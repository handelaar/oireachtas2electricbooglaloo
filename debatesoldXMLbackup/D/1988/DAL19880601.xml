      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 14, 7, 8 and 15.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight.  It is further proposed that No. 7 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on No. 6, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. It is further proposed that the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 14 shall be brought to a conclusion, if not previously concluded, at 12 midnight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Communications. Private Members' Business shall be No. 30.</P>

      <P>In relation to this item, which is a motion introducing a new aspect into the Sound Broadcasting Bill, may I ask the Taoiseach to allow the debate on this motion to continue for the day?  We have no objection at all to sitting <Col N="878" /> to 12 midnight but we regard the debate on the introduction of a Bill which allows for a new television service to be too restricted by being confined to up to 1.30 p.m.  While I am on my feet, in relation to item No. 14 agreement to which I realise, has not been reached, it is proposed in that respect to introduce a guillotine at 12 midnight on Committee Stage of the Bill.  Again, we feel that adequate time should be given to debating more than 100 substantial amendments to this Bill.  We do not regard the time allocated as adequate.</P>

    <Title>Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987: Instruction to Committee.</Title>
    <Col N="882" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Committee on the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, that it has the power to make provision in the Bill for the establishment of an Independent Radio and Television Commission having the function of entering into contracts for the provision of sound broadcasting services and a television programme service additional to services provided by Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>May I at the outset stress that this motion is purely of a procedural nature and is necessary so that this House, in Committee, has the power to make the two substantive changes proposed to the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987.  Those changes are: to provide for the establishment of a new independent regulatory commission which will select the franchises for the programme services envisaged under this legislation and to regulate those services, and to allow the commission in question to enter into a contract for the provision of a television programme service and to regulate that service.</P>
      <P>I believe that the resolve and determination of this Government to tackle the long-running sore of chaotic and unregulated broadcasting in this country has been greatly welcomed and appreciated. For ten years and more we have had the spectacle of illegal pirate radio stations creating chaos on the airwaves, bringing the law into disrepute and, indeed, at international level bringing the good name of this country in the radio regulatory sphere into disrepute.</P>
      <P>The fact that within a relatively short period of assuming office this Government were able to produce their legislative proposals in the broadcasting area is evidence of our commitment to deal with this matter once and for all.  We were able, with the co-operation of this House, to get our legislative proposals successfully through Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> I believe there was a generally positive reaction to my initial proposals when they were published in the sense that their thrust was seen to be sensible, pragmatic and workable.  They generated a healthy and constructive debate, both within this House and outside it, which I greatly welcomed and which has been of considerable assistance to me in determining how best to make further progress.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that the major area of concern about my initial proposals related to the absence of an independent authority to determine who should get the franchises for the services envisaged and to provide the degree of regulation which it was felt those services required. I made it very clear from the outset that the absence of such an authority was not based on any issue of principle or ideology. Indeed, in the first set of proposals published in this area by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1981 we had provided for such an authority.  However from the work and research done since then, the whole question of the financial viability of a worthwhile authority had been brought into question &mdash; apart altogether from the questionable need as to whether radio services actually needed the degree of regulation which would warrant the establishment of a separate State authority.</P>
    <P>It is primarily the introduction of the television element into the Bill that both strengthens the case for such an authority in terms of the degree of regulation that is warranted and in terms of securing the financial viability of such an authority.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me at this stage to go into the detail of the purpose and nature of the authority &mdash; or the commission as we are calling it &mdash; which we propose.  That will be the purpose of our Committee Stage debate.  However, I dare say I will not be accused of prejudging the view of this House by stating that the proposal to establish a commission will be generally welcomed.  The reason for the motion before us is that the proposal to establish a commission is a change of substance to the original Bill and, consequently, this House needs to <Col N="884" /> adopt a motion as proposed if it is to have the power to give effect to that proposal in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the motion before the House relates to the proposed introduction of the television dimension into the Bill and it would be useful to put this proposal into context.</P>
    <P>The whole objective of the legislation now before us is the creation of new opportunities and new choices in the broadcasting sphere.  We have had for over 60 years &mdash; in practice for the most of that period and theoretically in more recent times &mdash; a State monopoly situation in our broadcasting services.  Those services, which have been vested in RTE, have undoubtedly served us very well and we have every right to feel proud of them, but times and circumstances change.  The people &mdash; the public themselves &mdash; have shown, first, that they want choice and, secondly, that they want to be involved and that they are quite capable of being involved in providing broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>What then is the role of Government in responding to this situation?  As I see it, our primary objective must be to create the environment and afford the opportunities in which such involvement can take place and new choices created.  I believe there is a consensus in this House about our policy objectives so far as radio broadcasting is concerned and I am equally convinced that the logic of what we are doing in that area applies equally to the television area.  Indeed, in the context of the major developments in television broadcasting which are taking place all over Europe there are perhaps even more compelling reasons as to why we should seek to open new opportunities in television at national level.</P>
    <P>The trend in television broadcasting is moving very much in a supranational direction with the development of satellite broadcasting services and the major expansion in cable networks all over Europe.  The public of the various countries of Europe are going to be more and more exposed to external influences in television.  This is not something we should fear &mdash; indeed in many respects it <Col N="885" /> is to be welcomed.  It presents a great opportunity to improve European cohesion, to expose us to views, perspectives, horizons and aspects of European culture which otherwise would not be available to us.  It can help us to better appreciate the diversity of culture that make up the nations of Europe while, at the same time, help us to appreciate even more those elements of our own culture which give us our own unique identity. We for our part are playing our full role at Council of Europe and European Community level to ensure that a properly balanced international legal framework is established in which the developments I refer to can take place.</P>
    <P>This then is the context in which the Government are putting forward their proposals to have a third television channel. It is vitally important in this new international broadcasting environment that we strengthen our indigenous broadcasting voice and choice.  By establishing another channel in this country we can redress to some extent the imbalance between the number of external services which are and will increasingly continue to be available here and offer our public an extra measure of indigenously based choice.</P>
    <P>There are some who say that we are moving too quickly in this area, that we would need more public debate, commissions of inquiry, etc., into the question of establishing a third channel.  We are, of course, a great nation of talkers. We have been talking and wrestling with our consciences for over ten years about what to do in the radio sector and I wonder how much wiser we are at the end of that process?  Will the radio services which will now emerge be significantly different from those which would have emerged had we taken action earlier to deal with this area?  As I have said before, the only people to have gained from inaction are the illegal stations.</P>
    <P>The world will not stand still while we in Ireland sit back for a couple of years and debate the question of a third channel in this country.  By the end of 1989 the UK will have three new direct satellite broadcasting channels in operation and <Col N="886" /> they are talking also about establishing a fifth terrestrial channel.  Luxembourg will have its medium power satellite launched with up to 16 channels.  France and Germany, too, will have DBS services in operation.  I do not believe that the outcome of an extended debate here will be anything other than that we would be right to create the opportunity in which a third national channel could emerge. The danger of delaying, of course, is that some or all of the external services which I mentioned will have already found a niche with Irish viewers, making it more difficult to get a new national station off the ground.  The Government cannot actually make the third channel happen &mdash; this is entirely up to those in the community who believe that such a service can be established and can be successful. I believe it is our responsibility to afford that opportunity and to create a flexible framework within which it will work.</P>
    <P>As to the nature of the services to be established, I do not want to anticipate the debate we will have on the particular legislative provisions we are proposing beyond saying that they are of a general and flexible nature &mdash; indeed, in the main, they are similar to RTE's general mandate.  It is important that our approach should be flexible; we should not straitjacket the new service but must leave sufficient scope for the new service to be imaginative and inventive.  I believe, for instance, that possible concerns that a lowest-common-denominator type service will emerge are completely unwarranted.  That simply will not work because the reality is that there will be plenty of other stations, with probably considerably more resources than a third Irish channel will ever have, who will be better able to provide purely entertainment-orientated services.  If this new service is to carve out an identity and an audience niche for itself, it will have to be distinctive and inventive.  It will have to set out to capture the Irish audience from the plethora of choice it will have.</P>
    <P>RTE have already shown how this can be done, that is, by concentrating on home-produced material and on material <Col N="887" /> with which an Irish audience has a strong affinity and which will never be found on external services.  This in my view is the way that a third channel here will be successful.  Such a service of course will have subsidiary benefits.  For example it will be an important stimulus to the development of the audio-visual production sector in this country and will constitute an important new outlet particularly for the independent production sector.</P>
    <P>There have been some expressions of concern also as to whether a third channel in this country is a realistic proposition and suggestions that we should undertake feasibility studies into the prospects of establishing such a service.  To my mind that is to misunderstand the role of Government in this area.  I have already stressed that our role is to afford the opportunities for this development to happen and to create an environment in which greater choice and competition will emerge.  I accept entirely that it would be appropriate to carry out detailed feasibility studies if it was in question that the State was going to finance and provide this new channel.  That, of course, is not the case.  It will be up to those who wish to provide the service to undertake the feasibility studies.</P>
    <P>The situation, I might add, is exactly similar to the position adopted by the previous Government in deciding to offer a franchise for a direct broadcasting satellite service from this country.  There were no feasibility studies undertaken by the State into the economics of establishing such a service.  That was left to the applicants on foot of the invitation of tenders.  The commission proposed under this legislation will be doing likewise. They will offer the franchise by means of public advertisement and assess and award the franchise on the basis of the applications received.</P>
    <P>From the representations that have been made to me there is more than ample interest in establishing a third service. This being the case, and bearing in mind the reasons I have outlined for a third channel, we should provide the <Col N="888" /> opportunity to enable the service to become a reality.</P>
    <P>As to the effect of RTE, yes, of course it will put them into a competitive environment. I believe that will be a good thing.  Indeed I believe RTE will welcome the new challenge which will come as a timely fillip to them to achieve further excellence.  I sense a great new air of self-confidence and self-respect in RTE; what I might call the old paranoias which tended to come to the fore whenever the question of breaking their broadcast monopoly was raised are no longer there. The attitude now is: we are ready, willing and able to compete with the best that is thrown at us.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of RTE, this presents me with the opportunity to announce this morning that I have granted approval for a number of developments in their radio and television services.  The details are as follows: an extra two hours a day to enable the RTE 2 television service to commence transmission at 3 p.m. daily; an extra 1,092 hours per annum to enable the Radio na Gaeltachta service to broadcast continuously throughout the day; an extra hour a day for the premier radio service, Radio 1, to enable it to continue broadcasting until 1 a.m. every day; four extra hours a day on the special millennium radio service to enable it to provide improved coverage of millennium events and activities; and an extra 575 hours per annum and an adjustment of the hours of broadcasting of the FM3 radio service.</P>
    <P>The effect of that will be that Radio na Gaeltachta, on Mondays to Fridays &mdash; instead of their present practice of broadcasting from 8 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. &mdash; will be able to broadcast from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  On Saturdays they broadcast at present from 11 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. but in future they will be able to broadcast on Saturdays from 11 a.m. right through to 8 p.m.  At present they broadcast on Sundays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Under the new arrangement RTE, in getting this approval, will broadcast a service <Col N="889" /> throughout Sundays.  I have also approved a proposal from the RTE Authority to allow the Radio 1 service to carry advertising nightly during the 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. period.</P>
    <P>Of the developments just mentioned I would single out as being of particular importance the extension of the Radio na Gaeltachta service which will now be able to broadcast continuously from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on a week-day basis and from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. at weekends.  This service has carved out a very important niche in the cultural life of the country.  I know that the improved service which the station will be able to offer will be greatly welcomed not just by the people of the Gaeltachtaí but also by the strong and loyal listeners to that service throughout the country to whom the Irish language is of great importance.</P>
    <P>I will finish by reverting to the substance of the motion before the House and reiterate that it is primarily a procedural requirement to empower the House, in Committee, to deal with the matters coming before it in the Bill.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's considerable movement demonstrated since he introduced the Second Stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill. The proposals now before us are so radical as to render the original Bill almost indistinguishable from the new proposals. I can understand the feeling that this debate should be somewhat longer, the legislative proposals being in such confusion procedurally at least in regard to so many sections and amendments.</P>
      <P>I should like to devote central attention this morning to the new departure into the television sphere and also to the issue of the radio network we want to see develop.  These are the central issues of concern from the point of view of the public.  It is out of the network we wish to see develop that the types of amendments we have tabled for the remainder of the day evolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's change in the radio sphere &mdash; to have these exploratory hearings before a decision is taken on what <Col N="890" /> stations to license &mdash; is welcome.  I have argued strongly in this House that the Minister is imposing an excessive straitjacket on the development of radio here by insisting on the 24 county stations.  I anticipate that what we will see evolve from that proposal are stations in each county that will be virtually carbon copies of one another.  They will be obliged, by the limited advertising revenue available within each county boundary, to pitch at a very middle-of-the-road audience. They will not have sufficient potential listenership to support specialised broadcasting. With that straitjacket of county stations having exclusive control within their counties, I anticipate that commercially such stations will not get off the ground in many counties.  From the point of view of the listener, I anticipate that we will end up with 24 stations differing from one another only in the colours they carry on championship day.  It would be a pity to see that happen.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's decision to give the commission power to conduct exploratory probes of the nature of the service demanded, I think he is going to completely sink the possibilities offered by that procedure if he insists on continuing with the straitjacket of 24 county stations.  We really want to see a commission that has the discretion to look at the best shape of broadcasting to serve broader regions than the county.  I would envisage regions of up to one million people, within which there could be a number of stations, some dedicated to specialised interests such as jazz, current affairs or classical music and which would not necessarily have to comply with the 20 per cent news requirement.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is going some distance towards a more flexible scenario for the development of radio by putting derogations on the news quota and so on, I think by insisting on 24 county monopolies he may sink the intent of his proposals. I ask the Minister to reconsider whether it would not be more preferable to have broad regions?  At that stage whether we have a national station would really be an open question.  I am not sure <Col N="891" /> that a national station would really have a niche if we had a proper regional network of stations.  As I said on Second Stage, I fear the effect of the national station will be a bit like the pine forest where the tallest tree kills all the growth underneath.  This is a danger.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the type of network envisaged so that we can give the commission the discretion to be flexible and produce diversity.  The Minister has expressed this wish in his statement but I think he is running the danger of puncturing it by his operational proposals.</P>
    <P>The major new proposal today is to license independent television.  We must go back and consider what effect this will have on existing broadcasting.  It is important to be aware of the fact that broadcasting is not a market in the normal sense, as the viewer cannot choose what he wants to watch.  He cannot express his preferences in the way he can in a normal market.  He cannot express the strength of his interest in a particular type of programming.  He can only decide to switch on or to switch off.</P>
    <P>Advertising decisions really dictate the shape of the market.  In commercial television the operators are selling audiences to the advertisers.  This puts an onus on the Dáil when proposing to develop independent television that we must realise there will always be a necessity for Government regulation and intervention. The truth of the matter is that advertising financed television will not produce what the consumer wants, let alone meet the type of programming that will always need public patronage, because of the low audience relative to its cost.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for State involvement.  In shaping our legislation we have to push to the fore the need of the commission to sustain quality in broadcasting.  We must ensure that stations that make a commitment initially to provide quality broadcasting can be brought to task if they do not live up to their commitments.  We will be seeking amendments to ensure that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> In Britain, as we know, the Independent Broadcasting Authority have operated very strong regulations on their stations.  The reason they have been able to do that so effectively is that there is a monopoly on the television advertising market in the UK for the IBA franchise holders.  That is not the case in Ireland. We differ not only by having RTE and other stations involved in the Irish advertising market for broadcasting but also the national station, RTE, is not 100 per cent funded by the licence fees as is the case in the UK.  We have to recognise the potential danger to the quality of broadcasting in Ireland is greater than in the UK.  We will not be able to exercise the same degree of regulation over the station because it is in a more competitive market and RTE have also to collect advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised there is a danger that in a fierce ratings war quality programmes, such as &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; etc. are expensive to produce.  It costs up to 50 times more to screen an hour of &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; than one hour of &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;.  I think in a competitive ratings war those sort of programmes will be under pressure. We cannot ignore that fact.  A programme such as &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; cannot secure 50 times the audience for its station to match its 50 times higher cost than &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;.  In framing this legislation, we must recognise that there will be such pressure on the quality of broadcasting as a result of the emergence of independent television.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a tragedy if, in time, we found that RTE became a sort of Arts Council ghetto where we had just public patronage programming, very worthy programming but not capable of commanding high audiences figures.  It will always be necessary that public service broadcasting secures a good balance in its programming.  There should be a lot of entertainment capable of informing people and developing their taste and programmes while maintaining their audience.  It is important that whatever we do in legislation we ensure that RTE are capable of doing what they have done so successfully to date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> I fully accept the Minister's point on the inevitability of commercial broadcasting. We have seen that technology is bringing stations into Ireland.  The vast majority of new stations, satellite and terrestrial that are proposed throughout Europe are commercial.  If we turn our backs on the idea of developing commercial television all we will be doing is denying the possibility for an Irish-based commercial interest to develop a television channel.  Ireland cannot insulate itself from commercial channels.</P>
    <P>While admittedly the penetration of these channels may be low, I think there is no doubt that these European commercial channels will build up quality and penetrate the market precisely because they have the might to command programming of high quality.  The Football Association in Britain have now a proposed contract to tie up exclusively the showing of soccer matches on the satellite stations.  If commercial European stations can command that sort of programming, there is no way we can block the pressure on RTE and the emergence of a considerable share for commercial broadcasting in Ireland.  We have to walk the difficult tightrope between having excessive regulation for the new fledgling commercial stations and, on the other hand, damaging RTE.</P>
    <P>We must realise also that the commercial operations will be facing into quite a difficult market.  At present the advertising market in Ireland is relatively small, approximately half the size proportionately to other countries such as the UK and European countries.  The market is worth £90 million if you exclude the local newspapers.  The broadcasting world already has a very high share of that, an unusually high share by international standards.  There is no doubt that the new station will be entering into a tough competitive world of advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>We have to avoid overloading the station with programme duties while, at the same time, ensuring that we continue to have quality broadcasting that, thankfully, has characterised broadcasting throughout these islands.  We are <Col N="894" /> uniquely well served by RTE and the 60 per cent who have access to the UK channels are well served by these good channels which stand well above what is available throughout the rest of Europe. We have to ensure that the development of this new commercial channel will allow that quality to continue.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful today to make sure that we evolve television that is genuinely new, that complements what we already have in RTE, something that does not produce the lowest common denominator.  This is a danger, unless we properly oversee progress.  We should have regulations that will spur the station on to achieve a high quality but that do not sink the station.  We have to achieve a very delicate balance.  To a large extent that will be the job of the commission rather than of the legislative framework we draw up, because not only so much can be done through legislation.  For that reason there should be a clear brief to the commission.  The choice of very high calibre people for the commission will be absolutely crucial to the development of broadcasting.  We can have no doubt that the task of sustaining quality and producing greater diversity in programming will be difficult for any commission.  I hope the Minister in selecting people will recognise the difficult task to be done and will pick people with the calibre to do it.</P>
    <P>To secure a television station characterised by quality, diversity and excellence it is important that the Minister does not stick to the idea of a single national channel.  Local channels serving communities will be much more complementary to what RTE are putting out as the national station.  It is desirable that the new television channel should have a local niche, offering the possibility of greater community involvement in television. This approach is supported by the technology.  At the moment we have no national transmission network for the proposed channel but we have well developed cable networks for distributing channels in certain areas.  In broadcasting, people would like to see the development of television channels that would have a local flavour and which <Col N="895" /> would serve identified cabled areas.  The commission should be willing to entertain any application that is acceptable in quality and is commercially sustainable.  For the moment it looks as if that will be just in Dublin and Cork but in time there is the possibility that other areas will want to have a company providing programming with a considerable degree of local flavour.  To make this commercially viable, there will have to be a substantial amount of networked programmes common to them all.</P>
    <P>In the UK there are some very small franchised companies serving identifiable communities with television.  They take networked programmes and also have local programmes.  Some of the areas serviced by such companies are as small as the Channel Islands for example, where there is a company which operates on a £2 million advertising take in the year. That is within the reach of relatively small communities in Ireland and we should go in that direction as it would be more complementary to what RTE are already putting out and it would meet the sort of diversity and quality the public want.</P>
    <P>It is important to have a high content of home programming in the station.  RTE have shown the way in this area.  About half of their programming is now home-produced, and since they moved in this area they have been building up their share of viewers and have been becoming more financially viable.  Far from depressing RTE, this move has accompanied their greater success in listenership and in meeting their financial targets.  This should also be achieved by the independent stations perhaps over a period of five years.  Much of the programmes should come from independent producers so that we can open up more opportunities for Irish talent.  That approach to television will not only produce what Irish viewers want, and they have shown that they want home-produced material, but it will also mean that there will be genuine economic opportunity for many people of talent <Col N="896" /> emerging with the development of television, and it will be reasonably spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There must also be fair competition between RTE and the new station.  No station should own the system of distribution of the alternatives.  It makes no sense in competition terms that RTE should own Cablelink.  Cablelink will be the carrier for an alternative station in Dublin.  It is the carrier for diversity coming into Dublin.  It would be unreasonable to expect RTE to want to seek emerging competition.  The Restrictive Practices Commission have already alerted us to the danger of RTE's control of this company and they will return to this issue in 1989 to have another look because of their fears.  The Restrictive Practices Commission should not have to return again and again to consider whether RTE are using their position to interfere with competition.</P>
    <P>We should tell RTE to dispose of their interest in Cablelink over a period of four to five years.  They would be able to do that profitably.  We know they are crying out for investment so as to meet the competition and that they have been restricted in their right to invest.  If they dispose of that company they will have the capital resources needed to invest. On the other hand, RTE must be freed from the constraints the Minister has imposed heretofore, of requiring permission in relation to their broadcasting hours.  Today the Minister announced a relaxation of broadcasting hours.  It is ironic that the Minister is announcing this at the same time as we are bringing in stations that will be free to choose their own broadcasting hours.  As the Chairman of the RTE Authority said, there must be a level pitch on which RTE can compete.  That means giving them the right to determine their own broadcasting hours, their own investment plans and the right to decide who collects the licence fee.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of measures which can give RTE a reasonable crack of the whip in what will be a competitive market.  Because of the way broadcasting will develop they must have these rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> Equally I think fair competition will require that there is no excessive interlocking of ownership between different stations, or between the broadcast media and the news media.  Not alone is fair competition important for competition reasons but also in the public interest.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point about the kind of regulations that must be made which will give a real spur to these stations to serve the public and provide quality. The way to achieving the right balance between giving them a reasonable opportunity to do commercial planning and obliging them to meet the promises they make when they make their applications is to have, say, a seven year contract within which there would be scope for an annual review.  To use a footballing term, these annual reviews should show a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; to a station which deviates from what it promised to do in the way of programming and ultimately a &ldquo;red card&rdquo;.  If a station deviates from what it said it would do the commission could first warn them and if they failed to heed the warning they could announce the following year that they were going to readvertise the contract and then readvertise it the year after that. Obviously the station would be free to apply again for the contract but this would put continuous pressure on a station to comply with the regulations.  If a station is allowed to operate for seven years and is not obliged to say whether it is achieving the required quality, a station which started out with the highest intentions could eventually be tacking and changing and not producing what was intended.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that new television stations should not have the freedom to express editorial views.  RTE have had a high reputation for their objectivity in dealing with issues.  This is because they have not expressed editorial lines and taken sides in controversial issues of the day.  It would be a sad day if commercial networks could take sides on issues of the day or take political sides, when the background is that it is a rationed medium and not like the printed <Col N="898" /> press where anyone can get in and compete. There will be, I hope, a number of stations but the Minister is proposing just one station.  In any event it will be a restricted medium, and if one operator has control of a franchise and has the freedom to express an editorial line, alternative views will not have the same opportunity to be heard.  This commercial station must operate under the same constraints as RTE are under to refrain from expressing editorial views.  That does not, as it has not in the case of RTE, make for boring broadcasting.  We have had the highest quality of interesting broadcasting from RTE without their breaching that rule and I think that rule should equally apply to the new station.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues Members are concerned about will be debated at length later in the day and we have before us a number of very worthy amendments that will improve the Bill.  I hope the Minister has the same open mind now as he had at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate on the original radio Bill and that he will entertain constructive changes in the legislation.  We have to realise that what we are doing here will set the tone for many years to come.  The Minister rightly said that we cannot ignore developments in technology and put excessive constraints on the station but at the same time I believe we must give the commission a clear brief so that they will have the ability to carry out that brief and have the potential to produce the sort of quality and diversity in broadcasting which I believe we all want to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should like to make in relation to the motion is the effect it is going to have on the title of the Bill, which is the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987.  I think it could be said that that title is a misnomer because there is now a proposal before us to include an independent commercial television service within the scope of the Bill, and if the Bill is enacted it could give rise to some confusion if the title of the Bill persists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment <Col N="899" /> down to change that title.  It will be known as the Radio and Television Bill, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that because the title of the Bill before us is the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987. The original Sound Broadcasting Bill is being substantially amended by the inclusion of the proposal for a commercial television station.  That proposal and the other amendments the Minister has brought in are very welcome but they have changed the whole character of the Bill, altered its scope and broadened it considerably.  I think there are 78 amendments in the Minister's name and we will be debating these on Committee Stage later on today and tonight.  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate all of these amendments because there is a guillotine motion on them which arose on the Order of Business this morning.  I understand that there is agreement on the way the sections will be taken but it is important that a major legislative proposal like this should be allowed sufficient time for full debate in this House.  The fact that it is being guillotined is not in the best interests of a major issue like this.  It has been awaited for a long time and it deserves very full and adequate debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the proposed independent television station is being tagged on to the Sound Broadcasting Bill and to some extent this is indicative of the way the Government have approached the issue of broadcasting.  Apparently they are willing to allow it to develop in a haphazard way but I should like to see it developing in a much more planned and controlled way.  One of the objectives of the Bill to which the Minister referred, is to legalise independent broadcasting services and put the pirates out of business. Of course that is very desirable but there is legislation already on the Statute Book to deal with that situation.  It has never been used effectively but it could have been so used.  I do not think that aspect of the Bill is the main driving force of what is before us now.  The main objective and thrust of the Bill should be to <Col N="900" /> ensure the orderly development of broadcasting services in Ireland, both sound broadcasting and television broadcasting, and to ensure that this is done in a much more planned way.  We should be able to go into this in greater detail than we are being allowed to do because of the way the Bill has been introduced in the House.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned that we are undergoing major technological changes and in the light of that it is only right that the fullest consideration should be given to the way broadcasting services will evolve.  We do not want to commit ourselves now to making irrevocable decisions which could affect the way broadcasting will develop in the years to come.  For example, the Government in the UK have commissioned major reports in this area and the public have had an input into these.  We are tagging on to a radio Bill a proposal to introduce a new television channel and while I welcome the development of broadcasting services, the increase in choices for the listening and viewing public and the increased competition in this area, I still think it would be better if we could have had a longer period to consider the television aspect particularly.  The Minister mentioned earlier that we in this country are great at talking but not at getting on with things.  Because of technological changes and the way things are developing we could be making fundamental decisions at this point which two or three years hence, with the benefit of hindsight might seem to have been mistakes.</P>
    <P>Many people suggest that we have too much television already or too much television of the same type, now that we have satellite services available to us.  In Dublin, for example, Cablelink will not transmit the French language and Italian language programmes that are available on the Cork system, and these would greatly enhance proficiency in continental languages which is obviously desirable.  They are transmitting other satellite programmes and also the UK services and many of these programmes <Col N="901" /> are similar in content as far as the entertainment aspects of the service they provide are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves should there be more of an emphasis on developing localised television services for, say, the Cork and Dublin areas with sustaining services coming in from either RTE or the other stations.  Again Deputy Bruton referred to this and it is important.  Perhaps we should have that kind of a system in preference to the proposed single national channel which is going to compete directly with RTE 1 and 2, both of the ITN stations, the BBC stations and the satellite services we are receiving.  If we had an opportunity to have public discussion on how we want to see the television services developing rather than rushing headlong and going for the option of a single television channel, it might have served us better in the long run.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the position in which RTE find themselves in relation to this proposal.  RTE have provided a very satisfactory service to the Irish public in their public service broadcasting down through the years.  They are undoubtedly burdened with additional costs that the commercial stations, both television and radio monopoly, do not have to carry.  Because of the public service element of their programming they have to involve themselves in what would be considered to be not necessarily commercially viable programming.  I know they are in receipt of a licence fee which is a privilege that the other commercial stations do not have but, at the same time, it is very important that they are allowed to compete on as equal a basis as possible with both the new radio and television stations.  The Minister announced some relaxation in broadcasting hours and the amount of time they could allow for advertising but it would be right and proper for RTE to be given authority to decide on these matters themselves because they are now going to come under very strong competition both from radio operators and the new single television channel.</P>
    <P>In regard to that single commercial independent television channel, I wonder <Col N="902" /> where is the evidence that it will be commercially viable.  I certainly hope that it will be and I accept that there is a commercial risk there, but the Dublin and Cork local stations I referred to earlier possibly would be much more commercially viable and would serve the interests of the public better in that they would complement the services provided by the existing national stations and the other stations that we are receiving.</P>
    <P>I also have to ask do we need the proposed MMDS to carry the new television service.  In the Estimates debate on the Department of Communications last week I raised this at some length with the Minister.  We know there are strong objections to the introduction of this system on grounds that need to be clarified. I have asked before that the Minister would clarify them and I am still awaiting a response from him.  There is the whole question of this system's technical suitability for transmitting services in certain parts of the country where the geographical terrain is not suitable for it. There is also the question of the existing illegal operators who are operating a rebeaming system in the UHF spectrum and why the Department cannot legalise that operation.  At present they are illegal by virtue of the fact that they do not have a licence.</P>
    <P>The Department's view is that in the interests of regulating the frequency spectrum and because of the fact that they are reserving the UHF spectrum for RTE they cannot allow these rebeaming operators to operate in that spectrum even though there is a lot of spare capacity there at the moment.  This whole area of the UHF spectrum operation is something that the proposed commission in this Bill should look at closely so that it is not as a sacrosanct immovable situation that exists at the moment in relation to these operators.  If we can transmit services by rebeaming them, it would be much more beneficial to do that rather than going to the trouble and expense of introducing the MMDS which, technically, could be defective. There is also the whole question of whether there are any health hazards <Col N="903" /> associated with it.  There is a body of opinion building up among eminent people who consider that it has a lot of serious health implications.  I asked the Minister last week in the Estimates debate to respond to that.</P>
    <P>We also must ask ourselves what are the implications for us of ongoing developments in direct broadcasting by satellite.  Is it appropriate that we should be putting in another terrestrial system here because it could become redundant in a few years because of the way developments in the satellite services are progressing.  These are the kind of questions we should be asking ourselves in relation to the way broadcasting services should develop.</P>
    <P>There are other relevant matters, some of which Deputy Bruton referred to, like the cable area and in particular RTE's control of Cablelink which is carrying services in competition with RTE.  We have to ask whether there is conflict of interests there.  I agree that RTE should sell off their interests in Cablelink and that the cable relay service should not just be regarded as a relay service for television.  It can also compete in its own right in terms of purchasing programming material and in terms of involving itself in advertising.  At present it is restricted from doing that.  It is a unique situation whereby a State broadcasting service is controlling the media whereby its programmes are transmitted together with those of its competitors.</P>
    <P>There are a whole range of questions, particularly in relation to the development of television service, which should be properly examined and evaluated, and I do not think that just adding on the television proposal to a Bill that started out dealing exclusively with sound broadcasting services is the right way to go about it.</P>
    <P>The other main change to the Sound Broadcasting Bill which is proposed by the Minister in the amendments he has put down relates to the establishment of an independent radio and television commission having the functions of entering into contracts for independent <Col N="904" /> sound broadcasting services and the new television programme service.  This is to be welcomed as it totally changes the system that applied under the original Bill where there was an advisory committee with very limited powers and functions and the Minister, effectively, had control over who got a licence to operate a radio station, and now that will apply to the television station as well.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, in a recent press interview after he had circulated his amendments, when asked what the new television station would be called said he had not decided but that it would not be called channel Fianna Fáil, despite what the Progressive Democrats might say.  It is obvious that the criticism we made at the time about the lack of an independent licensing authority for radio stations struck home.  I acknowledge the changes the Minister has made in that and I welcome these changes.  Clearly it is not correct that there should be political influence in this whole matter.  I do not think the Bill would have got through the Dáil, and certainly there would have been huge public opposition to it, if the advisory committee had been left in as proposed in the original Bill.  The Minister has accepted that and that it is in the public interest.  It is important to ensure that no Government can influence or interfere with news or current affairs programmes through political patronage.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Independent Radio and Television Commission through whom the Minister will grant licences to enable contractors to operate broadcasting services is a big step in the right direction for the reasons I have already mentioned.  One occasionally reads reports in the press in relation to RTE and recently one of the Minister's colleagues in Government was reported to have called to RTE to seek an explanation as to why a function at which he officiated was not covered by the station. The same Minister is said on another occasion to have brought pressure to bear on the journalists in the RTE newsroom to cover a sod turning ceremony which was taking place in his own constituency. I am making the point that these are the <Col N="905" /> kind of things that must be avoided and that is all the more reason we need an independent body between the Government, politicians generally and broadcasting services.  Therefore, the major change which is being made to this Bill is to be welcomed greatly.</P>
    <P>The function which the commission have of inviting expressions of interest in securing a sound broadcasting contract is useful because it will enable the commission to make decisions arising out of the discussions they have on the nature and type of service it is intended to provide in any given area.  This will enable them to build up a picture of the diversity of services on offer in that area and it will assist the commission in making recommendations to the Minister on what type of service should be facilitated in that area.  This gets over the problem which existed in the original Bill where anyone and everyone could make an application for a licence.  Under this system, at least, there will be a greater degree of control on how sound broadcasting services should develop.</P>
    <P>I note also that the commission are to have regard to several factors determining the suitability of applicants to be awarded a sound broadcasting contract. It is particularly important that the nonprofit making community radio area should be positively encouraged.  There are amendments down dealing with this matter which we will have an opportunity to discuss this afternoon.  There are several other amendments down to the Minister's amendments which will further improve the Bill.  It is not right that any one person or group should have a monopoly on broadcasting services or the media generally.  I know there are some provisions in the Bill dealing with that but one of the points I would like to highlight is that full disclosure should be made of the actual shareholding in that company.  Wherever there is a nominee shareholding it is important that the beneficial owners of the shares should be disclosed.</P>
    <P>There is another good development in the Bill where this whole area will be open to public scrutiny.  It will allow <Col N="906" /> interested parties to vet and to get the full information as to who these applicants are.  That process will enable people in the community to have an input as a result of having examined a register which will be available publicly and they can make their views known to the commission. All of that is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the main changes which the Minister has brought in with the exception of the reservations I expressed earlier about the suitability of dealing in a rushed way with the introduction of the single national television channel by adding it, almost as an afterthought, to the Sound Broadcasting Bill.  The whole question of extending television services, which I support in principle, requires much more detailed examination.  I know we have a long day, afternoon and night before us on amendments.  I look forward to a constructive and lively debate as the day progresses.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his opening remarks made what I would consider to be the greatest understatement in the history of this House when he said that this motion is purely of a procedural nature.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are having what is supposed to be a Committee Stage debate but what is, in effect, a Second Stage debate on the introduction of commercial television. The Minister should have withdrawn the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, and introduced a new Bill.  This would have enabled everybody to contribute to the discussion in a constructive way. What has now been handed to us is far from satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to mention I welcome the debate and I hope that at last the Minister will take on the illegal pirate radio operators. I welcome the change of heart by the Minister in agreeing to the independent broadcasting authority.  We will be looking for some changes by way of amendment and I hope we will get to that before the day is over.  It will be a particularly long day for a communications discussion and I hope some <Col N="907" /> of the amendments that will be put forward by Opposition spokespersons will be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>While it is right of the Government of the day to bring forward legislation on any matter they consider necessary in the public interest, and while I accept the Government are free to consult whatever parties they so choose inside the House before they bring forward such legislation, there has been a tradition that in matters of public interest and where sensitive matters are dealt with, the Government first produce a statement on their proposals regarding proposed legislation in the form of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the RTE national television service, there was a comprehensive debate in this House and Seanad Éireann on the basis of a report commissioned by the Government on the feasibility of establishing a national television service.  The merit of such an approach is that the issue of public accountability, the range of programming and, indeed, the financial cost to the Exchequer or the community can be examined.  Issues such as what statutory controls should be placed on broadcasting and the freedom of broadcasters to provide the public with an independent information service and, indeed, what kind of entertainment services should be provided can be dealt with in broad outline and alternative approaches indicated.</P>
    <P>The difficulty the Labour Party have with the introduction of a new television service by way of Committee Stage amendment is that the preliminary debate should have taken place around concrete proposals setting out the Government's intentions in relation to the future of broadcasting services and which took account of international developments in satellite broadcasting. These are not available to us when we come to discuss what exactly an alternative television service to RTE can and should provide.  What I find particularly distressing is that the prediction which the Labour Party made when we <Col N="908" /> announced our proposals for broadcasting in 1984 is becoming true in the worst possible way.  We said then and I quote:</P>
    <P>We propose that prior to publication of a Government Bill that a working party on community local radio be established to examine all aspects of local community radio and that the entry of private commercial interests to local broadcasting within the State would create a precedent for a similar approach to television broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We went on to state that such development in a country with a population of 3.5 million people was not compatible with the survival of public service broadcasting which served the whole community without sectional or special interest.  A two year study of the development of alternative community radio stations to those of RTE led us to conclude that it was possible to develop another tier of broadcasting in the form of community controlled radio stations.  We knew that the demand for local broadcasting existed in many areas where pilot RTE local radio experiments had been conducted successfully.  We also learned that there was active pirate activity on the airwaves.</P>
    <P>Where is the evidence that there is a public demand for an alternative commercial television service in this country? Due to our proximity to the United Kingdom we have already a range of alternative television services which can be received, unfortunately, only in the eastern part of the country.  I say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; because the Labour Party have never subscribed to the view that a section of the Irish people should be denied access to the British broadcasting media by either direct controls or artificial barriers introduced by an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>A fair question to pose is, in whose interest are these proposals being brought forward?  It is not simply RTE who provide an excellent national TV service on two channels given the resources available to them; it is not the various cultural groups who have voiced <Col N="909" /> their concern that programmes will not give Irish culture sufficient prominence. What has to be asked here is whether any group of private individuals should be allowed to control what has been acknowledged as the most powerful medium in modern society.</P>
    <P>Take the example of the independent broadcasting authority who license franchisees in the UK to provide TV services. You will find that the regulation of the content, the financial structure and the responsibilities of the independent broadcasting authority was made particularly strong in order to counterbalance the possible dangers of private abuse. Indeed, the financial regime that has been introduced provided for considerable statutory payments by the franchisees to the independent broadcasting authority to enable them to carry out their function of ensuring that programming and broadcasting standards were on a par with the BBC and that the overall broadcasting environment would not be dragged down under the pressures of securing the maximum amount of advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister and Government supporters and those of the Fine Gael and PD Parties who support the concept of private ownership of broadcasting media can point to the almost exclusive ownership by private individuals of the print media.  I do not think it is a particularly good example on which to base our approach to either sound or TV broadcasting.  We have seen in the UK and the US the growth of concentration on ownership of the print medium and latterly in the US of TV. Given that satellite broadcasting will accelerate its services in the next 20 years, it is totally native to believe that the national interest of this country, or indeed the collective interest of member states of the EC, can be protected by having what the Minister described as a light touch form of regulation broadcast. This form of regulation will lead to less regard to the priorities which various nationalities want to see reflected in TV broadcasting.  The reason is quite obvious. Satellite broadcasting is being <Col N="910" /> financed by advertising revenue.  It does not have the resources in private hands to produce high quality international programmes and is driven to rely on a diet mainly of sport and out-of-date films in order to generate advertising revenue sufficient just to break even.  These unregulated services which can be categorised as commercial television are advancing the American concept of freedom and the provision of information through broadcasting.  I suggest this form of broadcasting has not provided the American public with the kind of quality television programming we in Ireland associate with RTE and the BBC.  In terms of information and entertainment as it is recognised internationally by citizens throughout the world, including the US, that high quality public service broadcasting is the best form of TV.  The recent Eurovision song contest proved that RTE can compete with the best in the world.</P>
    <P>No provisions are contained in the Minister's amendments to indicate that the high standard laid down in the legislation establishing RTE will apply in the case of private commercial television in Ireland.  I am afraid the reasons do not reflect well on the Government or the main Opposition party.  If there is a wish to increase both quantity and quality of independent programmes made in this country there is no reason that we cannot adopt a power structure in public service broadcasting to include such diversity, to allow for separate broadcasting organisations to develop and apportion some of the licence fee and, if necessary, some of the advertising revenue which accrues to RTE to achieve this.  We do not need to give a free hand to private commercial TV in order to provide additional programme choices.</P>
    <P>We are going ahead with this legislation largely in the dark in regard to its effect on RTE and the long-term impact on the power of any Government or this House to regulate what goes on over the airwaves.  There are those who would form the view that there should be little regulation of the airwaves, but in practice I suggest there will be domination by <Col N="911" /> financial and advertising interests of a significant proportion of the output of commercial television.  When RTE were established, because the cost to the Exchequer of providing the service was seen as beyond the capacity of the Government at the time, it was conceded that a funding system would have to allow for both advertising and licence fee so that TV would not require a subsidy. There appears to be no consideration in the Minister's approach to the ultimate Exchequer costs which may arise if RTE's services were to be maintained while they suffered substantial loss of advertising revenue to their commercially licensed competitor.  In this respect the Minister has been less than honest.  We know the effect in practice has to mean curtailment in RTE services which are not provided on a purely self-financing basis, in other words, services to the Irish language, the national orchestras and a wide range of minority tastes that are recognised in the programming of our national TV service.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a statement by Mr. Colm Kenny, lecturer in broadcasting in the NIHE who initially welcomed the Minister's proposal for sound broadcasting as an honest attempt to put order on what had previously been a legislative mess.  In a statement issued on 24 February 1988 he called for the appointment of a non-political commission of inquiry into the future of broadcasting in Ireland who would report within a specific time to a special committee of this House and make their report available to the public so that the recommendations could be made and the Government could act upon them.  The issues he wanted such a broadcasting commission to examine were:</P>
    <P> (a)  The potential market and desirable content of local radio.</P>
    <P>(b)  The ways in which community radio could be actively fostered.</P>
    <P>(c)  The financial and technical feasibility of an MMDS national television service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> (d)  The implications of international Direct Broadcasting by Satellite for Ireland.</P>
    <P>(e)  The future of Irish DBS and the uses to which Atlantic Satellites have put their franchise in this area.</P>
    <P>(f)  The copyright and fee implications of MMDS for existing cable operators.</P>
    <P>(g)  The continuing control by RTE of Dublin Cablelink.</P>
    <P>(h)  The effect of broadcasting developments on the national and provincial press.</P>
    <P>(i)  The future of RTE and its services in the light of potential financial losses arising from new national radio and TV stations.</P>
    <P>(j)  The question of control of Irish media interests by organisations or persons normally resident outside of the State.</P>
    <P>(k)  Any other factors which the Commission believes to be relevant. </P>
    <P>No reasonable person could argue with this approach being taken prior to a major new legislative measure with regard to the development of TV services. I will not pretend that I grasp fully the implications of the revolution in the media services if satellite broadcasting were introduced.  I know, however, that the UK Government, who are strongly in favour of removing regulations by Parliament on broadcasting, threw their weight against any moves by European countries to impose local and in this case national control on international satellite franchise holders.  The Council of Europe discussed the possible erosion of national programmes and services being supplied by satellite broadcasters and sought to have a minimum of 10 per cent of programmes include national material.</P>
    <P>We are living in a time prior to the implementation of the Single European Act when international combines within and outside the EC will be seeking to consolidate their position in the context of a market of 300 million people.  I see in <Col N="913" /> the Minister's approach no real statutory control mechanisms which would prevent the ultimate takeover of the Irish private television service either in part or in whole by private international interests. It is no use for the Minister to give a personal assurance &mdash; as I am sure he will.  We know from experience that legislation which has weak regulatory teeth is inclined to be ignored and the maximum interpretation is taken by those who stand to gain most from this type of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;. The Labour Party were pilloried in the print medium and accused of having a fetish about State ownership of the broadcasting medium when we opposed the proposals by the previous Government &mdash; of which I recognise we were part &mdash; to private broadcasting services.  If the Minister was prepared to recognise that the opening up of the broadcasting medium required more, not less, regulation that applies in the case of RTE, we might have taken a different approach. Let me make quite clear that the Labour Party see State ownership as a means of protecting the public interest and not of hindering the expression of ideas which either we or anybody else disagree with. This is not at all at variance with recognising the legitimate demands of communities or, indeed, film and programme makers that they should have access to the medium of television in this country. We have supported in the past and we would support any move to increase such access provided that any competition in the provision of service is based on quality and not on the pursuit of advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>It is naive if not foolish to believe that RTE will not be affected by the introduction of commercial television in Ireland.  It will and the major casualty will be quality programming for it does not take much imagination to see that RTE will be forced to compete on the lowest common denominator if that is what the commercial environment dictates for its survival. This represents a cynicism about Irish culture and indeed the provision of information on current affairs which will <Col N="914" /> not serve the future generations that remain in this country.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing this section which intends to introduce a commercial television service, though we have put forward a number of amendments which could at least keep the option open, that a public service structure of broadcasting would remain if the Government were prepared to rethink their position. Specifically we have proposed that a majority of share capital should be held by the State in one form or another so that there will be a direct means for ensuring that the services which an independent television company would provide had to reflect the wishes of the Oireachtas and are not allowed to use the many clauses in the legislation whereby the Minister or the commission vary the terms of a licence apparently for any reason whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The Minister and those parties who support private commercial television believe this is another example of the Labour Party running up an ideological flag simply for the sake of ideology.  I ask them to reflect on the experience of the Independent Broadcasting Authority in Britain in relation to the Breakfast a.m. television service.  Recently it has been discovered that the real financial backers of this service are not the shareholders who publicly backed the project.  In fact, considerable money from a Middle East country was made available on a covert basis.  Even if no considerations other than commercial ones were involved, it is not necessary to spell out the implications if such a development were to take place in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must consider who will be the likely candidates to become partners as financial backers for a commercial television service in Ireland.  There have already been discreet inquiries, as far as I am aware, by UK interests and there may be others.  In this legislation we are opening a Pandora's Box but there will be no positive benefits to the community in terms of additional quality programmes or alternative choices which cannot be provided by RTE or are not already being provided by the BBC or the IBA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> It is alarming that the Government should vest themselves in a clock of seeming liberalism whose inspiration has come from the most illiberal Government in post-war Britain, that of Mrs. Thatcher. There has been a virtual onslaught on the independence of the BBC and latterly on the IBA because of their refusal to adapt news and current affairs programming to take account of Government objections. The Director General of the BBC was dismissed because he insisted on showing programmes which the British Government found offensive.  The British Government support commercialisation of television in order to geld what has become a powerful independent institution, the BBC and their competition, the IBA.  It does not advance the cause of freedom one iota that broadcasting should be involved in self-censorship in order to accommodate the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The idea that market forces be allowed full rein is nothing but a thinly disguised attack designed to put television services on the defensive and answerable to the advertising paymaster.  I ask the Minister, even at this stage, not to proceed with this section of the Bill and to establish an independent commission which would examine the future of broadcasting services at least in so far as television is concerned.  I sincerely hope that, even at this stage, the Minister will give consideration to setting up an independent commission.  He recently referred to &ldquo;talking shops&rdquo; and I know there is a tendency to go on discussing these matters.  Nonetheless, it is of such importance that further consideration should be given to this measure before it is introduced in the way now proposed.</P>

      <P>It is important to stress that the Minister had no hang ups about this matter apart from the fact that he was concerned about the cost in terms of running such a commission and the drain that would be put on the resources of the State.  The provision in the Bill for an independent television programme service and its regulation ensures the viability of the commission in terms of it not being a so-called drain on State finances.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister's determination in tackling the running sore of chaotic, unregulated broadcasting over the past ten years.  The law has been held up to ridicule because of inactivity, malaise and disagreement between Government parties which allowed those who flouted the law to flourish.  Disrespect for the law of the land has had a detrimental effect of the attitude of all young people to the functions and application of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a tremendously positive reaction to this pragmatic proposal and there is immense interest in it judging by the reaction from outside groups anxious to get involved in a legitimate <Col N="917" /> way.  Indeed, I am heartened by the fact that the Minister had already indicated he intended to give an extension of broadcasting time to Cork local radio.  On Second Stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill I said the possibility of having a private-public arrangement for Cork local radio should be examined and pursued. I am pleased that RTE looked on that favourably and I understand that negotiations are taking place in this regard.  I should point out that it is not necessary in this instance to bring it under the commission as it can be dealt with by the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>RTE own a State national resource but it is not in the best interest of the consumer that this monopoly should continue. I recall, almost ten years ago, John Kelleher of Strongbow calling for an independent channel and independent production companies welcome this development with open arms.</P>
    <P>The new channel will have in its favour that Irish television audiences are remarkably interested in home-produced programmes.  If one examines RTE one will see it has proved that in recent years with what was a deliberate and, on occasions, even a frenzied rush into home production.  That in itself paid dividends with the result that independent productions doubled last year.</P>
    <P>The independent sector can boast of a growing number of skilled technical know-how.  Already there is co-operation between them by way of sharing freelance cameramen, editors and so on. With this new dawn there will be more full-time activity and, consequently, greater expertise and more jobs in that sector.  In my view the new independent channel can act as a catalyst for RTE. Already there are indications that RTE are gearing themselves to meet the new challenge and I understand that the idea of changing the name RTE 2 is being considered.  That in itself is to be welcomed because the title, without the RTE connotation, would give the station a new vitality and, perhaps, a new emphasis.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live outside Dublin welcome the idea now being mooted of a one hour news programme.  At long last <Col N="918" /> we will get the coverage we legitimately deserve.  The third channel will be able to transmit nationally on the MMDS system and the Minister has told us that it will be incumbent on cable companies with whom RTE are involved to carry the independent channel.  The Bill holds possibilities for the new channel to adopt new approaches, whether they are new transmission systems, new studio technology, a new role for independent production companies, or new formulae that may revolutionise programming here.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the last speaker for his bretvity and point out that I do not propose to go on at any length on this motion.  On Second Stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill I went into detail on the attitude of my party to the whole question of broadcasting and communications.  My remarks will be fairly general and I hope to be able to give other speakers an opportunity to contribute to the debate. Since we had the Second Stage debate on the original radio Bill we have had a bewildering number of amendments introduced by the Minister, thankfully, to some extent, in that he has agreed to set up an Authority for the issuing of contracts.  However, the Minister will retain the right to issue licences for the various wavelengths and so on.  The Minister has tagged on a provision for new commercial radio stations and a new national television channel.  Apart from what has been said in the House in regard to a commercial company named by the last speaker, there is no obvious public indication that there is a demand for a third TV channel.  The Minister has said that submissions have been made to his Department but by whom?  Who do those people represent?  When will we be told who is behind those submissions?  What are their interests in the national TV channel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must assume, because we are talking about commercial television, that their primary interest will be the profit that can be made from the new station. There is no problem in regard to that but, unfortunately, experience has shown that <Col N="919" /> where profit is the primary aim commercial considerations dominate.  The question of the standard of broadcasting, the material broadcast, the way the system will be run, access to the system and a whole range of other issues will take second place to the question of whether the new station is commercially viable or not.  In a sense, what we are dealing with here is a very hotch potch approach to the whole question of communications.</P>
    <P>New technology has provided us with a wonderful means of communicating with each other.  The development of satellites, cable networks, and the new MMDS system has meant that we have a whole range of television stations available to us.  We have the capacity to record and make programmes in a much broader and less expensive way than was the case. Smaller crews are required for the making of TV programmes and running radio stations.  We have the technology but, unfortunately, I see this technology being used for the purpose of making profit rather than giving people an opportunity to communicate with each other over the airwaves, to debate with each other to generally acquire a sense of community spirit, put forward their ideas, adopt a sense of tolerance of different traditions and so on.</P>
    <P>The indications in RTE are that there are commercial pressures on the station to become viable in the strictly profit-making sense.  We now can see a development whereby not only do we have advertisements in slots at various times &mdash; the Minister today announced an extension of advertising time for radio in the evenings &mdash; but we have a development of what could be described as the plug on various programmes on RTE.  Presenters, acknowledged to be first class at their job, people who are trusted by the public, are seen to promote products which in their own way may be excellent but which are being promoted in a way which indicates that the person plugging them is giving them their blessing.  That is an unfair form of advertising as far as I am concerned.  There should be a strict <Col N="920" /> separation of advertising from the programme area.  We should not allow this to develop further, whether it is in RTE or in the new commercial TV station or the radio stations proposed in the Bill. We should not allow presenters to promote products on the basis that they are give-aways with their names being plugged regardless of the consequences for competing products.  It is an unfair form of advertising and represents an intrustion into the programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of independence or the non-editorialising of programmes, there is some suggestion that a new national commercial television station would be in some way independent of the political pressures to which RTE are subject.  That would be a naive understanding of the way these things happen. There is no doubt that many of the programmes on RTE give the views of the presenters.  There is no problem as long as those views are not brought into the news and current affairs areas.  There is an obligation on RTE to provide a balance.</P>
    <P>I was slightly amused recently when a Mr. Tony O'Flaherty complained that Gay Byrne had expressed his own personal views with regard to the Enniskillen massacre, views which I feel were held by the vast majority of the citizens of this island.  I was amused because that particular individual is well known in the Dublin area as being deeply involved with the Provisionals, who give nobody the right to express a view at all contrary to their own.  There is room for programmes to present a particular view or even the personal view of the presenter provided there is a right to reply and the right to have an alternative view broadcast.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about commercialism taking over our communications systems and the idea that the only way to generate communication between people is by having profit as the ultimate aim.  The Minister has indicated he has no ideological hang-ups and that he has not made decisions from the point of view of ideology. I said earlier in this debate that I am not happy with this implied dismissal of ideology.  I am sure the Minister will <Col N="921" /> admit privately, if not publicly, that he has an ideological framework within which he operates, as we all do.  It is common practice among the major parties in this House to deny that they have an ideology.  It is important to stress that there are ideological considerations to be taken into account in the area of communications.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the task of ensuring that access to our communications systems is free to our citizens, that they are not burdened down with a plethora of multinational stations which pump out a diet of pop and patter.  They must not be besieged by dozens of stations which do nothing other than promote the various products which the multinational companies try to sell.  There is nothing to be gained from that kind of development or by establishing a new commercial television station which simply becomes part of that scene.  We should be making our decisions on the basis of how best people can communicate with each other.  I do not see that the way in which this Bill is framed or the amendments the Minister proposes necessarily address that problem. It is not a question simply of who owns or controls a station, whether it be RTE, a commercial company or some private individual.  Public companies are just as free to pander to the commercial interests which provide them with finance to stay on the air.</P>
    <P>This is a much deeper question than that but unfortunately there is no time to develop it or to encourage public debate outside this House.  This is one of the reasons I have asked for more time for this debate, so that the public could be afforded an opportunity to learn what is going on, to appreciate the implications and to have an input in our deliberations. None of us has all the wisdom we might like to think we have.  If democracy is to work properly there must be a two-way process between us and the people who elected us.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a State monopoly on broadcasting.  That is true in so far as there are no commercial stations operating legally.  That is not to say that RTE have not had to face competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> They have had to face competition for advertising from UTV and Channel Four, as well as competition in programming from BBC1 and BBC2.  Now they are in competition with other piped channels such as Sky and presumably more stations will be piped in with which RTE will have to compete.  Although there is an apparent State monopoly, it has not ruled out the element of competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the diversity of culture from European stations.  I wonder whether the piped channels we have had so far are an indication of the kind of diversity we can expect.  Commercialism clearly indicates the pressure for television to go for the mass audience and the bigger the better.  We are talking about tens of millions, not the relatively puny audience of 3.5 million in this State. The tendency has been for the commercial interests dominating any radio or television station to go for the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>It would be an unfortunate fact of life if we allowed commercialism to dominate our broadcasting system.  I must put a question mark on the possibility of us getting the best of Europe or a diversity of culture as a result of the developments. That is why I am urging that there should be a much broader debate on this whole question of communications.  I am not arguing that we should erect a steel wall around this island &mdash; that would be totally nonsensical &mdash; but we should be attempting to provide a broadcasting system which would help to generate debate among ourselves, generate understanding of ourselves in the world and generate a better view of what exactly is being pumped at us and the various forces that lie behind the commercialism on the multinational stage.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of commercialism which concerns me and which is increasingly evident in television is sponsorship. Rarely can an event be held without sponsorship from some brewery, cigarette company, or sports gear company, generally multinational companies.  The whole emphasis in relation to cultural matters, sport, communications, drama, <Col N="923" /> film, and so on, is to some extent dominated by sponsorship from companies of one kind or other.  I was in a local hall, not in my own constituency, a few months ago at a sporting event where young people were playing basketball.  On the wall was a big advertisement for a particular brand of beer.  These 14 year old boys were playing their game of basketball and enjoying themselves.  The fact that that hall had to go to a company which was promoting beer to look for money while, at the same time, they were presumably trying to promote a healthy lifestyle for the youth of the area they were serving seemed to me a fairly strong contradiction.  That is true of quite a huge range of events which now appear on television.  Again, I am raising this question of the dominance of commercialism in relation to communications.</P>
    <P>There is no indication that the Minister intends to rule out the pirates who have been thumbing their noses at the law for the past ten years in relation to radio broadcasting.  This Bill indicates, as one commentator pointed out in an article recently, that experience will be an asset when applying for licences.  One must assume that experience as a pirate will be equally as valid as any other kind of experience.  It would be a grave mistake for this House not to take some strong stand against the pirates who, to this day, continue to operate despite the presence in this House of these Bills which, much as I disagree with some of the emphasis in them, are an attempt to deal with the regulation of the use of the airwaves.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a question with the Minister, as I did with the Taoiseach this morning, on Item No. 22 on today's Order Paper, the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, which reached Committee Stage together with the Sound Broadcasting Bill.  That Bill is intended to outlaw those who do not have licences to broadcast.  I wonder why it is not being debated in tandem with today's Bill as has been the case up to now.  It seems, as I have argued previously, that it would have made more sense and would have indicated a firmness on the part of <Col N="924" /> the Government with regard to piracy if the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill had been brought in and passed first and if it was made quite clear to those operating as pirates that it was not acceptable and if they continued to operate they would be excluded from applying for contracts or licences.  That has not happened and I ask the Minister to indicate why they have dealt with these matters in the order in which they have done.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is not the role of the Government to test the feasibility of having a new national commercial television channel.  I wonder whether he is being entirely honest in saying that.  Perhaps &ldquo;honest&rdquo; is a wrong word to use, but is he being entirely straight in dealing with this issue in that way?  Already in the Bill it is being proposed that £500,000 of the revenue which would normally go to RTE will be taken from those funds and applied to the commission.  There is no doubt that a commercial television channel will, by virtue of the limited nature of the advertising market here, particularly for national advertising, take some of the revenue from RTE also.  It is, therefore, at least in the early stages, likely to cause a loss of revenue to RTE.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee, as the Minister knows, that a commercial television station will survive despite whatever feasibility studies show with regard to their viability.  A television station could be given a contract, could operate for a year or two, take a considerable amount of resources from RTE in terms of advertising, leave RTE in difficulties and then, because it has not become viable, disappear off the scene.  That would not be a very good result for RTE or, indeed, for the people who would have been employed by the new station.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Minister has dropped his requirement that any station would have to produce 40 per cent of their programming within the State.  I wonder how he proposes, therefore, to ensure that the kind of ethos he spoke about would be maintained by a new commercial television station.  I note that he talked about an indigenously based <Col N="925" /> company.  As we know, being based in Ireland does not put any obligation on a company to use Irish programmes, to acquire the expertise of Irish staff or any of these things.  I wonder whether just being required to be based indigenously in the State is sufficient to ensure the kind of station which he hopes to achieve, that is, a commercial station which would have an Irish ethos.  It would be interesting to have a debate on how you would define an Irish ethos, but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's announcement this morning with regard to extending times for RTE, he did not refer to RTE Cork's local radio and the extension of time for them.  I know that over a period of time they have been arguing very strongly for an extension of their broadcasting times. I find it difficult to understand precisely why the Minister retains that control over broadcasting times.  It is not as if other stations are attempting to broadcast on the same wave lengths.  It seems that if RTE or, indeed, any of the other stations that we are proposing to establish have the capacity and the willingness to broadcast 24 hours a day, that is what they should be allowed do provided they meet certain standards in terms of production and the quality of what they are producing.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister's token reference to community radio in the Bill remains entirely inadequate.  We will be debating that later today but I still believe it is not entirely adequate simply to require that the commission should take into account the community interest represented by a particular applicant.  There is no obligation on them to encourage the development of local co-operatively organised community radio.  That is one of the needs for which there is a very clear demand.  I will be moving an amendment to cover this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the major step forward taken by the Minister this morning when he opened what is a very healthy debate on the changes in the communications area which are acceptable and practicable.  The setting up of the <Col N="926" /> commission is justified now that the decision has been taken to provide an extra service.</P>
      <P>Everybody is at one in wanting to regularise and put local radio, particularly in the Dublin area, on a proper footing. This has been very unsatisfactory for some years.  It was interesting to hear Deputy De Rossa speak about ideology. We could put that down as a reason why there has been such slow progress in this area for such a long time.  When one gets involved in the area of ideology it is very difficult to get a decisive decision.  The outgoing Government had that problem. They could not get agreement among the Coalition parties and the matter was allowed drag on indefinitely.  The Minister has taken a couple of giant steps forward and I hope this Bill will pass both Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible and that it will soon be on the Statute Book.  The Minister has addressed this issue in very plain language.  We are a great nation of talkers but if we could make decisive decisions we could make real progress.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to look at the history of communications, especially the original method of communication, namely, newspapers.  When the State was founded there was political involvement in newspapers. Our party were involved in setting up a newspaper.  Time has passed, changes have come about and the control of our newspapers is in the hands of various holdings.  There is no State control. Our newspapers stand on quality, or fail because of a lack of quality, but overall, there is a reasonable balance.  There is a certain amount of inaccurate reporting and certain publications sensationalise some aspects of the news but, on balance, newspaper reporting tells us the trends that are emerging in this area.</P>
      <P>When creating a new method of communicating, one is naturally ultra-cautious and wants to have a certain amount of control because inaccurate reporting is not acceptable.  From experience one may find that controls which were originally imposed were unnecessary but at the time they were seen as safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view setting up the commission <Col N="927" /> to deal with local radio and the possibility of setting up a third TV channel is a good move.  The people who believe such a move would be viable should be given an opportunity to present their proposals. Various aspects of the legislation will give the Minister and the commission enough control to ensure that what will be provided is acceptable.  I have no doubt the Irish people, with their choice of TV channels and radio stations, will devise their own methods of control.  Anybody providing an inadequate service will suffer the commercial consequences.  The commission will dictate what is an acceptable quality of service.  Today there is great competition attracting television viewers.  The Minister referred to the satellite concept which is beginning to percolate into our awareness because viewers will have a very wide choice available via satellites.</P>
    <P>All in all, there is probably a need for the third channel to fill a niche in the television communications area.  I was a member of the Oireachtas committee who looked at the working of RTE in 1978-79.  At that time one felt that because of a lack of flexibility, which probably exists to a lesser extent today, they could not react adequately to changes. The great debate of the day was the acceptability of the use of video cassettes, on-site reporting, recording in Limerick and Cork, showing the reports on the 9 o'clock news, and so on.  That new technology was unacceptable to the workforce of RTE.  There was a great deal of discussion about this, about demarcation lines, overmanning levels and so on.  To put it another way, we could put this debate on a par with the debate on one-man buses.  As I said, the RTE workforce said this new technology was unacceptable.  Times have changed and these changes are now in place and the matter has been adequately resolved.</P>
    <P>We live in a rapidly changing world and we must be able to respond to the various technological changes that are coming forward.  The Minister is presenting a workable formula.  Under this <Col N="928" /> legislation he wants to delegate an appropriate commission to ensure that the necessary steps can be taken to provide these services.  I have no doubt a small well-run TV station could be profitable, viable and workable.  I see this as another way to present a good image of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to local production, but with the subcontracting concept established, even in RTE, one can show a lot of quality work.  This will present our young broadcasters with the opportunity of doing good work and will provide an outlet for that work.  The new communicators who are prepared to produce reasonably costed quality work will be able to show the finished product on this channel.  I sincerely hope this third channel will provide an outlet for the great work of these young people because at the moment, since RTE is such a large organisation, they have great difficulty in getting their work on the screen.  There are programme makers in RTE, in-house staff and teams of people dealing with different aspects of communications &mdash; current affairs, art, culture and so on. Outside RTE there are many young capable broadcasters who cannot get a position in RTE although they can produce excellent work.  I hope the new channel will provide worthwhile outlet for that sort of production.</P>
    <P>The Leader of The Workers' Party probably needs to catch up with the trend on ideology.  A country for which he would have a certain admiration, the Soviet Union, is moving to break away from its traditional ideology.  I have come back from Iraq, a country which is State-controlled. Early in the year that Government decided to break the State monopoly and go for a combination of State and private enterprise.  There is a whole drift across Europe of socialist governments changing dramatically and allowing greater freedom of activity to the people whom they represent.  That is what is being done here in this legislation. We are removing the shackles and giving more elbow room to those who are capable of performing and achieving in our <Col N="929" /> society.  Understandably, from the beginning we would want the hand of the State on many of these important areas of communication.</P>
    <P>Quality and efficiency are the order of the day.  If one is not producing quality on a cost efficient basis, survival is not possible.  There is an element of the RTE service which we would classify as being in the social arena, in that they are asked to provide a nationwide service, particularly in the area of local radio.  It is understandable that that service must continue to be provided.  Doubtless, local radio will find it difficult to survive in the rural setting in certain parts of the country.  I do not know how the scales can be tipped in the balance to ensure that local communities with low and falling populations will get a local radio service comparable with that in other parts of the country.  Removal of the shackles of State over-involvement is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made reference to the regulations concerning the various hours of broadcasting.  That has given some control of the service but has nothing to do with the quality of the service.  The Minister is correct in the changes which he mentioned towards the end of his speech this morning.  With regard to the competitive areas of local communication, as one representing what we like to regard as two new satellite towns, I sincerely hope the local radio element will play a key role in creating the community spirit that must be created when one is moving from a village of 1,000 population, to today's population of more than 50,000, with the intention of development into a new satellite city or large town.  Local radio facility will be a great vehicle there for bridge-building and bonding together this new community which will need to establish themselves as a cohesive unit.  How better to do this than through the local written media and, in particular, local radio.  It will give large numbers of groups an opportunity to express their viewpoints. It will facilitate the provision of outlets for the many organisations who have much to say.  It will be a tremendous <Col N="930" /> opportunity for those excellent people who give up so much of their leisure time in looking after groups, teenage or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the satellite towns of Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan and Tallaght, local radio will be of major importance.  I hope that whatever licensing arrangements are issued by the commission will recognise population growth and the satellite town concept.  These areas are at the stage of suffering growing pains.  We can be negatively critical, which is a step in the wrong direction. Much has been achieved in the establishment of new communities and the local radio facility will be of great importance here.  Like all other Deputies, no doubt, I have had various opinions expressed to me.  Yesterday I was approached by a community representative group in the Blanchardstown area who said that they were trying to put forward a proposal and package that would allow them to apply for whatever local radio franchise might be available in that area.  Naturally, I encouraged them and asked them to put forward the most competent package and to get what professional advice is available.  That type of community involvement should get recognition in the issuing of licences.</P>
    <P>In the mid-nineties we will look back on this debate as a giant step forward.  I hope the opportunity the commission will afford to those in the community in the area of professional communications will be fully grasped.  The combination of satellite lifting of programmes <i>vis-à-vis</i> various franchises will show the competitive edge of communication.  This RTE debate so far smacks of the Aer Lingus debate during which we were regularly briefed in Buswell's Hotel on applications for competition in regard to Ryanair and other air carriers.  The introduction of competition into the marketplace was the single greatest revenue boost to Aer Lingus for many a year.</P>
    <P>We will see the challenge provided to RTE, both radio and television, resulting in an added impetus.  RTE will want to show how excellent they are and will have the opportunity to be measured against <Col N="931" /> competition.  Across the water, one sees the BBC-ITV relationship.  There are different niches but the BBC are recognised as the national broadcasting service in that country with a particular role to play.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the various important current affairs programmes of recent times presented to the people of Britain and Ireland which might not have been presented had it not been for competition, with the privately organised outfit feeling that they could take on the Government of the day in presenting current affairs issues that should have been available for viewing in Britain and here also.  The people providing services outside State control will do so in a very competitive marketplace.  It will give RTE an opportunity to respond to the new challenge.</P>
    <P>The communications media of newspapers, radio and television will benefit from this legislation.  From the Minister's point of view the appointment of the commission, combined with the extra TV channel, is fully justified and I have no doubt will get the support of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Being the second largest party in this House I do not think it is unreasonable that we should have a second contributor to this debate.  I do not want to delay the House but let me make three very brief points.  Firstly, I believe the Bill should make provision for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Dáil.  There are those who feel that this should not be covered in legislation of this kind but I believe it should be.  In New Zealand a specific radio station was set up to broadcast the proceedings of parliament; this in a country which is of similar size to our own and which has a parliament similar in size to our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> What happens is that parliament is broadcast on a particular station and it is left on the air all day long.  People can tune into this station if they so wish.  There may be those who may not wish to do so but for the information of the House let me point out that this station is very popular in New Zealand and that even the staff of the parliament on their days off tune into this particular station.</P>
    <P>As RTE have not kept to their contract and, as they are contractually obliged to do, have not rebroadcasted the proceedings of the committees of the House it is not right that RTE should continue to have the right to rebroadcast the proceedings of the Dáil.  I believe this right should be taken from RTE and should be given to a team set up within parliament to rebroadcast the proceedings of the Dáil, Seanad and the committees of the House.  It is outrageous that a body owned by the State can make contractual arrangements with the Houses of the Oireachtas and not stick to them.  They have ignored these arrangements and have not made adequate resources available so as to enable them to cover the proceedings of the Houses.  Each time there is a hijack or a major sporting event in some part of the world they are able to despatch a team of reporters to cover the event, yet they cannot find somebody to cover the proceedings of parliament. The proceedings of parliament, particularly the work of the committees, are covered by every other section of the media and I believe because RTE have not kept to the agreement they should not continue to have that facility.  Consideration should be given to including in the Bill a provision for the setting up of a broadcasting station to cover the proceedings of parliament.</P>
    <P>The second point that I wish to make, and this was touched on earlier in the debate, is that there are many people who are quite happy with the existing Christian broadcasting station.  I do not know what its exact name is.  I do not think that any one religion should hold a monopoly in broadcasting but there is a demand for a religious station.  These <Col N="934" /> stations are quite popular and provision should be made in the Bill for the setting up of a religious station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there is a demand for the setting up of a religious station covering religious music, sermons and interviews and provision should be made, and perhaps some encouragement given to the new Authority, to ensure that such a facility is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point is that increasingly the written media is being competed with by both radio and television.  I feel that we are imposing a set of standards on one section of the media which we are not imposing on another.  For instance, let us take the question of balanced reporting on both radio and television.  It would be unthinkable if such a requirement did not apply to RTE or to any further radio or television station set up in this country. Yet, in the written media there seems to be no requirement that there be balanced reporting.  As we already have in existence an independent RTE Authority, should we not consider the setting up of a press council to which people who feel they have not received fair treatment in the media can complain to and to which a journalist who feels that his independence is being overrun by the marketing requirements of a particular newspaper could have recourse so as to ensure that the standards we apply to one section of the media would also be applicable to all other sections?  Those journalists who are being forced to put a particular angle on a story in order that <Col N="935" /> the newspaper may be able to sell more newspapers should have recourse to such a council.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where we should look again at the question of whether we should set up a press council not just to protect the public &mdash; I am not paranoid in any way about the press &mdash; but also journalists.  It is a well known fact that journalists are increasingly coming under pressure from their marketing managers to put a particular angle on stories and I do not think this should be the case.  Journalists would be quite happy to have a court of appeal to which they could appeal if they feel they are being compromised in their reporting.  I hope on Committee Stage to deal with a particular section of the Bill but for now I will sit down and allow Deputy Keating to make a contribution.  I do not think it is unreasonable that this party, having 50 Deputies in this House, should have a second contributor to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the last point which Deputy Mitchell made.  I believe that a party should be entitled to put forward as many speakers as they wish.  There is an anomaly contained in a arrangement which imposes a strict time limit of two and a half hours to three hours on the discussion of a Bill while putting no time limit on the length of speeches.  One or two abusers, and to be fair this did not happen this morning, can use up all the time.  The truth of the matter, and I have spoken to Deputies on all sides of the House about this, is that they believe there is no point in coming into the House to make contributions as they know they will not get in.  This includes the majority of the back-benchers on the Government side.  In accordance with the order before the House, Deputy Roche has the right to speak before me if he so wishes and that is the point we should address, otherwise we will make a shambles out of the proceedings. As there is very little time left I intend to be brief but let me say that we intend to press that point as it does mean that we are making a mockery out <Col N="936" /> of the proceedings and are assuming that the majority of Members will not have an opportunity to participate in this debate. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>As our spokesman, Deputy O'Malley, has already outlined, we broadly welcome this Bill and we do not mind contrasting it with the dangerous proposal which emanated from the previous Government.  The first line in the explanatory memorandum of their Bill read that the purpose of their Bill was to control broadcasting, an incredible but inciteful comment.  I am pleased that this Minister's approach is much more open and democratic.  Nevertheless, I believe we have a right to question the assumption behind broadcasting legislation, which is that the State has a right to hold a monopoly and the State has a right to derogate from that right.  That right is not vested in them anywhere, either in the Constitution or in law.  The State has no such right.  The airwaves do not belong to the State.  They belong to the people and the degree of control which is exercised by the State should be the minimum necessary to maintain public order and order in broadcasting terms.  The debate which has taken place in recent years has been about an incredibly outdated attitude to maximum control and regulation by the State of all broadcasting within this country.  At its heart that was about political control and power. Undoubtedly that was the atmosphere that permeated that discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the discussion referred to this morning &mdash; the principle about private or public ownership &mdash; misses the whole point.  This Bill is designed &mdash; though in our view not perfectly so &mdash; to withdraw direct State involvement to some degree and allow people to organise their affairs in the broadcasting sphere to the maximum extent.  From our point of view that is a good thing.  It is also a good thing that there should be the maximum degree of choice, that people should have the right to choose, not just what we think they need &mdash; one of the areas in which we believe the Bill is deficient &mdash; but rather what people want to view or to listen to.  There is a kind of notion that <Col N="937" /> somehow we should establish commissions and committees, that we have, as it were, the right to say to people that the broadcasting service, in broad terms, should present programmes which are, by varying degrees of percentages, presented in such a way as to accord with our view of what we think is in the national interest.  That is incredibly arrogant.  Ultimately people have a right to express a view about what they want, even if what they want sometimes is not necessarily what you, I, or they themselves would at all times listen to or view.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, therefore, we should challenge the right to a monopoly.  I was struck by a reference in a publication called <i>Communications</i>, in an article by Richard Elen, to the following:</P>
    <P>One of the basic requirements of a dictatorship or autocracy is a monopoly of the means of communication.</P>
    <P>He said many other things also but that does strike the note, that the insecure State, the insecure Government, or the undemocratic Government will be the first to reach for this incredible idea that they must control broadcasting, or that broadcasting somehow is the arm or extension of Government, as it has been claimed was said by a former leader of this country, though I do not know if he ever said it in that context.  We challenge that and reject it, because we believe that people have the ultimate right.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister was unduly scathing in his remarks in regard to what have become known as the pirate stations. None of us has any defence of people who break the law.  Nonetheless, it is overstating it somewhat to say, as did the Minister:</P>
    <P>For ten years and more we have had the spectacle of illegal pirate radio stations creating chaos on the airwaves, bringing the law into disrepute and, indeed, at international level, bringing the good name of this country in the radio regulatory sphere into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The truth is that what brought this country into disrepute was the fear, cowardice <Col N="938" /> and craven nature of successive administrations who did nothing about it.  When it comes to it, whether or not we like to admit it, whether or not it is popular to say so, the reality is that the vast majority of pirate stations provided an extremely good service, were extremely popular and created no chaos whatever, though there were some who did in a technical sense.</P>
    <P>I admire the entrepreneurial flair and spirit of many of the people associated with those stations.  I am extremely sorry to see that we have not on the Statute Book at this moment any facility whereby they can apply for a licence; in other words, there is no law with which they can comply.  Technically they are certainly in breach of the law and I know, from having spoken to some of them, they have no wish to be so.  That applies also to some of the initiatives which could have been taken in recent years had there been a facilitating mechanism for obtaining a licence, which would include the Christian station referred to by Deputy G. Mitchell, or, indeed, various educational stations in which there is a great future if handled properly.  Therefore, it is a little harsh to talk about individuals creating chaos when, apparently, no interest was taken in taking a proper regulatory framework on board to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The freedom or right to communicate is essential and forms a basic philosophic element in the approach of my party to public order, the right of people to communicate with each other through any means, technological or otherwise, available to them, the role of Government being a minimalist one to protect order in that respect.  I am struck by the fact that our Constitution bears that out in Article 40, subparagraph i., where it talks about the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions and develops that at some length.  This finds a more detailed echo in the constitutions and laws of other countries that have taken that fundamental freedom very seriously, as for example, in the law in Germany, referred to in a publication under the heading of <i>Basic Law of the</i><Col N="939" /><i>Federal Republic of Germany</i>, which had this to say at subparagraph (1):</P>
    <P>Everyone has the right freely to express and to propagate his or her opinion in words, writing or images and to inform himself or herself without hindrance from generally accessible sources.</P>
    <P>Similarly in Sweden, Canada and in the United States, that very precious, essential freedom is respected in law.  It is particularly desirable in a small, island country, with relatively few vehicles of communication, that that freedom would not just be agreed to be important but, wherever possible, would be written into law, perhaps into our Constitution and, in so far as is possible, would be extended also not merely into the television and radio spheres but also to the printed media so that journalists and other investigators &mdash; in pursuance of various issues &mdash; would have the freedom to be able to discuss, debate and pursue without fear of immediate recrimination or oppressive legislation falling on their backs.  That is consistent with the general approach we take in these matters.</P>
    <P>The relationship between Government and broadcasting always has been very difficult and will continue to be so.  I suppose what we are endeavouring to do here is balance that maximum freedom of the individual with the obligation of Government to at least interpose some degree of order and protect the public in certain areas, for example, to protect young people against exposure to violence, pornography, to protect people against technical interference with the airwaves.  There is, therefore, a role for Government and it is a question of the definition of that role that is important.</P>
    <P>In large measure the provisions of the Minister's Bill work in the right direction but, in some respects, are overly detailed. I should like to have been able to develop these points further but I shall not do so beyond making one or two further brief points.  However, I do regret not having had the opportunity to develop those points as I had hoped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> The proposal to establish an independent commission has been lauded and is generally acceptable.  We support it wholeheartedly.  However, it is important that we would not, somehow, stigmatise the political process as being the primary or only area from which influence or undue pressure can emanate.  Merely because we may have a commission independent of the Minister by no means indicates that we have a commission free from other pressures.  I was struck by a publication <i>Government and Broadcasting in France</i>, written by Raymond Kuhn, in which he spoke about the French experience as follows:</P>
    <P>The failure of the various reforms introduced since 1969 to settle the problem of the Government's relationship with the broadcasting services does not augur well for the success of the 1974 statute.  It is most unlikely that the latest measures will mark the end of broadcasting as a controversial issue in French politics.  There are too many groups intent in using radio and television to further their own political ends for this to be the case.  Apart from the Government and the parties of the majority, other groups, including business interests, the left-wing opposition and the trade unions, have all shown their readiness to exploit the potential of the broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>Merely because we have this easy, ready recourse at every level, to seeing the political system as somehow the repository of all obnoxious elements in our society, because, as an independent commission one distances oneself slightly from that does not necessarily mean that we will not have other influences, perhaps even more perverse, certainly less accountable influences, brought to bear.  I am sure that will not happen.  I simply raise the point that it is not merely from the political arena, which is at least ultimately accountable to the public, that such pressures and possible insidious influences can emanate.</P>
    <P>There were also some points I should have liked to have made about the fear and concern there is over broadcasting <Col N="941" /> standards in the wake of the opening up of broadcasting generally.  Certainly it is true to say that a fear of lowered programming standards has been the principal reason for resistance in this area but experience abroad does not bear that out. I look forward to healthy development in this area.  I look forward to more choice for people, higher standards, above all the freedom for people, innovators, entrepreneurs, people who are desirous of communicating people who are desirous of providing a service &mdash; whether it be through the Irish language a là the Conradh na Gaeilge submission, whether it be through the Christian broadcasting service, through the open University system or tuition on the air in its various forms, through local, regional stations &mdash; the essential requirement is that there be a multiplicity of choice catering not just for the passive, music programming desire but also for more stimulating, educational, uplifting, inspirational type of material.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a step in the right direction.  I do not agree with some of the speakers who said that it should have received more consideration.  I am sick and tired of commissions.  As the Minister pointed out this thing has been going on for the last ten years.  The Minister is on the right track and I commend him on it. I regret that I did not have a little more time to develop some of the points.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised a point about sponsorship and it is worthy of comment. On balance, the ultimate answer in trying to prevent or discourage people from being overly subject to that is in developing a generation of people who are educated and confident in their assertion of the right to choose, who are able to weigh up the influences around them and make free choices.  That is where we stand on these issues.  It is better than trying to put one's finger in the dam by stopping sponsorship, outside broadcasts and satellite broadcasts, and trying to pretend that we can exist on an island on our own in a blinkered way.  That is simply out of touch with 1988.  I want the people to have the maximum choice available and the education and self-confidence to <Col N="942" /> exercise that choice.  This Bill goes in that direction and from that point of view we welcome it in broad terms, with the slight reservation that we would have liked to have more time to have said a little more. Perhaps we would not have said anything significantly different, but we would have said it at greater length.</P>

      <P>Time is limited but we will have an opportunity in the afternoon and until midnight to discuss in detail on Committee Stage many of the points that have been made in a general way.</P>
      <P>I welcome the speeches that have been made in support of this liberalising measure proposed in this motion and proposed in the Bill.  Deputy Bruton and other speakers referred to home programmes. I am conscious that in the independent third channel to be established there should be a concentration on home programmes. With that in mind I will introduce an amendment which we will discuss in the afternoon.  The amendment will be to section 16 of the Bill and part of it reads as follows:</P>
      <P>(4) For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service is devoted to original programme material produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Communities by persons other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of fair competition between RTE and the independent stations, RTE will have a major advantage over the independent stations and the independent radio station because RTE will still be in receipt of licence fees plus advertising, whereas the independent stations will have to depend on advertising alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of this level playing pitch in relation to the operations of the independents versus the constraints on RTE, I can advise the House that since last Christmas, following consultations <Col N="943" /> between myself and the RTE Authority, we have established a mechanism for constant contact between the Authority and officials of my Department.  It is that type of work that has resulted in the announcement I made today in relation to the extra time for radio and television and the changes in adverting rules that will apply to RTE.</P>
    <P>On the question of the editorial view and the freedom to express an editorial view, it is not my intention, and it never was my intention, that the station would have the right to an editorial view.  I tried to cover that in the drafting of the Bill within the constraints of advice given to me by the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman, on the basis of what was or was not constitutional.  At the moment we cannot control the editorial view of the independent papers, and we would not want to and the argument put by the Attorney General's office is that the same rules would apply, that it would be unconstitutional to control editorial view.  That is not a view that I shared.  I got back to them and I would have liked to be able to tell the House that my wish, a wish expressed by a number of amendments tabled to the Bill by various parties, would be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Malley for the points he made and for his welcome for this Bill. The Deputy made a number of points which we can cover on the various amendments to be discussed later. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the White Paper which was there pre-RTE TV. Things have changed a great deal in communications since the early sixties.  We now have satellites and extra stations, cable television and so on.  We talked enough about the whole thing and it is now time for action.  I accept the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan that other channels should be available to the rural areas as well as to the capital and main cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are welcome to <Col N="944" /> apply.  If they apply in joint venture with somebody else, under their own RTE legislation, I am prepared to look at it. They do not have to and would not want to come under independent commissions. An RTE Authority under an independent commission would not work.</P>
      <P>In relation to unregulated satellite stations, I can assure the Deputies that the EC and the Council of Europe are conscious of the effectively unregulated situation of satellites, and standards are being drawn up both at EC level and Council of Europe level.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned standards for RTE and for the independent stations.  Standards for RTE have been extended further into the operations of the independent stations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the support given by Deputies O'Keeffe and Lawlor for the Bill. Deputy De Rossa mentioned the question of personalities plugging products and sponsorship.  This is something I took up with RTE at a very early stage in my Ministry.  The rules in relation to, for example, prizes being put up on programmes &mdash; for instance cars and the personalities involved plugging the cars in a way that could be misinterpreted to give the impression that they were lauding the benefits of those cars or products &mdash; are in place.  The guidelines have been changed for that type of sponsorship. I agree with the Deputy on the principle of it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the diet of pop patter, the intention of the Bill in relation to the 20 per cent rule on radio for news and current affairs, is to stop this wall-to-wall practice that we have had in the pirate stations.  A point was made by Deputy Mitchell in relation to Christian broadcasting. There is nothing to stop any group applying for a licence.  Broadcasting of the Dáil is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I understand that is being considered following a resolution of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Independent productions were mentioned by Deputy Lawlor and I answered his point.  I thank Deputy Keating for his warm welcome for this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> Using the Deputy's criteria of insecurity of Government, if a measure of the security of this Government can be taken from the fact that we are loosening the controls of broadcasting to the extent of this liberal regime which we are promoting here <Col N="946" /> today, the Deputy can be assured that this Government feel totally secure.  I look forward to a detailed discussion in the afternoon and into the night on the various amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have received representations by and on behalf of existing operators of illegal systems which rebroadcast television signals at UHF. Their main interest is in preserving the existing unsatisfactory <i>status quo</i> in relation to illegal rebroadcasting.  The question of licensing rebroadcasting at UHF has been considered carefully both by myself and two of my predecessors.  I have decided against such a course of action, as did previous Ministers.  I have dealt with the reasons why in replies recently to questions in the House.  The Official Report references are as follows: 28 April 1988, volume 379 columns 2498 to 2503, and 2530; Wednesday, 18 May, volume 380 columns 1791 to 1794.</P>
      <P>I should stress that rebroadcasting at UHF was considered not to be in the national interest even before the possibilities of MMDS were investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in relation to spare capacity in the UHF spectrum and is it possible that the rebeaming operators could utilise spare capacity?  They would be willing to yield up the frequency if and when the public service broadcasting sector required those frequencies.  Following on from that has the Minister any comment to make in relation to the safety hazards associated with the MMDS system about which there is much public concern?  I think the Minister indicated when we discussed this matter last week that he would make some statement on the matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Any developments in UHF rebroadcasting would not address the fundamental problems which the Department found when consideration was being given to the licensing of UHF rebroadcasting, and consideration was <Col N="948" /> given to it.  The UHF broadcasting spectrum is the only spectrum available for terrestrial broadcasting developments here, including RTE's medium to long term requirements and also the very limited capacity of the UHF.  It is estimated that on a national basis up to four channels, as opposed to the 11 which will be available on MMDS, is the maximum which would be obtained from the band.</P>
      <P>There is a question later on the subject of safety.  I should like to refer the Deputy to the fact that the World Health Organisation have set out, since 1980-81, a series of health standards to be followed in the operation of micro-wave.  Micro-wave is not just used for television, it is used for telephone systems and many other systems.  The proposed MMDS system will be well within the scope laid down by the World Health Organisation and there is no question of any health risk.  On the contrary, I would say to the Deputy that it is less than honest of these illegal operators to try to bring this as a red herring into the debate on the development of MMDS.  The Deputy is correct when he mentioned that on last Friday on the Estimate debate I referred to it at some length and I gave him, and other Deputies in the House, a guarantee that it is my intention &mdash; and it is already in train &mdash; to prepare an information leaflet on exactly what is involved in the MMDS network, the MMDS proposals, the costs etc.  The question of the cost of MMDS to subscribers is something that came up in representations I received from people in Donegal through my colleagues in Donegal.  The investment required for MMDS systems generally will be very significant.  A typical transmitter installation will cost up to £250,000 and each subscriber will be supplied free by the MMDS operator with between £250 and £300 worth of equipment in his house.  This will comprise an aerial converter and a decoder.  It is estimated that the cost of the service will be approximate to that charged for modern cable systems which is around £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister refer to the fact that he will bring <Col N="949" /> out an information leaflet on the safety aspects of the MMDS system.  It is unfair of the Minister to say that the people who have reservations about this system are being less than honest and that they are introducing a red herring into the argument about MMDS.  In relation to the UHF spectrum, the Minister said that medium and long term planning in terms of the management of this spectrum would require that everybody else should be kept out of it with the exception of the State broadcasting service.  What does the Minister mean by medium to long term planning?  What number of years is the Minister talking about?  It may be possible to accommodate these people until such time as it becomes absolutely necessary for the airwaves in that spectrum to be handed back to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These people, with the illegal service which they have at present, are providing up to four channels for their subscribers.  The MMDS system will provide up to 11 channels, including the new national independent station here.  I do not believe that the people in rural areas should have to accept a lower set of standards and a lower service than those available in cabled cities such as Dublin, Cork and the other cabled areas. The same range of choice should be available to those in rural areas where it is impossible to cable.  The MMDS system is operating in America and Canada.  We are the first in Europe to take it and it is known as the non-wired cable system.  It will provide a uniform quality of service which is not available at present through the illegal operators where the illegal deflectors have different qualities of service; some are quite good, some are very bad but they vary from place to place. The UHF will not give the full range of stations which are important.  Because of the new broadcasting changes that are coming in, the three new satellite channels that will be available in the UK before 1989, the 14 that are available from Luxembourg, the new DBS systems which are coming in from France and Germany and the satellite services which are already available, I do not see why <Col N="950" /> the people in the four corners of this country should not have the same quality and range of service available to them as to those who are fortunate enough to live in the cities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that those who are operating the community service at present, albeit illegal, will have no future in the operating of rebeaming of television signals, that they will have no role to play in the new system which he is evolving and has he actually told the representatives from those community groups who are representative of the people in rural areas and who are totally against the MMDS system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question Deputy Cullen asks illustrates the point that it is necessary to have a full information document available to them because there is great misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the full extent of the potential of the service and the quality of the service of MMDS as distinct from the illegal deflectors.  There is no bar whatsoever on those community and other groups getting involved in applying for the legal and organised network of MMDS and I would welcome their involvement.</P>

Private <Col N="951" /> applications will be made by groups such as community groups, as mentioned by Deputy Cullen.  No licence can be given until the regulations are made and no licence will be given until the regulations are made.  I have tried to short-circuit the length of time of lead-in to give people an opportunity to be notified of the intention to proceed on this basis.  I have asked them to indicate their interest in making applications but no licence will be given prior to the regulations being made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice the provisions that are in the Broadcasting Acts place very little constraints on the Authority with regard to programming hours on radio and television.  All recent applications for increased hours on both radio and television have been approved with the exception of an application relating to Cork local radio.  The policy of retention of ministerial approval over increases in the broadcasting hours is to ensure that the Authority do not over-extend at the expense of the television licence fee payer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that RTE will be put at a disadvantage given that they are now going to have to compete with independent radio that are being set up under the Bill we are discussing today on the basis that they are going to be subject to certain constraints in terms of the number of hours they can broadcast whereas the independents will not be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On the contrary, RTE have a distinct advantage over individual independent television and radio to be established because RTE will be in receipt of a licence fee as well as the advertising revenue that they are capable of bringing in.  They have over 60 years experience in radio and over 25 years in television and experience in gaining advertising.  They have their very important and very large niche in the market so there is no disadvantage.  As far as the operation of co-operation and controls between the Department and the RTE Authority is concerned, in order that the RTE Authority will be on the level playing pitch the Chairman of the RTE Authority speaks about, since before Christmas there has been a joint working group between the RTE Authority and officials of my Department.  They meet on a regular basis.  Whenever problems come up, whenever queries arise, they are sorted out in the context of those arrangements and the RTE Authority will be happy with the announcement I made this morning in regard to the extra hours, extra advertising time on radio, television and Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>At the moment the Minister of the day has control over the extra hours that RTE would be looking <Col N="953" /> for.  It is important that there should be some control, that the organisation does not over-extend because it will be the licence fee payer who will be picking up the tab at the end of the day and, as the Deputy rightly says, it is also the role of the Minister of the day to make decisions in relation to licence fees.  There is no reason to change the legislation.  RTE are in a unique position.  They receive up to 45 per cent of their revenue from licence fres and there should be some control to protect the consumer.  We have heard a lot in the past couple of weeks about protecting the consumer and this is one instance where we should not remove the protection for the consumer that is inherent in this ministerial approval.</P>

With regard to billing I should like to know when the call-logging system will be operational.  I assume that such a system will remove the necessity for the Ombudsman getting involved in such complaints because telephone users will be able to obtain a printout of the duration and location of calls, matters which are the subject of so many queries about billing.</P>

The position with regard to cabling and digital generally is so good that faults occur about once every two years compared to one each year on each line, as predicted at the time of the <Col N="956" /> establishment of Telecom Éireann.  With regard to billing Telecom Éireann, as part of their computerisation programme, are investing £20 million in equipment which will allow each subscriber to have on request details of each call made from their number.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, absolutely not.  The RTE Authority will still be in receipt of the full licence.  An Post have met their commitments in relation to the targets laid down by the Authority.  They are doing an excellent job in the collecting of licence fees.  They have spent a lot of money on computerising the collection system and I am confident that the percentage being collected at present will increase over the next five years.</P>

Will the Minister agree that there is a more efficient way of collecting these fees?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that those liable should be paying the licence fee and that if they do not do so they are stealing from their neighbours.  Unfortunately, up to now the penalty for non-payment of licence fees was very small, but the <Col N="960" /> Deputy will be aware that in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill which is before the House &mdash; Second Stage has been passed and I hope Committee and Final Stages will be passed shortly &mdash; the penalty for such an offence is being increased dramatically.  That should increase the percentage of payments. With regard to the Deputy's question to me about whether RTE are satisfied with the collection system, I should like to tell him that while I accept they would like to collect the fee themselves they are satisfied that An Post have been meeting their targets.  In my view An Post, because of their network of post offices and their contact with people throughout the country, are uniquely qualified to collect the licence fee.</P>

      <P>They are on target for the amount laid down between themselves and RTE.  They reached their target last year and will reach it this year. An Post are conscious of the need to improve the percentage collected annually and have invested a lot of money in the collection system by computerising it and allocating specific staff to that task. Their system is working very well and in my view when we agree to the increased penalties there will be a greater number of people paying their licence fee.  As one Member said, not to pay a licence fee <Col N="961" /> amounts to stealing from one's neighbours.</P>

A total of £5 million has been spent to date.  It is estimated that over 500 jobs have been created or maintained as a result.</P>

      <P>The question refers to the Government's plan for the expansion and development of Bord na Móna.  Is the Minister aware that considerable research has already been carried out by Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais into possible alternative uses and the <Col N="963" /> great possibilities for conventional forestry and grassland amenities?  Will the Minister say specifically what is envisaged for the future of Bord na Móna?  He spoke very quickly in giving the reply and I certainly did not get the message.  What future role will Bord na Móna have?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for speaking too quickly.  I believe the future of Bord na Móna is guaranteed.  The board, together with the new chief executive and the management, have been doing a good job in reviewing prospects and laying out a path for the future.  The Government felt this was an opportune time to look at the overall picture from outside.  In 1985-86 Bord na Móna made a loss of £17.6 million; in 1986-87 they made a loss of £15.8 million and it is estimated that in the year 1987-88 they will incur a loss of £3 million.  Their total overall debt stands at £165 million.  It is time to look at the potential of Bord na Móna by bringing in a firm of outside consultants.</P>
      <P>Their terms of reference are to review the existing operations of Bord na Móna and to recommend such changes as may be necessary to achieve maximum efficiency in accordance with modern business criteria in each of their activities; to examine the relationship between the ESB and Bord na Móna and to identify the medium and long-term changes which will be necessary to take account of the realities of presentday electricity production economics with a view to producing cheaper electricity for the consumer; to examine the effectiveness of the organisation, management and research and development activities within the company and the relevance of the present R and D programme; and to identify new products or services which can be delivered on a profitable basis. There is a tremendous future for the employees of Bord na Móna but that can only be secured if it is a viable company. This is what we are trying to ensure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 19, 30, 32, 39, and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to the reply I gave to the House on 28 January and 17 May in relation to the proposals made on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final project proposal was received by me on 2 May and my Department, in conjunction with the INPC, are currently <Col N="967" /> examining it with all speed possible bearing in mind the complexity of the issues involved.  I have also engaged outside consultants to provide an independent appraisal of the proposal.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate to publish the consultants' report when completed.</P>
    <P>I have long held the belief that Ireland's strategic oil needs can best be served by the presence of an operating oil refinery backed up with adequate stocks of both crude and product.  It can be taken that in the course of any negotiations I would ensure that the State's strategic interests are protected.</P>
    <P>The proposed project proposal includes a plan for the construction of an oil products pipeline from the Whitegate refinery to Dublin with a number of intermediate depots.  It would not be appropriate for me to make any statement in relation to this or other aspects of the proposal which are now under examination.</P>
    <P>I have seen the media report to the effect that consultants engaged by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) have submitted a favourable report to the NNPC on the proposals which were received by me on 2 May.  I am not in a position to comment on the consultants' report as it has not been forwarded to me.  It should be noted that such a report could not in any way comment upon the acceptability of the proposals to the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, give careful consideration to any proposal which is received for the use of the facilities at the Whiddy terminal or the Whitegate refinery.  It is open to any interested party to submit their proposal to my Department.</P>

      <P>This question has been asked of the Minister before but now that independent consultants are vetting this proposal, can he give us an assurance that this matter will be laid before the Dáil so that it can be debated and a decision taken on it before any commitment is entered into by the <Col N="968" /> Government?  Great concern has been expressed, as the Minister has rightly said, and it has been referred to many times in the media of late, that the strategic interests in this country could possibly be undermined by entering into this deal with the Nigerians.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to have the matter laid before the Dáil so that approval of the deal will be given before any commitment is entered into?  The Minister said that he is open to negotiations being entered into by other oil producing countries. Can that happen before this deal is concluded or does it have to await his decision on the final outcome of this Nigerian deal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Dáil Éireann making a decision on the matter, within the Constitution the Government are the Executive and the Executive make the decisions, as happened in the past when the previous administration made a decision in relation to the handing back by the previous owners of Whiddy to the State with a lump sum.  That was notified to the Dáil and the same procedure will apply in this case.  I am sure we will have a debate in the House.  I am open to that but it is a matter for the Whips.  The Dáil will be notified of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the second part of Deputy O'Malley's question is concerned, we are open to proposals from any other country. They do not have to await a decision on the Nigerian proposal that is before us.  There have been a number of visits to Whiddy and Whitegate by other interested groups.  Contacts have been made and discussions have been going on in relation to that matter.  At the request of the Nigerian Government there was a reserve put on the facilities, in view of the fact that they had to invest much money in preparing their project proposal. Mr. Lukman, their oil Minister, when writing to me last November at the time the original outline proposition was put to us, asked that in view of the cost that would be involved for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation a reserve would be put on it pending a final <Col N="969" /> submission of their proposal.  That timespan has now lapsed and it is open to other proposers to make any proposition they like.</P>

He nominated a company on his behalf to carry out the initial negotiations with the Government of the Republic.  The negotiations were carried out with a working group that I appointed in my Department of which the INPC were members.  The proposal now before the Government is the proposal from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.  There is no middle man involved.  The agents nominated by the Nigerian Government were the people who carried out the preparatory discussions and negotiations, together with the representatives of Citicorp.</P>

The Minister mentioned that it is the intention of the Government to ensure that the strategic interests of the country are protected.  Is he in a position to say if that means that Whitegate and Whiddy will remain in Irish State hands? Finally, the Minister referred to other people looking at the facilities.  Are there any outline or firm proposals before the Minister other than the Nigerian ones?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>I now have before me the firm proposal.  An outline proposition was put to the Government and discussions took place on it.  Around mid-March the discussions had reached a certain stage, at which time I wrote to the <Col N="970" /> promoters and agents and said that we had gone as far as we could on the outline proposal and that I wanted a firm proposal. That final proposal has been with me since 2 May.  I have indicated that a decision will be made within six to eight weeks of that and we are still on time-scale for that.  As far as the strategic aspect is concerned, obviously that is a matter that we will have to take into account in arriving at a decision as to the ownership of Whiddy and Whitegate.  As to whether any other proposals have been made, the answer is no.  Discussions are taking place with a number of other people but we have not received any firm proposal yet.</P>

      <P>The Forest Service of my Department are in communication with the Land Commission with a view to assessing the potential of remaining lands <Col N="972" /> held by that body for afforestation purposes. Indications are that very little, if any, of these lands will be found to be suitable for commercial planting.</P>
      <P>The areas now held by the Land Commission comprise for the most part small and widely scattered parcels the development, planting and management of which would be uneconomic in forestry terms. The better quality plots which would be required for deciduous trees are generally located in farming districts where there is very keen demand for agricultural land. However, the investigation is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the EC policy to set land aside, it is difficult to understand why there could be such demand for certain parcels of land given that the Land Commission have been trying for a number of years to dispose of an outstanding land bank.  As some of the areas the Minister spoke about are so small and scattered, how can he justify this in relation to the programme his Department are advancing for afforestation in disadvantaged areas, where areas beyond two hectares may be grant aided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the second part of the Deputy's question first.  The Deputy is probably not distinguishing clearly between private afforestation and State afforestation.  In relation to the western package, all the grants and incentives are primarily aimed at encouraging farmers and non-farmers who own land to afforest their land and in that instance grants are available for the size of land the Deputy mentioned.  That is not to be construed as meaning that the State or the new company could be involved in the acquisition of very small parcels of land for the same purpose.  We are very anxious to encourage the private development of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the earlier part of the Deputy's question, about 45,000 hectares held by the Land Commission at the moment are unallocated and only about 4,000 or 5,000 hectares are in good land areas.  Representing a rural constituency, I am a little surprised the Deputy is suggesting that there would not be interest <Col N="973" /> among farmers, particularly small farmers, in the reallocation of those lands for conventional farming purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said and taking into account that the EC have set aside policy for agricultural land, will the Minister consider that the Government have a responsibility to plant deciduous trees for which there is no commercial return for a private individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The set aside policy which has been agreed by the EC refers precisely to arable land and in the cereals base of the agricultural demesne.  I accept that we all have responsibility for maintaining and improving deciduous stock in the country.  In the Forest Service, I have increased the percentage of deciduous trees and we will try to maintain that trend.  We have also introduced new grants for the private sector, taking into account that this is a long-term operation, and many of these grants are being taken up by the private sector at the moment.</P>

      <P>As regards pricing, BGE are already offering an attractive pricing package to encourage householders to switch to natural gas.  Specific measures to reduce air pollution are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the success or failure of the smoke controlled areas will depend on the ability of people to pay for the fuel to reduce smoke emissions.  Apart from the Dublin Gas Company's promotion offers, has the Minister any plans to ensure that the price of gas to the consumer will be retained at a level which should be at least as low as that for the solid fuel they have been purchasing up to now?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be <Col N="975" /> assured that the price of BGE fuel is closely monitored by me.  The Deputy will be aware that BGE are already offering very attractive incentives for people to switch to natural gas.  For example, they are offering a 50-50 cash back for customers installing natural gas central heating for the first time.  This means the customer gets all his gas at half price for three years, which is a very substantial incentive.</P>

I understood the Minister to have said in this House four or five months ago that the Attorney General had completed his review, but we still appear to be in a position where we have not initiated any legal action ourselves.  Further, the Minister keeps saying we have already taken legal action by virtue of the fact that we are involved in this Cattenom case.  To what extent are we involved and how have we become involved?  As I understand it, all we have done is submit our views to the court.  The court need not take any notice of that.  The major issue, Sellafield plant which has been in production for the past 30 years spewing radioactive waste material into the Irish Sea, is not being addressed from a legal point of view.

      <P>I understand that, given the low level of general interest in foreign language services as evidenced by the market research carried by cable companies last year and the current limited channel capacity on the existing cable system, Cablelink decided against relaying the available foreign language channels for the time being.

I would like to see foreign language programmes carried for some of the spare hours available, even a couple of hours per day or every second day.  In the context of 1992 and our membership of the Community, <Col N="979" /> it is important that we have a greater knowledge of foreign languages.  This would be one way of doing that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is putting forward two recommendations for adoption at next month's Paris Commission Meeting. These recommendations are as follows:</P>
      <P>Recommendation proposed by Ireland concerning closure of Sellafield Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Plant</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Having regard to the objectives as stated in Article 1 of the Paris Convention, to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the sea from land-based sources;</P>
      <P>Having regard to the objectives of Article 5 to forestall and as appropriate eliminate pollution of the maritime area from land based sources by radioactive substances;</P>
      <P>Having regard to Article 13 in which Contracting Parties undertake to assist one another as appropriate to prevent incidents which may result in pollution from land-based sources;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Having regard to the frequency of incidents and shortcomings in the management and plant operation at the BNFL Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant which Ireland regards as rendering that plant unsafe and liable to cause incidents resulting in serious pollution of the Irish Sea;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the Report on Discharges from Nuclear Installations in 1986, Parcom 10/6/7-E shows that discharges from Sellafield are so much higher than those from nuclear power stations in the UK;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that present plans for improvements at Sellafield do not provide for the elimination of these discharges;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the UK Advisory Committee on Nuclear Installations Report for 1984-1986 noted that the reduction in routine discharges from Sellafield gives rise to increased levels of waste on the site and that there remains the possibility of an accident causing an uncontrolled release of radioactivity;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the levels of waste on site will continue to increase as long as the Sellafield Plant remains in operation;</P>
    <P>Ireland proposes the following recommendation to be adopted at the June 1988 meeting of the Paris Commission:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the BNFL Nuclear Reprocessing Plant at Sellafield should be closed and waste already on site should be stored and managed in a safe condition in order to prevent the occurrence of any incident which would result in serious pollution of the Irish Sea and any other maritime areas within the scope of the Paris Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Recommendation Proposed by Ireland on Compliance with Adopted Recommendations</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having regard to Article 11 of the Paris Convention which states that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the contracting Parties agree to set up progressively and to operate...a <Col N="981" /> permanent monitoring system allowing ...the assessment of the effectiveness of measures for the reduction of marine pollution from land-based sources&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>Having regard to Article 16 (b) of the Convention which states that it shall be the duty of the Commission</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to review generally...the effectiveness of the control measures being adopted...&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>Having regard to widespread public concern about the operation of reprocessing plants and the lack of public confidence in assurances given by the operators of such plants;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that Paris Commission Recommendations should be meticulously implemented and should be seen to be so implemented;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the need for earlier and more frequent reporting on compliance with recommendation 87/4 (and other similar recommendations) than that proposed by the Ad Hoc Working Group following its meeting in October 1987;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that, while Contracting Parties should be free to make presentations to the Commission from time to time regarding the level of compliance with Recommendation 87/4 etc., assessments by the Commission would be more acceptable to the Public;</P>
    <P>Ireland puts forward the following recommendation for adoption at the June 1988 Paris Commission Meeting:</P>
    <P>The Secretariat to the Paris Commission should report, at the 1989 meeting of the Commission, on the extent to which Contracting Parties are complying with Recommendation 87/4 which stated that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Contracting Parties declare their firm intention to apply the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate as soon as possible any pollution caused by radioactive discharges from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, into the marine environment&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> and other similar recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think both of these motions are selfexplanatory. As Deputies are no doubt aware, there was not much support in 1987 for our motion for the closure of Sellafield, but I do not intend to let the matter rest and I am hopeful that we will get more support this year.  The second recommendation is based on a belief that, if international bodies make recommendations, they should also take the necessary steps to ensure that the recommendations are put into effect.</P>

I have been through this before with the Minister and have told him that I see the Paris Commission being useful only from the point of view of airing our justifiable grievances in this whole area.  I see very little benefit coming to us from the point of view of actually achieving the desired result, which is the closing down of the Sellafield plant.</P>

I also believe we should use every available opportunity to highlight our legitimately held view that that plant is a menace as far as the Irish people are concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The last occasion on which my Department carried out a search and seize operation under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts was on 29 October 1987.  The operator of the station in question was prosecuted on 23 May 1988.</P>
      <P>All illegal broadcasting stations are liable to be seized and their operators prosecuted at any time.  However, the inadequacy of existing law to deal with the situation has limited the extent to which my Department can deal effectively with the problem.  Thus in present circumstances, and pending enactment of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, the primary criterion in determining whether the existing powers &mdash; inadequate as they may be &mdash; will be used relates to whether a particular station is causing interference to other licensed radio communications services, particularly emergency or safety of life services.  In the case of the station which was most recently raided, it had been causing persistent and continuous interference to BBC radio and ignored repeated warnings from my Department in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My position on the closing down of <Col N="984" /> illegal stations following the enactment of the new Radio and Television Bill and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill was set out in the closing speech on the Second Stage debate on those Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply on Second Stage debate on the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, this is a thorny problem and while we would wish to avoid any hiatus this may be the price which will have to be paid to get the legal stations on the air.  Following enactment of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, we will allow a certain period of time before it takes effect to enable the illegal stations to voluntarily get off the air and we will then proceed to implement the Bill in full.  In fact, the task may not be that difficult.  Since it will be an offence to advertise on a pirate radio station, we may find that the funds of many of these pirate stations will dry up and they will automatically be forced out of business.</P>

    <P>It is always difficult to predict with any accuracy the timing and level of profits which might be achieved by any organisation. In the case of Dublin Gas, profits are dependent on a number of factors. These include volume of gas sold, the costs incurred in delivering the product to the customer and the price obtained for the gas, a factor which depends to a large extent on oil prices.</P>
    <P>Present indications for gas sales are good.  On the costs front, Dublin Gas is now a more efficient and cost effective operation than in the past.  If the present trends continue I am confident that Dublin Gas will return to profit in the next few years.</P>

      <P>As you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, this is my second attempt to raise this question and I thank you for allowing me to raise it today. Yesterday this question seemed to be of great urgency and today it is obviously of even greater urgency.  Let me ask the Minister a number of supplementary questions.  Can the Minister tell us why she did not meet these people late last night or this morning?  It seems incredible that the meeting should be delayed until tomorrow.  Secondly, as the group certificate is due to begin on Friday with the leaving certificate and intermediate certificate due to commence next Wednesday, 8 June, I would like the Minister at this point to assure parents and the students that they will be able to sit their examinations irrespective of the outcome of the meeting to be held tomorrow. That is the all-important question for the 5,000 people concerned in those counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, let me tell the Deputy that the ICTU officials who requested the meeting had to make a visit somewhere else and the most convenient date for both the officials of the ICTU and the two Ministers involved was the date and time which has been fixed.  It was a matter of <Col N="988" /> mutual compatibility between ICTU and ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, there is no point in the two Ministers meeting to talk to themselves.  The meeting had to be arranged at a convenient time and the officials of the ICTU wanted their delegation to be composed in a particular way and this took some working out.  We are meeting them tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m.  That answers the first part of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question, let me say that all concerned, the unions, my Department, the parents, with whom I have had informal discussions, and I are determined that the students will be brought to their examinations. I hope following our meeting tomorrow satisfactory arrangements will issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we all hope that the outcome of the meeting tomorrow will be satisfactory.  What I am seeking now from the Minister is an assurance that those students will be able to sit their examinations and I would like her to tell us whether she has a plan for getting those students to their public examinations?  I do not want the details of such a plan; all I want to know is whether there is a plan to get those students to their examinations. I would also like to know if the <Col N="989" /> Minister will undertake to make alternative arrangements should any student not be able to reach the examination centre, for them to take that subject, perhaps in a different form, as quickly as possible so that they will not be disadvantaged in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions which I wish to ask of the Minister.  First, has she any plan for getting students to their examinations and, secondly, will she arrange alternative examinations?  I would also like her to tell us whether she knew in advance that these redundancy notices were going to be issued to 93 workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy, I should say that of course the students of the country will be sitting their examinations and there will not be any need whatsoever for alternative examinations or venues.  As I said, all concerned, unions and ourselves, are very anxious that this matter be resolved. I would hope that services will continue to operate as heretofore and that the meetings to be held tomorrow will be productive.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's further question, I should say that the Minister for Finance has received a communication from the chairman of CIE stating that his company are co-operating fully in experimentation with pilot projects but that, from time to time.  He also refers to the replacement of the bus scheme.  A followon, is that CIE's arrangements with the Department of Education always have envisaged that their arrangments with us and ours with them would continue until the end of the examination period.  I take great heart from the contents of the letter from the chairman of CIE.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the majority of the 23 drivers involved in County Sligo will not be in a position to tender because of the cost of the buses for the new ones?  Is she also aware that, because of the years of service they have given in this capacity, many of them are of advancing age and will not be able to obtain alternative employment?  Will the Minister bear this consideration in mind in her talks with ICTU?  Will she also consider giving priority to these people in so far as working out some mechanism whereby they would be given at least first choice on these runs?</P>

I rise to voice my objection yet again to the way in which this House is being treated as a rubber stamp.  There is a very important Bill before us.  It is being attempted to squeeze all the amendments in before midnight.  Now we are being faced with the proposition that, in the first slot alone, between 5 and 5.30 p.m. we shall have to deal with 40 amendments.  Since we are dealing with the establishment of the independent commission, their functions and membership it is totally unsatisfactory.  I contend a lot more time should have been allowed for the debate on this Bill.  I wanted to record my objection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `the Commission' means the Commission established by Part II;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All of the amendments in question are related to or consequential on the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 proposes the insertion of a new section.  It will be section 3 of the revised version of the Bill, if agreed, which provides for the establishment of an independent radio and television commission as a full body corporate. It will be taken in conjunction with amendment No. 59 which deals with the insertion of the schedule at the end of the Bill which sets out the detail of the constitution of the commission.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the commission, as an independent Authority, meets the primary concern voiced by Opposition Deputies during Second Stage debate.  Its constitution is precisely similar to that proposed for the Local Radio Commission in the previous Government's Local Radio Bill, 1985.  In particular it meets the concern voiced by some Deputies, particularly by Deputy Richard Bruton, in that it must be comprised of people who have expertise or shown capacity in media and commercial affairs, radio communications, engineering, administration or social, cultural, educational or community activities &mdash; exactly similar to the 1985 Bill.  The membership can only be dismissed for stated reasons and then only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is similar to the 1985 Bill and the Broadcasting Authority Acts.  Apart from these significant features, the provisions include all of the conventional and routine legislative requirements involved in setting up a separate independent State authority.  These include details concerning the appointment of the members of the commission; the conditions of service applying to the chairman of the commission; the remuneration and terms of office of members of the commission; disclosure by member of commission of interest in proposed contract; seal of the commission; meetings and procedure of <Col N="1034" /> the commission; staff of the commission; conditions of service, remuneration of staff; membership of Houses of the Oireachtas or European Parliament and superannuation of staff of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Schedule also contains provisions relating to the duty of the commission in respect of its revenue, borrowings, investment, accounts and audits and annual report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments have been proposed by the Opposition Deputies and I will deal generally with these.  Deputy O'Malley has proposed amendment No. 17 which deals with the submission of annual reports by the commission. I believe that this matter is satisfactorily dealt with in section 17 of the proposed Schedule to the Bill where a standard provision relating to the submission of an annual report by a State-sponsored body is provided for.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to the Schedule, I am satisfied that the standard arrangements under which the Government will appoint the members of the proposed commission are quite satisfactory &mdash; bearing in mind in particular the criteria which the Government must use as specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 to the Schedule proposes the addition of the criterion of having expertise in trade union affairs to the general list of criteria which persons to be appointed to the commission must have.  The existing criteria which include administration or social, cultural, etc, activities adequately cover the matter. Nevertheless I can accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 proposes to increase the minimum number of members who make up a quorum from three to five.  The quorum which I have proposed is similar to that which applies to the RTE Authority.  It must be borne in mind that the commission can fix a higher quorum and we should leave them as much flexibility as possible.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 to the Schedule is not acceptable.  The normal industrial relations arrangements and terms and <Col N="1035" /> conditions of employment will apply to the staff of the commission.  I would stress, incidentally, that my hope is that the commission will be a very modest organisation with a relatively small number of staff.  Otherwise, they could become a total burden on the radio and television services we want to establish, not to mention the State.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification.  It seems to me that amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14 refer more correctly to the amendments being discussed at present by the Minister, even though they are further down on the schedule.  May I address that subject, that is, the role of the commission?</P>

      <P>In the Schedule the Minister has established a very broad set of expertise.  Is it normal to establish so broad a set of expertise?  A lot of the expertise required does not seem to refer to the task we are asking the commission to do.  Why did the Minister decide to throw the net so wide in defining expertise for this purpose?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was conscious of the concern expressed by Deputies on Second Stage about the fact that there was no commission involved in the decision in relation to who should get contracts or licences.  In bowing to the genuine concern expressed by Deputies and accepting the fact that, with the addition of television, a commission could be a more viable proposition, I took the 1985 Bill that was introduced by the previous Administration and it is in that context that the net is as wide as it <Col N="1036" /> is here.  It is exactly the same as in the 1985 Bill.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to clarify it.  My understanding is that in the first group we will deal with amendments Nos. 4, 8, 17 and 59 together with amendments to amendment No 59, Nos 1 to 5.  We will deal with what refers to the establishment of the commission.  Having dealt with that we will then move on in the same group to consideration of the other amendments listed in the wider document which the Deputy has received, which refer to the functions of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to understand where I am.  One of those amendments, the first one down in my name, is about the requirement to have a report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year in which the commission will be required to give particulars in relation to the operation of the various stations set up, both the radio stations and the single television station. This is very important in that it would give the Houses of the Oireachtas an opportunity to understand a number of things in relation to how these stations have performed during the course of each year.</P>
      <P>The powers and nature of the broadcasting carried out under the provisions of the Act should be established because some of these stations might well be awarded licences but may not be fully utilising the frequency space made available to them and other private interests could use that frequency if it were made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> The area of complaints is very important. The annual report should contain information with regard to the number and the nature of complaints received arising from material broadcast during the course of a year.  It is also important that we should have information from the contractor relating to the hours in which people viewed or listened to the service being given.  If it is an inferior service and people are not listening to it, we will effectively be tying up a network or a wavelength that could otherwise be used by somebody else in the community who would like to fill that slot and provide that service.  The other points I listed in my amendment No. 17.  I put it to the Minister that it is necessary that such a report should, on an annual basis, on a given date, be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we can examine these matters fully and ensure that any corrective action needed is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken me some few minutes to sort out exactly where we are and what we are doing.  I thank the Minister for accepting the gist of amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 59 which includes the insertion of &ldquo;expertise in trade union affairs&rdquo; in that section on the appointment of the membership of the commission.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to amendment No. 1 and to amendment No. 4 in the name of myself and other Workers' Party Deputies.  On re-reading amendment No. 1, I see that it is not worded very well, but it was intended to ensure that the appointment of the membership of the commission would be brought before the Houses and would be agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, in much the same way as the situation whereby if the Minister wants to sack a member of the commission, or indeed the whole commission, he must bring it before the House by way of a motion. Having looked at it again I think that amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan is more appropriately worded and is seeking to do the same thing as I was proposing to do in amendment No. 1.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to <Col N="1038" /> accept that amendment.  I am keen that this should be done because as we know over many years there has been concern about the appointment directly by Government of bodies of various kinds. We went to great trouble here during the previous Administration to establish a system of appointment for the Planning Appeals Board because of concerns expressed in regard to that.</P>
      <P>The commission we are talking about establishing here is of equal importance. They will be dealing with a very sensitive area of communications.  I have no doubt that the Minister will seek out the most appropriately qualified people in line with the terms outlined in the Bill, but it would be important that the House would have some say on the matter, if for no other reason than to clear the air and allow Deputies and parties in the House to make their views known and support, or otherwise, the commission as appointed.  It would certainly avoid a situation at a later stage where accusations of one kind or another could be thrown about willy-nilly without any regard to facts.  I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan, if he will not accept amendment No. 1 which is not that well worded.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, the proposal is that the commission would have a membership of not less than seven and not more than ten.  If the Minister were to go for the lower figure of seven and we were to accept the position whereby a quorum for any matter being decided by the commission could be as low as three, one could, in effect, have decisions being made by two members out of seven or even out of ten, and presumably it could be any matter coming before the commission for decision.  I do not believe that would be entirely satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from involvement on committees of various kinds, inside and outside this House, that when decisions are made by minorities on committees because they happen to be present it leads to all kinds of difficulties and dissatisfaction among the members who were not present and also leads to rows <Col N="1039" /> of one kind or another among people who feel they have been badly done by and that the decisions were not really democratic because the majority of the members of the commission were not present.  I am proposing there that the quorum should not be less than five.  I think that is a reasonable figure.  I would be concerned that a majority decision could be made by two people in view of the fact that the quorum is fixed at three, presumably until such time as a quorum is decided by the commission itself.  We should oblige them to ensure that the quorum is not less than five.  I will leave it at that for the moment and see what the Minister has to say on it.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 59 proposes:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1. (1), after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in the second line, to insert &ldquo;subject to the approval of a resolution by the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister having gone so far in setting up the commission and acceding to the wishes of everybody in this House, should ensure the impartiality and the future role of the Government in broadcasting by accepting this amendment.  It was a wise decision on his part to set up this commission but this would be an added safeguard.  I would go along with Deputy De Rossa regarding the number of people to constitute a quorum.  That would be a worthwhile safeguard.  Likewise, I would welcome the inclusion of trade union people with the expertise to ensure that there is an input from one of the social partners.  That is desirable and I support Deputy De Rossa on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy O'Malley, I believe that the matter is satisfactorily dealt with in section 17 of the proposed Schedule to the Bill where the standard provision relating to the provision of an annual report by a State-sponsored body is provided for.  Let me read for the House the section as it will appear in the amended Bill.  Before I go any further, I am not <Col N="1040" /> sure if other Members who are debating this have a copy of the document which I sent out, the Bill as it will stand if all of the amendments I put forward are accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We will just send across a couple of copies of it.  They were circulated before but it probably will help us all during the debate for the rest of the day.  It provides that the commission shall in each year and on such date as the Minister may direct make a report to the Minister of its proceedings under this Act during the preceding year and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas; that whenever the Minister so directs the annual report shall also include information on such particular aspects of the commission's proceedings under this Act as the Minister may specify and the commission shall submit to the Minister such information regarding the performance of its functions as the Minister may from time to time require.</P>
      <P>As well as that it would obviously be in the interests of the commission to submit as much information as possible without going into the minutiae of the operations of each individual station.  I do not disagree that there should be as much information as possible coming forward, but the intention is that this will be a small commission with small numbers of staff.  We do not want to set up a bureaucratic monster that will cost the contractors, the radio or television operators, staggering sums of money.  We do not want it to become a burden on the taxpayer.  If Deputy O'Malley would be satisfied with the annual report and information to the Minister, which is the standard document as laid down for all State bodies, there is provision for a Minister to specify that particular information is needed on particular stations in particular areas.  This can be done under amendment No. 2 and would meet many of the points that Deputy O'Malley is concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> The points put forward by Deputy De Rossa are covered by No. 3 of the Schedule proposing the addition of expertise in trade union affairs to the general list of criteria which persons appointed to the commission must have.  I believe that the existing criteria, including administration or social and cultural activities, adequately cover the matter but I am prepared to accept the amendment as proposed.  In common with other amendments, I would have to ask the Deputy to leave it until I come back on Report Stage and I will include it then.  That is what I have been requested to do by the staff of the House.  It will appear on Report Stage but I accept it.  It is a legitimate point.  I think it was covered but it is as well to specify it and I accept it.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 as proposed by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Sullivan regarding impartiality of the commission, we are fully convinced that the criteria as laid down and that the standard arrangements under which Governments appoint members of the proposed commission are broad enough and in particular you must bear in mind the criteria which the Government must use as specified in the Bill, including now trade union officials.  The criteria are broad and are as they were in the 1985 Act which I have now incorporated into this Bill, and I do not believe it will be necessary to change the particular procedure which has been followed since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the quorum aspect, which was mentioned by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Sullivan, I have no strong view on it, that if there are ten five would be a suitable number.  I believe though that it should be left to the commission themselves to fix the way they will operate. They can fix a higher quorum and I think it would be as well to leave them flexibility as to how they will operate.  They might decide that they would require a quorum of five for particular types of decisions and for minor items, where they want to do an incorporeal type of thing, that it would be three.  I do not know how they will operate but it is up to <Col N="1042" /> the commission to decide.  They can be flexible.  I can see the merit of the point made by Deputy De Rossa and by Deputy O'Sullivan in relation to major decisions being made by only three people.  I do not think that would be good or right but I do not anticipate that any responsible commission would behave in that way.  They will set their own procedures for their own behaviour.  What I have down here is a copy of the 1985 Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the independence of the commission are there circumstances in which they might not be allowed by the Minister to increase their licence fees, which are their income, and thereby would be unable to perform their functions?  I know the Minister himself would never have such intention but is there any conceivable legal possibility within the terms of the Bill as framed at present that that could happen, that the Minister could prevent them funding themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is strictly a matter for the commission to decide on the levies they will impose on each individual radio or television station.  That is totally a matter for the commission.  There is a provision in the Bill that they must be self-financing.  There is no provision in the Bill for interference by the Minister in their financial arrangements.  It is their responsibility.  At the time when the inital proposals were put forward and we debated them on Second Stage, it was my intention, at that stage, to make the stations as viable as possible and without over-burdening them with great overheads, to have a figure of around 3 per cent as a levy on their advertising rate. That was my own view but the commission are totally independent and can decide what they like in relation to it with no interference from me or from the Minister of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour the point because I know there are perhaps more important aspects to be discussed.  In relation to the quorum on amendment No. 4, the Bill as it stands <Col N="1043" /> indicates that the quorum shall be not less than three and until it is so fixed shall be three.  Every question at a meeting of the commission shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question, and in the case of an equal division of votes the Chairman of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote.  Section 7 (5) clearly states that every question at a meeting of the commission shall be determined by a majority of the votes, and the Bill sets a minimum of three as the absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>Taking the point which the Minister makes that the commission may well set a higher figure, there is no legal obligation on them to do so.  I would prefer to see a higher minimum figure included. We all have the experience of being on a committee and when people do not turn up and important decisions have to be made we tend to want to push the business through, with the best of intentions. We then have to face all the kick back, noise and rows that follow from that because people whose proposals may have been brought before the board and not decided, perhaps for very good reason, may feel that adequate consideration had not been given by all the members of the commission.  For that reason I urge the Minister, in the interests of at least being seen to be fair as well as actually being fair, that the minimum figure should be raised to five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to agreeing the commission by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Bill ensures that where a Minister wants to sack a member of the commission he must bring a motion before the House to do that.  Obviously where a Government has appointed a commissioner and then wants to sack that commissioner it would be for a very serious reason.  Equally, in order to establish the absolute fairness of the appointment, to show that not only has the commission got the support of the Government in terms of its Cabinet functions and responsibilities with regard to this Bill but that it would have the support of the House as well, it is a reasonable request to have in the Bill that <Col N="1044" /> where the commission is appointed by the Government that it would come into effect when agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not intend to proceed further on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister for some clarification arising out of the points I raised on amendment No. 17 which relates to the annual report we discussed earlier.  I accept, to a very large extent, what the Minister has said that the reporting system which he has outlined is probably adequate, although I would like to see it cater in a fuller way for the points which I have set out in my amendment. The main query I have in this is that under the system catered for in the Bill at present is it possible that an annual report would come out three years late? The purpose of my amendment is that, say, on 1 March each year that there would be laid before the House a report dealing with the preceding calendar year. It is important that the reports should be up to date because what I have outlined in my amendment were aspects that could need attention on a fairly urgent basis.  I do not see that there would be much point in receiving a report if it is two or three years out of date.  I am not sure from what is catered for in the Bill at present whether there is an absolute requirement to have the report laid before the House by a certain date after the preceding year and the year in which the report is being made.  I think that is an important aspect and I hope the Minister will be able to accommodate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the quorum question put forward by Deputy De Rossa is concerned I have no strong views on it.  The only reason I was leaving it as it is was that I wanted to leave as much flexibility as I could in the operation of the commission to the commission rather than having the Government laying down every minute detail of their operation. Let me look at it again and we will be back on Report State and I will talk about it then.  In regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I have said everything I can say. It would be a total change around in <Col N="1045" /> the situations.  The RTE Authority are appointed in the way it is proposed here and so are all other semi-State bodies. The importance of the proposal to allow only Dáil Éireann to sack is to make sure that there cannot be governmental interference in the operations of the commission. If there is Government interference or any attempt at governmental interference, that can be rejected by the commission, and if the Government of the day wanted to sack the commission because the commission would not do what the Government wanted them to do, either directly or indirectly, the Government just cannot fire them; they have to come to the Dáil to do it.  That is a very important safeguard for the independence and impartiality of the commission and I think it meets points one and two about impartiality, which is what the Members want to see.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy O'Malley's point on up-to-date reports, I share his view about the need for all semi-State bodies to bring forward their reports immediately after the year of operation.  The Government are pressing all the State agencies to bring forward their annual reports immediately after the end of their financial year. However, what Deputy O'Malley is trying to achieve really is that if there is a station in an area not meeting the conditions of the contract they get, they would be subject to a form of discipline and investigation by the commission, but we should not have to wait even for the annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley talked about the urgency of the annual report.  I believe it should be even more urgent than that and that is why I have included here powers of investigation.  If there is a complaint or even if there is not a complaint they can go down to a station and carry out investigations to see that the contractor is operating on the basis of the contract he has been given and which has been agreed between the commission and himself as contractor.  The day-to-day operations should go on without interfering in each individual station but if there is obvious non-compliance with the contract you should not have to wait for an <Col N="1046" /> annual report.  You should be in there investigating it straight away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, how will one know the station is not necessarily operating in the way it should operate?  Are we to be monitoring the operations of these stations on a continuous basis?  We are both trying to achieve the same thing, to ensure that if there is any problem out there it be addressed sooner rather than later.  That is why I was looking for the publication, within a specific period in the early part of the year, of a report on the proceedings on the year's activities.  Otherwise it could well be that you would not be aware of the problems existing in some of these stations and consequently would not be able to take the remedial action necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The very nature of this Bill is about listenership and viewership. We are talking about somebody getting a contract to run a radio service in a particular part of the country.  When the contract is agreed between the commission and the contractor it will be available to general public examination.  I have no doubt that if a contractor was not meeting the criteria laid down and the details of the contract as agreed between the commission and himself the listenership would be complaining about the quality of the service in the station and would bring that to the notice of the commission and the commission would operate.  The commission when up and running, while they will have fairly minimal staff &mdash; I hope they will have minimal staff &mdash; will ensure that spot checks are carried out to see if there is any flagrant violation of the contract.  I have no doubt that the listeners themselves through their complaints will bring it to the attention of the commission and in that way we will have interaction between the listener <Col N="1047" /> and the commission to bring about a position where the radio operator will meet his contract obligations.</P>

      <P>I have a very brief comment on amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to 59.  I understand the concern of Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Sullivan about this, but it seems that having the requirement of Dáil approval could at the end of the day politicise these appointments instead of depoliticising them and I would be afraid that people might not be willing to run the gauntlet of a sort of Dáil inquisition if that sort of procedure was there. I have some misgivings about the sort of procedure although I understand the motive for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Bruton suggesting that these appointments are not political at the moment?  Let us have it out in the open here.  We are around long enough to realise there is a political flavour to most of these appointments. Bringing them to the Oireachtas for approval I think is the proper way of doing it.  If we are to be realistic and to be honest, we will see that most of these appointments are political appointments. We should recognise that.  It is naive to think otherwise.</P>

      <P>The point Deputy Bruton made is excellent.  The Government's intention is that we will have a commission of excellence here.  One of my concerns about the point mentioned is when the proposed membership would go before the Dáil and could be discussed here that could discourage people of excellence from allowing their names to go forward to serve on the commission. I do not want that to happen.  I accept the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan that on occasions every Government have made appointments in relation to people of a particular political persuasion, including the Government that Deputy O'Sullivan has served in and the one I have served in.  However, I believe in recent years there has been an attempt to depoliticise these appointments and as <Col N="1048" /> far as possible to appoint people with the best qualifications for the jobs.  That has been the practice and I assure the Deputy and the House that that practice will be followed in relation to this.</P>

      <P>Let me make a comment arising from what the Minister has been saying.  Obviously, all of us in this House accept that it is a major step forward that we have a commission.  I do not want to become too hung up on the composition of that commission in the sense that they could be influenced by politicians in any way, but arising out of the fears and reservations Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Sullivan have expressed let me ask if there is a system whereby part of the numbers who would comprise this commission could be nominated by bodies who would be recognised as having expertise and experience in the whole broadcasting area?  Maybe a certain percentage of the commission should first of all be nominated by some of these nominating bodies and in turn those nominees would be approved by the Minister.  That might do two things; it might ensure that the interests that should be represented on the board are being represented on it and, secondly, that the people who coming through as a result of having been nominated by these nominating bodies would not be leaving themselves open to the accusation of being political appointees.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the people involved in this will be.  Standard procedure has been followed since the foundation of the State in appointment to boards, be it the ESB, Bord na Móna or any board &mdash; there are quite a number of them under my Department.  The criteria will be laid out in the Bill as to the type of individual and the expertise of the individual.  I have extended that expertise now to include trade unions and the intention is to try as far as possible to fit in the various criteria with individuals.</P>

    <P>The Minister has taken on board the points I made in my amendment and accepts my reasons for tabling it.  I would prefer to see a requirement on the Commission to lay a report before the House on a specified date each year because I have a fear that if two or three years elapsed before a report is produced the action that may be needed to be taken in connection with it will not be possible. However, the Minister has assured me that the new system will not allow that to happen.  I hope that will be the case and for that reason I will not press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete line 20.</P>
      <P>All the amendments in question, Nos. 5, 6, 9 and amendments to amendment No. 9 &mdash; Nos. 1 to 7 &mdash; and amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14, 20, 28, 29, 31, 33, 39, 40, 41, 44, 46, 47 and 48, are related in one fashion or another to the functions it is proposed to give to the commission. Some are of a purely consequential nature &mdash; for example changing references to &ldquo;licensees&rdquo; to &ldquo;sound broadcasting contractor&rdquo; and &ldquo;licences&rdquo; to &ldquo;contracts&rdquo;.  Others are obviously of more substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 sets out the primary function of the commission as that of <Col N="1062" /> arranging for the provision of sound broadcasting services and a television programme service additional to services provided by RTE.  A series of subsections follows outlining the powers and duties of the commission in the fulfilment of its primary function.  These provisions, I might say, are essentially similar to those proposed in the Local Radio Bill, 1985 as put forward by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps explain the rationale that lies behind the arrangments proposed for the commission and its relationship on the one hand with the Minister and on the other with those who will be providing the new radio services, that is the sound broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The original Bill envisaged a straightforward licensing arrangement between the Minister and broadcasting.  The fundamental reason for having any form of licensing for broadcasting services stems from the frequency management obligations of the State at national and international level.  If it was not for the physical constraint of limited radio frequency availability there would be no reason for the State to be involved in licensing radio, any more than it has an involvement in the print media.</P>
    <P>The licensing function &mdash; which is the frequency management function &mdash; still remains the responsibility of the Minister. It is not a function that could simply be delegated to the commission because first of all its origins go back to the various telegraph Acts of the last century which vested a monopoly in the Minister, and his antecedents, in the transmission of messages and to the wireless telegraphy Acts which vest the licensing function in the Minister.  Secondly, the whole radio communications area is governed by numerous international conventions and treaties for which Governments are answerable.  Thirdly, broadcasting frequencies are just one small element of the radio frequency spectrum and there is an inter-relationship between the way broadcast frequencies and other areas of the spectrum, such as aeronautical and mobile communications, are managed. It is essential, therefore, that frequency <Col N="1063" /> management be vested in one body alone.  In the vast majority of countries in the world this function is vested in central Government.  The only practical alternative would be the American model of vesting responsibility for managing the whole of the spectrum in one body, the Federal Communications Commission in their case.  To achieve that here one would effectively have to convert the Department of Communications into a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill, the frequency management function of issuing licences remains with the Minister.  A different form of relationship must then be established between the commission and radio station operators.  The relationship adopted is a contractual one.  The commission enters into contracts with persons to provide the broadcast service. The Minister then issues a licence to the commission covering the frequency to be used and other technical parameters and the benefits of this licence are conveyed under subsection 5 of amendment 9 to the broadcasting contractor through his contract with the commission.  This ensures, <i>inter alia,</i> that the broadcaster will not be in conflict with the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 which requires every person who is in possession of and who maintains and operates transmitting equipment, to have a licence.</P>
    <P>The various other provisions of amendment No. 9 are those which are deemed appropriate to include under the functions of the commission and are similar to those in the Local Radio Bill, 1985. They include specifically:</P>
    <P>a duty on the Commission to ensure that programme contractors comply with the provisions of the Act;</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was quite emphatic in his demands that the regulatory authority should have such a duty and I concede that&mdash;</P>
    <P>a power to require programme contractors to make recordings of their programmes and make such recordings <Col N="1064" /> available to the Commission &mdash; subsection (8);</P>
    <P>a power to require contractors to arrange for the provision of services on behalf of Ministers of the Government &mdash; there is a similar provision in the Broadcasting Authority Acts relating to RTE and in the Local Radio Bill, 1985 and is used to allow Ministers from time to time make public announcements of national importance;</P>
    <P>a new provision has been requested requiring contractors to co-operate with the gardaí, local authorities and health boards in the dissemination of information to the public in the event of major emergencies;</P>
    <P>a power enabling the Minister to suspend licences and operate stations directly or have them operate in accordance with directions issued by him in the event of any emergency declared under section 10 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  A similar provision is written into all forms of licences issued by the Minister and is intended to be used to enable the Government to take control of all forms of radio communications in the event of a major emergency such as war situation or other major civil disorder. The power in question has never been used in the past.</P>
    <P>One of the major new elements of transparency introduced into the Bill is a subsection (6) which allows any member of the public to inspect every licence issued to the commission in respect of every broadcast service established.  There is a further provision later on in the Bill allowing any member of the public to inspect and purchase a copy of any contract between the commission and programme contractor.</P>
    <P>A series of amendments, Nos. 1 to 7, have been proposed to my amendment No. 9.  Two of these amendments, Nos. 1 and 5, have the same substance, advocating a particular developmental or promotional role for the commission in <Col N="1065" /> relation to community broadcasting or community initiatives in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>On this question I considered that the Deputies concerns on the community dimension are adequately covered by new criterion (h) in the selection process in section 6.  It is important that the commission is given as much flexibility as possible to develop its own policies in relation to all potential forms of radio broadcasting and that it should not be constrained into focusing in on one particular framework.  As to the suggestion that the commission should have a role in relation to the management structure of radio stations, we think that this would be quite inappropriate.  Indeed it would be quite impractical for the commission to seek to have such detailed control.  I would furthermore add that I have had meetings last Thursday with the National Association of Community Broadcasters who have expressed themselves fully satisfied with the arrangements, I am making, regarding the community dimension of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 to Government amendment No. 9 propose to put the reference to television into the plural i.e. that the commission shall have the task of providing for television services as against a single television service as the Government have proposed.  I must say that in principle the Deputies are pushing an open door with me in that I fully support the idea of more competition and more choice.  However, I would ask the Deputies not to press these amendments at this time because I believe they will have consequential effects, if they prove meaningful, on the television element of the Bill which I need more time to examine.  If the Deputies agree, I will see if I can accommodate their wishes when we come back to the matter at Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 to Government amendment No. 9 proposes that RTE should be able to tender for franchises under this legislation.  The whole objective of this legislation is to provide for non-RTE broadcast services.  The RTE Authority and management were <Col N="1066" /> extremely unhappy about the arrangements proposed in the 1985 Bill because they felt it was invidious that they should have to be answerable to the Local Radio Commission proposed under that Bill. While RTE certainly argued that they should be allowed compete in the local radio scene, they felt that they should do so under their own broadcasting legislation. The position is, therefore, that any involvement in local radio that might be contemplated for RTE can be dealt with under their own legislation.</P>
    <P>I should mention that there is nothing in this Bill which prevents potential contractors from entering into commercial arrangements to acquire or use some of RTE's programming as part of their schedules.  We know from the NACB, for instance, that they recognise that some of the community stations which they plan would not be able to generate daylong programming every day of the week, particularly in the initial stages.  They would hope, therefore, to be able to do a deal with RTE whereby they would carry some RTE programmes during unused capacity.  That said, however, it will be important that all potential stations generate sufficient programming of their own and create their own identity if they are to stand a reasonable prospect of winning a franchise.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 to Government amendment No. 9 seeks to impose an obligation on the commission to require broadcasting services to carry party political broadcasts.  However, this matter is dealt with in precisely the same way it is dealt with in RTE's legislation i.e. under the programming obligations which we will come to later in the Bill and I, therefore, see no need for this particular amendment.</P>
    <P>We come now to amendment No. 6 to Government amendment No. 9.  This amendment seeks to delegate to the commission responsibility for licensing multichannel television distribution systems. This amendment is quite out of court. The function of licensing these systems is primarily a frequency management function and I have already gone to great pains to spell out why any separate <Col N="1067" /> element of that function &mdash; be it management of broadcasting frequencies or frequencies which may be usable for television retransmission purposes &mdash; cannot simply be devolved to a separate authority. There is a substantive inter-relationship between the way each segment of the radio frequency spectrum is managed.  You cannot, for example, simply devolve to that commission responsibility for deciding what part of the frequency spectrum is to be used for this or that purpose because what they decide may be firstly in contravention of the international treaties which govern the use of the spectrum and secondly may impinge upon a whole range of other radio-communications services.</P>
    <P>Apart from these very real and practical considerations, which, on the basis of the proposal put forward by the Deputy, I am afraid he does not understand, we have no wish to be imposing the burden of a totally new and different area of responsibility in the commission. It will have more than enough on its hands dealing with the establishment of the proposed new radio services and television service and monitoring their operation.</P>
    <P>I know of course that what lies behind the Deputy's proposal is the question of MMDS and I have no wish to be diverted into a discussion on that question.  I have endeavoured to explain the reasons &mdash; which are primarily frequency management reasons &mdash; which lie behind my decision in this area on other suitable occasions, reasons incidentally which my predecessor and the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Mitchell, clearly understood when he too decided that MMDS was the correct solution for providing multichannel choice in the non-cabled areas of this country.</P>
    <P>There are three amendments of substance which are relevant to amendment No 9, namely amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14.  I cannot accept amendment No. 13 because its whole ethos conflicts with what we are endeavouring to do here.  For instance, it provides that the commission itself will act as a broadcaster and will <Col N="1068" /> instal all of the transmission facilities for the proposed new stations.  This would require, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Exchequer would have to provide advances to enable it to undertake these responsibilities as well, indeed, as a much larger organisation than we envisage.  The commission which we are proposing will not be a broadcaster; it will be a regulator.</P>
    <P>Likewise amendment No. 12 is inappropriate and unnecessary because the substance of what it seeks to achieve is covered elsewhere in the Bill.  First of all the commission have a duty to ensure that the terms of this legislation are complied with.  For example, the element proposed in paragraph 2 (a) of amendment No. 12 &mdash; which provides that the role of the commission will be to ensure a proper balance of education, information and entertainment in programming, covering a wide range of interests etc. &mdash; is effectively covered by the requirement on the commission to provide for the establishment of a diversity of services catering for a wide range of tastes, including minority interest, by the fact that it must have regard to the range, type and quality of programmes proposed in selecting franchises, by the requirements to carry news and current affairs programming, all of which constitute in practical terms the informational, educational and entertainment aspect of broadcasting.  Likewise the suggestion that the commission should have a role in opening up opportunities for Irish talent is inappropriate. These opportunities will be created by the new radio services, not by the commission. The radio stations themselves will have been selected on the basis of criteria which embody the objectives of the Deputy's amendments.  In this regard I will be able to accept the principle of a proposal which the Deputy makes in this area when we come to dealing with the criteria for selecting broadcasters.</P>
    <P>Precisely the same remarks apply to amendment No. 14.</P>
    <P>I must again stress that we must be flexible and pragmatic in this legislation and avoid unnecessary frills and aspirational rhetoric which are adequately and in a practical way embraced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Finally, a series of other consequential amendments are embraced in a discussion in this area.  They are amendments Nos. 21, 29, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 42, 45, 47 and 48 and are purely editorial changes converting references to &ldquo;licences&rdquo; and &ldquo;licensees&rdquo; to &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; and &ldquo;contractors&rdquo;.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are consequential, inserted into the interpretations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's point that to some extent the items mentioned in amendment No. 12 specifying the role of the commission are met in various places within the text of the Bill.  It is unusual and out of tenor with the legislation establishing other State boards not to set out what it is hoped this commission will achieve.  The Minister knows there are aspirational texts in the ESB Bill about the provision of a certain type of service, the efficiency of their operation and so on.  It is unusual for the Dáil to establish a commission and when dealing with its function to refer only to the mechanics of issuing contracts.  It would seem more appropriate to express the hope that the broadcasting will be balanced in context, will open up opportunities for Irish talent, support community initiative in getting into broadcasting and uphold democratic values, particularly freedom of speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Dáil should make a concise statement as to what exactly it hopes the commission will achieve.  The idea of freedom of speech is cited only in respect of television and not in respect of radio.  The opportunities for Irish talent are cited only in respect of television and not of radio, as the Minister has set it out.  The question of supporting community initiatives is simply one of the criteria that the Minister would have them refer to.  Initially the NACB &mdash; I do not know what they think now because I am not privy to the Minister's discussions with them &mdash; felt that the commission could go a long way towards supporting various community and co-op ideas, by providing information, by perhaps holding meetings where they <Col N="1070" /> would provide advice to potential community applicants.  This would not be high cost activity but nonetheless would extend somewhat beyond simply having regard to the desirability of community stations when allocating contracts.  Similarly, the issue of a balance is the most fundamental thing and it is fair to say that it is accommodated in the Bill.  That is the background to the amendment and is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 to the Minister's amendment No. 9 deals with community involvement in broadcasting.  The Minister said that it would be appropriate that the commission would get involved in the management control of the station.  What I had in mind was similar to what has been expressed in other areas &mdash; the expertise of the board, particularly in relation to community stations.  The board could recognise a certain co-op structure that they would feel was appropriate for community stations.  I had no more in mind than that they would satisfy themselves that there was a reasonable charter or divide-out of the proceeds and the various things that are involved in having a satisfactory co-op.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 2 and 4 to amendment No. 9, I am glad the Minister is willing to consider these on Report Stage.  As I have said this morning, the technology is pointing in the direction of a separate channel serving Dublin &mdash; which has a huge cable service &mdash; Cork and other areas if the system is developed to serve them.  The opportunity should be kept open for more than one company to serve this area and I am glad the Minister will keep his mind open on that for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 6 to amendment No. 9, I accept what the Minister is saying, that the frequency management function has to stay in the hands of the Minister.  On the other hand, the handing out of the franchise or the contract to the MMDS operator or the cable operator will be intimately involved in the commission's work in setting up channels.  For example, whether or not someone would make a ruling on the obligation to carry a station would be <Col N="1071" /> tied up with the decision to allocate to a station.  As the Minister has rightly said, there will be a rapid growth in the availability of satellite services.  They will have no obligation as to their content and no one here will be overseeing them.  At the same time there is growing concern at the availability of excessively violent or pornographic programming coming through on these stations.  It seems that someone will need to look at whether these programmes should be shown in Ireland, as they will not be subject to any Irish authority.  I do not know how that can be accommodated.  I would have thought that, if we are setting up an independent broadcasting commission which will be looking at issues such as quality of programming generally among the channels to which they give contracts, they would be the people who would have the knowledge and expertise to look at this issue.  Perhaps under some sort of a ruling they would be able to say to cable companies: &ldquo;We do not want you to show certain categories of material&rdquo;.  Without getting into heavy handed censorship, it is apparent that there is growing concern about this sort of material becoming available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 7 to the Minister's amendment No. 9. Amendment No. 1 seeks to include paragraph (a) which would oblige the commission to promote the development of a community sound broadcasting service which is democratically owned and controlled by the community as a co-operative or other non-profit distributing structure and is used as a means of community development.  That is an amendment largely drawn from the recommendations of the community broadcasting group.  I am quite surprised that they have indicated to the Minister that they are satisfied that amendment 16, subsection 2 (h) covers the needs which they have expressed to me over a long period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 16, subsection 2 (h) simply says, in consideration of applications <Col N="1072" /> received by it and in determining the most suitable applicant to be awarded a sound broadcasting contract, the commission shall have regard to the extent to which the service proposed serves recognisably local communities and is supported by the various interests in the community or serves communities of interest.  That section has to be taken in the context of other parts of section 6 which also indicate that the commission must have regard to the adequacy of the expertise, experience, financial resources and the quality, range and type of programme proposed to be provided.  It also refers to the extent to which the application accords with good economic principles. Obviously I have no objection to applications complying with good economic principles provided what is meant there is not an application must be seen to be aimed towards an economic end rather than a broadcasting end and that the expertise, experience and financial resources required will not be such that it would be impossible for a local community to provide the service.</P>
    <P>It seems there is a need, in view of the development which the Minister has indicated will take place in broadcasting, for us to place an obligation on the commission to promote community broadcasting. There is nothing in the Minister's amendment No. 9, which replaces sections 2 to 4, or in section 6 (1) or section 6 (2) which obliges the commission to promote community radio or indeed to take any cognisance of the fact that an applicant may be serving community development needs.</P>
    <P>I can think of specific cases &mdash; some were mentioned in the House this morning by Deputy Lawlor &mdash; where a community radio service, for instance in the Blanchardstown or Tallaght areas, would be a very beneficial service.  There is no reason to believe that an entirely commercial radio station would serve the same kind of purpose.  In the Finglas area, which is a relatively well-settled area, quite a number of people are anxious that a local community broadcasting service would be provided.  They feel it would provide an identity for the area and would use a lot of the local talent.  The same <Col N="1073" /> would hold true for the Ballymun area which needs all the assistance it can get from this House and from every other statutory body to establish itself as a viable community.  Over the 21 years of its existence as an estate it has had to overcome and deal with some very severe problems, many of which are not yet even near to being resolved.  I have no doubt that a community radio station would provide an excellent avenue for local people to get to know each other and to help develop the community.  There is nothing in this Bill which obliges the commission to take that aspect into account. If a more economically viable proposal comes from an entrepreneur there is nothing in the Bill which says the commission must give the edge to the community group.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is a need to ensure that any service provided, whether it be a community or commercial service, should be run as efficiently and professionally as possible and it should be able to fund itself.  I am anxious that the Minister accept some amendment to the functions of the commission which would place an obligation on them to promote the development of community sound broadcasting services.  I can foresee communities being overrun by a plethora of commercially-orientated services, and that would be unfortunate.  I fear, even with community status, that they may fall into the trap of being dominated by the commercial interests I mentioned earlier, purely from the point of view of having to survive financially.  That is another aspect to which we should address ourselves.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure that RTE would have the right to apply for contracts &mdash; the amendment says &ldquo;licences&rdquo; but it should be &ldquo;contracts&rdquo;&mdash; for sound broadcasting and television services from the commission.  The purpose of this amendment was to ask where RTE fit into the picture.  There is no restriction on any of the press barons, for example, applying for contracts and licences to provide a television and radio service.  Section 3 (4) talks about having regard to the desirability of allowing any <Col N="1074" /> person or group of persons to have control of, or have substantial interest in, an undue number of sound broadcasting services or the desirability of allowing any person or group of persons to have control of or substantial interest in an undue amount of the communications media in the area specified.</P>
    <P>I understand one newspaper group own a morning national newspaper, an evening newspaper, two Sunday newspapers and a third of the provincial newspapers. There may be other groups which have similar control, and it would clearly be in their interest to have some input and some say in the broadcasting services as well.  After all, the broadcasting services will be competing with them for advertising revenue.  Given the nature of our society, the people who own our newspapers are primarily interested in the bank balance and the balance sheet at the end of the year.  In my view, there will be strong competition from the newspaper area to get involved in television and radio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It does not seem fair or right that RTE, the one group with expertise in this area, should be totally excluded.  In response to amendment No. 3 the Minister said the purpose of the Bill was to provide for non-RTE broadcasting services.  I could understand that if what he was talking about was the broadcasting services which would not be under the direct control of the RTE Authority, but a case can be made for RTE establishing subsidiary companies at local level to provide either county radio stations or city radio stations in the Dublin, Cork or Galway areas.  In my view, it is not reasonable to exclude them entirely from this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there was nothing to prevent local community groups from doing deals with RTE for networking or for the use of transmission equipment etc. but, while I think that is a good idea, it is not precisely what I have in mind.  RTE should have the right through establishing subsidiary companies to get involved in this area.  After all, they too will be competing with whoever gets the broadcasting contracts for <Col N="1075" /> advertising revenue, which more and more is the life blood of RTE.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 7, we are seeking to require sound broadcasting contractors or a television programme service contractor to provide for the transmission of party political broadcasts. I put down this amendment simply to raise this issue because we could not see in the Bill, or in the Minister's amendments, any reference to it.  No one will argue that party political broadcasts are riveting radio or television &mdash; the one exception would be those broadcast by The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>Since we have agreed to conclude this group of amendments by 5.30 p.m. I will be brief.  I want to pick up on something Deputy De Rossa said in relation to community broadcasting. We are all agreed that we want to see real community broadcasting developing.  As Deputy De Rossa pointed out, the Bill says the commission should have regard to this, but it does not in any way positively discriminate in favour of community broadcasting or do anything to foster or encourage its development.  This is possibly a weakness in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> I know that the Minister has said that he has had meetings with representatives of the NACB who have expressed themselves satisfied with it.  In the phase they go through whereby they invite applications from the public to discuss what would be relevant services in a particular area, I hope that the commission will take on board the necessity for ensuring that community broadcasting in the real sense of the word will develop and that there will be the requirement on them actually to reserve specific frequencies to ensure that that kind of radio service can develop.</P>
    <P>With regard to my amendment No. 14, this is somewhat similar to Deputy Bruton's amendment.  I felt &mdash; and he likewise &mdash; that it was necessary to state and specify the role which the commission should play.  The Minister in his response so far has indicated that we were involving ourselves in frills and aspirational rhetoric.  In my case, and I am sure in Deputy Bruton's also, that was not the purpose in putting down these amendments.  We felt that there should be a positive statement in the early part of the Bill as to the purpose of the commission. What I have down in paragraph 2 (a) of amendment No. 14 is entirely appropriate to the kind of thing that the Bill should state.  It is basically about ensuring the orderly development of broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>In my Second Stage contribution earlier today, I indicated that I had some worries about, for instance, the television channel being tagged on to a Bill that started out as a Sound Broadcasting Bill. I would like to see much more planning and control of the way broadcasting is developing here, particularly in view of the major technological changes that are taking place.  It was not a frivolous amendment; it was put to give us some purpose and sense of direction.  I do not accept the Minister's comment that it was put in for purely aspirational purposes.</P>
    <P>On the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton and myself, No. 2 to the Minister's amendment No. 9, I think that I understood the Minister to say that he cannot accept it at this point, but that he <Col N="1077" /> generally is in favour of what we have suggested in the amendment and that he will be making more comments with regard to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment 13, I have been pressing this in view of the fact that the Minister rejected an earlier amendment of mine which affects this amendment, regarding the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is unlikely that I will succeed with this amendment.  Quite frankly, I am amazed at the Minister's continuous references to the 1985 Bill which became an Act.  He said that RTE were not at all happy with some of the implications of that Bill. Essentially, he is highlighting the Labour Party's position on that occasion.  We were not too happy with the role of RTE during the discussions on this Bill.  I am somewhat surprised to hear his reference to the NACB because at one stage I thought that they were thinking along the same lines as the Labour Party.  Obviously, they have had a change of heart and have had discussions recently with the Minister and he seems very confident that he has their support.  That is their entitlement and I shall not comment on that.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned party political broadcasts.  Amendment 9, paragraph (10) (d), states: &ldquo;subject to consent of the Minister, to arrange for the provision of services with or without charge for and on behalf of any Minister ...&rdquo;.  Is it the Minister's intention to make recommendations on conditions to ensure that all minority political interests would be safeguarded under this section? It is quite possible, for instance, that parties that would not be thinking on the same lines as many of the commercial operators could lose out as a result of this section.  Would the Minister allay my fears in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier we had a contribution from Deputy Keating regarding the role of the State in broadcasting, the implication <Col N="1078" /> being that Big Brother had his hand on everything and was doing the country a service.  It is well to bear in mind the history of broadcasting in this country. We are now discussing the introduction of a commercial television station plus, I should imagine, a multiplicity of radio stations.  It should be said that were it not for the fact that the State initiated broadcasting we would have gone without a broadcasting system for many years.  RTE have done an excellent job. It is wrong to say that the State brought undue pressure to bear and did not allow freedom to entrepreneurs, as they were described today.  To me they were law breakers and we cannot fudge that issue. They posed a threat to life at times by their interference with important communication networks.  The frequencies used by ambulances and by Dublin Airport were interfered with and we were very fortunate that there was not a serious accident.  Like Deputy Keating, I was not happy that the Government of which I was a party on two occasions did not take these offenders to task.  I sincerely hope that there will be no undue delay in coming to terms with these people who have got away with it for so long.</P>
    <P>Regarding community and local radio, there have been news broadcasts on these pirate stations which have not been authenticated.  First and foremost, it is dangerous not to get the source of the news.  Items could be broadcast which are not accurate.  I cannot see a section in the Bill which deals specifically with this problem, but perhaps it has evaded me. When news is broadcast over RTE, we can say with some justification that they will stand over what they broadcast.  That has not been the case with the pirate stations.  They plagiarise news items from newspapers which those newspapers would not authenticate.  Steps must be taken when misleading information is given over the airwaves.  I hope that this matter will be dealt with.  Newspapers have the cost of the collection of news and of supporting a staff and they have their news items stolen from under their noses.  In my own city representatives of <Col N="1079" /> these pirate stations waited daily for the newspaper to be published and proceeded to announce the news before the vast majority of the people had an opportunity to read the newspaper.</P>
    <P>With Deputy De Rossa's amendment to amendment No. 9 I have no problem. I wish he had elaborated on paragraph (b), that is:</P>
    <P>to arrange, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, for the provision of sound broadcasting services (including a national sound broadcasting service) and one television programme service...</P>
    <P>This seems to be a departure from the traditional position taken by The Workers' Party.  Perhaps he would fill me in on this.</P>
    <P>In answer to my question to the Minister this morning regarding the role of Cork Local Radio, he said that there was no application for a joint venture by Cork Local Radio for an extension of broadcasting hours.  I again ask the Minister to elaborate on this reply and to tell us what his intentions are in regard to Cork Local Radio.  I was a member of the deputation that went to meet the then Minister, former Deputy Conor Cruise O'Brien, which led to the setting up of Cork Local Radio.  That indicates my personal interest in this matter.  Is the Minister now suggesting that there should be a joint venture with some of those who are actively engaged in violating the law? This morning these people were described entrepreneurs and, quite frankly, I think that this is a misnomer.  I feel the Irish entrepreneur is a very rare animal indeed&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P Just="Center">PART III</P>
      <P>Sound Broadcasting Services</P>
      <P> .&mdash;(1)  In order to secure the orderly development of sound broadcasting services and, having regard to the availability of radio frequencies for sound broadcasting, to allow for the establishment of a diversity of services in an area catering for a wide range of tastes including those of minority interests, the Commission shall as soon as may be after it has been established and may thereafter from time to time by notice published in at least one national newspaper, invite expressions of interest in the securing of contracts for sound broadcasting services under this Act.  Such expressions of interest shall indicate in general terms the type of service that would be provided and shall not be regarded as an application for a sound broadcasting contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Commission shall make a report of its findings under subsection (1)  to the Minister who, having considered the report and after consultation with the Commission, shall <Col N="1081" /> specify the area (which area may consist of the whole or any part of the State) in relation to which applications for a sound broadcasting contract are to be invited and the Commission shall comply with such direction.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister, having regard to the report furnished by the Commission under subsection (2)  and having regard to the availability of radio frequencies for sound broadcasting, may limit the number of areas which he may specify under that subsection.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Commission shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, invite applications for a sound broadcasting contract for the provision of a sound broadcasting service in each area specified by the Minister under subsection (2)  and, subject to the provisions of this Act, may enter into such contracts.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where the Commission invites applications for a sound broadcasting contract for the provision of a sound broadcasting service it shall by public notice specify the area in relation to which the sound broadcasting service is to be provided pursuant to such contract and by such notice shall invite persons interested in providing such a service to apply for such contract.</P>
    <P>(6)  Having regard to the findings of the Commission under subsection (1) the Commission may, in considering applications for the award of a sound broadcasting contract, place greater emphasis on one or more of the criteria specified in section 6 (2) of this Act and whenever it is the Commission's intention to so do it shall specify such intention to each person who has indicated his intention of being an applicant for a contract.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every notice under subsection (5)  shall&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) be published in at least one national newspaper, and where <Col N="1082" /> appropriate, in one local newspaper circulating in the area to be served;</P>
    <P>(b) specify the procedure to be followed in order to make an application;</P>
    <P>(c) specify any other matters which appear to the Commission to be necessary or relevant&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment introduces a new section 5 which deals with the principles and mechanism by which applications for sound broadcasting contracts will be sought.  It is the provision which most directly replaces the original section 2 which provided that the Minister would from time to time invite applications for licences.  Such applications would be invited by means of appropriate press advertisements.</P>
    <P>Under the revised arrangements for inviting applications for contracts put forward in this amendment the commission would by means of a public notice in the newspaper invite on a general basis expressions of interest from the public in securing sound broadcasting contracts. They would not be applications for contracts <i>per se.</i> The objective would be to enable the commission to test the waters with a view to identifying the extent of interest in various parts of the country in providing services and the different ideas which exist regarding the type of services likely to emerge.  This would better help the commission when it eventually advertises the actual franchises to specify prospectives for services which have a realistic prospect of emerging in any area and this would help the commission to fulfil part of its mandate in facilitating the establishment of a diversity of services in an area catering for a wide range of tastes including those of minority interests.</P>
    <P>It would also enable the commission when it comes to advertising the specific franchises already proposed by the Minister to let potential applicants have a better idea of the additional franchises for town stations, low power neighbourhood stations and community stations it may envisage offering in any <Col N="1083" /> particular catchment area.  The commission would then synthesise the responses received under the foregoing process and submit a report to the Minister of the day which would give an indication of the extent and kind of services which would be likely to emerge.  The Minister would then after consultation with the commission specify the areas in respect of which applications for franchises should be sought.  This would be necessary for no other reason than the Minister must ensure that he has appropriate frequencies with appropriate associated parameters to offer for any proposed service.</P>
    <P>In this regard it must be borne in mind that every frequency assignment available to this country under the relevant international frequency plans has a specific set of geographic co-ordinates associated with it and the degree of flexibility in the location of transmitters is quite limited.  It would be pointless for the commission to advertise a franchise for a particular combination of county towns or townland areas without being sure that there was a suitable frequency assignment available for that area.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has specified the areas in respect of which franchises are to be sought, including the whole country for the purpose of the new national station, the commission would then proceed to invite applications in accordance with the mechanics proposed under the original Bill by means of public advertisement. It is also specified in subsection (6) of this new section that the commission may indicate when offering franchises that it will lay emphasis on one or more of the criteria outlined in the subsequent section and on which it will be making its judgment in the selection of the franchises.  For instance, as a consequence of its findings under the initial expressions of interest process, it may find that in one instance it will place more emphasis on the community element or Irish language element while in the case of another station the emphasis would be on the quality, range and type of programme proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> This gives me an opportunity to refer to a couple of the points which were raised in regard to community broadcasting. I have held a number of meetings and attended a number of seminars with the NACB.  My most recent meeting with them was last week when I referred to the amendment which I had tabled. While they would like to see the broadest possible amendment being considered, they were satisfied that section 6 (2) would cover their particular requirements. I share the views which have been expressed by other Members of the House in regard to the development of community broadcasting and I see community broadcasting being developed through the establishment of neighbourhood stations in areas such as Finglas, which Deputy De Rossa referred to, Ballymun and Blanchardstown.  I would envisage that these neighbourhood stations would be run by communities as I cannot see commercial interests getting involved in the running of such stations.</P>
    <P>Good economic principles were referred to and let me say that these apply equally to community and commercial broadcasting stations.  In considering applications the commission would have to take into account good economic principles. We do not want to see proposals being put forward which will not stand up on good economic principles in terms of the number of hours they intend to broadcast, the content of the programming and advertising revenue.  Let me assure Deputies that I share their views on the need to develop and encourage community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I have received various delegations over the last couple of months from most of the counties in the country.  In some cases a number of groups had come together under the umbrella of the NACB and in some cases independent of the NACB.  They comprised business interests, football interests, community council interests, resident association interests and social club interests and they felt that they could get together under the one umbrella and make an application for a licence in a particular county.  This is to be welcomed and I encourage it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Two amendments have been tabled to my amendment No. 10.  The first of these states that &ldquo;the Commission shall consider broad regions within which there could be several competing stations and which, in particular, would be capable of sustaining special interest stations&rdquo;.  I cannot see the merit behind this amendment. Surely the procedure which I have proposed in subsection (1) of my amendment adopts the more practical approach in that following the receipt of the expressions of interest the commission would have a good idea of the extent and nature of the services which would emerge, including whether the aim would be to set up a specialist station or a general station, and the commission would be in a position to determine from this trawl the most suitable geographic configurations for the setting up of radio stations, be they broad regions which Deputy Bruton has suggested in his amendment or the narrower county regions which I have suggested in mine. I believe that we should not focus the commission in one particular direction.  I believe the commission will be well capable of forming their own coherent and practical policies on how best to organise the new radio stations.  Of course the Minister of the day will have consultations with them.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 2 to Government amendment No. 10, I cannot see any significant difference between the Deputy's proposal and what I am proposing in amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 15 are also being taken in the context of the discussion on this section.  I am quite perplexed by amendment No. 11 which requires the Minister to consult with the authority &mdash; I presume the Deputy means the commission &mdash; before allowing RTE to provide any further local or regional services and that any such proposal to rescind it must be laid before the Oireachtas.  I consider that such an imposition on RTE would be totally unfair and unbalanced.  I believe we should be loosening the reins on RTE and that is what I have been endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned Cork. <Col N="1086" /> The practical effect of what would happen, if that amendment were carried, is that if I wanted to authorise extra broadcasting hours for RTE's Cork local service I would first have to consult the commission, to what purpose is not clear, unless it is envisaged that the commission could exercise a veto.  If the authorisation was then given to RTE it would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days, which could entail several calendar months. Meanwhile, RTE could hardly risk introducing the extra hours in case the proposal was vetoed by the Houses.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept that amendment.  Amendment No. 15, which seeks to prohibit the granting of franchises to persons involved in illegal broadcasting, is perhaps somewhat misplaced.  Quite frankly, I have no great sympathy for illegal broadcasters.  Nonetheless it would be inappropriate to actually ban them from being granted franchises if their application was the best received.  My position on this is in line with that adopted by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I would tell Deputy Cooney that, under amendment No. 16, subsection (2) (a) the commission must have regard to consideration of applications received by them and, in determining the most suitable applicant to be awarded a licence for a sound broadcasting contract, the commission shall have regard to the character of the applicant or, if the applicant is a body corporate, the character of the body, its directors, managers, secretary and other similar officers and, if considered relevant, its members and shareholders.  I consider that to be a fair nudge in the direction of being anti those who break the laws of the land.</P>

      <P>May I raise a point of order?  In view of the unusual format we have adopted for this debate today would it be possible to allow the Minister &mdash; I would ask the other Members present &mdash; having reached the expiry of each of the <Col N="1087" /> four time slots some time to conclude? For example, we had the conclusion of the first slot at 5.30 p.m. without the Minister having responded to the debate. Could we agree that, perhaps at 6.50 p.m. the Minister would be allowed to respond to the points made up to then?  In view of the number of amendments before us some points could go unanswered.  I think this would be a solution to that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address my amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No. 10 and also amendment No. 11.  My concern, in proposing amendment No. 1, is that the Minister, from the outset, has confined himself to what I believe to be a strait-jacket in considering county stations, the proposal being that, within the county boundary, there would be one countywide broadcaster only. There might be other town or neighbourhood broadcasters, but there would be one countrywide broadcaster only.  I <Col N="1088" /> feel that network will result in the evolution of very similar stations, for example, a Radio Tipperary South, a Radio Tipperary North, a Radio Meath, Radio Kildare all pitching at a middle-of-the-road mix of programming that will not really serve the need to produce diversity.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister's idea of a trawl.  I should like an assurance from him that if, as a result of that trawl, what appears most appropriate to the commission is that there be three stations operating and broadcasting all in the one area, a large area, that would be subject to possible agreement.  I can envisage circumstances in which there would be different types of stations &mdash; as I mentioned this morning &mdash; for example there could be a dedicated jazz station. Under the Minister's proposals I cannot foresee that type of station emerging unless they got control of broadcasting in a particular town.  It could be quite desirable, in the eyes of the commission that, in a region in which there was sufficient following to justify that type of dedicated station, requiring a fairly broad population to survive, that proposition should be entertained.  I was seeking, by way of this amendment, to get some assurance that the Minister, in designating areas he would license, would not confine himself to that notion of exclusive, one station only operating with that whole region as its franchise area.  That really encompasses the same intent as is contained in amendment No. 2.  I feel it would be more appropriate that the commission, having done their trawl, would be able to come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We see the need for three stations serving the north-west region, which would result in this different type of configuration of programming.  Those are the areas in respect of which we feel the Minister should agree to grant licences.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill is now framed the commission do not appear to be able to make recommendations for the appropriate licences.  Rather will it be the Minister, having looked at the report, would look into his heart and say what those areas <Col N="1089" /> would be.  The reason I am anxious about that provision is that the Minister seems to be so wedded to the idea of these county exclusive boundary-type stations.</P>
    <P>Turning to amendment No. 11, I should say I certainly did not have the intention that the Minister interpreted, as putting barriers on RTE extending their hours in Cork.  As I said this morning, I think RTE should be allowed to extend their broadcasting hours to any extent they choose and should not have to seek ministerial agreement.</P>
    <P>However, I contend there must be some interconnection between the two bodies.  For example, if at some stage the commission decide that they will introduce a number of stations in some area and, simultaneously, RTE decide they will do the same, all I was endeavouring to provide was that there would be some consultation before the Minister would go ahead with his proposals that might directly cut across the alternative proposal being considered by the commission. As the provisions stand the commission will be vetting, I hope requiring, the publication of applicants, having a detailed oversight, vetting applicants and examining their suitability.  If the Minister was going to proceed with some new local broadcasting service run by RTE I thought it would be only appropriate that at least there should be some public knowledge of what is intended. That is why I proposed the provision that an order setting this up would be laid before the House, and be subject to the 21-day rule, before coming into force. That is not to block the possibility of this occurring at some stage; it is to force it into the public arena so that there is some public knowledge of what is going on here.  It is not an idea to try to constrain RTE in extending broadcasting hours or to put any imposition on RTE.  It is just so that we have the same sort of information requirement about the development of local broadcasting if it comes from RTE as is appropriate if it comes from the independent stations licensed by the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general <Col N="1090" /> attitude of the Minister in relation to community broadcasting.  From what the Minister is saying I get the impression that a move in that direction would find favour with him.  I concur wholeheartedly with the Minister's attitude in that regard.  I have a thing against natural phenomena being used for private profit. The airwaves should never be the subject of private profit.  They should be for the community either through a State-owned or community-owned broadcasting system.  Consequently, I am pleased to see the emphasis which the Minister is putting on the desirability of having the community involved.  I have met some community interests and I have been impressed by their dedication, their professionalism and their commercial approach in the formulation of their plans.  They are as aware as we that their local station will have to survive commercially in a harsh business world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton made a very valid point when he painted a future scenario of the counties being served by community radio, necessarily middle of the road radio, not dealing with minority interests, that there should be some arrangement by the Minister whereby under the aegis of the community who will have the overall control provision should be made for speciality broadcasting for the speciality market that exists.  There is a great danger that if we do not do that, we will provoke pirates into existence again, because that is how pirates originally came into operation, to serve a particular market need.  There is merit in what Deputy Bruton says in that the Minister would want to be aware of having the new broadcasting system too middle of the road with not enough flexibility to cater for specific tastes and lobbies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept my amendment No. 15. The Minister has indicated that he disapproves of pirates and that there is a nudge of disapproval contained in the criteria set out.  That is not enough.  It is a matter of grave embarrassment for all of us here in this House, more particularly for those of us who served in the executive, expecially those who served in <Col N="1091" /> a particular office of the executive, even if only for a short time, that we did not tackle this problem.  One could always say, in hindsight, that one could have gone to the stake if there was not a collective decision to tackle this problem. To tackle that would have expressed a degree of bravery not given to politicians to fulfill.</P>

      <P>My antipathy to pirates, while I cannot express it with the total lack of embarrassment with which I would like to express it, is there nevertheless. They have broken the law for the last decade with impunity and they have contributed a great deal to a reduction in respect for the rule of law since the State condoned them.  But it is not too late at this stage to give a firm public message that cheeky breaches of the law are finished. The way to give that message is to take power in this Bill to exclude them from contracts under the new regime.  I appreciate that there is one very respectable person in the midlands whose services are being used as a precedent, by many of the putative community groups, but I am afraid that they too have to bite the dust because they broke the law.  The fact that they were community-based and broadcasting very desirable-type services does not excuse them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to reconsider my amendment.  I do not see that it is going too far to ask that the Minister ensures that people who broke the law should be excluded from consideration under the new licensing or contracting regime.  I cannot see any objection in principle or in logic to what I propose, but if the Minister does not want to go that far, I would like him to tell me why he thinks he should not go that far and if <Col N="1092" /> he convinces me or himself about it, I would ask him to adopt some stronger criteria than those already indicated to us.  For the sake of the rule of law and the common good and all the rest of it a clear signal should be given from this House that those who break the law cannot do so with impunity forever and that their sins must catch up with them, and here is an opportunity to catch them.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 11 I am not happy with the terms being put forward by Deputy Bruton. The proposal here is a rather onerous imposition on RTE specifically and a further restriction of their services.  As the Deputy has explained that that was not his intention, I do not know what he proposes to do in relation to it and whether he proposes to press it.  I would not like to see it being pressed in its present form.</P>
      <P>I have an amendment similar to amendment No. 15 and it seeks to do much the same thing as Deputy Cooney seeks but with the exclusion of those who were involved in community-based non-commercial services.  There is a qualitative difference, if nothing else, between those who saw a gap in the law and made as much as they could as quickly as they could out of it, and those who saw a gap as an opportunity to provide a community service.  There is no doubt that many of the pirates were renowned not for the quality of their service but for low wages and the poverty of their service.  Indeed, the treatment they meted out and perhaps continue to mete out to those who work for them is nothing less than Victorian. I have no sorrow at all for any of the entrepreneurs who exploited the gap in the law, or the unwillingness of the law enforcement agencies to employ the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps a way out for the Minister would be for him to indicate that he would not be happy with people who were involved in this kind of activity for the last two or three years, so as to in some way apply some sanction on those who were involved in this way.  I know that the Minister referred to the section which provides that the commission will <Col N="1093" /> have regard to the character of those who will apply, and perhaps under that section the Minister can make recommendations to the commission as to how they decide on the character of the person or persons involved.  I would not like to see a sanction being applied against those who worked for pirates because given the state of things at the moment, if a young person can get a job anywhere, he will take it.  To some extent Deputy Cooney's amendment is too all-embracing and it could read that anyone who is involved with a pirate would be excluded whether it was those who owned it or those who were simply working in it for a pittance in many cases.</P>
    <P>That is about all I have to say on that matter.  The Minister should consider it as we will be coming to it at a later stage on amendment No. 16. Perhaps the Minister would consider applying some sanction by way of excluding the promoters of pirates for a couple of years at least.</P>

That is why I listened here with a certain amount of envy to people from the Dublin area where there is no problem of this nature.  I am envious of the fact that it is now being considered that the Minister will be able to give frequencies to various communities in Dublin &mdash; Ballymun, Finglas and other parts of the city &mdash; and if that is the case I am not objecting.  What I am saying is that the same facilities should be made available to all communities throughout the country regardless of how remote such communities may be.  If there was <Col N="1094" /> liaison between RTE and the commission &mdash; RTE have already a number of relay stations throughout the country &mdash; these stations could be utilised.  They are not being utilised to the full extent at present. I hope these rules will be applied evenhandedly and that preferential treatment will not be given to one section such as we have on the east coast at present where people can receive signals from Britain and where people on the west have to settle for two stations.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Cooney's amendment. It is wrong that people who have flouted the law should now be interpreted as having expertise, as has been said here today.  They have acquired that expertise illegally.  It is as though somebody who engages in safe cracking or burglary should be a good candidate to be a locksman.  It is the same type of thinking.  Anyone who is breach of the law should be excluded from holding a licence.  For too long we have been tolerant of people who have said: &ldquo;We do not mind what you think, we will continue to operate&rdquo;.  We cannot differentiate as suggested by Deputy De Rossa.  I appreciate the problem with teenagers who are anxious to make a breakthrough in broadcasting.  The only answer to that is through the pirate stations and they were exploited to a large degree.</P>
    <P>I was concerned recently when it was revealed that a certain newspaper in my own city had been engaged in negotiations and discussions with a pirate radio station.  I believe no contracts were signed but the fact is that people who it would be expected would show the way to members of the community were themselves actively involved in having discussions with this illegal operator.  Perhaps it would be in my own best interest to ignore another aspect of this illegal activity.  We had one particular union &mdash; and as a member of the Labour Party I do not say this lightly &mdash; the National Union of Journalists, who condoned their members behaving illegally.  It would be like my own union, the Post Office Workers' Union, condoning the theft of mail.  There are double standards. <Col N="1095" /> For too long we have gone along and said, &ldquo;All right, there are good reasons&rdquo;. There is no reason a person should go along and flout the law in this matter.  In relation to the Cork radio station, with all due respects I think the Minister is taking me a little out of context.  He was trying to turn it back on to myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far as Deputy Bruton's points in relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are concerned, it is not the intention to put the commission into a strait-jacket.  On the contrary, I believe that the system and the method I am proposing will bring forward this trawl to see what interest is in stations countrywide. This trawl will be very beneficial and it may turn out that there will be county stations, and in some cases a number of counties might come together. We should not put the commission into a strait-jacket which I think is what the Deputy was suggesting here.  Whatever is most appropriate is what we should do. It is for the commission to advise and, where possible, we can agree to different stations.  In regard to many of the speciality stations and interest groups referred to by the Deputy and by Deputy Cooney, their interests and their needs will be met, as in Downtown Radio in Belfast, which is the nearest legal independent regime we have in operation in radio.  They cater for speciality interest after 7 o'clock; for example, one evening would be devoted to jazz, another evening country and western music, and community workshops on another evening.  The speciality and interest groups are catered for in those listening hours that are not so great as radio is mainly a daytime medium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> There is no reason why the commission cannot propose some speciality or minority interest for particular stations.</P>
    <P>On the question of why the Minister should have any role, which was asked by Deputy O'Sullivan, the situation is that it is the Minister who has responsibility for frequency assignment and who is answerable at international level, on behalf of the State, for ensuring that the frequencies are assigned in accordance with international frequency plans which have the force of treaty.  While the commission could well conclude that it would be desirable to franchise a radio station in a particular geographic area, the Minister might have to refuse to authorise such a franchise because there is no suitable frequency assignment available for such an area at an international level.  To avoid problems of this nature, it is left to the Minister to specify the areas to be franchised but, as mentioned, he must do so only after consideration of the findings of the commission and after consultation with the commission.</P>
    <P>The type of regional stations which have been referred to by Deputy Bruton may come up out of this type of trawl.  I am not rigid on it.  I would like to see what will come as a result of this initial advertisement which the commission will put in asking for proposals from areas. However, I believe with the interest that is out there and which has been indicated through representations to the Department there is sufficient interest in most counties to have a station of their own. That is understandable.  Counties like their own identification.  They like their own local newspapers.  They like their own particular colours of teams as mentioned by Deputy Bruton and, as an initial step, many of them will go and there will be enough interest in counties, or in groups of counties, to have an application put forward.</P>
    <P>So far as amendment No. 11 is concerned, I made the point already that while the intention of Deputy Bruton is to lift constraints off RTE, the practical effect of his amendment &mdash; I know this may not be what he wants &mdash; from its day-to-day operation would be to further <Col N="1097" /> constrain RTE.  I have instituted a regime to try to remove constraints from the operations of RTE that have developed over the years and this is an ongoing process.  Many of the announcements I have made today resulted from the committees that were established to try to remove these constraints.</P>
    <P>Yes, I agree with Deputy Cooney in relation to community broadcasting.  It should be encouraged.  I have indicated my view in subsection (2) (h) of amendment No. 16 that there should be development of community broadcasting, but sometimes in the narrow sense of neighbourhood broadcasting a couple of hours a week is probably all that would be viable in some of the neighbourhood stations where it would not be possible to have a full 12 hour day or 24 hour day station.  Neighbourhood stations could be run by communities totally on a voluntary basis for maybe a couple of hours on Friday, Saturday or Sunday or however it will work.</P>
    <P>As far as pirates are concerned, Deputy Cooney's amendment provides:</P>
    <P>Provided, however, that no licence may be granted to any person, group of persons or company where that person or any member of that group of persons or that company or any member of that company had been involved in providing a sound broadcasting service without being licensed to do so.</P>
    <P>In the sense that we as legislators have failed over the last ten years to bring in a legal regime for alternative radio, during that period many community groups and others who have a keen interest in radio started up where they would not know where they could apply for a licence.  I have no sympathy with the commercial-type pirates as I have tried to indicate in the criteria laid down that the commission must use in determining who gets a licence.  I have already read it into the record here.  I wanted it to be seen that the Government's view and my view are that we give a high priority to having regard to &ldquo;the character of the applicant or, if the applicant is <Col N="1098" /> a body corporate, the character of the body and its directors, manager, secretary or other similar officer and, if considered relevant, its members and shareholders;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly substantial nudge to the commission as to the Government's view in relation to them.  I do not believe it is practical after ten years of a vacuum where we as legislators have not provided a legal regime to debar those who have been involved, but the criteria are laid down under section 6 (2) and the vast majority of the present pirates could in no way meet the various criteria laid down there and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As far as the legislation to put them off the air is concerned, I hope we can discuss it next week on Report Stage or whenever it is agreed between the Whips that we take Report Stage.  I suggest that as well as taking Report Stage we take steps to bring the two Bills together, this Bill and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill which is geared to put these pirates off the air.  We cannot have the law brought into further disrepute with the legal regime on radio and pirates still on the air.  We must put them off the air and the penalties in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill are such that they will go off the air.  They cannot survive because there are penalties in there for those involved in advertising on illegal radio and for the operators of that radio. BTE have to disconnect their telephones and the ESB have to disconnect them, so it is quite a rigid regime which will put them off the air and I assure this House that that regime will be rigidly and determinedly enforced by me and the Department of Communications.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa made a point in relation to community but not pirates.  I think I have answered that.  I have answered the question Deputy O'Sullivan asked regarding specific areas and specifying areas.</P>

I have a question in relation to subsection (2) (a) in amendment No. 16 regarding &ldquo;the character of the applicant or, if the applicant is a body corporate, the character of the body and its directors, manager, secretary or other similar officer...&rdquo;.  How do the commission propose to investigate the character of the applicants?  We cannot expect the seven or ten members of the commission to know personally all applicants who present themselves to them by way of looking for a contract.  Would it be proposed that the commission would advertise the proposals that come before them and the principals involved in the proposal? Would they advertise the fact that they are sending their submission to the Minister with regard to whom they propose to give the contract to so that the public could have an input into whether their proposals are persons of good character?</P>

I assume, having looked at the applications and deciding on one, their executive would then find out the exact background of the individual or shareholders and partners in an operation and see that they have not been involved in certain <Col N="1100" /> practices in the past &mdash; not just in pirate radio; there are other practices they could have been involved in.</P>

On amendment No. 11, obviously the difficulty here is that we have not the RTE legislation before us but I would like to see RTE removed from constraints and that there would be some public knowledge of intention to proceed with new stations.  In withdrawing the amendments to amendment No. 10 I still ask the Minister to consider perhaps for Report Stage whether the way in which he has drafted his subsections (2) and (3) gives the impression he is going to consider only one contract within a given area.  It is provided that he will specify the area in relation to its applications for a contract. It gives the impression he is considering only one contract for the area and that will rule out the area of speciality stations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two brief comments. One relates to the community nature of broadcasting which I hope will be predominant in the new system when it comes into being.  One area that was worried by the advent of local broadcasting was the provincial newspaper industry.  I am probably right in saying that provincial newspapers are being involved in many of the proposals for community broadcasting and that is only right, but in case the regime should ever emerge where they would not be included it would be very important for their continued health, and the health of the broadcasting system, that they would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that he look at the drafting of the criteria <Col N="1101" />&mdash; strictly speaking we have not reached that yet &mdash; to see if it will be possible to be more specific in relation to giving a right to provincial newspapers to become involved, if they so wish, in local broadcasting. In regard to amendment No. 15, I take the point that as drafted it would exclude innocent people who were compelled, for commercial reasons mentioned by Deputy De Rossa, to become involved in illegal broadcasting and that it would be unfair to penalise them.  I also take the point made by Deputy De Rossa about pirates who were non-commercial. They can be distinguished.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point about criterion (a), that the commission would have to have regard to the character of the applicant and that that is a nudge on the commission to exclude pirates.  In my view it is a bit vague.  If the commission interpret the Act according to the normal canons of interpretation and look at the words of the Act without reading the debate, there is nothing to suggest that the reference to character there could include having been a participant in illegal broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the drafting of that criterion in relation to character and introduce into it at least an allusion so that the words of the statute would nudge the commission towards excluding pirates and that they would not just have to rely on what the Minister has said in the course of the debates.  They might feel that it would be improper for them to do so, that they would be constrained by the words of the statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as local newspapers are concerned I should like to tell the Deputy that this is the first of the Bills published by my Government, the Government of which Deputy Cooney was a member, and the various Private Members Bills, that contains criteria to allow local newspapers apply for a licence.  In the past they were debarred from applying but now they are allowed to apply under criterion (2) (f) in amendment No. 16 for the simple reason that I believe this will have an effect on their advertising revenue.  It would be <Col N="1102" /> wrong to debar them because they have played a very honourable and important role in the development of rural Ireland and its culture.  It is important that they should continue to have a role to play in the media in their area.  Their interests should be protected.  However, there should not be a monopoly, as referred to by Deputy De Rossa, and that is also covered in the criteria.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of character, one of the first criteria in character is law-breaking and whether one has been respecting the laws of the land.  The provision was drafted in consultation with the Attorney General.  However, I will have a look at this but I do not want to make a promise to Deputy Cooney.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>1.  Before subsection (2), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  No contract shall be issued to any person or company, where that person had been directly involved in providing a sound broadcasting service without being licensed to do so, save where it was a community based, non-commercial service.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have rarely been involved in the processing of a piece of legislation that is as complicated as this Committee Stage.  We have tabled three amendments to amendment No. 16.  I will not dwell on our first <Col N="1103" /> amendment because it was dealt with, to some extent, in Deputy Cooney's amendment. One thing I would like to do in regard to people who may apply for contracts, those who are at present or have recently been involved in pirate stations, is to ensure that where they have gone out of business recently, or as a result of the legislation we are proposing to introduce next week to put them out of business, they will not be eligible for the contract unless all the liabilities under PAYE, PRSI and VAT have been met. One of the problems Governments have faced in recent times is the capacity for companies to wrap up their affairs and head off into the sunset owing huge sums of money in VAT, PRSI and PAYE.  In many cases employees are left in a bad state because they cannot get benefits as a result of their former employers failing to return their PRSI and, in some cases, their PAYE.  I would like to see that included as a reason for not giving a contract to an applicant.</P>
    <P>As an aside on the whole question of pirate stations and how they operate, and the reference by Deputy O'Sullivan to the NUJ organising the employees of pirate stations, I should like to state that I have no problem with regard to them organising employees, as I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan has not.  What struck me as odd was the fact that in many cases the NUJ organised the employees of the pirate stations while at the same time blacking anybody, particularly political people, who were interviewed on the pirate stations from appearing on RTE. To my knowledge the only political individuals who were blacked were members of The Workers Party.  That throws another sidelight on the fiction that in some way The Workers Party control RTE.</P>

      <P>I can recall what occurred at a Press conference which we organised at the time of the general election in 1981 &mdash; it may have been the <Col N="1104" /> election in 1982 &mdash; at which, through no fault of ours, a reporter from one of the pirate stations appeared.  When the RTE employees discovered that a representative of a pirate station was present they refused to broadcast the interviews they had carried out or a report of the Press conference.  That was in compliance with the instructions they had from their NUJ branch.  Presumably, they did not have any option, but there were anomalies there and the only people to fall foul of that ruling were representatives of The Workers Party.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 1 we are seeking to apply some restrictions on those who have been involved in pirate radio stations, excluding those who were involved in community-based non-commercial services.  Our amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 16 relates to paragraph (d) of the Minister's amendment which states:</P>
      <P>(d)  the extent to which programmes in the Irish language or programmes relating to Irish culture are to be provided;</P>
      <P>We are seeking to have that replaced by the following:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (d), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  the quantity, quality, range and type of programmes in the Irish language and the extent of programmes relating to Irish culture proposed to be provided;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>It may seem to be a relatively minor amendment but the section as it stands seems to imply that only the extent or quantity of programmes relating to Irish language and culture is to be considered. It would be no great difficulty for radio stations to throw on any quantity of Irish programmes, say, very late at night.  Far more important in assisting the usage of the language would be the quality, range and type of programme provided.  The Minister might accept an amendment along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment No. 5 proposes to insert before paragraph (h) a provision <Col N="1105" /> which would require the commission to take regard of the extent to which the applicant is representative of the community in the area proposed to be served. We are not happy with the formulation of paragraph (h) as it stands, whereby the commission are obliged to take into account the extent to which the service proposed serves recognisable local communities and is supported by the various interests in the community.  We feel it is important to include the extent to which the proposer, whether it be a community group or a non-profit making company, is itself representative of the community. I would ask the Minister to take those views into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's amendment No. 1 highlights the issue of non-payment of PAYE and VAT.  I am somewhat nervous about a more general ban of the sort which has been discussed here.  The law took no action.  If action had been taken the person would have been convicted in court and a penalty imposed.  Presumably in some cases that did happen.  It would not be usual to say that somebody who committed an offence should ever after be banned from carrying out a legitimate activity.  The problem is that due process was not applied and it is very hard to say that we will now apply due process retrospectively and apply a penalty without having brought these people to court.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa is on stronger ground when he points out that a person who set up a company and did not pay PAYE or VAT has shown poor character.  Obviously we will hear the Minister's thoughts on these matters on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the authority are entertaining applications, it is only reasonable that the public should have access to some minimal details without infringing on the confidentiality of how a financial proposal is being put together.  They should have some details as to the type of programming proposed when a contract is being advertised.  The Bill makes no provision for such public knowledge.  Admittedly the Minister is enabling the public to put in some general comments to the <Col N="1106" /> commission about the sort of stations they would like to see evolve, but the likelihood is they will not do so until they see the colour of the eyes of the people looking for contracts.  Some minimal indication of the type of programme mix proposed by applicants for a contract should be disclosed.  In the case of planning permissions voluminous detail is given but that has never been proved to interfere with commercial independence. I am not looking for that sort of detail, but some minimal publicity should be given to the number of applicants so that the commission can see what public opinion is.  This public knowledge should be available at the very outset so that it would be known what applications were beaten by the successful applicant.  That would be an additional pressure on the successful applicant to live up to what he said at the time of application.  The public would know that he succeeded over and above others who were worthy and would feel all the more aggrieved if he failed to honour his promises.</P>
    <P>There is a certain discontent with paragraph (h) in amendment No. 16.  The idea of serving communities or being supported by various interests in the community is a very loose one.  In view of the fact that the Minister has not acceded to the earlier proposals that the commission should support community involvement, it is desirable to tighten up this provision. I have suggested my paragraph (j) as an additional paragraph rather than a substitute.</P>
    <P>If the Minister decided to allow the setting up of speciality stations dealing with jazz or classical music, for example, they should not necessarily have to conform with the news quota.  I am not sure that a news quota should be inserted at all.  I accept that the Minister is attempting to meet that point with the combination of his derogation and his agreement to consider these speciality stations.</P>
    <P>I should like to have seen an explicit statement regarding the desirability of promoting opportunities for Irish talent. This should certainly be in the criteria. With regard to television, I should like <Col N="1107" /> to have seen a quota for home-produced programmes.  I am disappointed at this omission, although the Minister speaks about an amount of independently produced programmes.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 3 relates to the disclosure of applicants' interests in companies.  There is a section in the Minister's amendment where he draws attention to the desirability of the commission having regard to the fact that a monopoly should not develop in broadcasting or in the media generally.  Under paragraphs (f) and (g) of his amendment he points out that this would be an undesirable occurrence.  My amendment is designed to further strengthen that.  The names of shareholders in an applicant company should be disclosed, particularly where shareholdings are held by nominee shareholders.  In other words, the beneficial owners of the shares would have to be disclosed.  If that is not the case it is highly possible that somebody who has an interest in becoming dominant in the whole broadcasting area could acquire interest in companies which would be making applications for a broadcasting contract under perhaps different names.  Under the device of nominee shareholding they could build up quite a spread of interests right across the board and that is entirely undesirable. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment and does not in any way inhibit the way the system would work.  I cannot see that it would inhibit any applicant company from making an application.  It is only right and proper that the shareholding should be disclosed.  That basically means that the beneficial shareholders should disclose who they are, particularly in cases where they are held as nominees.</P>

      <P>In relation to Deputy De Rossa's amendment No. 1 about pirates, I believe they should be entitled to apply for a licence and I am not prepared to accept that amendment.  As far as amendment No. 4 in his name is concerned, this is the formulation of the criteria relating to the Irish language programme and programmes relating to Irish culture.  This is unnecessary because the element which the amendment introduces relating to the quality, range and type of such programmes is embraced by the preceding criteria.  Nonetheless, in view of the commitment of all sides of the House to the encouragement of the language and culture, I am prepared to accept the amendment as put forward by Deputy De Rossa.  We will include it on Report Stage.  As far as amendment No. 5 is concerned, I have gone as far as I am prepared to go on this matter and I cannot accept the amendment.  I have given a clear indication in relation to the community services and interest groups.  I cannot accept amendment No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes that details of applications for franchises be made public in advance of the commission making their selection.  The public franchising approach which I have taken is satisfactory and accords with the standard procedure for awarding public contracts.  I can foresee all sorts of difficulties arising if Deputy Bruton's amendment is adopted.  It would, for instance, discourage some applications because nobody wants to be associated with an unsuccessful application.  It could lead to a constant upping of the ante as applications seek to out-bid each other in promises which would ultimately be <Col N="1109" /> unfulfillable.  I believe that the degree of transparency which I have already proposed for this legislation is almost unprecedented, in particular the full disclosure of licences and contracts.  To go any further would make the task of the commission quite impossible and I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy O'Malley's amendment No. 3, is concerned, this reformulation of the terminology which I had proposed relating to shareholders of an applicant company is acceptable and I am happy to accept that amendment.  It is an improvement on the wording that I had proposed.  As far as amendment No. 7 is concerned, this is already covered through the mandate imposed on the commission relating to the provision of a diversity of services, the range, quality and type of programming proposed and the news and current affairs obligations that will be on all stations.  I am quite happy to accept in principle the thrust of amendment No. 8.  I would respectfully point out to the Deputy that there seems to be a problem in the drafting of the amendment because there is a reference to entertainment opportunities for Irish which, in the context of the previous clause, I simply do not understand.  We could have a look at a better formulation of words and may be we will embody it on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the point in relation to quotas for Irish music.  I am not anxious that there should be quotas which provide for a certain amount of Irish music.  What is Irish music?  Is it traditional music, bogus Tennessee music or folk music?  The best way around it would be to encourage Irish artists.</P>

A form of wording which I had in mind in relation to Deputy Bruton's point was that the commission &ldquo;shall have regard to the extent to which the applicant will promote and create within the sound broadcasting service proposed new opportunities for Irish talent, music, drama and entertainment.&rdquo;  I am not saying that that is the right wording but I will get a form of wording and we can discuss it on Report Stage.  I think it would be the view of the House that we should have a form of wording such as that to encourage Irish artists and Irish entertainment industry generally.  It is a question of finding the right form of wording.  I agree with the principle of the amendment but I would ask the Deputy to withdraw it at this stage and we will find a form of wording before coming to Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>This amendment asks what exactly &ldquo;if it appears to him to be in the public interest to do so&rdquo; means.  The Minister is taking on himself the power to vary the licence terms for a sound broadcasting transmitter, and he specifies a number of conditions under which he might find it appropriate to do so.  Then he adds the catch all phrase &ldquo;if it appears to him to be in the public interest to do so&rdquo;.  I cannot see the reason for that when he has set up a commission to look at the contract terms and to police them.  They are the people who are acting in the public interest.  As far as frequency management is concerned, the Minister has stated explicitly that he will consider these as grounds for varying the terms in special circumstances.  I do not understand why he has taken on this extra decision to interpret the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that there is an unnecessary air of suspicion, <Col N="1115" /> or perhaps misunderstanding, about this section.  Let me again stress that the licences which the Minister issues are solely technical documents relating to his frequency management functions and obligations.  I also issue such licences for every transmitting station which RTE operate and if Deputies want to see what they actually look like, they are all available in the Library here.  They comprise a plethora of data relating to frequencies, power limits, site co-ordinates, spurious emission levels and other technical data which I would not even pretend to understand.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, the proposed deletion of the criterion that the Minister may vary a technical licence if he considers it in the public interest to do so, may I say this to the Deputy?  It is true that most of the foreseeable circumstances in which the Minister might have to vary a licence are covered in the two preceding clauses, that is on grounds of good frequency management or because of requirements under some new international treaty.  To that extent, I admit criterion (c) is a &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; provision. I and my Department are concerned that there may be some unforeseen circumstance not covered by the preceding clauses in which it is imperative that a change be made in the technical parameters of a licence.  It is nothing more than that.  If the Deputy fears that this power may be abused in some fashion, may I point out that any Minister who sought to act unreasonably could be very easily brought before the courts to justify his actions.  In the circumstances I ask the Deputy not to press this amendment.</P>

This enables the Minister to vary the terms of a licence &mdash; which means either a frequency or the power of the transmitter on some similar technical adjustment &mdash; if it is necessary to do so in the interests of the safety or security of premises.  Let us assume that a radio station is interfering with an instrument landing system at an airport.  This is not a theoretical presumption; it actually happened.  Deputy O'Sullivan, as a consequence of his amendment if adopted, would prevent the Minister from taking immediate action to get the radio station to change its transmissions.

      <P>This amendment relates to the Minister's power to vary the terms of a licence.  If the Minister varies the terms, a broadcaster is entitled to know the reasons.  The purpose of my amendment is to make the wording even stronger than &ldquo;reason&rdquo; because the Minister's reason might be that it was not in the public interest and this might not be very satisfactory as far as the broadcasting contractor was concerned. I have asked that &ldquo;the full and detailed particulars&rdquo; be given as to why there was a variation made in the licence. I accept from what the Minister has said that these amendments are of a technical nature and I will not be pressing this amendment.  However, I am sure he will take on board the purpose of my amendment because I think a broadcaster is entitled to have a full explanation in the event of an alteration in the terms of a licence being made.</P>

It is only in the event of the broadcaster not doing this that these measures will be implemented.  As I said, this is a technical measure to meet frequency rules and regulations.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 24 in my name proposes that these stations should be under the same obligation as RTE to refrain from expressing editorial views of their own.  This is important because, unlike newspapers, there will not be freedom of establishment and we are talking about a rationed medium when we are licensing broadcasters.  It would be very wrong if anyone were able to pursue a consistent line, particularly a television station which would be the only one broadcasting in its franchise area and it would be very wrong if a commercial interest took a particular line on the controversial issues of the day because there <Col N="1121" /> would be very little right of reply.  RTE have a very good reputation for impartiality because they have observed this requirement.  They report impartially and do not express their own views.</P>
      <P>They have honoured that requirement and we have had the benefit of it in our broadcasting environment.  It goes without saying that this commands the support of the House.  Every party represented on the Opposition benches has put down a similar amendment.</P>

      <P>As I was saying last night, the purpose of the establishment of the companies of An Post and Telecom Éireann was to have a more responsive and commercially-orientated performance from the companies than was being got from the Civil Service Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Anybody looking at the situation over the past few years since the establishment of these new companies in 1984 will realise that their performance to date can be seen as highly successful and an example of a properly run and efficient State enterprise. In fact, Telecom Éireann are rapidly proving themselves to be in the front of the field in Europe.  They are at present installing what they call a logging system that will be capable of producing detailed bills of every phone call made by the user.  The system will come into operation <Col N="1122" /> during the course of this year and, as I understand it, will be completed by March or April of 1989.  When the system has been fully installed there will be very few countries outside North America that will be able to equal us.  I do not know of any in Europe.  It will certainly put us ahead of most European countries and it is costing Telecom Éireann £20 million to install this system, which will be of tremendous benefit to consumers.  It will render the proposals in this Bill completely out of date.</P>
      <P>In addition, the board are installing a computerised fault-handling system.  This was introduced in Cork over two years ago and is at present being extended throughout the country.  It will improve considerably the procedures for handling telephone faults and will also provide, I understand, a better information centre for consumers.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the users' councils for Telecom Éireann and An Post was not sought by either company, nor was it sought by the workforce of either company. The councils were abolished by the Minister and the present Government. These consumer watchdogs should be reinstated.  If the customers' interests are of such concern, why not advocate in this Bill that a proportion of board places be reserved for consumer interest groups &mdash; at least one member to represent consumers' interests rather than the current situation where political or big business appointees dominate the boards?</P>
      <P>There is also the question of codes of practice.  Why should it be a specific list of measures as outlined in the Bill, rather than an agreed procedure between consumer representatives and the companies? The performance of both companies and their policies conform to, and surpass in many cases, the codes of practice that have been suggested in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an attack on public sector companies disguised as a consumer protection measure.  The approach is closer to the type of approach used by the British Government than anything else.  If this Bill were to get through, the attack <Col N="1123" /> would proceed next to the ESB and, possibly, other State companies, the purpose being to restrict their development, to render them more inefficient through a whole series of bureaucratic measures and then say they were inefficient and should be privatised.  Of course, there would not be any restrictions on private companies or any bureucracy imposed on them as is being suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an implication in one section of the Bill that each individual unit of An Post or Telecom Éireann should be selfsufficient, should produce its own audits, its own accounts.  This would certainly not be in the public interest.  It is reasonable, where there is a high volume of turnover of post in urban areas, that these should be allowed to subsidise services in rural areas with a very light level of post and a wide area of distribution, in the west or elsewhere.  It is socially desirable that post be distributed in those areas and be assisted by the more efficient areas, or areas of higher volume of turnover. There is a social need and the social purpose of these two companies has not been taken into account at all in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 would create particular problems for both companies.  It asks for the publishing of the borrowing limits and the proposal of any major investment to be undertaken during the year.  That is an absurd burden to put on any company, that they should publicise their future investment.  Let us suppose that An Post or Telecom Éireann wanted to purchase some land for the construction of some development.  If they disclosed this at the beginning of the year they would have to pay the highest price for any site they would attempt to purchase.  There is no obligation on any private company to publish their plans in advance so why should there be on a State company?  This is a ridiculous section.</P>
    <P>Section 6 in relation to compensation has even more enormous implications. One can just imagine the position with regard to compensation for lost mail. Anybody can put a letter into a letter box.  It is not like a courier service where you bring your parcel, it is signed for, <Col N="1124" /> accepted and delivered.  Anybody can put any kind of letter, or even a small parcel, into a letter box.  There are millions of pieces of post being distributed in this way.  How can you prove that the mail was lost?  How do you prove that it was posted?  How do you prove, if it was posted here to be delivered in Britain, that it was lost here or in Britain?  The suggestion that people can claim compensation for a piece of mail which they allege was sent and did not arrive is absolutely absurd.  These are public utility companies and there is no private firm anywhere to compare with them.  In fact the only private firm which ever operated in the public utility area was Dublin Gas which was probably the most inefficient and ineffective company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to contribute to this debate as it provides us with an opportunity to examine the performances of both An Post and Telecom Éireann, since their establishment as semi-State bodies in January 1984.  It is not all that long ago when we complained about the very long waiting lists for the installation of a telephone particularly in the newer developing areas; Dublin comes to mind in this regard.  I am very familiar with large housing estates in my own constituency where householders could not be told when they could expect to have a telephone installed.  At one stage the old Department of Telecommunications were not in a position to accept applications for the installation of a telephone, so unsure were they when they would be able to provide a service. Since then considerable changes have taken place in both of these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> In his contribution to this debate Deputy Richard Bruton said that the two objectives which motivated his Bill were the desire to seek protection for the customer and the desire to see the best possible economic performance on the part of these two companies.  That is a very reasonable aspiration, but I cannot accept that this Bill is either necessary or desirable in order to achieve these objectives.  Even a general study of the two companies in question has convinced me that the workers and management fully appreciate their responsibilities which are spelt out in the legislation which led to the creation of these two companies.</P>
    <P>The goal of An Post is for them to be seen as running, in their own words, the world's best post office business serving profitably the nation's changing needs.  In fact, this statement is contained in their 1987 annual report.  They have also stated that they must continually assess their performance in terms of customer expectations and competitive developments. One part of that assessment includes the production of a five year plan, which would be a rolling plan from year to year, which would be submitted to the Minister for Communications.  The plan would also describe An Post's guiding strategy for securing their key objectives.</P>
    <P>The management and workforce of An Post have stated that their overall objective is to achieve profitable growth through the development of existing and new services for its customers.  In that regard An Post have outlined for themselves a number of objectives which include the expansion of the mail market by not less than 3 per cent each year up until 1991 and the building of a profitable parcel service which recognises the need of customers for speed, convenience and cost efficiency.  Their objectives also include the introduction of comprehensive financial services providing competitive money transmission and other facilities through their large network of offices around the country.  Their objectives further include the installation of an electronic funds transfer network which would provide for existing and new <Col N="1126" /> agency clients with an efficient and cost effective transmission service.  They also wish to continue to strive for improved productivity in order to minimise costs to their customers and to secure the employment of their workforce.  Finally, the provision of a comprehensive and managerial support service to their national lottery company is also one of their objectives.</P>
    <P>When one studies those objectives one cannot be but convinced that the workforce are aware that if they are to develop and expand and to take on new agency services they can only do this if their existing services are second to none, if all of the workforce strive to minimise inconveniences and delays to their customers and strive to minimise the grounds which give rise to complaints on the part of their customers.  If the company does not do this the setting of objectives is nothing more than a fruitless exercise, and I am quite sure the management and workforce have no intention of getting involved in such an exercise.</P>
    <P>The annual report for the year ended 31 December 1987 outlines in considerable detail the performance of the company to date.  Anyone who reads the report cannot be but impressed by the expansion of services, the upgrading of facilities and the improvements in the company's premises around the country which have taken place.  This has been welcomed by all who have cause to use the services provided by An Post.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all of the changes which have taken place in recent years it is very important to note that the company made a profit of £2.776 million which includes the moneys received in national lottery management fees.  That is an outstanding performance particularly when we take into account the losses which accrued prior to the company becoming a semi-State organisation.  It is only right that we should compliment and congratulate all those in An Post who have contributed to this outstanding success story, a success story which is often forgotten.  We sometimes neglect to think back to the days long gone when An Post under the old system returned losses year <Col N="1127" /> in year out and were a drain on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another important question is the question of charges which have a direct bearing on our economy.  In the past these have been compared unfavourably with those in other EC countries but due to the efforts which have been made by An Post their charges now compare more favourably with those in other EC countries. Our charges now come fourth in the league table.  Only a few years ago they were either first or second in the league table.  I also understand that An Post have given the Minister for Communications an assurance that charges will be maintained at their existing level at least until the end of this year.  Therefore, there has been a real reduction in postal charges taking inflation into account.  This speaks volumes for the management of An Post and of the commitment of the workforce who have had to accept major changes and considerable upheaval in the workings of their organisation as it moved towards profitability, as it improved considerably the range of services being offered to its customers and as it sought to expand its customer base. That should be welcomed by all of us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also said in his contribution that the two companies are relatively immune from market pressures holding as they do a monopoly position in the market.  This is not something which I accept completely.  Presumably Deputy Bruton was making the point that if an organisation had the benefit of being a monopoly in the marketplace, then they could dictate their terms and conditions to those they are intended to serve.  I do not think that is the case with either of these companies.  My view is that where a company finds itself in a monopoly position in the marketplace, almost invariably it develops to the stage at which the monopoly company decides it will operate and sometimes develops a market strategy suitable to itself only, very often to the stage at which the specific needs of its customers are not taken into account.  In turn obviously that leads to major problems for the company in <Col N="1128" /> that it then suffers the loss of support of the very customer base it was intended to serve.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann enjoy a monopoly status to such an extent that they can afford to become careless in serving their customers' needs or become complacent in broadening their existing band of customers. This is because of the enormous changes now taking place in the field of telecommunications and of document information transfer.  The development of this new technology requires the provision of sophisticated equipment.  Frequently this equipment is available from sources other than Bord Telecom Éireann or An Post.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom are having to compete more and more with the private sector in the supply and installation of equipment associated with the provision of a modern telephone service in a manner which was not the case some years ago.  Therefore, one could not maintain that Bord Telecom are in a monopoly position.  For example, they are having to compete with the private sector in the provision of facsimile machines and associated hardware, the provision and installation of telex equipment and supporting hardware and, in the case of An Post, the provision of franking-machine and lettersorting equipment.  In the case of Bord Telecom, they are in competition with regard to the provision of advanced telephone systems, including the associated hardware and the design and installation of those systems.  From the point of view of Bord Telecom there is also the question of signal transmission engineering equipment, including its design and installation.</P>
    <P>In relation to any of those products it will be found that An Post or Bord Telecom have to compete with the private sector and do so remarkably well.  It is an important segment of their business. One cannot confine Bord Telecom to the provision of a pair of wires from A to B, allowing the private sector exclusively to provide the back-up equipment and hardware, hiving off whatever profits may <Col N="1129" /> arise from the provision of such equipment, service and design.  Such opportunity should be open to An Post and Bord Telecom equally because it is an area in which they must and can compete.</P>
    <P>The rapid development of communications technology increasingly places an onus on Bord Telecom and An Post to have the strength, capacity and skills to compete with the private sector. If they are lax in these matters in any serious way, then it will quickly become apparent to other supplier companies who will move in to fill the gap.  My purpose in making these points in relation to that aspect of Deputy Bruton's proposals is to illustrate that both companies &mdash; if they disregard the concerns of their customers, adopting a monopoly approach &mdash; will do so at their peril because quickly other companies will enter the market place who are capable of supplying a great deal of what both companies now have the capacity to provide.</P>
    <P>A similar competitive position is developing in the postal services area. The rapid growth in previous times of courier services has demonstrated that, where there is a gap in the marketplace the private sector move in fairly quickly to fill it by providing the services required, for example, in the region of urgent document collection and delivery. This is a service I believe An Post should develop more strenuously.  Clearly it is complementary to their function and role.  They should not easily surrender various functions which can be profitable, which are complementary to their role, to other agencies.</P>
    <P>We all remember some years ago when the private sector sought to provide its own postal collection and delivery service. At that time a number of privatelyowned postal delivery companies were established, due largely to what was perceived at that time as a State-run postal delivery service which was over-priced and somewhat unreliable.  I do not think those companies were acting strictly within the law at the time.  Nevertheless we should remember that the private sector would try again to enter that area <Col N="1130" /> of postal delivery and collection if An Post fail to live up to their stated objective. If they fail or weaken in their resolve to serve their customers, then An Post or Bord Telecom will be the losers, which will have an effect on the stabilisation of their workforce and the whole range of facilities capable of being and at present provided by both organisations.  That resolve should not be weakened in any way but it will if they fail to respond to customer needs or complaints, or if they fail to try to devise operational systems within their organisations by which they can deal expeditiously with customers who have cause to complain for one reason or another to either or both organisations.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate yesterday there was a great deal of discussion in relation to the introduction of roadside letter-boxes, when heated argument developed on this issue.  I understand that roadside delivery boxes are provided by An Post only with the voluntary agreement of the householders concerned.  As I understand the position, there is no compulsion on anybody to accept delivery of mail to the roadside letter-box. Figures provided to me indicate that there has been fairly widespread acceptance of roadside letter-boxes, amounting to approximately 7,000 to date, and that, in a small number of cases only, has there been organised resistance.  I believe An Post recognise the potential hardship on elderly or disabled people living alone having to collect mail from roadside letter-boxes. An Post should accept and recognise that hardship so that, in such cases, the company would be prepared to ensure that mail is delivered to the homes of such people.</P>
    <P>There have been some cases also of householders who, having agreed to the erection of roadside letter-boxes, changed their minds, An Post having gone to considerable expense to provide and erect the boxes and re-organise postmen's delivery routes.  In these cases I suppose it is not unreasonable for An Post to require householders to collect their mail at the local post office.  It is not unusual, when dealing with a large <Col N="1131" /> number of people, to find a small number changing their minds.  It might be possible for An Post to re-examine this matter, allowing people who genuinely decide to change their minds to do so.  It would not be unreasonable to expect An Post to meet this change of heart without the imposition of any financial penalty.</P>
    <P>I understand that the type of roadside letter boxes in use in Ireland is in widespread use on the Continent and does not appear to have presented security problems there.  I am aware that there appear to be security problems here and that discussions are taking place with Irish manufacturers with a view to producing a box which would incorporate more security features.  Of course An Post meet the cost of providing and erecting new roadside letter-boxes.  I understand that customers are canvassed in regard to the provision of such a box by a local post office official.  It has also been pointed out to me &mdash; this matter having been raised by other Members &mdash; by An Post that there is no question of a commission being paid to any such official in respect of each customer who accepts a box.  I think that was suggested by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Higgins raised a question relating to a person in Leap, County Cork, being required to pay an annual fee of £27.50 to collect mail from the local post office.  It just shows how one can get the wrong impression.  Anyone reading a statement about that would think it was because he refused to agree to the provision of a box.  On detailed inquiry into this case, the question of delivery to a roadside box is not at issue at all.  The fee is the normal charge for a person who wishes to collect mail from a post office in preference to having it delivered by the postman.  This arises regularly in the commercial sector, where companies, for their own reasons decide to collect post directly at the post office.  I understand there is a fee charged for that service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>If a post office has to set <Col N="1132" /> aside mail for a company and hold it until that company calls, that is an additional service as that customer's mail is being taken out of the normal run of mail. People, particularly in the commercial sector, should be prepared to pay for that service.  A postman delivering to the area where that company is situated will still have to travel that road delivering mail to other customers.</P>
      <P>Post office buildings and accommodation have been a serious bone of contention down through the years.  It has been evident that post office buildings in nearly every town, particularly where they were State owned, tended to be in a fairly dilapidated condition.  Not much was invested in updating buildings and keeping the exterior and the interior in good condition, and in keeping the area where customers were served well lit and reasonably well decorated so that people could do their business in reasonable conditions. An Post are now making considerable efforts to upgrade their buildings and they are currently engaged in a major building programme, including the refurbishment and extension of existing post office buildings and the provision of new delivery and sorting offices.  In the 1984-1987 period An Post invested over £11 million on the provision of new expanded or refurbished accommodation at 30 different locations, while other schemes, including minor refurbishment and improvements have been completed in a large number of offices.  An Post are committed to maintaining the momentum of the building programme throughout 1988.  Presumably this is an effort by An Post to improve their services to the customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann took responsibility for the operation of the national telecommunications services on 1 January 1984.  The principal services provided by the board include telephone, telex and data transmission services.  The legislation which gave rise to the establishment of Telecom Éireann sets out their principal objectives which correspond greatly with the objectives of An Post.  Clearly it must be the wish of the workers and management of Telecom <Col N="1133" /> Éireann to continue to expand their customer base by striving constantly to provide the best possible service at all times. It must also be the policy and the philosophy of both companies to conduct relations with their customers as professionally as possible with particular reference to minimising complaints from customers and to removing the causes of complaints.</P>
    <P>The area where complaints are most frequently made in connection with An Bord Telecom is the area relating to the issuing of bills.  It is traditional to challenge a telephone bill for a variety of reasons.  Most people who challenge bills are motivated with the best of intentions. Constituents frequently visit my clinic saying that they are unhappy with their telephone bills.  They do not have evidence of a mistake because they cannot have that facility at present.  They only have an educated guess as to what the bill should be.</P>
    <P>In some cases people try to keep records, but there are a whole range of issues which can distort a bill and give the wrong impression to the customer.  I am sure Telecom Éireann are sick to death of this type of query.  They are now spending a considerable sum trying to devise a system whereby people can have itemised bills.  This is being established first on a pilot basis and hopefully they will be able to extend it nationwide in due course at a cost somewhere in the region of £20 million which is a very considerable investment to ensure that the customer is satisfied.  In future customers will be satisfied with bills issued or will at least be satisfied that there is equipment to check these bills so that they do not have to rely simply on the word of an official of An Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The board should be encouraged to continue their efforts in this regard and to ensure that the system is extended nationwide as quickly as possible.  Until then customers will not be satisfied. When this system is implemented, there will be a considerable decrease in the number of complaints relating to bills.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to charges and to the <Col N="1134" /> quality of service.  The Minister for Communications pointed out that, due largely to the efforts of An Post, postal charges have been kept down in the past two or three years and they now compare very favourably with European countries.  We must continue to further improve charging structures and to effect a further decrease in real terms in charges to customers. Telephone charges have a direct bearing on company costs and overheads and on the economic performance of this country.  Telephone and other telecommunications bills in business are extremely substantial nowadays and can have an inhibiting effect on the operation of a company.  This is no longer the small item in terms of commercial operations' list of creditors.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to the compensation code.  This area is so vague and so open to abuse that I am surprised Deputy Bruton has put it in here.  How can one prove that a letter was posted?  If a customer posts a letter that contains a very substantial tenure and that letter is lost or goes astray, or is not posted at all, how does one cope with a claim from the customer for the loss of a tenure which could have major implications for the company?  If we are going to extend it to all items going through the postal system, it cannot be done.  It is too vague and too general.  If An Post tried to provide insurance liability to cover that issue, in my opinion it would drive the costs of postal charges sky-high and it would be counterproductive to the very intent of this Bill which, as already stated, seeks to bring charges more into line with EC countries and to further enhance the operation of the company.  I do not think it would make very much sense to have that particular issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The final point I want to make relates to the written contract. Again, it is suggested that in An Bord Telecom there should be a written contract for every customer.  While that is <Col N="1135" /> desirable and laudable to some extent, I think it is just the creation of another layer in the organisation which would only give rise to increased manpower to supervise the writing and the altering of the contracts etc. and in the end would not necessarily improve the facilities available to the particular customer.</P>
      <P>Having had this debate, having discussed the two companies and looked at their operations and the legislation as proposed by Deputy Bruton, I believe the Deputy should be willing, at the end of this debate, to withdraw the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the other Deputies in the House I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill which has been put forward by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It has been noticeable that Deputies on all sides welcomed the opportunity to speak on the subject matter.  I would remind Deputies that it has been very difficult to get a response from the Minister at any time about his interest in these companies.</P>
      <P>After the reports of the Ombudsman in 1986 and 1987 I believe Deputy Bruton properly responded to some of the difficulties outlined by Mr. Mills.  I think it was a constructive response.  I do not believe Deputy Bruton is dogmatic.  He put forward the Bill in the interests of consumers.  I have not heard very many Deputies talk about the range of consumers who deal with An Post and with Telecom Éireann but quite an amount of employment is involved in efficient use of the service and, indeed, the efficient service given.  In the efficient service given there are elements about delivery and cost.  All Deputy Bruton is asking for in the Bill is that the consumers would be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister accepted the spirit of the Bill I do not believe that some reasonable amendments could not be agreed.  I am disappointed that the Labour Party and The Workers' Party have reneged on their so-called obligation to the consumers. They, too, are interested in employment, in the employees in the <Col N="1136" /> company, as well as employees in industry and in services throughout Ireland. Had they some constructive amendments to put down, I am sure Deputy Bruton would have considered them on Committee Stage.  I am very disappointed to hear a defensive wall being put up about the performance of Telecom Éireann and An Post.</P>
    <P>Both companies, since they were established, have performed very well and they have had good results.  There has been a change in attitude and an upgrading of the service.  The buildings have been improved and there has been capital investment.  Some of the most atrocious working conditions, as outlined by Deputy O'Sullivan, existed in the postal services.  When I worked in the sorting office each Christmas I suffered because the conditions were terrible.  I am disappointed that there has not been a better response from the people working within the services and those availing of them.  I am particularly disappointed that the media have not shown any interest in the consumer aspect of this Bill.  They clamour from time to time about consumer problems but the print media, the newspapers, seem to be turning a blind eye to some of the difficulties that have arisen, including the high charges that exist both in Telecom Éireann and in An Post.</P>
    <P>When the newspapers are short of money and when there is some pressure on them they have a free hand to put up their prices.  The Irish newspapers have not performed well.  If they had their own cost control system I am sure they would be doing better.  They might even be able to compete with the British newspapers that are coming in here and have some respect for the consumer.  The consumer has not complained enough in that area. This Bill gave the opportunity for Deputies in this House to acknowledge that there are high charges in An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Some of the services provided are not always good.  I will give two examples from my own constituency.</P>
    <P>In the area of parcel post, we have one of the largest mail order companies in the country, indeed, it is another semi-State <Col N="1137" /> company of which Deputy Mac Giolla spoke so highly; that is, the mail order business in Shannon.  They established an exceptional market in North America and were particularly successful in selling Waterford glass and other Irish-manufactured items to the North American continent.  Each year they had hassle regarding the cost of sending out their brochure in the post and they also had hassle concerning the cost of parcels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood referred to non-delivery and contracts.  There was even an incident during the period in which An Post was operating for the mail order company in which a container was lost at sea.  An Post did not notify, or could not notify, the company that these parcels had been lost for at least three months.  Look at the goodwill that was lost because some officers in An Post did not acknowledge that an accident had taken place, that parcels had gone astray and that something was wrong.  That consumer was entitled to some respect.  The mail order company had to replace all those parcels. That put some restriction on the operational profit of the company and it probably inhibited employment there.  Now they and other companies have another arrangement with forwarding agents and they have utilised the United Parcels Service in the US.  I could not or would not for one instant condemn the company.</P>
    <P>In their planning policy surely An Post should try to cultivate the business that mail order was developing.  They should make every effort to retain, and indeed, improve the service being given by mail order.  When they had their contract with the mail order company An Post changed their prices during the season with the result that the increased costs were borne by the company in Shannon.  They could not be passed on to the customers because the prices had already been sent out in a catalogue.</P>
    <P>The management should be trying to develop a policy.  This Bill introduced here by Deputy Bruton would require the company to look on a quarterly basis at their progress.  Perhaps the Minister could make a short report.  Every section of business internationally, not to mind <Col N="1138" /> nationally, has its own set of performance indicators.  On page 2 or 3 of a business magazine you will see a whole list of what is going on in the American or other economies and I do not know why we cannot take some pride in positive results from companies like An Post and BTE. Surely they want to improve their services. The workers would like to do so. Why should the board, the management and the Department be reticent about doing it?  The Minister talked about releasing private information and the performance of the company.  All he need do is something reasonable.  In the Bill Deputy Bruton does not require him to expose extraordinary figures.  Cost schedules in any manufacturing company would have bottom line figures and they become the norm.  The British have their own systems and we know how that country is performing.  They publish more statistics than we do.  Perhaps Deputy Bruton is looking for something of a revolution in getting the Irish people to publish their indices.  What two better companies have been praised so highly by the Government side, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party to set a headline and accept the need to do that?</P>
    <P>I have given an example of one aspect of the problem in my constituency.  They did not communicate and a great many jobs were depending on that.  We are proud in the mid-west of the success of the Shannon Airport complex and Aer Rianta.  A couple of weeks ago I complimented the Fianna Fáil Party on the way they continued, despite different charges from time to time, to invest in Shannon and see the investment was protected. I would like to see them doing that now, and I would like to see An Post doing parcel post for mail order. However, if the Minister adopts the introverted attitude he has and is not quite open, I cannot see how the parcel post is going to be improved.  I do not believe they will ever be able to compete again in this respect.</P>
    <P>People have been talking about the company and their services and social responsibility.  Rationalisation is proceeding at present and nobody on the <Col N="1139" /> Government side seems to have adverted to the fact that, for instance, all the sub post offices are being reviewed.  There was a big meeting in Ennis the other night of some 90 postmasters who all believe they are going to be dispensed with.  One of the great political favours in this House at one time was to give so-and-so a post office.  Did he get it from the Fianna Fáil crowd or the Fine Gael crowd?  Now it is going to be the other way because they are going to take it away.  Generally Fianna Fáil would claim they gave most of the post offices out; now most of the sub post offices are to be taken away, at least while Fianna Fáil are in power.</P>
    <P>Again this Bill gives a vehicle to the Minister and the Oireachtas for a discussion on this very important social amenity, the sub post office.  The Minister of State, Deputy Smith, knows that if, for instance, the sub post office is locked up in Borrisokane or one of those sensitive areas all hell will be let loose, and rightly because the post office is part of the fabric of the village and the town. It provides a great many services now, seeing so many people are unemployed. They have social welfare paid out there every week.  Generally the service is good.  I do not know too much about the economies of it, but if we had a reasonable discussion on it and this matter could be explained Deputies could act as ambassadors for the rationalisation that might make it acceptable.  The attitude of closing one's eyes and locking the matter out, saying there is nothing really wrong and Deputy Bruton sought to bring down the whole edifice of examining the postal and telecommunications area too critically, is wrong.  I do not think that is what the Deputy had in mind.  He was trying to lift the quality and value of the service.</P>
    <P>We have not spoken about jobs dependent on BTE.  Take the multinational companies and their practice.  Multinational companies who have their headquarters in the US, Japan or other countries wait until it is convenient for them to ring in from the US, Japan or England because to ring out from here is too expensive and might from time to <Col N="1140" /> time cause ripples and problems.  In recent times the new technology acquired by BTE has improved the service and now industrialists are using the Fax and other advanced technology to wire the information required, so letter post has been reduced substantially.  I am interested in the increase in the number of letters the Minister and An Post are talking about.  Is it all these competitions that Gay Byrne and other maestros are organising that has caused this increase in the number of letters?  What will happen when Gay Byrne has gone off the air for the next two or three months?  Will the numbers of letters decrease?  Will the volume decrease?  That would be an index that Deputy Bruton would require to be published quarterly; we would know then the effect Gay Byrne was having on the postal services anyway.</P>
    <P>As far as BTE were concerned, the overseas charges on industry were away too high and I am glad that in October the rate is to be reduced, but it will still be very high. It is a factor going against the IDA and other promoting companies when they want to attract industry here. Some industrialists from the US have been appalled at the very high charges. Sometimes there was a problem regarding quality or production and ringing out from here caused excess costs.  Many of the companies, having examined their accounts, warned their personnel in this country against utilising the telephone in an east-west direction.  I would like BTE to examine their relationship with manufacturing companies and industrial users. I have complimented them on the value of the new technology that has been put in.  Their modern techniques will improve communication.  However, they seem to be reluctant to agree to changes.  For example, Bord Telecom delayed for a long time before they introduced the Fax system.  I hope the board will use every modern facility that will help those involved in manufacturing.  They should be to the forefront as far as telecommunications are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman in his report did not refer to the manufacturing sector and that <Col N="1141" /> is why I concentrated on that aspect in my contribution.  I regret the Government have decided not to support the Bill.  The Minister was not very fair to Deputy Bruton in his contribution. Deputy Bruton was anxious to get comparisons from the Minister rather than costs.  The Minister should have produced comparisons rather than rejecting the Bill out of hand.  Surely taxpayers are entitled to know how their money is spent.  For example, we should be told if letters of comfort have been issued to those companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was not seeking a lot of information.  The Bill was introduced because the Minister in the past 18 months failed to answer questions put to him about these companies.  I cannot understand his attitude.</P>

      <P>The Minister received quarterly reports from those companies but he does not give the House any information about them.  At some time in the future the Minister of State will be in Opposition and he will be anxious to get information on how conditions might be improved for industries in his constituency. I have no doubt he will expect to get a reply to the relevant questions he will put to the Minister.  We are being denied access to important information and as a result of the Government's decision to abolish the users' council, consumers cannot get that information.</P>
      <P>The value of the users' council was that they anticipated problems.  I do not think there is any way people outside the companies can anticipate any difficulties.  I wonder if the Department are exercising proper control over those companies. The Minister has told us that the companies have commercial status and are allowed to compete.  In my view they operate a monopoly and the Minister does not permit anybody to examine them or criticise their performance.</P>

      <P>Those statements are based on my experience over the past 18 months when the Minister for Communications was ambivalent in his reply to questions.  The Minister has not told us if in his opinion An Post or Bord Telecom were performing properly.  He told us that he was abolishing the users' council because there was duplication by the Government cut back on the allocation to the Office of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman had difficulty in coping with the queries before the users' council was abolished and I do not know how he can cope today.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to us all that the Minister is anti-consumer.  He is spending his time protecting the ranch and Government speakers have adopted a policy of, &ldquo;what we have we hold&rdquo;.  It is disappointing that we cannot do something to improve the standard of the services offered by those companies, even for tourists.  Most hotels have installed modern telephone systems but at a cost to tourists.  On one occasion when I wanted to make a telephone call from a hotel in the country I was asked for a deposit of £2 for a call that would not have cost any more than 50p.</P>

      <P>American visitors have drawn attention to the extraordinarily high charge for telephone calls.  The charge is double that of Bord Telecom; the hotels simply add 100 per cent to the charge.  At one time people could complain about such charges to the users' council but that is not possible any more.  I am sure many tourists have been upset over those charges. We should remember that a drop in tourist numbers means jobs are lost.</P>

      <P>I complained to the previous Administration.  The Minister was wrong in abolishing the users' council and the Taoiseach made a grievous error when cutting the budget of the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Communications, should be generous enough and accept that they have made a mistake.  The Minister for Communications should have accepted our goodwill, as expressed by Deputy Bruton, to improve the services of the postal and telecommunications companies. If he does not agree with all the provisions of the Bill he can put forward amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I support fully the spirit in which Deputy Bruton has brought in this Bill and I regret that the Government cannot see their way to supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post and Telecom Éireann are doing a reasonably good job in difficult circumstances.  Of course, any organisation or corporate body will always be subject to constructive criticism from time to time.  There is a general feeling that there is no positive response to representations made by Members of the Oireachtas and other elected representatives to both An Post and Telecom Éireann.  There is also a feeling among the general public that replies to correspondence are not received within a reasonable time.  The people who write to these bodies are taxpayers and ratepayers and many of them approach Dáil Deputies in an effort to clarify matters. This means additional work for An Post and Telecom Éireann.  The streamlining of their correspondence procedures would mean much less work for them in the long run.  Personally, I get a good service from officials and staff at all levels in these organisations, both in Kerry and nationally.</P>
      <P>The free telephone inquiry service established by Telecom Éireann has made it easier for people to query their bills, particularly those that are higher than usual.  I strongly recommend an instalment system for the payment of arrears.  Guidelines should be issued to people outlining the manner in which telephone accounts are computed.  This might enable them to avoid running up high accounts during a three-month or six-month period.  An Post and Telecom Éireann should get away from standard-type replies to correspondence.  Each client should be dealt with individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the installation of telephones, I recommend that Telecom Éireann should get rid of the rule regarding the half mile limit.  It makes economic sense to install as many telephones as possible where the cost is least but they have a degree of responsibility to people living in remote rural areas.  Consideration should be given to a group of <Col N="1145" /> perhaps four or five families living within a mile or two of one another along a stretch of road.  Priority should be given to such cases, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment An Post on the manner in which they are proceeding with the improvement and repair of post offices in provincial towns.  They owe it to staff in these post offices to provide them with good facilities which will generate a good atmosphere.  The general public also deserve such facilities.  Postal charges now compare more than favourably with those in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>Both these organisations should look again at the social aspect of the services they provide.  I am not at all happy about the manner in which An Post are installing letter boxes in rural areas and giving the impression that this is a compulsory arrangement.  It should be said loudly and clearly that it is a voluntary system and people in these areas are not obliged to take these letter boxes unless they are satisfied to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on this very welcome Bill, and to refer to the reorganisation of postal routes by An Post.  They are taking the human element out of the service.  The rural postman is part and parcel of rural life.  Elderly people living in isolated areas have no link with the outside world except through the postman.  When his service is taken away their last link with the outside world is severed.  A person in my own parish of Goleen should be treated in the same way as a person in Goatstown, County Dublin.  They are both citizens entitled to the same treatment. The citizen in Goatstown gets his letters delivered once or even twice a day but in isolated rural areas they are now being forced to accept these post boxes. I agree with Deputy O'Leary that An Post should go easy on this matter. Another point is that they are importing these post boxes from Sweden.  Surely we could make them in Ireland.  Have we <Col N="1146" /> sunk so low that we must import post boxes from Sweden through a company which received State backing to start up in this country?  I am amazed that the Minister is allowing this to happen and I would urge him to rectify the matter.</P>
      <P>Exorbitant telephone bills are being sent out by An Post.  Sometimes they are out of all proportion and their accuracy is in question.  Obsolete telephone kiosks in rural areas are, in many cases, out of order for a greater part of the year.  They are old-fashioned telephone kiosks which should be long gone from rural Ireland. The rural towns and villages should get the same treatment as the cities and major towns.  I recommend that we accept this Bill.  It will go some way towards exposing the inaccuracies in the service and rectifying the anomalies that exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate which has been very interesting and informative.  I hope the Deputies have been persuaded by the eloquence of the arguments on this side of the House to support the Bill.  I have been mesmerised by the spurious arguments produced by speakers on the other side of the House to deflect attention from the purpose of this Bill.  This Bill is to improve the quality and to lower the price of the services from these two companies. It is to get a fair deal for consumers. This has been consistently ignored by the speakers on the other side of the House.  They are ignoring the nature of these two companies.  These companies were not set up to make a profit or to compete.  They have been told that profit is not their objective.  They have been told that they are to be monopolies, that they are to have exclusive privilege in the area.  They do not have a commercial bottom line.  I have heard the Minister and other speakers time and again talk about interference with the commercial mandate.  These companies do not have a commercial mandate.  They do not have to maximise profits like private companies.  They are there to provide us with a quality of service and a low <Col N="1147" /> price.  The Dáil has a clear function to oversee those bodies.</P>
      <P>As recently as a couple of years ago the National Planning Board clearly set out what we should be trying to achieve in relation to our State-sponsored bodies. We were to set them clear objectives they would be expected to achieve, to develop indicators of their performance and to monitor their performance.  We have an excellent body in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies which is designed to do such monitoring but what can they monitor? We do not have the publication of performance indicators from these companies. We do not have testable objectives for them.  We are now being refused even the right to see their price indications relative to European countries published on a regular basis.  The Minister tells me this is too onerous for them.  These are companies we set up to achieve this for us.  Who else is going to monitor it if not us?</P>
      <P>I am particularly amused at the Labour Party and The Workers' Party coming into this House and telling us that they want State-sponsored bodies free from full accountability.  This is the sort of thinking that has encouraged Britain to go for privatisation.  They want to see companies free from interference.  They want politicians off their backs.  They want profit-orientated decisions.  That is not what we set up these two companies for.  The Labour Party and The Workers' Party are taking a very blinkered view of what this Bill is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that to publish borrowing requirements and investment plans and to appraise them would cut across their commercial mandate.  That is nonsense.  Have Deputies forgotten that what has got us into the mess we are now in, where we are cutting back on services like hospitals' acute services for this community, is high borrowing by State companies as well as by the State and bad investment decisions?  Yet, the Deputies across the House are telling us that the Dáil is not entitled to know this information or to see that investments are soundly based before decisions are finally <Col N="1148" /> made.  They want evaluation of investments only after the event.  We have seen far too much of that sort of approach to the use of public funds by State bodies. That is not what we want to see achieved. We want to achieve evaluation of the success of these companies and we want to have the information so that we can do that.  That is what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see the reciting of excuses, as I have heard from Deputies in the House, as to why these companies cannot be as efficient as their European counterparts.  We want to know how they are performing.  Deputies have cited these excuses which may or may not stand up, but the bottom line of what they are demanding is that the Dáil does not have the right to know how these companies are performing relative to their European counterparts.  That is the essence of this Bill.  It is very disappointing that the Government are not willing to accept this positive contribution to an improvement in the way we do our business.  Time and again we vote money on public capital programmes and we do not know what is the basis of those investments or whether they are being achieved within the budget.  Perhaps years later we find out that investments went badly astray.</P>
    <P>I have also been surprised to hear Deputies time and again espouse the cause of the consumer and say that they, too, are on the side of the consumer &mdash; yet they are willing to acquiesce in a situation where these two monopoly companies are to be judge and jury in their own case.  Deputies are defending these two companies who between them control £700 million of turnover and who are to be pitted against the individual consumer.  They say the individual consumer should not have the normal rights of redress.  I cannot understand someone who says he espouses the cause of consumers and then turns his back on a measure such as this which gives only a modicum of redress for consumers.</P>
    <P>Those who vote against this Bill will be voting to deny redress in the courts for the consumer against these enormous companies.  They will be voting to deny the consumer the protection of a code of <Col N="1149" /> practice as is provided for in this Bill. They will be voting to agree to the situation that there will be no users' council to defend consumer interests in this area. They will be voting against the chance to consolidate the Ombudsman in his work. These measures are only the minimum that can be defended to give some element of protection to the consumer who has been so consistently denied that protection by this Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at the frustrations consumers have been suffering in recent times with the services of these companies.  The Minister in the House sought to lay down the fact that 43 per cent of complaints to the Ombudsman were about Telecom Éireann.  He suggested that this was not a significant figure, that it represented only 0.3 per cent of bills.  The Civil Service who deal with millions of householders every day had fewer complaints made about them than Telecom Éireann.  Much as he likes to divide the 43 per cent of complaints to the Ombudsman by large numbers, that will not fool anybody into thinking we have an adequate service from these companies responsive to the needs of their customers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the House we discovered the extent to which the Government are willing to pour disdain on the consumers and on those who are seeking to defend their interests.  It was from the Taoiseach, goading his backbenchers, that we heard the Ombudsman's Office brought into disrepute in this House.  This is the <Col N="1150" /> Government who want a powerless consumer, who abolished the users' council, who halved the investigative staff of the Ombudsman and who, as recently as today, have backed down on the commitment given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he would bring these two companies within the remit of the normal consumer legislation.  This is not just an isolated incident in relation to these companies.  It is a consistent view of the Government.  They wanted to shaft the National Social Service Board and any voice that stands up for consumers.</P>
    <P>The House should unite behind this Bill which is a constructive proposal not only to defend the rights of consumers but to bring these two companies, who, as many people have said, are performing well, into an even better era when they can stand over their services, they can hold their heads high that they are defending the interests of the customer. That is precisely what we set them up to do when we passed sections 14 and 15 of the Act in 1983.  It is disappointing that Deputies are acquiescing in the back-off by this Government in respect of the rights of the consumer.  I hope the Opposition parties will unite behind this measure.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 21 seeks to include in the Minister's formulation the words &ldquo;and without any expression of the contractor's views,&rdquo;. Earlier today I indicated that a case could be made for the expression of views on the part of presenters in programmes other than news programmes.  In dealing with the broadcasting and presentation of news I think that a rigid approach has to be adopted.  I agree that it is almost impossible to have news presented in a totally neutral form.  It is a fact of life that words have different meanings for different people and many of the terms that we use in relation to Northern Ireland have different meanings for people in Northern Ireland.  Therefore it is almost impossible to have a completely neutral presentation of news.</P>
      <P>What this amendment seeks to achieve is that there would be no expression of the contractor's views in the presentation of the news.  It is quite common for newspapers to carry editorials giving their own version of events.  Pressure can be put on journalists to report a story in a certain way for a variety of commercial reasons, the weight of advertisers of other interests perhaps.  It can be said that RTE have avoided this problem.  We have all been able to complain from time to time about the way in which stories in relation to our own parties were carried but but on investigation I think it will generally be found that there were good reasons for this as pressure of time.  Generally RTE have avoided presenting their own views in the presentation of news. This approach should be carried over into commercial and community radio stations and the proposed new commercial television channel.  It is important that such an approach be adopted, particularly given what I said earlier in that producers of programmes come under strong pressure to present stories in a certain way.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to take on board this amendment in order to ensure that the news programmes carried on the various stations will be presented in an unbiased manner.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 25 is practically identical to the amendment which has been moved by Deputy De Rossa and sets out to seek the same objective &mdash; that news programmes be transmitted in an impartial manner.  It is quite common for newspapers to pursue an editorial policy which reflects the views of the proprietor.  I believe those who operate broadcasting stations should not have the opportunity to engage in such a practice.  There is need for restraint in this area.  My amendment No. 22, seeks to insert two words, &ldquo;and presented&rdquo;.  Earlier today I referred to the fact that many radio stations do not identify their sources.  I believe that the operator should accept full responsibility for the news programmes which are broadcast on his station.  It was quite common for some radio stations to quote their sources as being AP, UPI or INA. There is the question of accountability and the proprietor of the station should accept full responsibility for the news programmes which are broadcast on his station.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 21, 24 and 25 are quite similar and seek to insert an obligation to broadcast news in an objective and impartial manner.  It is proposed to insert the words &ldquo;without any expression of the contractor's views&rdquo;. Let me say that in principle I have no difficulty with the proposals in question. The only reason that such an obligation did not appear in the Bill which I have put before the House is that when the matter was raised with the Attorney General's office initially we were advised that such a provision would be contrary to the freedom of expression provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution.  The analogy was given that it would be tantamount to preventing newspapers from carrying editorials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> It was appreciated that there was an equivalent provision in the Broadcasting Authority Act prohibiting the RTE Authority from expressing its views but this was deemed to be more justifiable on the grounds that the RTE Authority represented the people and it would be inappropriate for it to voice sectoral views.  However, in the light of the unanimity of views in the House on this question I had further consultations with the Attorney General's office on this question and while the view still remains that there could be a risk that the provision in question is unconstitutional it is considered that the risk is very small indeed. Accordingly, I am prepared to accept the amendment in principle and subject to checking further on the terminology proposed I can give an undertaking to come back on Report State with a proposal for a similar provision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 32 to 40, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>At the outset let me say that I was delighted with the Minister's response to the last batch of amendments.  It was very fair and reasonable and I thank him for that response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say in relation to amendment No. 27 &mdash; which proposes to delete paragraph (c) which the Minister proposes to insert in lieu of section 10 (1) (c) in the Bill &mdash; the reason I propose its deletion and its substitution by some smaller proportion of broadcasting time <Col N="1158" /> to be devoted to the broadcasting of news and current affairs is that I think 20 per cent is far too much.  It would be very difficult to run a local or regional station on the basis that 20 per cent of one's broadcasting time be devoted to news and current affairs.  My fear would be that they would be dragging up the most banal and parochial matters in an endeavour to fill their broadcasting time.  I do not think it would do anything to help standards.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind, when one is legislating for local radio like this, that one must take into account the level and standard of national broadcasting of news and current affairs.  We are unusually fortunate in this country in that we have an exceptionally high standard and volume of news and current affairs emanating from RTE, both radio and television.  For that reason I question the necessity for a period as long as 20 per cent, or two hours between 7 a.m. and 1900 hours, if the service is provided for more than 12 hours in a day.  I believe it would create a lot of difficulty.  It is also my belief that it will be impossible for people to avoid a lot of repetition of what is essentially RTE news, which is available directly from RTE, and there may be copyright problems about that.  If they have to get such news from their own sources it will be very expensive.  While I am all for it, I contend it is too high a proportion and I would ask the Minister to re-examine it.  I repeat that it is too high particularly in the context of the exceptionally good coverage of both news and current affairs on RTE, much better than that provided in most other countries, in terms of volume and equality.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 51 is related to this. I note that amendment No. 51 partly meets this point in that it allows the commission to authorise a derogation from the obligation of a station to broadcast or devote 20 per cent of their broadcasting time to news and current affairs.  It affords a derogation from the requirement in question &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;in whole or in part in the case of sound broadcasting services&rdquo;.  It is perhaps too much to allow a total derogation.  If the <Col N="1159" /> provisions of amendment No. 51 are implemented and strong applications are made to the commission, in some circumstances, one could end up with almost no news coverage.  I wonder could the two of these &mdash; subsection (1) (c) and the proposed section 15, be rewritten in a different way that would allow the commission discretion to prescribe a percentage or amount of time rather than have this requirement that there be a minimum of 20 per cent and, on the other hand, under the provisions of another section, a right to derogate entirely from that requirement.  It may have to vary from place to place and from station to station &mdash; I acknowledge that.  But the two of these amendments seem to me to be somewhat contradictory in that one imposes, in section 10, a heavy minimum requirement of news and current affairs while there is, in section 15, as proposed the right to derogate entirely from that requirement, or the right of the commission to authorise a derogation entirely from that requirement.  It may well mean that we will end up in some stations, without a derogation, with 20 per cent news coverage and in others, with a derogation, with none.  Taking both amendments together it might be better to have some provision giving the commission discretion, subject to its insistence on a reasonable amount of news and current affairs from each station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is similar to that proposed by Deputy Desmond O'Malley.  Along the same lines as Deputy O'Malley I would contend that this is a residue of the old Bill the Minister originally circulated in which he provided for no oversight of stations, no real test of performance after the initial licence had been granted.  It was understandable that the Minister should be anxious to see some quota of educational, current affairs and such material in that context. We have now moved on considerably. We have all welcomed the Minister's agreement to move on.  We are now providing for a commission being in a position to exact more demanding standards <Col N="1160" /> from stations and to oversee their performance in relation to what they promise at the time of contracting.</P>
      <P>Earlier, in response to Deputy O'Sullivan, the Minister said that he did not favour quotas on Irish music, Irish performers, that he did not favour this sort of quota approach.  I contend he should continue and apply that approach in this area.  The commission will be there to use their discretion.  As we said earlier, hopefully there will be stations that will evolve and will serve specialised interests.  This requirement would be a particularly onerous burden on those stations. While there is provision for a derogation, clearly the legislation is saying there is a presumption that one should be achieving 20 per cent of news in all cases and that it would be something of an exception that one would not do so.  I do not think that that necessarily should be the case.  It would be more sensible to allow the commission examine this and the balance of programming.  Otherwise the next thing one will be doing is defining what constitutes current affairs.</P>
      <P>This should be examined in a less rigid and legislative fashion.  I contend we should go along with the view the Minister has been taking consistently, that the commission should examine this in a flexible manner and judge what will best serve the quality of broadcasting in this area.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may put my views on the record and then perhaps the Deputy can have his say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the points advanced so far in relation to this by Deputies Desmond O'Malley and Richard Bruton, I should say I am not prepared to accept the amendments in regard to the elimination of the 20 per cent rule.  Bearing in mind the Second Stage debate and the points made then by Deputy Bruton in relation to stations of specialised interest &mdash; be they, say, jazz or others &mdash; I have tabled <Col N="1161" /> an amendment, No. 51, which provides for a derogation from the requirements relating to news and current affairs programming and which reads:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding section 9 (1) (c), the Commission may authorise a derogation from the requirement in question in whole or in part in the case of sound broadcasting services which it contracts to provide in any area to meet specific special interests, provided it is satisfied that there is a reasonable plurality of sources of news and current affairs programming available to the public in question from other sound broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>That meets any reasonable point in relation to specialised services and the argument that this 20 per cent rule would impede the development of specialised radio.  But I am not prepared to remove the 20 per cent rule.  I do not believe that the stations themselves &mdash; if properly running their services &mdash; would feel that two hours within the day is too much to ask.  If they are really representing the areas or regions for which they are supposed to cater &mdash; be that in Dublin, Sligo, Cork, Limerick or elsewhere &mdash; obviously it will be in their interests to be in touch with their people, to be representative of them, to provide a news and current affairs service in relation to their region and a national current affairs service also to their listenership.  I believe that a station not doing so will not be successful.  Also I am not prepared to permit of circumstances in which, if one does not have this provision, one is liable to have a station with &mdash; and here I might use a phrase I have used many times &mdash; a wall-to-wall music feature which reduces the whole aspect of radio to the lowest common denominator.  We had enough of that in the past.  In passing this legislation we should be careful to make sure that we do not have wall to wall music stations, that the 20 per cent rule is there and that it should stay.  I will be asking the House to support my view and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is going to insist on quantifying the amount.  It should not be done at all.  One is straight away into a &ldquo;never mind the quality, feel the width&rdquo; situation.  It will involve many of the local radio stations and perhaps the commission in defining current affairs.  They will have sufficient problems before they go into that.  Could one regard a 10 minute discussion on how well U2 were faring in the US in a tour, as current affairs, prior to running a half hour of their music?  That is the kind of area into which we will go.  The stations, for their own good, will include what the Minister is asking for, and perhaps much more than that, of news and current affairs, because that is what will give individuality to the stations and what will separate them from the mass of stations that will be available.  It is much better to let this settle, in the initial stages at least, rather than inserting it in the Bill.  As Deputy O'Malley said, we could perhaps do it by regulation later on as things settle in.  It is better to let this thing find its own level from the start.</P>
      <P>Down along the line, a major weapon lies in the hands of the commission and that is the question of the renewal of the licence in due course.  The licence need not be renewed if a station is abusing privilege and is not performing in the manner outlined in the Bill.  More than that, there is the judgment of the people who will be listening to the station.  The local and community stations will be seeking to get maximum listenership. Their individuality will come from their news and current affairs programmes and that is what will get them maximum listenership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be grossly unfair to impose on specialised Irish music and classical music stations an obligation to conform to the requirement for news and current affairs because they do not set out to get a listenership of that nature and there will not be a demand from their listeners for that service.  It would be fatal for that kind of station to have to interrupt its primary purpose, to provide classical or specialised Irish music in order to give current affairs programmes.  I appeal to <Col N="1163" /> the Minister to rethink this.  It could be done by way of regulation rather than by inserting it as a permanent feature into the Bill.  This provision will stultify the stations because at times it will result in totally unsatisfactory material going on the air.  Will the Minister explain whether the quota has to be fulfilled in each week, on each day or over a period?  If a quota is to be filled in a limited period like a week, there may not be suitable current affairs material.  Does the Minister intend it to be scheduled into the programmes in order to make up the time factor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, I take a view opposite to that of both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Nealon.  I have an amendment down to section 15 which would delete the question of derogation. If we eliminate the requirement on the stations to provide news and current affairs, there is a grave risk that we will end up with tabloid type broadcasting which will provide virtually nothing other than a diet of patter and pop.  While there is a market for that kind of broadcasting we should at least try to inform people, whatever their tastes, of the daily events of the world other than in the pop or classical areas.  That would apply to stations who may specialise in drama or in any other area.  I do not see a great problem for the stations in fulfilling the requirement.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley says, RTE provide a very excellent service in current affairs and news and there is no reason the stations cannot buy in to or link in with the various news services of RTE and with the current affairs programmes of RTE, where they do not have resources to provide that kind of service themselves.  Community stations simply would not have the resources to make their own programmes on a regular basis. There is an opportunity for RTE to market their services on a network basis to these stations.  Amendment No. 30 deals with the question of standards in relation to news and current affairs but I will leave that until we reach it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not met the points that I have made and I would have thought they were valid.  The Minister seems to imply that if there is not news and current affairs the rest of the output is likely to be wall to wall music and he is opposed to that, as am I. There are a lot of other things one can have other than news and current affairs, which is not wall-to-wall music.  The commission should be given a greater discretion than is allowed to it here, a different type of discretion, to take account of local circumstances and so on. If a station were to broadcast for 20 hours a day that would require four hours of news and current affairs, and that would be very difficult for them to provide out of their own resources.  One cannot just plug into RTE and replay it.  RTE have copyright in regard to what they broadcast. While local stations can buy from RTE they may not, particularly in their early years, be in a position to do that.  I do not know the charges because I am sure none has been fixed as yet, but the charges could be beyond the resources of local stations.  It is surprising that I am arguing against too much news and current affairs, but the proportion in the Bill is too high.  A very good service could be provided with a smaller proportion of the overall time for news and current affairs. This proportion might be justifiable if RTE were themselves a kind of wall-to-wall station but they are not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nealon talked about stultifying.  My view is that without this type of rule we will end up with a stultifying situation of just wall-to-wall <Col N="1165" /> music.  The Deputy asked me how this 20 per cent would be worked.  Amendment No. 26 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 32 to 40, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) a minimum of&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i) not less than 20 per cent of the broadcasting time, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  if the sound broadcasting service is provided for more than 12 hours in any one day, two hours of broadcasting time between 07.00 hours and 19.00 hours, is devoted to the broadcasting of news and current affairs programmes; provided a derogation from this provision is not authorised by the Commission under section 15,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The derogation is brought in to meet the points made in relation to specialised stations, classical music stations and other types of stations.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned that he has an amendment down to my amendment No. 51 on the basis that he does not want the whole of the news programmes to be removed. For that type of specialised station which is being talked about, the commission could have the flexibility to move in whole or in part.  That is as far as I am prepared to go.  I regret we have reached this situation.  I tried all day, and in the preparation of the amendments which have been submitted, to be as flexible as I possibly could on behalf of the Government both in the amendments I have submitted and in relation to acceptance of certain amendments put forward by the other side.  I want to say to Members of the House that this is one point on which I cannot move.</P>

      <P>In the first line of subsection (3), to delete &ldquo;may draw up&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall draw up&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to this amendment what we are seeking is to change the position that the commission &ldquo;may draw up&rdquo; standards and practice to that they &ldquo;shall draw up&rdquo; standards and practice in relation to subsections (1) and (2).  This is the area we have been discussing regarding the broadcasting of news, the treatment of current affairs, the question of decency, good taste, party political broadcasts and so forth.  It would be better if the House made it clear to the commission that we wanted them to draw up standards of practice in relation to how these matters should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, and perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, RTE already have standards of practice in relation to how these matters may be dealt with and, taking one case with <Col N="1167" /> another, they work reasonably well.  As I said earlier in relation to the proposal not to have a specific amount of news and current affairs on a particular station, one could end up with a tabloid-type presentation of events.  If there are not particular standards for presentation which would apply across the board to all stations, RTE, the new commercial television station, the various commercial radio stations including the community stations, there could be very differing interpretations of the guidelines in the Bill regarding what is good taste, decency and what is a fair presentation of the news and so on.</P>
    <P>We should put an obligation on the commission to draw up standards or a code of practice in relation to these matters from the start so that we do not have to urge them, at a later stage, when some difficulty has arisen because of a particular presentation of an item which is found to be unacceptable and when we may then be in the middle of a row, to try to have a code of practice established. So far as I know, such a code of practice is in existence within RTE and it may well be that the same code could be applied across the board to the other stations.</P>

      <P>My amendment seeks to put the new stations on the same footing with regard to the length of time they may allocate in any hour or in any day to the broadcasting of advertisements.  At present I understand that RTE is confined to seven and a half minutes per hour.  Under the proposal before us here the commercial television station, and presumably the commercial radio stations as well, will be allowed to broadcast for up to ten minutes per hour of advertising time.  I am not suggesting we should apply the ten minutes across the board to RTE because from the point of view of watching and listening there is enough advertising on both RTE radio and television but, in the current phrase, there should be a level pitch applied to both the commercial stations and RTE.  The amendment should read that the same times for broadcasting advertisements should be permitted to the commercial stations as apply to RTE.  It is a reasonable proposal. I hope the Minister is in a position to accept it.  In the past when this matter was raised he indicated that he felt RTE already had the edge because of finance they could get from the licence fees, and presumably money they were getting from the Cablelink business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make two points in relation to that.  First, the Minister is now effectively taking £0.5 million from money which in the normal course would go to RTE in order to set up the commission.  Secondly, the money from the licence fees generally goes to maintain a whole range of services which I cannot see the commercial stations maintaining.  I am thinking in particular of the repertory company they maintain, the orchestra, and there are other things.  They also provide a range <Col N="1170" /> of public service programmes on a whole range of things like farming.  I was going to say &ldquo;minority interests&rdquo; but I could not regard farming as a minority interest, in this House anyhow.  They deal with other areas for which they provide services which by any stretch of the imagination could not be regarded as being watched or listened to by a large audience.  For that reason I feel there should be the same application of advertising time available to both the commercial and the public stations.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 35 provides that the Authority would have flexibility within the overall maximum of 15 per cent provided by the Bill to prescribe lower rates for certain stations. The commission may come across circumstances where they would feel, in the light of the sort of programming undertaking the station is entering into, that it was not appropriate to allow them to range up to the full quota of advertising. They might feel this in respect of some community services or of stations to which they had given derogation from the current affairs requirement or whatever. In tune with giving the commission discretion in the way they conduct their business I feel this is more correct.  Bearing in mind what Deputy De Rossa says, that RTE are restricted to a lower level, there may be certain cases where the commission would feel that another station should be restricted to a similar level. I feel the commission should have discretion. I can understand why the Minister would feel that the maximum level should be higher than the maximum level for RTE in the light of the licence fee availability, but that might not apply in all cases.  I submit that what I have offered by way of amendment No. 35 strikes a balance between Deputy De Rossa's amendment and what is in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 36 and 38.  I am trying to achieve, essentially going on the same lines as Deputy De Rossa, that RTE would not have to operate in a climate less favourable than that of the commercial sector.  I would prefer to pin it back to seven and a half minutes in the hour as in RTE, but I do not think the Minister would accept that amendment. I have no doubt that the feeling is that to be commercially viable it would be necessary to have a ten minute advertising slot, despite what Deputy Kelly said during presentation of the Communications Estimates last week regarding broadcasting.  RTE are now faced with a tremendous challenge if the commercial operators are to be allowed two and a half minutes extra in the hour.  I am not making a case for extra advertising for them, but if RTE are at a disadvantage in this regard we are signalling the demise of RTE because commercially they would not be able to compete.  This is a substantial amount of time.  It may seem small, but taken over a week it is a great deal of advertising time, bearing in mind the duration of some of these advertisements.  I ask the Minister to try to bring some equality here so that at least RTE and the commercial operators are on the starting line together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 refers to prizes. At the moment RTE present prizes but they exercise control on them and the Minister may, if he so desires, impose controls on the extent to which the prizes are given.  It is reasonable to assume that initially when commercial radio and television are introduced there will be quite an amount of competition and repetition of what is happening in the newspapers where incentives of cash prizes and various other enticements will be given to attract a listenership.  If there is not equality here and if RTE have to contest for listeners that would be detrimental to the future of RTE.  I ask the Minister to make the commission responsible for seeing that any prizes that would be given on <Col N="1172" /> the commercial stations would be determined by the commission.  They would impose an upper limit on the amount. Equality should obtain right across the board in this regard with RTE and the commercial stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put down by my colleague, Deputy Bruton, providing that within the general criteria there should be flexibility.  It is very difficult for the Minister to produce a uniform rule for the entire country which would be unfair to every area because the catchment areas with which the variety of stations would be dealing vary greatly. For instance, the larger stations in Dublin, Cork and Limerick would have large potential and large organisations would advertise through them.  Smaller areas, like my areas of Sligo-Leitrim, would not have the potential to encourage people to take expensive advertising, therefore the station would have to use time and gather in an amount of less expensive advertising in order to pay their way.  Let me say that how one can expect to put the one station in Sligo-Leitrim with 170 miles between the end of one county and the end of the other I do not know.  A general uniform rule for the entire country might prove unwieldly as a method of attaining what the Minister is seeking.  It would be a good idea to introduce flexibility, as suggested in Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor I would cry for the future of RTE.  They can charge enormous prices for their advertising. They have the entire country and they can &mdash; and I am sure will &mdash; regionalise their advertising when the new stations are introduced.  They have many ways of fighting their own corner and will be able to do it within the present constraints.  As far as the local stations are concerned this degree of flexibility would be advisable because of the different types of catchment areas those stations would be catering for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I drafted this section in relation to the advertising I consciously allowed the proposed new <Col N="1173" /> services the extra increment of advertising time over that currently available to RTE because the new stations will not have the licence fee that RTE are in receipt of.  They will depend for their survival and development on advertising alone.  Consequently, I believe they are entitled to that extra increment.  The figure of 15 per cent is very much in line with the figure being considered by the Council of Europe and the EC.  Discussions are taking place there in regard to broadcasting and agreement will be reached and directives issued in regard to a limit of 20 per cent of total broadcasting time.</P>
      <P>I accept, as Deputy De Rossa said, that RTE are responsible for the orchestras and a repertory company.  The licence fee, which amounts to about 45 per cent of their income, will help the station carry them.  That is one of the reasons why they get the licence fee.  It was put to me that RTE were carrying farming programmes as if they were providing a public service. In my view quite a large proportion of the station's advertising revenue is for products with unpronounceable names used in the treatment of liver fluke and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.  The level of 15 per cent and ten minutes in any one hour has been decided on and with the 20 per cent rule on current affairs, I am not prepared to move on them.  In his amendment Deputy Bruton wants the commission to be able to specify lower limits than those proposed but in my view the broadcasters will determine the amount they will carry up to the limit proposed.  Indeed, if the commission specified a lower limit for one station as compared to another they could be accused of discrimination.  It is better to write those conditions into the Bill.  They will be written into EC directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised a point about games and prizes and I should like to point out to him that all radio stations are subject to the Gaming and Lotteries <Col N="1174" /> Acts.  Those Acts will have more effect than any commission rules or regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister elaborate on Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.  I can see a certain element of danger in this.  I am not very familiar with the Italian scene but I understand that the development of broadcasting there has been on the basis of very attractive prizes.  That has become the foundation of their broadcasting to the exclusion of more worthy material. Will the Minister tell us the provision of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts that contains such restrictions because there is a danger that stations that concentrate solely on a gaming type of approach to broadcasting could win very high audiences? I do not think that is what the House intends.  I can accept what the Minister has said in respect of amendment No. 35.  However, where the commission decide to give derogations with respect to the current affairs obligation they might feel that could be matched by some lower level of advertising.  That might not be a bad thing for the type of stations involved but I do not think I would go to the stake about this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to respond to Deputy Nealon's comments on amendment No. 36.  Deputy De Rossa was correct in pointing out that RTE have a concert orchestra and a symphony orchestra, a repertory company and the RTE singers.  I do not think anybody would deny that they have made a magnificent contribution to our cultural lives. It appears that they are in danger because they will be asked to compete from a most disadvantageous position.  Effectively, the Minister is signing their death warrants.  It has been said that RTE do not behave as though they were a public service broadcasting authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only in relation to the farming aspect.  The point was made that farming was a minority interest and the only reason they carried such programmes was as a public service but <Col N="1175" /> the Deputy withdrew that as he went on. RTE is a public service organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of farming, RTE, since their inception, showed urban dwellers what was involved in the agricultural sector and in my view greater cohesion between the two communities resulted.  Many people in the cities did not know what happened on farms until RTE produced farming programmes.  My former colleague, Justin Keating, produced some tremendous farming programmes on television.  RTE have done much to promote our national games and culture.  The fact that RTE have the income from licence fees to fund their operations has been over-emphasised. We must remember that they have a responsibility to maintain the network and operations like Raidió na Gaeltachta. I do not see anybody rushing to suggest that we should have special provisions for Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Many programmes broadcast by RTE will not be produced by the new commercial stations and for that reason RTE are entitled to a fair stake.  I regret to say that they are not getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has to be made that while the income from licence fees accounts for 45 per cent of RTE's income an increase in licence fees is an extremely sensitive political issue.  There has always been a reluctance to increase the licence fee.  When the commercial stations are established under the Bill the question of the licence fee will become a more politically sensitive issue because we will have people asking why they should pay a licence fee when they do not look at RTE.  In my view there will be a strong movement not necessarily to do away with the licence fee but to restrict it in many ways, or have it applied to the other stations.  Licence fees may provide 45 per cent of the income of RTE but I do not believe it is a source of revenue that will continue to the same degree for any great length of time.  I hope I am wrong but that would seem to be a fair scenario to paint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> In relation to minority programmes, I mentioned farming in a jocose way. There are perhaps 150,000 farms, big and small, around the State.  While obviously farming is a fairly large industry in terms of output and exports, in actual numbers of viewers I would imagine it is not that significant.  In many cases until recently the only stations which could be received by many people in rural areas were RTE 1 and RTE 2.  I am not claiming it as a minority interest but nevertheless it is not a major one.  Presumably the main interest of the advertisers is to reach those people who listen to RTE radio and watch RTE television.  RTE also provide minority interest religious programmes, youth programmes and language programmes. To some extent politics and current affairs could be classified as a minority interest.  The broadcasting of the proceedings of this House and the Seanad would be similarily classified as catering for a minority interest.  RTE cater for minority sports, music, drama, adult education, the blind, the physically handicapped etc.  Obviously, they provide a wide range of minority interest programmes.  I do not expect that the commercial television station will be anxious to provide these kinds of services to the same extent.  Certainly localised radio stations will not be keen on it. Whatever about the minority status of many of these interests on a national basis, on a local basis the audience for these programmes would be tiny in many cases and they are likely to be completely ignored.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at this matter fairly.  RTE should not be put at a disadvantage. I mentioned earlier the risk that a commercial station operating nationally might seem on paper to be viable from a commercial point of view and win a significant proportion of RTE's advertising revenue, perhaps forcing one of the RTE channels to close or restrict services.  Then the commercial station might not remain in operation.  It is a black scene to paint but it is a possibility. I have heard reasonable people argue that the advertising revenue available is not great enough to maintain three <Col N="1177" /> national television stations.  RTE have provide an excellent service and acquired a high degree of expertise and professionalism.  I do not think anyone could fault their presentation of the Eurovision song contest which demonstrated that professionalism.  This House has a responsibility to be fair to that station.  I am not speaking about the Authority but about the people who work in the station and who, in many cases, have given their lives to it.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his approach to advertising slots for RTE and the commercial stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan praised RTE for the manner in which they present Gaelic games and such things. They present Gaelic games because that is what the people want to watch.  The same applies to the international football match they showed tonight.  They cater for minority interests at suitable times, sometimes on RTE 2.</P>
      <P>As far as income for RTE is concerned, whole new areas are opening up to them such as the cable network where they almost have a monopoly.  This could become a major source of income in the future.  There is also the television licence.  With regard to advertising, we should be worrying not about RTE but about the effect on the newspapers, particularly local newspapers.  There is a theory that more advertising will be generated and that everyone will benefit. The local newspapers are at risk because of the advertising on local and community stations.  The Minister might explain the position regarding RTE's time limit.  Is this to be by way of legislation or by regulation of the Minister or is it to be agreed between the RTE Authority and the Minister?  Is there a possibility of a similar arrangement in this case, if legislation is not involved?</P>

      <P>It can be said that sports broadcasting grew from the thirties when Mícheál O'Hehir started broadcasting commentaries on football and hurling matches. He has contributed in no small way. Regarding folklore, there are young people who would not know anything about the Irish folklore tradition were it not for Donagh McDonagh, Séamus Ennis and Ciarán Mac Mathúna.  In our headlong rush for commercialisation, are we to forget all the work done in the past?  All I am asking is that RTE should be allowed to survive and continue to offer the service they have provided through the years.</P>

      <P>I have to admit to Deputy Bruton that I have not the full details of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts in my brief but I am assured there are very tight rules and regulations in the Acts and they apply to the level of prizes offered in competitions.  RTE have run into trouble in this matter which is specifically covered by the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  I will get the details for Deputies Bruton and O'Sullivan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licence fee payable to RTE is not a paltry sum but represents an income of over £42 million and it is well spent.  They are doing an excellent job, as I have already said publicly on many occasions. The Deputy referred to the Eurovision Song Contest.  They did an excellent job in that regard.  Not only would we have to be proud of what was achieved in relation to its presentation but they used technology which was at the cutting edge <Col N="1179" /> of advances on the world stage.  They portrayed this country in its very best light with the various postcards promoting tourism in Ireland which they showed between the songs.  It showed Ireland at its very best in contrast to the frequent image of the bombs and the bullets and what is euphemistically referred to as the troubles.</P>
    <P>The RTE Orchestra have been doing an excellent job and will continue to do an excellent job and I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan on that.  They have enhanced the cultural life of this country and we are very proud of them.  I have the opportunity on a regular basis of attending the National Concert Hall and listening to them.  There is no suggestion whatsoever in this measure that RTE will be damaged. On the contrary, only this morning I announced extra broadcasting hours and extra advertising in line with what the Authority want.  We will continue to encourage and to develop RTE.  They are not an organisation with their back to the wall fighting off all comers.  They are a proud organisation, self-confident and self-reliant.  The paranoia that existed in the past whenever there was mention of interference with their monopoly has disappeared. The RTE organisation today, with their board, Authority, management and staff, are ready to fight any competition because they are confident in what they are doing.  They are confident in their level of broadcasting as far as home-produced programmes are concerned and they are not afraid of competition.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy O'Sullivan in relation to the contribution made by Mícheál O'Hehir to the development of our national games.  We all, as children, remember sitting on Sunday afternoons listening to Mícheál O'Hehir's voice as he portrayed a picture which we could see in our minds.  I could imagine every kick of a ball in Croke Park, Sunday after Sunday, during the summers of my childhood.  He continued to do so with the advent of television, as did Ciarán Mac Mathúna, the late Séamus Ennis and many others.  Many more people are <Col N="1180" /> coming through the system and further generations will be equally proud of them.  There is nothing in this legislation that will in any way damage RTE.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do is to establish a regime for alternative radio.  We cannot close our eyes to the facts that we have had ten years of illegal alternative radio where totally unregulated pirates &mdash; up to 70 of them &mdash; were on the air, bringing the law into disrepute.  Surely it is better to have a regulated, legal television and radio regime which will be under the control of legislation passed through this House.  We have to be practical about this matter.  There is no way that stations can survive solely on the level of advertising that RTE have.  There is no way that RTE could survive on that alone. They need the extra boost of the licence fee which amounts to about £42 million. If we are going to establish these stations we will have to give them some opportunity to survive and to thrive and that is what the 15 per cent rule is all about.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Nealon as to what the situation is in RTE as regards advertising.  They apply a limit of 10 per cent of total broadcasting time, subject to seven and a half minutes or 12½ per cent in any hour.  It is determined in the first instance by the Authority and that is subject to the consent of the Minister of the day.  I want to put on the record of this House that rather than this legislation being in any way damaging to RTE I see it very much along the lines of Ryanair &mdash; Aer Lingus.  It has already put a new fire and self-confidence into RTE.  They are determined to fight all competition. It is very encouraging to see the level of home-produced programmes they are now carrying.  They realise that these are the programmes the people want.  That is where they are getting the extra advertising and the high rates they are getting for much of their advertising.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Nealon's concern about the position of the newspapers, local and national.  I have had discussions with the national newspapers of Ireland in relation to the future position.  In turn, they have had discussions with the RTE Authority in regard to the promotional programme <Col N="1181" /> we talked about earlier, of cars being offered as prizes and so on.  That has all stopped now because of the approaches I have made to RTE about the position of the national newspapers of Ireland and the local newspapers.  It was because of my concern for their continuing role that I included in the Bill, for the first time in any legislation dealing with broadcasting, a provision to allow the newspapers to apply for licences.  That was not included in any legislation from the previous Administration, previous Fianna Fáil Bills or Private Members' Bills.  No provision was made for the newspapers to apply for licences.  That provision now exists, subject, of course, to the monopoly provision that was mentioned and that was a matter of concern for Deputy De Rossa earlier in the day when we were discussing this measure.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the question of private radios being on the air for approximately ten years.  I hope we will be discussing that matter next week in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill.  That is entirely different legislation and I fail to see why it has to be introduced here at all at this stage.  The Minister has an assurance from all sides of the House that he will not be obstructed in any way in introducing this measure.  He has said that RTE are prepared to fight.  They are entitled to be armed to the same extent as their competitors.  At present no application has been received from any wouldbe commercial radio station.  They will have the advantage of carrying out a study as to what it will cost to run a station.  RTE already have standards which we expect them to uphold.  They have administrative and technical staff who have to be paid.  I fail to see why the Minister, who has been quite receptive to some of the suggestions made here today, is digging in his heels on this measure. It is one of the most crucial elements in the whole Bill.  We are putting RTE in a disadvantaged position.  I would ask him to examine this matter before we come to Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying with regard to RTE getting themselves into shape to fight off competition.  In relation to this amendment we want to try to ensure that where they do face competition they will face it on equal terms with that competition. From the wording of the Bill it appears they will be at a disadvantage because the competition will be able to offer for sale &mdash; whether they will be able to sell it is another question &mdash; up to ten minutes per hour advertising whereas RTE are restricted to selling seven and a half minutes per hour advertising.  I am not an advocate of greater advertising on television or radio.  I would be quite happy to see RTE maintain the seven and a half minutes advertising per hour but what I am seeking is that the competition be restrained in the same way.  In our amendment we seek to have advertising restricted to the same level that applies to RTE.  It may be that in future the advertising time will be restricted further for RTE, or it may even be extended, depending on the market and economic conditions.</P>
      <P>We have been getting along quite well with this Bill.  We did not get all we wanted but the Minister has been quite generous in accepting reasonable amendments, and I think this is a reasonable amendment.  I do not have the costings before me, nor have I seen them, of what it would mean in financial terms for the commercial companies to have ten minutes advertising as against seven and a half minutes for RTE, and I do not know how this would compare with the money RTE get from licence fees.  The point I made earlier about licence fees is valid.  Once the commercial stations get going, there will be pressure to at least hold the licence fees at the present level, or perhaps reduce them, or share them with the commercial stations, depending on how well the commercial stations are doing.  I am urging the Minister to take my suggestion on board.  I do not propose to pursue the matter any further.</P>

      <P>I want to deal briefly with the points raised by Deputy De <Col N="1183" /> Rossa and Deputy O'Sullivan.  Deputy De Rossa made the point that RTE were facing competition on equal terms.  The RTE radio station has been in existence for 60 years and the television station has been in existence for 25 years.  They are the people with the edge as far as competition is concerned.  They have the advantage because they have a range of services in place, they have their network and transmission towers in place and they get the licence fees.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked why I am digging in at this stage since this is a crucial element.  The level of advertising proposed is a crucial element if we are serious about this legislation and about establishing independent television and radio stations, expecting them to be viable and providing a proper quality of service. They cannot survive on less than 15 per cent advertising time.  That is not just my view.  That is the view of people involved in radio and television all over Europe. These advertising figures have been spoken about in Council of Europe regulations and EC directives.  In my view, independent stations cannot survive on less than the 15 per cent advertising time and I doubt that many of these stations will even reach the maximum of 15 per cent because of competition from RTE and elsewhere.  It is essential that they have this figure of 15 per cent otherwise it will be difficult for them to survive.  We could talk about this all night, but I am not prepared to alter that figure.</P>

      <P>We dealt with this to a large extent on an earlier amendment.  Section 15 is to allow derogation from the obligation to provide news and current affairs programmes in whole or in part.  My amendment suggests that there should not be provision for total derogation from providing news and current affairs programming for the reasons the Minister argued, that is, we do not want stations providing wall to wall music.  There should be an obligation on stations to provide a minimum amount of news and current affairs.  With my amendment there would still be the right to give some derogation and in my earlier contribution I explained that there was nothing to prevent a station, whether they be community, commercial or national stations, from buying their news and current affairs content from RTE or other organisations set up to provide that kind of programme.  I can perceive companies being established to provide this kind of service.  For that reason it would be important in all cases to maintain the obligation on the stations to provide at least some element of news and current affairs programmes.  I ask the Minister to take on board what is, in essence, a fairly minor amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Authority shall accept complaints made by a member of the public, who is unhappy with the response of the station to a complaint. The Authority shall make a recommendation on the complaint.  In cases <Col N="1187" /> where the complaint involves a breach of the Authority's codes of practice or of the station's licence terms, this recommendation shall be binding.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This deals with the complaints procedure to apply in the case of the new stations. Essentially, my concern in moving amendment No. 43 is that we do not have, as the Bill now stands, any automatic complaints procedure coming into force.  The Minister is retaining for himself the discretion subsequently to extend the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to the new stations.  As of now, unless the Minister makes regulations there will be no Broadcasting Complaints Commission applying.</P>
    <P>To my mind, previous legislation moved in this House took the view that the Authority should hear complaints in the first instance and make recommendations. That is what I have in my amendment No. 43.  Alternatively, the Minister could satisfy me, anyhow, if he said that he would automatically make the Broadcasting Complaints Commission apply in the case of the new stations. There should be one or other automatically enforced so that people who have a grievance against some station which has been established could, from the outset, have recourse to an independent group to hear their complaints, as is the case with RTE at present.  I would urge the Minister either to accept my amendment No. 43 or in subsection (3) of section 12 of the Bill to provide that the broadcasting complaints procedure would come into force automatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider this amendment necessary.  The commission have a statutory duty to ensure compliance with the Bill and will, no doubt, automatically receive complaints from the public and act on them.  As to the issuing of binding regulations in relation to breaches of codes of practice or contract terms, they have a statutory duty to ensure compliance and must therefore take action against the broadcaster who is breaching them.  They have this statutory <Col N="1188" /> duty already, so it is not necessary to include it in the form proposed here.</P>

      <P>With respect, what we are talking about here are complaints where somebody might feel aggrieved by the way in which he was treated in a particular programme that went out.  It might not necessarily occur that that was in breach of either a contract term or a term of any other code of practice.  I do not think that anywhere in the Bill the Minister mentions that the Authority would be hearing complaints from the public about items such as that.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission have been satisfactory in relation to RTE, perhaps a bit slow in finally making deliberations so that the horse has truly bolted by the time they make a decision, but that is in the nature of the provision. I thought perhaps the Authority might be the more appropriate body because they would probably be able to report more quickly.  I do not think that the Bill provides elsewhere for the hearing of grievances that people might have about the way in which they were treated in a particular programme.</P>

It is written into the Bill that not only have they the right to complain but that the broadcasting contractor, the actual station, must, for fair and proper balance, if somebody is injured, give an equal amount of time on the following day or within the subsequent couple of days.  They must give equal right of redress and the right of a second point of view.  That has been written in.</P>

      <P>My amendments to amendment No. 49 deals with the investigations.  I have two points.  One is fairly automatic, that if the commission feel that there has been a breach of the codes of conduct that we have set out, they would have power to investigate such a breach.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The other point is that, with reference to my amendment No. 2, I do not quite understand the fairness of a procedure under which the cost of an investigation should fall willynilly on the station being investigated, regardless of whether the apparent complaint being investigated is found to be sustained or not.  It would be quite strange justice that the costs would apply even if you were not culpable in a court of law.

You are here talking about a judicial investigation, not a system of upholding fairness to a huge range of consumers who are being served by the station and that it would be only reasonable for them to be bearing the cost.  These are investigations essentially with a view to discipline, or suspension, or such other measure against the station.  If the station is found by the commission at the end of the day not to have been culpable, there should not be an automatic imposition of costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, Deputy Bruton's point in his amendment No. 2 is unnecessary because it will inevitably be a provision in any contract that the terms of the Bill shall be complied with, which automatically includes any codes of practice established by the commission.  In the second grounds where an investigation may be conducted as, for instance, where a station is causing interference to other radio communications services and such services are thereby injuriously affected, it is not the intention that the commission would resort to using this power with any frequency.  There will be constant dialogue between the commission and the station operators and if it is felt that a station operator is going off the road with respect to his obligations the commission would, through dialogue, <Col N="1193" /> encouragement and support seek to get the operator back on the road.

      <P>The Minister has said that this provision will not be used very often but hoping that this provision will not be used is not a strong argument. What is the logic behind the suggestion that a station, whether it is culpable or not, should have to carry the cost of an investigation?  Certainly I do not think the commission would use this power in a bloody-minded way and have their officials trampling all over stations simply to run up an expense account.  I would like the Minister to outline what is the logic behind the suggestion that there be an automatic imposition of the cost of an investigation on the station whether it is culpable or not.</P>

      <P>The intention is that the commission would proceed by way of dialogue, encouragement and support in an effort to get the operator to work within the terms of his contract.  It is only when a contractor is being bloody-minded that this provision would be used. This provision would only be used as a last resort when dialogue has failed to secure a remedy.  The commission would require a broadcasting contractor to carry out a market research survey of audience reaction to a radio service and to furnish the results to the commission.  The commission would have a say in the appointment of the person who would conduct such a survey in an effort to ensure that proper professional standards and independence would prevail.  I do not consider that this is an unduly onerous obligation to impose on contractors.  The likelihood is that many of these station operators would have to carry out surveys on audience ratings anyway in an effort to persuade advertisers to buy advertising time from time.  The provision in question would enable the commission to ensure that aspects of concern to it relating to broadcast services are embraced in such surveys.  Therefore, I do not see the provision as being a major imposition on the companies.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider imposing a limit on the expenditure which may be incurred by the commission in the carrying out of these investigations?  I can see the argument that if you do not apply the cost to the broadcaster then the commission would be reluctant to get involved in the carrying out of investigations because they would have to carry the cost themselves. The reverse would also be true in that the commission may get involved in the carrying out of investigations too quickly and incur costs way beyond the value of the investigation if there was no restriction on the expenditure which could be incurred in the carrying out of an investigation.</P>

      <P>The principle all along has been that the commission would have a light touch in regard to regulations and that is why I have avoided inserting too many statutory obligations or rules and regulations.  The role of the commission would be to encourage and give advice to operators in an effort to bring them along in the best way possible and not to chase them up every day of the week in regard to frivolous and spurious complaints which may be made by members of the public.  At the end of the day if the carrots do not work the commission should be able to resort to the use of the stick.  In this legislation I am providing them with that stick in an effort to make sure that contractors meet their obligations. I know I speak for everybody in this House when I say it is essential that every company, every individual and every community association who applies for and receives a contract and makes commitments in regard to that contract should meet their obligations and if they <Col N="1195" /> do not meet those obligations the commission should be able to resort to the use of the stick in an effort to ensure that they stay in line.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time that the Minister used the expression that the commission would have a light touch in regard to regulations and I think the Minister should admit that this approach has not worked in countries which have introduced commercial radio and television services.  I feel that unless very strict regulations are laid down many contractors will not adhere to their contracts. The case will be made that it is not possible to adhere to the rules in regard to news content for a thousand and one reasons, such as the station being too small or that it is a speciality station. This has been the experience in Britain in particular where contractors have endeavoured to circumvent the law simply by completely ignoring it and in the process behaving like legalised pirates.  Some have reverted back to their original style, the playing of wall to wall pop music.  I believe that the use of the light touch may be the undoing of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2), to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Commission shall develop guidelines in consultation with the Fair Trading Commission to safeguard against a degree of interlocking ownership between stations or with other sections of the media, that would be against the public interest.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of my amendments refers to the degree of interlocking ownership between stations.  I note that the guidelines for selecting stations have been laid down but the experience of other countries shows that as time has gone by they found that there was a need to introduce guidelines on the extent of interlocking ownership.  In Britain they are now talking about restricting the newspaper share in a licence to a certain level and in Australia they have found that the prevention of crossing as between the different media is desirable.  There is a danger that it might militate against the public interest to have an undue concentration of ownership.  Perhaps the way to move forward is for the commission to develop guidelines in consultation with the Fair Trade Commission in an effort to ensure that a reasonable code was being adhered to in regard to the extent to which stations were being controlled by other stations and in regard to the extent to which newspapers controlled stations.  It seems to me that this would be desirable that, instead of a case-by-case individual merits proposition the commission would envisage <Col N="1199" /> general guidelines to be observed in this area.</P>
    <P>The provisions of my amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 50 essentially are along the lines the Minister has been speaking about all day, that is the need for a light touch but, at the same time, decisive power on the part of the commission to ensure that broadcasting contractors comply with their various obligations.  As the provisions stand the length of the contract has not been specified. It is only <i>in extremis</i> that the commission will have the power to step in against a station they feel is failing to honour its commitments.  The likelihood is that there could easily be slippage of standards confident in the knowledge that the commission are unlikely to act very strongly against a station until the end of its licensing period, at which stage it could begin to pull up its socks.</P>
    <P>I felt the type of procedure that would be more sensible would be the one I have outlined here, inserting a provision for annual reviews of stations and their performance on the part of the commission, if they so wish.  In the course of such reviews they could issue a warning, a yellow card, to any station to the effect that it was not complying with its obligations. The station would then have a year within which to improve or face the likelihood that the commission would announce the readvertising of its contract. That procedure strikes a balance between, on the one hand, setting the contract period so short that it would not be commercially viable for the station to put together a proposal and, on the other, setting the contract period so long that the commission were not afforded an opportunity to ascertain how a station was performing over a long period until its contract came up for renewal.  I put forward this proposal as a happy medium that would give the sort of light touch the Minister envisages but, at the same time, exert decisive pressure on a station to live up to the programming promises made at the time of licence application.</P>
    <P>What motivated me into tabling amendment No. 4 was that I understand <Col N="1200" /> that the National Association of Community Broadcasters have codes of conduct, charters and so on, under which they register community-run stations and ensure that their standards are observed. If we are in circumstances in which there may be up to 200 community stations operating nationwide, it would seem sensible to me that if the NACB are providing a reasonable code and overseeing the activities of these community-run, cooperative stations in a reasonable manner, the commission would be able to recognise the NACB's self-regulatory system.  Perhaps the Minister would see the merit of that suggestion as a way of keeping down costs on the part of the commission while, at the same time, fulfilling their needs in this area.</P>

      <P>After subsection (4), to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall be a condition of every broadcasting contract issued under this section that 51 per cent of the ordinary share capital in any company shall be vested in the Minister for Finance or shall be held by any company or group of companies in which the Minister for Finance has a majority shareholding or other publicly-owned bodies.&rdquo;. </P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a number of points here.  Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 1 seeks to require the commission to develop guidelines to safeguard against a degree of interlocking ownership between stations or with other sections of the media that would be against the public interest.  I should say that the Deputy's amendment is fully covered in the new section which I have introduced, by way of amendment No. 16, paragraphs (2) (f) and (g) which specify criteria which must be taken into account by the commission in determining the most suitable applicant for a contract.  I might read the relevant paragraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(f) the desirability of allowing any <Col N="1201" /> person, or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue number of sound broadcasting services in respect of which a sound broadcasting contract has been awarded under this Act;</P>
    <P>(g) the desirability of allowing any person, or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue amount of the communications media in the area specified in the notice under section 5 (5).</P>
    <P>Those provisions would meet the general objectives of Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 50, I should say that it provides for a procedure for annual review under which a warning could be issued to a contractor, if there is no improvement in performance, that the contract could be re-advertised.  We must be reasonable and recognise that a contract necessarily will be for a number of years in order that investment can be made in a proper level of services. However, under the provisions of subparagraph (4) of amendment No. 50 every sound broadcasting contract must provide that the commission may, at its discretion, suspend or terminate the contract, first, if any false or misleading information is given to the commission or, secondly, if the contractor has, in the opinion of the commission, committed serious or repeated breaches of his obligations under the sound broadcasting contract.  This is a very full provision which encompasses the amendments sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 50, I should say that this is a condition that would envisage 51 per cent of the ordinary share capital in any company being vested in the Minister for Finance.  This amendment goes against the whole thrust of the legislation and is not a feasible proposition.  I contend it would sound the death-knell of the services emerging under the provisions of this Bill and I am not prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 4 to <Col N="1202" /> amendment No. 50, I can understand why the Deputy says that the community broadcasting groups have their codes of conduct and practice.  I find it a contradiction that all day we have been talking about the commission, their role and the fact that they will be overseeing the operations of the various contractors and radio operators while, at the same time, certain numbers of these stations will not be under the control of the commission but rather operate under a voluntary code of conduct.  I do not think that can work; everybody licensed must come under the control of the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 50 in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, there is always the possibility &mdash; as the Minister will recognise &mdash; that, despite the greatest care on the part of the commission, some contractors may be appointed who will produce sub-standard service for their community, not necessarily in breach of any of the regulations or of the conditions of their contract, but still of a sub-standard and undesirable nature.  Of course, this could be disastrous if the Minister had awarded any such contractor a long contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yes, if the commission had awarded them a contract of considerable duration.  Therefore, the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton would represent a valuable source of control in that respect.  If the Minister is unable to accept that amendment, he might consider a mechanism of awarding short contracts, with roll-over effect, in which contractors who are performing well &mdash; taking the positive approach &mdash; would have their contracts automatically extended but the possibility of sanction would exist in respect of the type of contractor about which I am speaking.  I would visualise great difficulty arising only if the terms of contract envisaged were of long duration.  There would be great encouragement in the initial years <Col N="1203" /> for a contractor to perform rather badly, to save money by producing cheap material in order to maximise his profit. Then he would gradually improve so that he would be acceptable when the renewal time came along.  If Deputy Bruton's suggestion in amendment No. 2 is unacceptable I would strongly advocate shortterm contracts with the possibility of rollon for people serving very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to have proper quality of service we must have proper investment in these stations at the start up time.  The only way to justify a proper level of investment is if there is a guarantee on the basis of tenders submitted, on the basis of commitments made by the contractor, on the basis that the contractor will honour those commitments, that he will be allowed a reasonable length of time, be it five or seven years. Going the other road of the roll-over, and I accept Deputy Nealon's point that he wants to see a proper standard, is the wrong road.  A proper standard is covered in the way I am going about it in the amendments I propose.</P>
      <P>If a contractor gets a licence subject to renewal after two years, there is no way in which that contractor can afford to raise the sort of money necessary to set up a proper station with proper quality equipment and studios, and invest the sums of money necessary to give the type of quality service we want from these stations.  It is better that they get the longer contract and establish themselves correctly and then the commission, with their overseeing role, if they are not honouring their commitment in relation to their contracts with the commission, would take action against him.  That is the more viable way of approaching this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek further clarification. In relation to amendment No. 2 the Minister says that investment will not be forthcoming if contractors did not get a reasonable period within which to operate, according to the commitments made. What I have proposed does not cut across that.  It is purely a procedure whereby the <Col N="1204" /> commission can issue a formal warning to a station that it is not, in the eyes of the commission, meeting its commitments. The Minister refers to the fact that in subsection (2) (a) they can withdraw the contract in cases where serious or repeated breaches of obligation are being committed.  It is only sensible to provide something short of that draconian move and this would be by way of a formal warning that the contractor now had a year within which to improve or he would be facing the scenario envisaged in subsection (2) (a).</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 1 the Minister refers to the commission deciding about undue amounts of control between different sections of the media.  I am interested to know what he feels is undue, in the meaning of this term.  Does the Minister envisage situations where a national station should also have shares in regional stations?  Would the Minister suggest guidelines, or who will suggest to the commission what might constitute unreasonable control and would the Minister not think that the Fair Trade Commission, whose job it is to look at competition, is the sort of body who would know what constitutes undue control of the media?</P>

Rather than having the annual review which the Deputy was considering, there is an investigation power there all the time so that in the event of the commission not being satisfied with anything, rather than having to wait for an annual review they could investigate at any time.</P>
      <P>Undue control is a matter for the commission to decide.  In relation to the involvement of the Fair Trade Commission in this legislation, we already have one commission and I do not see that we should involve another commission in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All contractors shall be required to make payments as follows to the Commission at the following rates for an accounting period of 12 months:</P>
      <P>For the first £50,000 of advertising receipts &mdash; Zero</P>
      <P>For the next £50,000 of advertising receipts &mdash; 10%</P>
      <P>For the next £400,000 of advertising receipts &mdash; 20%</P>
      <P>For the balance above £500,000 &mdash; 25%.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this is to provide revenue for the commission.  What I am asking is not unreasonable, inasmuch as the first £50,000 of advertising receipts are free of any charge but from the next £50,000 of advertising receipts I am asking for a 10 per cent take.  That is not an unreasonable amount.  It is best to have in existence a statutory and visible levy rather than an unknown levy which the Minister may from time to time request the commission to impose.  This would be a means of providing the necessary income to ensure the continuance of the commission.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 54 concerns the applications for television programmes contracts.  The amendment says:</P>
      <P>The Commission shall, on being directed to do so by the Minister, invite applications for a television programme service contract for the provision of a television programme service...</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain exactly what is meant by that?  Why must the Minister direct the commission to invite applications?  I understood that the procedure was that there would be a public invitation for proposers to make submissions to the commission and that the commission would go through these and seek licences from the Minister with regard to the frequencies, channels and so forth, which would be required to fulfil the requests which they considered to be valid and viable.  I am mystified as to why the Minister should take the power to direct the commission to invite applications.</P>

      <P>This legislation is enabling legislation.  The decision as to whether there should be third channel is a matter to be determined by the Government and they have made that decision.  It is appropriate therefore that the commission should only seek to establish such a service on being directed by the Minister.  The trawl that we mentioned earlier on was in relation to a trawl of those interested in the radio licences, and where the radio licences are concerned that is the reality of it.  This is just a direction to the commission to advertise for a third channel, Channel 3, so that is what will happen.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification on what the Minister has said about the trawl envisaged in section 5. Under amendment No. 55 &mdash; which we will reach shortly &mdash; that is not one of the sections excluded from the application to a television station.  I presumed, and it follows on from our discussion earlier, that the Minister would be envisaging a similar entertainment of interests.  The way television should develop in this country would be on the basis of particular localities with some programming network between them and the Minister was agreeable to look again at that.  I would have thought it was more consistent with the view that section 5 of the Bill applies to television also.  Is it by accident or design that under section 4 (2) (b) there is a different provision entered into regarding the contract for television than the contract for sound <Col N="1212" /> broadcasting?  In the case of sound broadcasting he said the sound broadcaster would have to provide the service as the sound broadcasting contract might specify but no similar provision is entered into under section 2 (b).  It would seem to me to be quite normal that the television station should be equally bound by the contract.  I cannot understand what is going on there.  Is it an accident in drafting or is there some purpose behind it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured that there is no significance to it.  So far as the question of the trawl is concerned, the Government have decided that there will be an independent national television service. As far as the involvement of the regional services are concerned, to which the Deputy referred and which I said I would consider, the consideration of it will be on the basis of opt-out arrangements being made for particular hours of the day, for example, an hour a day or a half an hour a day as already exists in Cork communications where they opt out for a half-hour on a number of days in the week when it would be possible to have the national station.  In the case of BBC, Northern Ireland opts out for about 20 minutes, before the national news.  There could be an opt-out arrangement, as in Cork, for 20 minutes or half an hour.  There could be an opt-out arrangement for half an hour through the cable system within the Dublin region. That can be allowed.  That is what I am looking at and that is what I said I would come back with on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this matter this morning I made my position and that of the Government quite clear.  I am being practical about it when I say that undoubtedly the trawl will indicate a number of people who are anxious to provide a national service.  The Government shall direct the commission at that stage to provide that national service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 16, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  The provisions of Part III of this Act, other than sections 7, 8 and 15, relating to the powers, duties, functions, obligations and responsibilities of the Minister, the Commission and sound broadcasting contractors respectively, shall apply with respect to the television programme service contract entered into by the Commission and the television programme service provided under this Part, and any reference in Part III of this Act to a sound broadcasting contractor shall for the purposes of this Part be construed as a reference to the television programme service contractor.</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding the generality of subsection (1), section 9 (1) (c) shall not apply in the case of the television programme service provided under the television programme service contract.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Commission shall ensure that the television programme service provided under this Act shall in its programming&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole <Col N="1214" /> island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language;</P>
    <P>(b)  uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Consituation, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression;</P>
    <P>(c)  have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular those of such countries which are members of the European Community; and</P>
    <P>(d)  includes a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs programes; </P>
    <P>and the television programme service contractor shall comply with any requirements of the Commission in respect of such matters.</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service is devoted to original programme material produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Communities by persons other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisations.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Subsection (4) states that the commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service is by persons other than the contractor and that it would originate in the State or some other member state of the EC.  As I understood it, the Minister envisaged that a certain proportion of the total output of the station would be home-produced and within that quota a certain proportion would be produced by independent producers and not by the station itself.  This seems to provide only for the latter part.  There does not seem to be any suggestion that the station <Col N="1215" /> should be achieving a certain quota of home-produced material, be it produced in-house or out of house.  I would like the commission to ensure that a reasonable proportion would be home-produced; 50 per cent in the case of RTE has been a very successful recipe for them to step up viewership and to improve their commercial performance.  What we should be talking about is a reasonable proportion being home-produced and within that a reasonable proportion being produced by contractors outside the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have to look at that wording again as the Deputy mentioned that point.  The intention is that there would be a reasonable proportion of home-produced material or, because of European rules, I had to put in &ldquo;or of EC member states&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Reasonable proportion&rdquo; is the phrase used in the directives prepared in the EC and at Council of Europe level.  We have a thriving independent production capacity here at present and we have the potential for an even more successful independent production sector.  I intend to encourage independent production and that is the intention in the amendment before us.  I may have to look at it again in relation to doing the double proportion.  I am not sure that I can.</P>
      <P>In relation to RTE building themselves up to between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of home production, it took them 25 years to achieve that.  I believe they would have been a much more successful station had they got there earlier.  In the light of the threat of competition they have brought themselves to this level.  This is the road that any competition, the independent station, will have to follow also because if they are to be successful and if they are to get the viewership and the advertising which will depend on their viewership figures, they must provide what the public want.  The public have made it clear that what they want is a reasonable proportion of home-produced programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a similar question at an earlier stage regarding what is now being described as a &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo;.  Would the Minister confirm on Report Stage whether he can specify in percentage terms how many would constitute a reasonable proportion?  I feel he cannot do that and that is as close as he could possibly go legally.  As I said, it is an aspiration that people would include home produced material but I think there is some legal obstacle in the way of the Minister specifying precisely how much can be included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister some questions in relation to this.  When we were discussing section 9 in relation to the broadcasting service the Minister was very strong &mdash; and I supported him &mdash; with regard to the minimum requirement of 20 per cent of broadcasting time for news and current affairs for local stations.  Now we are proposing in this section to establish a national television station and we are providing in this Bill under amendment No. 55, section 16 (2) that &ldquo;...subsection (1), section 9 (1) (c) shall not apply in the case of the television programme service provided under the television programme service contract&rdquo;.  We are letting them opt out there completely.  Further on in the amendment we find that &ldquo;(3) The Commission shall ensure that the television programme service provided under this Act shall in its programming ...(d) include a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs programmes; and the television programme service contractor shall comply with any requirements of the Commission in respect of such matters&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems contradictory for the Minister to take a strong view, on which I supported him, that there should be a minimum of 20 per cent of broadcasting time on radio and now come to deal with a national TV station where we are doing away with that requirement and providing that it need be only a &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo;.  I am not sure what obligation is on RTE with regard to the provision of news and current affairs, but I <Col N="1217" /> am reasonably sure that the requirement on them is more than simply providing a reasonable proportion.  I ask the Minister to clarify that and why he feels we should oblige the radio station to provide 20 per cent and not apply a similar criterion to TV, which is generally acknowledged to be a far more powerful medium of communication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 55, section 16 (4), deals with a reasonable proportion of the programme service devoted to original programme material, and the Minister said he may have to look at that.  He mentioned that there was here a flourishing independent production centre &mdash; which there is &mdash; producing excellent material at the moment but it is of very recent origin and still has not grown up into a strong entity and at present relies on the goodwill and general policy of RTE.  If RTE decide to go back into total production of all the material they wish of home originated material, that would deal a fatal blow to the independent producers.  RTE have been very good in encouraging these producers, so this represents major new possibilities for the independent sector where they can grow and flourish.  It represents alternative outlets for them and can ensure that we will be producing material which will subsequently sell at an international level.  That can be very important for strengthening the base of our film industry. The Minister is to look again at the wording of this section, which appears cumbersome at the moment.  I suggest that any changes made should strengthen the position of the contractors producing home material here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole object of the exercise is to ensure we have reasonable proportion of home produced programmes on the independent channel and that a reasonable proportion of that in turn will be of independent production outside the control of the contractor. Therefore, there is a double reasonable proportion which I may have to put in.  I am not sure about that but I will look at it. At the moment there is an independent <Col N="1218" /> production facility here who are doing well but there is potential for a great deal better.  They are getting a good deal of business from RTE who have taken a very enlightened view on it in agreement with their unions, their staff generally and management.  They have been sending out more and more independent productions. This is a healthy move.  It is good for the station as has been proved in the TAM ratings they have been getting for the independent production material.  This new independent TV channel will give a further boost to the independent production sector and they will welcome it.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa asked about a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs in this regard and 20 per cent on radio.  You are dealing with a totally different medium between TV and radio and that is why I have used the phrase &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; here as distinct from a specific proportion.  The Deputy asked what were the obligations under which RTE were operating.  RTE have no obligations whatsoever written into their legislation in relation to a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs and it is essential for the new Channel 3 that there should be a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs, so I have written it in.  What it means in percentage terms is a matter for the commission and I am leaving it to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the legal constraints on &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo;. This is what is going to come out legally binding as a directive from the EC.  That is why I am using the wording &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo;.  It will be legally binding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am clarifying it for the Deputy now.  I will say it again on Report Stage.  A legally binding directive is in course of preparation and nearly finalised in the EC in relation to the whole question of TV and radio, mainly television, trans-frontier TV, satellite etc., and &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; is the phrase <Col N="1219" /> used within that directive.  It is used here because we wanted our legislation to fit in.</P>

      <P>The EC are looking for quotas but we are into reasonable proportion.  That is the compromise that will be accepted.  I was at a Council of Europe meeting in Vienna about two months ago with all the Communications Ministers from around Europe and we had a long discussion on this quota as distinct from reasonable proportion. &ldquo;Reasonable proportion&rdquo; was the phrase accepted as distinct from &ldquo;quota&rdquo;.  I assure Deputy O'Sullivan and the House that the intention is that the independent channel will strive to reach that goal at 40 per cent minimum of the home produced programmes.  If Channel 3 are to be successful, for the reasons I specified they will have to have a high proportion of home produced programmes otherwise they will not get the audience and if they do not get the audience they will not get the advertising.  If the station does not get the advertising they will not survive. It is in their own interest to ensure that there is a high level of good quality home-produced programmes.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service is devoted to original programme material produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Communities by persons other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> Will the Minister explain what is meant by that subsection?  It seems to imply &mdash; I may be misreading it &mdash; that the contractor would be obliged to have a reasonable proportion of his programming done outside his or her organisation and that it may not be done by existing broadcasting organisations.  Presumably that means that RTE will be excluded from providing programmes for the third channel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to encourage independent production capacity here.  RTE have been encouraging home independent production operators.  They have been farming out more and more of their work to independents rather than producing at Montrose. It is the Government's desire to encourage the talent we have here as much as possible.  We want the promoters of Channel 3 rather than doing all the programmes themselves to send out a reasonable proportion to independent producers.  It seems unreasonable to expect Channel 3 to ask RTE to produce programmes on their behalf.  I am anxious that we should develop the independent production capacity here.  We have a great potential for exports in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider the number of new channels that will be introduced in Europe and America.  There will be three new satellite stations in the UK by 1989 and new stations in Luxembourg, Germany and additional satellite stations in the US.  They will need more programmes to keep their schedules filled on the 12 or 24-hour basis they will be operating.  Those stations will have to buy in programmes and we are trying to encourage the independent producing sector, and RTE, to avail of every opportunity to sell programmes to them.  There is potential in the short and long-term for Channel 3, RTE and the independents to form a consortium to sell Irish television programmes worldwide.  That is one area where there could be great co-operation between the new independent channel and RTE.  There should be a joint marketing operation to sell their <Col N="1221" /> programmes worldwide.  The programmes produced here are of a high quality and, therefore are marketable. We should be doing everything to encourage our independent producers and that is what I have in mind in this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the question not to imply that I am objecting to the development of independent programme makers because in my view they have a role to play.  As the Minister said, they have assisted RTE in reaching high viewer figures.  At present RTE sell their programmes to other broadcasting operations. For example, they sell an edited version of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; to Channel 4 and I am sure they market other programmes.  It is not unreasonable to expect that on occasions the new third channel will want to buy programmes shown by RTE, just as RTE 1 and RTE 2 repeat programmes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may, at the request of the Commission and after consultation with Radio Telefís Éireann, require the latter to co-operate with sound broadcasting contractors in the use of any mast, tower, site or other installation or facility needed in connection with the provision of transmission facilities for sound broadcasting services to be established under this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  A sound broadcasting contractor shall make to Radio Telefís Éireann such periodical or other payments in respect of any facilities provided in pursuance of subsection (1) as the Minister, after consultation with Radio Telefís Éireann and the Commission, directs.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete all words after &ldquo;subsection (1)&rdquo; down to the end of the subsection and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;as is necessary to compensate RTE on a commercial basis, where there is disagreement on the sum involved, arbitration shall be arranged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want the commission in deciding the rate of compensation to RTE to pay RTE on a commercial basis.  I do not think RTE should be expected to dip into their own resources in order to provide facilities to independent sound broadcasters. The compensation should be on commercial basis and where there is agreement on the sum involved arbitration should be arranged.  In my view that is only fair.  We have been talking all day about reasonable treatment for everybody involved and if RTE are to bear the cost of maintaining these facilities they should be allowed to charge on a commercial basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the thrust of the amendment is that there will be this type of co-operation, but any such co-operation shall be rendered on a commercial basis.  The expectation is that an operator who seeks a facility will work out directly with RTE the terms on which it will be made available and that arrangement will simply be given an imprimatur by the Minister.  If agreement on terms cannot be reached, the Minister, after consultation with RTE and the commission who will be acting on behalf of the contractor, determines the appropriate amount to be paid.  It should be noted that while legally the Minister would be the arbiter there would be nothing to prevent the Minister of the day from appointing and taking advice from a professional arbitrator.  The Deputy's concern is covered in my amendment.  There is no intention that <Col N="1224" /> the commission will go in with the backing of the Minister to take over the facilities of RTE.  This will be done on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>

      <P>It should also be possible under the section to extend this facility to the training of student broadcasters. RTE have acquired a lot of expertise which should be used to the best advantage.  It could be done on a commercial basis.  Any independent station who would want to train technicians, broadcasters and producers should be allowed to do so.  RTE should be allowed to market their services.  It would be a means of generating further revenue.</P>

RTE could train people for channel 3 and other stations around the world.  Amendment No. 52 and the further amendment from Deputy Bruton refer to the facilities of RTE &mdash; masts, towers, etc.  They do not relate to people.  The suggestion by Deputy O'Sullivan has much merit and if RTE come to me with such a proposal I will be delighted to encourage them. They do not need my approval.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister perceive this matter arising?  It seems we are inserting an obligation on RTE to co-operate with other sound broadcasting organisations.  It does not apply to television.  We are not putting a similar obligation on other broadcasting organisations to do likewise for RTE if they are seeking to use a facility, site, mast or tower which another organisation have.  How does the Minister justify putting an obligation on RTE and not on other organisations?  How does he see the matter being referred to him?</P>

      <P>RTE because of their history have the prime sites around the country.  International arrangements which are binding under treaty not only specify the frequency but in many cases <Col N="1225" /> the siting of the masts.  They have been sited by RTE in the positions arranged under the international frequency agreements to which we subscribe.  We are bound by these treaties and if we want to use these frequencies we must use the positions RTE already have.  RTE have developed these facilities over the 60 years of their existence.  The possibility of reciprocal arrangements does not arise.  It will be one-way traffic towards RTE, but not at RTE's expense.  They will have to be compensated on a commercial basis for their co-operation with the commission and the services they will be providing.</P>

      <P>I refer to the Minister's amendment regarding the use by private contractors of towers or masts belonging to RTE.  This is a very significant amendment which has major implications in regard to the capital cost of setting up independent stations and also in regard to the quality of reception.  There is also an environmental aspect.  None of us wants a proliferation of unnecessary masts and towers around the country.  I can see major conflicts arising.  I do not believe the Minister's amendment is worded sufficiently tightly.  It refers to any mast, tower, site or other installation or facility needed.  Who is to define whether it is needed or not?  What are the criteria?  I do not think it is a question of the frequency.  Is it a question of reception area or does the question of costcutting come into it?  I can see conflict arising in a variety of areas.  The independent broadcaster could possibly start off in a cheap way by using an expensive RTE mast.  I can also see RTE for one reason or another putting up major objections to this.  While the Minister has built in a type of arbitration as far as the cost is concerned, he should seek to build <Col N="1226" /> in some sort of arbitration or decision-making mechanism as to whether the site of the mast or tower is needed.  Otherwise I can see major problems of conflict.</P>

There could be delaying tactics.  These people represent opposition to RTE and I do not suppose RTE will go out of their way to facilitate them. The Minister, by building in some sort of arbitration system, would avoid many difficulties for the commission.</P>

I cannot understand why we should persist with this levy.  The Restrictive Practices Commission referred to this when they looked at the cable system in Dublin and they indicated it was anomalous to have this levy.  I do not see why the subscribers to the cable system should have to pay a licence fee and an additional levy.  I do not see why that levy should be there, whether it be payable to RTE or to this commission.  I felt the Minister's thinking in the past was that this levy should go and I am somewhat puzzled at his decision to sustain the levy on cable subscribers and to use it in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to thank you for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  My request was occasioned by the appearance of a news item in today's issue of a daily newspaper.  The item was small in size but very large in its implications and ramifications for the Third World.  I want to afford the Minister of State present an opportunity to clarify the statement attributed to him when speaking in Brussels yesterday.  I hope he will indicate to the House that he was misunderstood, misquoted or indeed misinterpreted and that far from posing a further threat to Ireland's overseas development aid the Government will restore it to the percentage of the gross national product it was before they took office.</P>
      <P>All relief agencies must surely feel threatened and indeed horrified that the Government are about to launch a further attack on the poorest of the poor. Indeed this sentiment was re-echoed in a Trócaire paper published last October.  It stated that a very serious threat hangs over the future of Ireland's programme. It is clear that if these proposed cuts are implemented and cuts of the same magnitude follow next year it will effectively mean the end of the bilaterial programme. I sincerely hope I am wrong in interpreting the Minister's statement as an attempt to condition the people for further massive cuts in overseas development aid, preparing the ground, laying down markers so to speak, for the total and complete abolition of the overseas development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have thought that the present Fianna Fáil Government had done enough damage already to ODA and that for their remaining period in office, be it long or short, they would have the common decency to treat that Vote as sacrosanct, that despite our own economic difficulties, and I would be the first to admit that we have such, we as a nation would not literally take bread out of the mouth of the most vulnerable section of humanity.  Believe it or not, that in essence is what we are doing.  We <Col N="1231" /> are turning our backs on the poorest of the poor.</P>
    <P>Famine relief always finds a sensitive and sympathetic response in the hearts of all Irishmen.  Perhaps it is a throwback to our own disastrous famine in the mid-1840s and the fact that we were colonised for over 700 years and, like the underprivileged of today's Third World, we too knew the yoke of slavery, deprivation, hunger and victimisation.</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out in 1985, 83 per cent of Irish people supported the principle that the Government should at least maintain, if not increase, their aid to the Third World.  Given the problem at present besetting our country &mdash; 19 per cent unemployed, high taxation, increasing poverty, rising emigration, the highest birth rate in the EC, the high dependency ratio of old and young &mdash; the Irish people are known to be among the nations most concerned about the people in the Third World.  The magnificent response and support given to Bob Geldof in Band Aid and Live Aid, the highest contribution <i>per capita</i> in the EC, amply confirm these findings.  We also make magnificent contributions through Trocaire and Concern and a host of other relief agencies.  This help is given willingly by the Irish people for the relief of those in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Irish people believe in the essential dignity of people and in their capacity to overcome the problems and pressures which can crush or exploit them.  In the pastoral letter on development, issued by the Irish Catholic Bishops on 2 February 1973 on the setting up of Trócaire, the Catholic agency for world development, the basic moral and Christian reasons for an Irish development policy were clearly stated and in a bold assertion of international equity and justice they declared:</P>
    <P>The earth and its good things belong to all the people of the earth and no nation has the right to build its own property upon the misery of others.  It is our Christian duty as individuals to share our wealth and to help our needy brothers.  It is equally our Christian duty to demand that the political authorities representing us act always with justice and responsibility towards less <Col N="1232" /> fortunate countries and be prepared to use all means necessary for this end. </P>
    <P>Surely against this background of moral authority the Government could seek and expect to get the consent of the Irish people not only to maintain but to increase their overseas development aid contributions.  In this regard the Government must surely stand indicated, be guilty of moral cowardice and out of touch with the feelings and true sentiments of the Irish people.  Contrast this attitude with that of the former Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant achievements of the Fine Gael Party when in Government was their absolute commitment to overseas development aid as evidenced by the establishment, for the first time in our history, of a Ministry of State for Development Co-Operation. Coupled to this was the undertaking to advance in a phased manner towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of our gross national product which resulted, in spite of the difficult economic situation which then existed, in a record allocation of £43 million to overseas development aid in the last year in office.</P>
    <P>If any one action of Fianna Fáil in Government epitomised their uncaring and insensitive nature, it is their reneging on this commitment.  The massive £11 million cuts as disclosed in the Estimates for 1988 amount to the virtual total dismantling of the overseas development aid programme and have left a trail of anger, confusion and disbelief in all the relief agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government have reneged on many of their statutory and voluntary commitments.  The bilaterial aid programme has been slashed by a massive £4 million which must assuredly cause death and hardship in four of the world's poorest countries &mdash; the Sudan, Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia &mdash; with which we have bilaterial arrangements.  The grantin-aid to Gorta, an organisation which has been doing such trojan work, has been discontinued.  The disaster relief has been reduced from over £500,000 to a derisory £1,000.  The world food programme has also been dismantled.  The litany of cuts and reductions continues <Col N="1233" /> and it must leave our international reputation as a caring and concerned people sullied and tarnished.</P>
    <P>The reputation of our international obligations must reduce substantially our moral authority and weaken our voice on all world fora.  These cuts could not have come at a worse time for the Third World.  The debt crisis continues unabated and continues to constrain development in many parts of the Third World.  These countries are caught in ths spiral of indebtedness, inflation, failing crops, natural disasters and internal strife, all militating against a resolution of their problems and the recipient country only sinking lower and lower into debt and despair.  It is estimated that the total indebtedness of the Third World countries now amounts to the horrendous figure of $1.19 trillion.  Nothing short of global action by the developing countries can bring hope to these countries and Ireland should give the moral lead to the rest of the world rather than betraying further its Christian ideals.</P>
    <P>These cuts and the proposed cuts are taking place against the background of more than 250,000 young children dying weekly from preventable causes and our response has been less than enthusiastic to their horrific plight, as witnessed by our contribution to the Grand Alliance for Children sponsored by UNICEF. Against this background we have the scandalous food surplus in Europe, and especially in the EC.  It is estimated that EC stocks amount to 1.4 million tonnes of butter, 1.3 million tonnes of skim milk powder, about 500,000 tonnes of beef, 16 million tonnes of cereals and 33 million hectolitres of wine, not to mention other products like sugar and tobacco.  These figures are staggering and scandalous. While mothers and children die of starvation in Sub-Saharan Africa, crops are deliberately destroyed in the northern hemisphere to maintain prices, and land is deliberately kept fallow.  Ireland, rather than reneging on its Christian responsibility, should be the front runner in exerting its moral influence on the development world and respond decisively to alleviate world hunger and famine, but how can it do that when its moral authority is being undermined by <Col N="1234" /> a continuing reduction of its overseas development aid?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to state categorically and to confirm his Department's position in respect of the forthcoming Estimates for 1989 and to dispel any doubts that have arisen from his statement.  Not only I but all the relief agencies await his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the points made by Deputy Griffin but, unfortunately, I did not hear one solid suggestion as to what he and his party would like to do. First, let me set the record straight with regard to the comments I made at the press briefing in Brussels yesterday on future budget allocations for the overseas development aid.  The short article in today's newspaper has a misleading title, and the statement attributed to me regarding further cuts in the aid budget does not reflect what was actually said but rather derives from conclusions of the writer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Griffin confused the situation even further by misquoting a very important word in the article when he asked for permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The article stated:</P>
      <P>The Government's grant aid to Third World countries could face further cuts next year...</P>
      <P>Deputy Griffin, for whatever reason, when asking for permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment used the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;could&rdquo;.  I presume that it was just a misreading of the article &mdash; at least, I hope that it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government are seeking further cuts in public expenditure generally.  That is common knowledge.  Discussions in regard to the 1989 ODA Estimates have not yet commenced and there is no indication of what the 1989 allocation will be.  The ODA allocation, like other public expenditure programmes, will be considered in the context of overall budgetary proposals for next year.  However, let me reiterate that the Government are aware of and sympathetic to the needs of developing countries.  They will be as generous as <Col N="1235" /> economic circumstances permit.  I shall do my utmost to maintain the current allocation as a minimum.</P>
    <P>Government policy remains one of commitment to the maintainance and expansion of official development assistance &mdash; ODA &mdash; as soon as economic circumstances permit.  While there is a reduction of £11 million in the 1988 allocation compared with that of 1987, as mentioned by Deputy Griffin, all commitments are being met.  I do not want to be political about something as important as this, but in fairness I should say that the Deputy and his party agreed to the general Estimates that were put before the Dáil.  That fact makes quite a number of the remarks he made a little hypocritical.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that, despite the reduction in ODA allocations in 1988, we are still providing a basic programme of assistance to our priority and partner countries.  In addition to continuing our support to ongoing projects in the priority countries mentioned by Deputy Griffin &mdash; Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia &mdash; we continue to support projects in the partner countries such as Burundi, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.  I had the opportunity of visiting projects in Lesotho and Tanzania earlier this year. I was very pleased to note the quality and practical benefits of the programme in which we are engaged.  I saw for myself that the current range of projects is being adequately funded and progressing towards the achievement of the objectives, which all include the training of local management in the skills of expatriate managers, so that the projects can become self-supporting in due course.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my appreciation of and thanks to all those development workers who are engaged both in the bilateral programme and in work for the NGOs.  They do the country proud.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw attention to the fact that, despite our economic difficulties, funding has been provided, albeit at a <Col N="1236" /> reduced level, for co-financing projects with non-governmental organisations and the other elements of the bilateral aid programme, such as development education, research, fellowship programmes and support for courses in Ireland.  Thus, the range of assistance under the bilateral aid programme has been maintained, even if individual allocations have had to be reduced.</P>
    <P>I listened to a number of the points made by the Deputy about meeting commitments. I do not want to be political, but I should like to point out something to the Deputy.  The last Government's promises in relation to ODA for the period 1985-87 as outlined in their economic plan, &ldquo;Building On Reality&rdquo;, were not adhered to.  I should like to remind Deputy Griffin that the plan promised an annual increase in ODA of 0.015 per cent of GNP for each year of the plan.  I am sure that economic circumstances, then as now, were the cause of the reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">

      <P>Yes.  The technical specifications for MMDS laid down by my Department will require operators to comply with the guidelines laid down by the international Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee of the International Radiation Protection <Col N="993" /> Association (IRPA) on the limits to exposure to radio frequency magnetic fields in the frequency range 100 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz.</P>
      <P>The IRPA, in co-operation with the Environmental Health Division of the World Health Organisation has undertaken responsibility for the development of health criteria documents on non-ionizing radiation.  These form part of the World Health Organisation Environmental Health Criteria Programme which is funded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  The body also has the support of the International Labour Office and the Commission of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the IRPA guidelines which were approved in June 1987 are to protect human health from the potentially harmful effects of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation.  The guidelines contain various exposure limits which are based on scientific data and no consideration was given to economic impact of other non-scientific priorities and they should provide, from presently available knowledge, a safe healthy working or living environment from exposure to RF radiation under all normal working conditions.</P>
      <P>Under the IRPA guidelines the general public exposure limit at the frequency range to be used for MMDS &mdash; 2.5 gigahertz &mdash; is a field power density of 10 watts per square metre.  This is the limit for the general public and has been arrived at taking into account that the general public comprises individuals of all ages and different health status and that the general public can be exposed 24 hours a day and over the whole lifetime&mdash; and the operation of MMDS transmitters will be at levels well below those guidelines.</P>
      <P>I am totally satisfied that the MMDS system will be fully safe in its operation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to Articles 30 to 39 of the EURATOM Treaty which deal with health and safety.  The obligations imposed by these articles are not very specific and this probably reflects current attitudes when the Treaty was drawn up in 1957.  I am not aware of any current breach of the Treaty by the British authorities and the Deputy may be assured that if I were, I would pursue the matter vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the experiment proposed for the Trawsfynydd plant last February was a matter to which the procedures <Col N="998" /> in Article 34 of the EURATOM Treaty should be applied.  I immediately requested the Commission, simultaneously with a decision by the Commission itself, to investigate the circumstances in which the experiment was to be carried out and to apply the procedures of Article 34.  At the same time the Attorney General was requested to prepare a legal case to protect our interests in the event that the experiment was to take place.</P>

      <P>The private forestry grant system has recently been improved by the addition of two new schemes and the improvement of existing schemes.  The level of grant assistance available is considered very generous, especially in the disadvantaged areas where grants of up to 85 per cent of costs are payable.  Last year, State and private planting combined reached a record level of over 11,000 hectares.  An encouraging development in recent years has been the increasing part played by the private sector in the expansion of national planting. This year national planting is expected to exceed 13,000 hectares.  I am confident that planting of this order will guarantee adequate timber supplies for the future.</P>

      <P>Construction of the north-eastern pipeline has commenced and will be completed by the end of the year.  The pipeline will run from Abbotstown through the North Dublin area to Ballough and then on to Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dundalk Gas Company, Bord Gáis Éireann have decided that the acquisition of the company would not be economically justified.  This decision was based on a detailed technical and commercial evaluation of the utility.  Dundalk Gas Company were not in a position to renew their public liability insurance on 12 May and indicated that the company would have to close at short notice.  In order to protect the utility's consumers from hardship, Bord Gáis Éireann have been directed to arrange for the orderly shutdown of the gas system and the conversion of consumers' appliances to other fuels.  BGE have reached agreement with Dundalk Gas on this matter, and the closure and conversion process will commence shortly.  Insurance cover has already been arranged by Bord Gáis.  The approach adopted here is the same as that previously used by BGE in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Industries and commercial enterprises in the Dundalk area will be connected, where appropriate, to natural gas via the north-eastern pipeline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board carry out an environmental monitoring programme which is designed to determine the levels of radiation in the Irish environment so that the potential exposure to members of the public can be assessed.</P>
      <P>The boards' monitoring programme includes air sampling at two Meteorological Stations at Valentia and Dublin and at the board's laboratory at Clonskeagh. Sampling of rainwater is undertaken at six meteorological stations &mdash; at Belmullet, Valentia, Roche's Point, Rosslare, Mullingar and Dublin.</P>
      <P>The average annual dose from naturally occurring radiation is about 2,000 microsieverts.  Radioactivity levels in the air have now returned to the levels that existed prior to the Chernobyl accident.</P>
      <P>The most significant source of radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment is the discharge of radioactive effluent from Sellafield to the Irish Sea.  The board collect samples of sea water, sediment, seaweed, fish and shellfish routinely from selected locations around the Irish coastline and these are analysed at the board's laboratory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated radiation dose resulting from the consumption of fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea to the average consumer of fish in 1987 was about two microsieverts compared with the maximum annual dose limit of 1,000 microsieverts recommended by the International Commission for Radiological Protection (ICRP).  Those consuming large amounts of fish and shellfish would have received doses of about 11 microsieverts. While the results show that levels of contamination are not significant from the point of view of health to the <Col N="1007" /> Irish public, it is, of course, the Government's view that any level of discharges from Sellafield is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in replies to questions on 3 March and 28 April, a national survey on the levels of naturally occurring radon in Irish homes is being carried out and the results to date show that most homes in Ireland do not have significant radon levels.  It would be premature to comment on the extent of any problem in this area until the survey has been completed.</P>
    <P>As regard dumping of radioactive waste in the marine environment, no such dumping has taken place since 1982.  The dumping which took place prior to that took place about 790 km off our south west coast.  No increased levels of radiation have been detected in Irish waters on foot of that dumping.  I will continue to work within the context of such bodies as the London Dumping Convention to ensure that dumping of radioactive waste at sea is not recommended.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 56, 57 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the VAT regime which applies to farmers in Ireland sales of livestock <Col N="1010" /> may be subject to either the flat-rate addition of 1.4 per cent where the farmer is not registered for VAT or the equivalent livestock rate where the seller is VAT-registered.  The flat-rate addition system does not apply to direct sales of livestock by unregistered farmers to foreign buyers so the question of a VAT repayment to such buyers does not arise.</P>
    <P>Where livestock are sold by registered persons to foreign buyers the tax charge of 1.4 per cent is refundable to the foreign buyer subject to certain conditions.  This is in line with the VAT provisions applicable to businesses generally under EC rules.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of such refunds to foreign livestock buyers in 1987 was £1.4 million.  The greater part of this sum is estimated to have been paid to buyers established in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards abuse the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are not aware of any abuses of the type referred to by the Deputy.  If, however, the Deputy has information concerning any such abuses, the commissioners have assured me that they will investigate the matter if he would be good enough to provide them with the necessary details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 64 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The EC common organisation of the market in beef provides for a number of support measures such as intervention, aids to private storage, premia and export refunds which are designed to assist cattle and beef producers and processors.  The interaction of a series of complex measures such as these can, when taken in conjunction with other factors such as market exchange rates and &ldquo;green&rdquo; rates, give rise to marginal distortions in some subsectors of the industry, some favourable and some adverse.  However, in the overall context, these measures are of significant benefit to Irish agriculture and our economy generally.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy is to maintain regular contact with the trade interests involved and with the EC institutions with a view to eliminating adverse anomalies as the opportunity arises.</P>
      <P>Exports of live cattle have been declining in recent years and exports in 1987 were the lowest in modern times.  I am anxious to ensure that live cattle exports are reduced even further so that the extra benefits derived from deboning, cutting up and processing the beef can be generated within the Irish economy. However, any specific action by the Government has to be taken within the limitations of Community law.  There is little scope here for unilateral national action &mdash; and there is a very large industry to imperil by ill-considered action.  Every effort is being made to have all negative anomalies satisfactorily resolved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the views of the Government on whether the falling cattle numbers and the continued export of live cattle together with restrictions on imports, pose a serious threat to the further development of the beef industry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it of prime importance that the decline in cattle numbers is reversed.  There are clear indications that the national cow herd is <Col N="1014" /> recovering; the fall in beef cow numbers has been arrested and the December 1987 livestock enumeration showed the beef cow herd to be at its highest level since 1980; cow slaughterings in 1987 were the lowest for four years; this trend has continued in 1988 with slaughterings in the first four months 18,000 or 20 per cent lower than slaughterings during the same period in 1987; AI usage has increased by about 10 per cent in the first three months of 1988 over the same period in 1987.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, allied to these favourable indicators, the very favourable prices for both cattle and calves which have been available in recent months and the favourable market outlook will convince increasing numbers of farmers to expand their beef cow herds. Attractive schemes are in place to encourage them to do so.  In seeking ways to accelerate the upward trend, I must have regard to the present very difficult budgetary situation and the constraints imposed by EC rules of competition.</P>
      <P>Live cattle exports have been declining in recent years and the 1987 figure of some 234,000 head was the lowest annual figure recorded in modern times.  While some increase in live exports to Northern Ireland has taken place so far this year, I am confident that the overall trend will continue downwards.</P>

Strawberry plants are grown under conditions designed to ensure that, as far as is practicable, stocks certified under my Department's Certification Scheme are healthy. Absolute guarantees of freedom from harmful organisms obviously cannot be, and are not, given.  Furthermore, for example, the disorder June Yellows is latent in the variety Cambridge Favourite and plants exhibiting symptoms of it are not certified under the scheme.  The position is, as in other countries, that a guarantee that the disorder will not show up in apparently healthy stocks at some future date cannot be given.  In the circumstances, the question of compensation does not arise.</P>

      <P>The person concerned originally applied for invalidity pension in March 1987.

Unfortunately, on two occasions when arrangements for examination had been <Col N="1017" /> made, the examinations had to be cancelled.</P>
      <P>When the person concerned was eventually examined, the medical referee was of the opinion that he could not be considered to be permanently incapable of work and was not therefore entitled to an invalidity pension.

He was subsequently examined on 27 May 1988.</P>

      <P>The Cork (County Borough and County) Traffic and Parking By-Laws 1986 made by the Garda Commissioner <Col N="1020" /> in 1986, following consultation with the Cork local authorities, and subsequently confirmed by me provide for the issue of residents parking discs by Cork Corporation. The fee prescribed in the by-laws for such discs is £35.</P>
      <P>I understand that the corporation have asked the Garda Commissioner to amend the by-laws to provide for a lower fee and I have already indicated to the commissioner that I am favourably disposed to this amendment.  I await the submission of the amending by-laws for my formal confirmation.</P>

      <P> (a)  Objectives</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee was set up to examine and make recommendations on future policies, including the form of funding, for third-level education.</P>
      <P>(b)  Membership and manner of appointment</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list of members is as follows: Dr. D.F. Ó Ceallacháin, Department of Education, Chairman; Mr. N. Lindsay, Department of Education; Mr. S. Nolan, Department of Education; Ms. Agnes Aylward, Department of Industry and <Col N="1029" /> Commerce; Mr. J. Corcoran, Department of Labour; Mr. F.

    <P>Following a Government decision that I, as Minister for Education, should bring forward proposals, including terms of reference, for the setting up of such an interdepartmental committee the above committee were duly appointed.  Because of their statutory responsibilities in the area of third level education, the Higher Education Authority were also invited to be represented on the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications of the decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in the vocational, community and comprehensive schools sector have been under examination by the Central Review Committee established under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The 1988-89 teaching staff allocations in <Col N="1030" /> respect of vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools must await consideration of the outcome of that examination.</P>
      <P>The selection of national schools for inclusion in my Department's special scheme of aid for schools serving disadvantaged areas is based on the particular circumstances of individual schools and not in relation to a general area.  For this reason, it would not be possible to accede to the proposal for disadvantaged status for the Tallaght area as a whole.</P>

      <P>The principal point to emerge from the most recent discussions with the authorities of Glenbrien national school, County Wexford, was that the school is prepared to provide from its own resources the full cost of a general purposes area in the proposed new school building.  My Department would then grant-aid in the normal way the low cost classroom element of the project.  The schedule of the project's ancillary accommodation and the nature and extent of necessary site works have yet to be settled.  It is not my Department's practice to disclose the financial details of individual projects the subject of grant applications, such information being considered to be confidential as between the school authorities and my Department.</P>
      <P>I shall arrange to have the Deputy informed of developments when discussions with the school authorities have been completed.</P>
