      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 8 and 16.  It is also proposed that the proceedings on Nos. 7 and 8, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m., today respectively, by one question which shall be put from the Chair in each case and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare, respectively, and that any speeches in the course of the debate on either motion shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that the Report and Final Stages of No. 16, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that at the conclusion of business today the Dáil shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday 19 April, 1988.  May I ask therefore, if the proposals for dealing with Nos. 7 and 8 are agreed?</P>

      <P>I want to register my objection to the Order of Business today.  It came as a complete surprise to <Col N="974" /> us this morning.  We were not advised of a change in the Order of Business and that No. 7 was being taken.  We will probably have three quarters of an hour only to deal with it.  It is absolutely shameful that when we are rising for three weeks a matter like this has to be dealt with in three quarters of an hour.  I already objected to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1988</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 16th March, 1988.</P>
      <P>Subsections (2) and (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provide that the Minister for Health may vary the income ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual in a particular contribution year.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of section 9 of the Act requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution has been passed by each House approving of the draft regulations.  The draft regulations now before the House shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £15,000, and it is proposed to increase <Col N="978" /> this to £15,500.  In determining the proposed increase in the income ceiling, I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the most recent information available regarding the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1987 when the average figure was £196.76, which was an increase of 5.2 per cent on the June 1986 figure of £186.92.  When this percentage increase is applied to the current £15,000 ceiling, a new ceiling of £15,780 emerges.  However, it is proposed to set the new ceiling at £15,500, which is more in line with the 3.2 per cent increase in the CPI to mid-August 1987. The effect of this increase in the ceiling is to increase the maximum amount of health contributions payable by persons with incomes in excess of £15,000 per annum, who will pay only an additional £6.25.  Persons with incomes of £15,000, or less, will not be affected by this increase.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the income ceiling will bring in about an additional £1 million in the contribution year 1988-89. Of this, about £250,000 should arise in the financial year 1988.  The balance of the additional yield, about £750,000, will come in the first quarter of 1989.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of current health contributions from all sectors.  The health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from farmers, for periods up to 6 April 1984.  The total amount owed by farmers to health boards at 31 December 1987 was about £5.7 million. While the amount which is still outstanding is a cause for concern, there has been an encouraging response to the efforts of the health boards to recover these arrears.  A total of £1.4 million was collected in 1985, £1.1 million in 1986 and a further £426,000 in 1987.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that health boards can retain these arrears, including any arrears collected in future years, as additional revenue to be applied to local health services' needs, and the health <Col N="979" /> boards have now initiated legal proceedings to recover arrears wherever this is appropriate.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Health (Hospital In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1984, came into effect on 1 June 1984.  These regulations allowed for an admission charge of £100 &mdash; which sum was subsequently increased to £150 on 1 July 1986 &mdash; to be levied on persons admitted for hospital in-patient treatment in a public hospital who are in arrears with health contributions.  This has proved to be quite an effective measure in inducing defaulters to pay their health contributions. However, I should mention that persons in arrears are not refused admission to hospitals, but the collection of the admission charge and the arrears is pursued later.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that outstanding arrears should be collected as soon as possible as it is clearly unfair that those who do not honour their obligations with regard to health contributions should continue to obtain health services at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government have decided to change the basis of income tax assessment for the self-employed and to extend liability to this sector for PRSI contributions.  They have also stated their intention to apply the same assessment, collection and enforcement procedures as will apply henceforth to income tax also to PRSI health contributions and to youth employment levies paid by the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to take this opportunity of informing the House that I am at present having regulations drawn up in my Department to give effect to this decision in relation to health contributions. When these regulations, together with other appropriate legislative provisions sponsored by the Ministers for Finance and Labour, are in place, health contributions together with PRSI and the youth employment levy will be aggregated with a self-employed individual's income tax liability and will be demanded and collected in a single <Col N="980" /> sum.  At the same time the regulations which I propose to make will, in accordance with the budget announcement, also provide for the deduction of capital allowances in the calculation of the reckonable income of self-employed persons who are liable for health contributions.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Deputies will welcome the main thrust of these measures which will, to a very great extent, streamline the assessment and collection of tax, levy, PRSI and, what I am primarily concerned with in these regulations, health contributions, by removing any duplication at present inherent in the assessment and collection system.  The individual taxpayer will also benefit from being able to discharge his full taxation and contribution liability to the State in one transaction.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free consultants' services.  I am not, as yet, in a position to say what the limit will be.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy to accept what the Minister has said but in reality a further £1 million is being taken from the public this year for an inferior health service.  Along with the £1 million, many health boards are implementing an administrative charge for services to which people are legally entitled.  I will be dealing with that briefly in a few moments.  In fact people will be paying more for a diminishing health service. We have seen graphic evidence in recent times of the consequences of the Minister's hamfisted attitude and actions.  The poor, the old and the handicapped are being deprived of a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the last month or so that the consequence of the Minister's decisions have come to public attention.  We have seen evidence of that in Ennis Hospital and the children's hospital in Crumlin. When the North Infirmary in Cork was closed an assurance was given by the Minister that we would get an adequate casualty service there but the medical staff are complaining that the service is <Col N="981" /> dangerously low.  The Mercy Hospital is overcrowded, staff are at a cracking point and the Southern Health Board state that the accident and emergency service at the Regional Hospital in Cork is not in a position to cater for the demands being made on it.  We have longer waiting lists, an inferior service and doctors and nurses under great stress because of the pressures being put on them.  Hospital equipment is not being replaced or repaired because of a shortage of money.</P>
    <P>Administrative charges are being imposed by some health boards on those who apply for hospital services cards and E1 11 cards.  People are legally entitled to those cards but health boards are imposing a charge for the processing of applications for them.  Some weeks ago the Minister told the House that the Department would investigate the legality of such charges and I wonder what they have decided.  The Southern Health Board have made a reduction in the charges but not removed them altogether.</P>
    <P>Our people will be paying £1 million more to the Government next year as well as having to pay more for private insurance cover.  It is not surprising that there has been a dramatic increase in the membership of the VHI because the people cannot get the public service they are entitled to.  In the public sector there are long waiting lists and that has led to a growth in private medicine.</P>
    <P>A recent report by the Southern Health Board showed that some of the consultants in that area are indulging in 50 per cent of private practice in public hospitals.  That has arisen because people are being forced away from the public health services.  I should like to ask the Minister, before he imposes any charges, to bring negotiations on the common contract to a conclusion.  Those negotiations have been going on for some time and we have all heard of the widespread abuses of the common contract.  The softly softly attitude of the Minister towards his colleagues must be condemned. We have a small percentage of consultants who are milking the system for all it is worth but the Minister is not doing anything about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> Community services have deteriorated in the last 12 months to such an extent that the unemployed are being asked to pay their travelling expenses to hospitals. In the last 12 months the Minister has succeeded in reducing the quality of the service.  I do not accept that the fact that the number of acute beds per one thousand of our population is up to the standard in other European countries is an indication that everything is in order. There is evidence of a crisis in our hospital services.  Our poor people are suffering.  Those who can afford to pay for medical treatment can obtain it within a matter of days while the poor, and those who must depend on the public service, have to wait months and, in some cases, years.</P>
    <P>Staff in the health services are demoralised and the Minister has succeeded in developing a two-tiered health system, one for the rich and one for the poor.  I must repeat, because the Minister has not contradicted my statement, that deaths have occurred because of the cutbacks. Last year I was challenged by the Minister for Finance to produce evidence of that.  I gave evidence of a case in County Waterford and it has not been refuted.  I have been waiting five months for a reply to that statement.</P>
    <P>The Government have played a great confidence trick on our people in promising an efficient health service.  Our people have to contend with a very inefficient service.  When the Minister took office he did not have any policy for the health services and we are now suffering as a result.  Before he imposes any further charges on the public the Minister should produce a comprehensive health care policy.  The objective of a health policy should be to provide a modern health service for the population with the best quality that is available, to provide accessibility to the service on the basis of need rather than on the basis of demand which can be unduly influenced by income or geography.  To make the system efficient, effective and flexible we must ensure that the best use is made of the limited resources available.</P>
    <P>I am flabbergasted to think that the <Col N="983" /> Minister has not challenged the bureaucratic nature of management in our health services.  He has not done anything about our health boards.  In my view the eight health boards pursue their own policies. I have evidence of people being refused a benefit by one health board and being told that they were entitled to it in another area.  We have different standards, mismanagement and over-management but the Minister has refused to tackle those problems.  In my view the reason the Minister has refused to tackle the eight health boards is that they are political vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that there is gross mismanagement in our hospital services but the Minister has closed his mind to reports of internal committees of boards of management in our hospitals.  We have had a lot of lip service about what the Department were doing in regard to community care but I have not seen any evidence of that.  In fact, community care is at a dangerously low level.  Staff are not being replaced.  We are agreeing to the motions today with reluctance but I should like to warn the Minister that he must come forward with a comprehensive health care policy sooner rather than later.  The public are demanding it. People are suffering as a result of the cutbacks in the last 12 months.  We are at crisis point.</P>
    <P>I support the calls for the setting up of an all-party committee of the House to investigate our health services.  We cannot depend on the Minister, or his Department, because what happened to those services in the last 12 months was as a consequence of the Minister's decisions.  We have to depend on the doctors and nurses for our information. An all-party committee should carry out an investigation into the consequence of the Minister's decisions in the last 12 months.  I will not pursue those matters further because of the limited time for the debate on these motions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Deputy Allen for the setting up of an all-party committee to investigate our health <Col N="984" /> services.  It is badly needed and Members should be more involved in policy formulation in areas such as health and education. They are appropriate areas for Members to be involved in the decision-making process.  Many criticisms have been levelled at the Minister for Health but, generally speaking, he is doing a good job and I should like to compliment him on that.  Many of the changes he has made were badly needed but it is important that any further changes are made within the context of the budget allocation voted by the House some months ago.</P>
      <P>However, when choices have to be made in hospitals as between bureaucracy and the provision of additional staff to provide a service to the public the cutbacks should first fall on the administrative and bureaucratic side.  I am not at all convinced that that has been done to the maximum possible extent.  I agree with Deputy Allen's comments about the need for rationalisation of our health boards.  We do not need eight health boards.  In the main they consist of political appointees with the result that decisions are often made not on the basis of what is in the best interests of the health care of the people but on the basis of political instructions.  If one county or one region has more representatives on a health board than an adjoining county or region very often a decision is made to keep a hospital or a service going in the county with the maximum number of representatives on the board.  The decision may bear no relation whatsoever to the need involved and the best interests of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many decisions are made purely on the basis of the political interests of the day and that is not good enough.  Those who shout loudest, who lobby most vociferously, get their way by putting pressure on the various political representatives who sit on these boards.  Generally speaking, the county or region with the greatest influence on the health boards will get its way against another area that might need the service more.  The Minister should look at the whole question of the health <Col N="985" /> boards structure, at their make-up, the need to rationalise the number of health boards and ensure that we do not have a health care system which is administered essentially at local and regional level by politicians.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Dublin local health committee, now defunct or almost defunct, and I am not sorry that it is going or gone.  I found it a most useless body. The information that could be got at such a committee could have been easily available with an efficient system of administration in the health boards by picking up a telephone or writing a letter. Invariably, the meetings consisted of councillors putting down questions about when certain buildings were going to be opened, or when a certain person would get into hospital.  Besides being a waste of time for the members, including myself, it was an enormous waste of time for the many health care workers who had to attend and staff these meetings and compile the information to deal with the various questions scheduled to come before the committee.  There was a cost involved in having meetings.  While the cost of travel to and from the committees in the Dublin area would not be high because the distances were short, in other parts of the country people had to travel long distances involving a totally unjustified waste of money.</P>
    <P>The increases in the health contributions represent an increase of £1 million in taxation.  Those of us who have looked at Mr. Lawson's proposals and the analyses of them in some of our papers and the comparisons made between our tax system and the British one will see very clearly that the disincentive effect of increases in taxation here have enormous implications.  Many are leaving this country today who have or could have jobs here but are choosing to go because of the high levels of taxation being taken from incomes.  We must seriously consider this matter in the context of the overall development of the economy and of giving people an incentive to work and to work harder. Increases in taxation of any kind, whether in the form of health contributions or <Col N="986" /> whatever, are all forms of taxation taken from income.  They have a further disincentive effect on work, effort and enterprise. Whether we want to or not, as a small country so close to Britain we cannot close our minds and eyes to what is happening there and in other countries where taxation is coming down.  Very often, we stand to lose the people we can least afford to lose.  Particularly at the lower end of the scale there is no justification for taking contributions, whether in the form of PRSI, health contributions, or whatever, from people on very low incomes.  It creates an enormous trap for those who would probably be better off if they stay on social welfare as opposed to going into the work force on low incomes.  We need to look at the possibility of not taking taxes or contributions from, say, the first £2,000 or £3,000 of income.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's comments about the collection of the levy from the farming sector in particular, it is a disgrace that that sector of the community owes in arrears to 31 December about £5.7 million in health contribution levies alone and there are greater amounts of money owed by them.  The leaders of the organisations involved should become as vociferous in asking their members to pay this contribution as they are in telling them not to make other payments or to lobby politicians about other things that are happening.  I have rarely, if ever, heard them say loudly that they want their members to pay these contributions which they owe &mdash; and owe to the taxpayer.  Because they do not pay them, the rest of the community have to pay the contributions for them.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the incentive is being given to the health boards to collect the money, by being allowed to keep what they collect.  I am also pleased that legal proceedings are being taken against those who have not paid.  Given the cost of legal proceedings in this country, there probably will not be much left if we have to go the full way to the court.  Nonetheless, it is an important point of principle and we should go the full way in <Col N="987" /> making sure that the State gets this £5.7 million from that sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion that one procedure will be adopted for collecting this levy from the self-employed and farming sector together with PRSI, taxation and so on, which proves my point that it is additional taxation.  However, it is more efficient that the State would collect all the moneys due to it by one simple method and the same should apply in relation to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Labour Party have no objection whatsoever to paying additional health contributions, or to raising the ceiling from £15,000 to £15,500.  But &mdash; and this is a very major &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash; we do object vehemently to paying substantial additional taxation in the long term while, simultaneously, services are being dismantled.  The purpose of health contributions is to finance the health services.  Never in the history of our party have we hung back from paying for those services and we know that we must pay for them.  However, we object that the ordinary PAYE worker who pays this charge of £1.25 per cent on gross income up to £15,500 is not being provided with the very services for which he is paying.  This Government have been singularly ineffective in the provision of these services and singularly ill-advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public beds which people are entitled to by virtue of category 1 or category 2 of the health services are being closed down.  It is now extremely difficult, if not impossible, for an elderly person to get into an acute general hospital on a matter of urgency, say for geriatric assessment, and to have normal care.  I shall give the examples of a couple of hospitals in my own constituency.  St. Michael's Hospital from the month of May to the month of October will not take in any booked <Col N="988" /> admissions at all.  St. Vincent's Hospital has had a whole ward closed down and converted to private beds in a desperate effort to get in some VHI money.  One senior consultant in that hospital told me he is no longer doing any continuous work; he has been dealing with emergencies only since last December.  Basic services are being disbanded.</P>
    <P>Nurse training, which was always regarded as a major outlet of employment and professional skills for young women, has been almost destroyed and was certainly not helped by the appalling foolishness of An Bord Altranais in trying to rationalise admission procedures. Orthopaedic and ENT services are in a total shambles.  A GP told me the other day that he knew a medical card holder, a child of 14 years of age, who was bluntly told it would take two years before he could have a tonsillectomy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a public disgrace for the Minister to say here this morning that we must increase health contributions to provide health services. However, the GP to whom I referred told me that if the 14 year old boy went to a consultant on a private basis, he would be operated on within two weeks.  People are suffering and are becoming very irate.</P>
      <P>Health education has also been abolished although part of the contribution was meant to pay for it.  There has been no reform in the health board's structure and there will not be any because it is dominated by Fianna Fáil &mdash; not only in terms of the last local election &mdash; but because of ministerial appointments to the various boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing is happening either in relation to the GMS.  There is a need to bring in an effective capitation system but this will not be done because the really strong vested interests in the health service will not be taken on.  The VHI are getting into more and more trouble.  Most Members of the House are in the VHI and they face an increase of 8.5 per cent in the ordinary A, B and C schemes and <Col N="989" /> closer to 9 per cent in relation to the D scheme.  The VHI have had a £15 million operational loss which was offset by about £7 million or £8 million income from portfolio investments.  Nevertheless, towards the end of the year, they will be demanding a very substantial, further increase.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the comments made by Deputy Harney in relation to the British tax system.  She referred to the fact that taxation had been reduced to 40 per cent in the UK with a base rate of 25 per cent, but at what a price.  The British Prime Minister and the Chancellor have taken billions of pounds out of the health services and given them to the rich and the super-rich.  We do not want that to happen in this country but there should be an incentive to care for people.  The problem facing the Minister for Health is that the Minister for Finance and his other colleagues in Cabinet railroaded him out of £40 million or £50 million of basic health expenditure in 1987 and 1988.  I hope he will now resist them and tell them that he will not accept further reductions and cuts in 1989.  The Minister was also railroaded in relation to health contributions.  The Minister said he would get an additional yield in this area but, as far as I know, the yield in health contributions for 1988-89 will be down by £1.3 million because the income of the self-employed and farmers will be calculated on capital allowances.  That means that the yield will be down substantially. There is a contradiction in what the Minister said here and what the Minister for Finance told me by way of written reply, that there will be a £3 million drop from the self-employed and farmers on health contributions and the employment levy in 1988-89, about £1.2 million in health contributions and £1.8 million on the employment levy.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the ceiling going up to £15,500 provided that the money will be used for the health services but it is going into the general maw of appropriations-in-aid of the Department and the Minister's budget is being cut.  For every extra increment he gets from appropriations-in-aid the Department <Col N="990" /> cut his budget back and leave him in an equally difficult situation.  Now that we have a break of some weeks, the Minister should address himself to the common contract which his predecessor, Deputy Haughey, brought in in such an appalling manner.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to bring about, in the next budget, uniformity of health contributions and other levies.  The PRSI ceiling contribution is £16,200 and the ceiling for the health contribution is £15,500.  I tried very hard to get a uniform ceiling &mdash; I tried to abolish the ceiling altogether &mdash; and I urge the Minister to do the same.  They should be averaged out and there would be no loss of yield. Of course, the trouble about abolition is that they still will not give you the money.</P>

      <P>I received an apology from the Whip's Office this morning as I came into the Chamber because I had not been advised of what was happening here today.  This item was not on the Order of Business for the week and we were not aware that it was coming up.</P>
      <P>The first objection I have is that the increase in the contribution rates is not accompanied by an increase in eligibility, which is extraordinary.  The Minister said that he would shortly be reviewing the income limit for free consultant services but that he was not yet in a position to say what that limit would be in regard to eligibility ceiling.  Yet he introduced this before he was in a position to see whether people paying this contribution will be eligible.  I cannot understand why the eligibility is not increased at the same time as contributions.  Is this legal and constitutional?  I do not know.  I also do not know why we need to rush this measure through on the last day of a sitting, which seems to be a very popular day for doing this.  Just before the House adjourned for Christmas, we rushed through the Bill dealing with fishing licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that 30 per cent of the adult population qualify for hospital services cards which means they also qualify for out-patient and in-patient services.  They are paying between £150 and £200 a year <Col N="991" /> in contributions to the health services.  As the previous speaker has said, we have to look at whether it is a contribution to the health services or not.  Do these contributions give them any rights?  Separate charges can be imposed for in-patient and out-patient services, therefore their contributions are not related in any way to the health services being provided. The Eastern Health Board are now trying to introduce a charge for the issue of hospital services cards.  They are going to charge £10 for applying for a hospital services card and this despite the fact that a person is paying up to £200 a year in contributions for these health services.</P>
    <P>Although paying 1.25 per cent of their income towards these health services they are not getting the services which they are paying for and in fact they are having to pay extra for the services which in turn is driving them towards the VHI. Again I must ask, is what the Minister is doing legal and constitutional?  If people are paying 1.25 per cent of their incomes for health services, surely they have a legal right to receive these without paying further for them.  This would be similar to the VHI saying that, although they were making their contributions, they would also have to pay their bills.  One wonders what the thinking behind this is and whether it is legal and constitutional.</P>
    <P>The greatest scandal of all is that while the Minister is going to bring in an extra £1 million by raising the contribution level to 1.25 per cent he is not bringing in the money which is due from those making no contributions the self-employed and farmers.  Deputy Harney, referring to the Minister's speech, said that it is terrible that there is £5.7 million outstanding but if we read the Minister's speech carefully we will see that that is only the amount of money outstanding to the health boards up to 6 April 1984. Since 6 April 1984 these contributions should have been made to the Revenue Commissioners, therefore all the money outstanding since 1984 was not mentioned by the Minister and he did not <Col N="992" /> say how much was owed by the self-employed and farmers in health contributions since then.  I understand that the figure is in the region of between £36 million and £38 million and this despite the fact that the Minister introduced a laudable scheme whereby if they did not pay their health contributions they would be charged for the services they received.</P>
    <P>Presumably, this has brought money in from those who have got ill but they amount to only a tiny percentage of the total.  The vast majority, just like the vast majority of PAYE workers who are paying between £150 and £200 a year in contributions, never get ill.  The vast majority of PAYE workers never avail of these services but at least they know that if they did get ill the services would be available and that they were contributing towards the health care of others.  Those who are not contributing are paying for no one's health care, neither yours nor mine.  The contributions which PAYE workers are paying have gone up from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent, yet eligibility levels have not been raised.  This is as a result of the refusal of the self-employed and farmers to pay their health contributions and the refusal of the Government to crack down on them so as to ensure that they do pay their contributions.  What goes for one citizen should go for all.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem in the taxation system is that citizens are not treated equally, they are discriminated against depending on their job and source of income.  If there is an easy way of ripping them off, it will be taken.  There is nothing to stop the Minister from increasing the contribution level from 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent and of course it will be the same people who will end up paying this increase.  He could then increase the charges for in-patient and out-patient services to £20 a time at the stroke of a pen. I ask, where do we stop?</P>
    <P>While these regulations propose to increase the figure from £15,000 to £15,500 they also raise the issue of the contributions and the services which one gets in return, whether those contributions are paid into some type of <Col N="993" /> health care fund in order to ensure that the services are provided or whether as, was stated by the previous speaker, they would go into the big maw of the Minister for Finance.  The big problem is that the Department of Finance are cutting back on the number of workers in the health services &mdash; as was pointed out yesterday there are now 1,500 fewer workers in the health services &mdash; and when you cut back on the number of workers in the health services you also cut back the number of services provided to those paying contributions of between £150 and £200 a year.  They have been paying these contributions for years but because the money is not there they are not getting the services in return.  If the money was put into a health service fund rather than into the maw of the Minister for Finance, then the money would be there and that is the nub of the question in regard to the health services.  The £36 million outstanding is precisely the amount of money which would be required in the current year to keep the health services at their previous level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to some of the points raised by the Deputies opposite.  Reference was made to the fact that the health services are in crisis but I would like to say that nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no such crisis in the health services.  Let us take the acute hospital service: such a service is available to anybody who needs acute treatment. I accept that there are waiting lists and that there always have been waiting lists and that in some specific services, such as the orthopaedic service, the waiting list is much longer than we would wish.  Other countries have similar problems and I am looking at this area to see if anything can be done to improve the situation.  The general medical service was protected by the decision of the Government to provide a further £25 million on what was allocated by the previous Government when we came into office in 1987.  There has been a further increase this year so as to ensure a good <Col N="994" /> community care service would be provided.</P>

Countries much wealthier than our own such as Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom find the same difficulties we are facing up to.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the GMS has been protected and has been provided with large percentage increases in funding since we came into office.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla suggested that the eligibility ceiling should be increased at the same time as the health contributions. Two issues arise here.  First, eligibility is <Col N="995" /> claimed on 1 June so that employers can issue tax documentation to employees so as to facilitate employees when applying for hospital services cards.  Also, delaying the eligibility ceiling until June means that eligibility is not determined on the previous year's income and that has an obvious advantage for the employees.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1988</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations was laid before Dáil Éireann on 22nd March, 1988.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to extend social insurance cover from 6 April 1988 to ministers of religion, members of religious orders, doctors, dentists and certain employees of local and public authorities employed under a contract of service.  This is necessary as a consequence of the extension of social insurance to the self-employed.  I thank the Deputies on the opposite side for agreeing to take this regulation which is necessary in conjunction with the main Bill which is being considered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persons concerned are specifically excluded from social insurance cover at present.  This means that even if a person in one of these categories is employed under a contract of service, such as, for example, persons in Holy Orders who are teachers, nurses, etc. or doctors and dentists employed by hospitals, they are not covered by the system.  There are historical reasons for excluding these various categories but their position has to be reviewed in the context of the new situation where social insurance is being extended to the self-employed.  Continuing to exempt these categories from social insurance as employed persons could not be justified when their colleagues who are in self-employment and who pay income tax under Schedule D <Col N="997" /> are being brought into the new extended system.</P>
    <P>The reason for the general exception of religious from social insurance cover stems from the fact that it was felt that persons in Holy Orders or in religious life are not regarded as employees in the accepted sense when carrying out the work or duties of their offices, even though some are paid a stipend or salary. There was also the consideration that the majority of such persons were celibate priests, brothers and nuns who do not have dependants and are not exposed to the kinds of risks to which ordinary insured persons are exposed.  In the case of medical and dental practitioners it was felt that they would only be in employment for a very short time, as the majority would go into private practice after a few years and, therefore, it was decided that it would be inequitable to impose a social insurance liability on them for a short period for which they would not derive permanent benefit. They would be doctors working in hospitals, prior to going on to some other employment perhaps in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Under arrangements made in 1974, certain classes of ministers of religion or other members of religious communities can be brought into the social insurance system where a representative body indicates that their exclusion is unreasonable and the Minister is satisfied that this is the case.  On foot of this provision ministers of the Church of Ireland have been brought into social insurance at the Class E rate of PRSI contribution in respect of their pastoral employment and are, accordingly, covered for all social insurance benefits, with the exception of unemployment and occupational injuries benefits.  No other group of clergy or religious has made representations since 1974 for inclusion in the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>Under the new extended social insurance system for the self-employed, clergy and other religious who are in receipt of reckonable emoluments or income, which are defined in the Social <Col N="998" /> Welfare Bill, 1988, will become compulsorily insured for old age and widows pensions.  It would, therefore, be clearly anomalous to continue to exclude from compulsory social insurance those clergy and religious who are employed under contract of service, i.e. religious employed in schools, universities, hospitals, etc.  This regulation now provides for their inclusion in the social insurance system as employed contributors. This is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare in the matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to ministers of religion, employed persons who are doctors or dentists and certain local and public authority employees are also being brought into the social insurance system for the first time.  Such categories have been excluded from compulsory social insurance since 1953 when the unified social welfare system was established. Social insurance cover was extended to doctors and dentists in the Defence Forces in 1985.  This was by special request and the extension was provided for them.</P>
    <P>It was felt at that time that the question of extending social insurance cover to other doctors and dentists employed, for example, by health boards and other local and public authorities should be considered in the context of extending social insurance cover to all doctors and dentists, including private practitioners.  Following the extension of social insurance to the self-employed, doctors and dentists who are in private practice are now being brought into the social insurance system as self-employed contributors.  As a consequence it would be anomalous to continue to exclude all medical and dental practitioners who are employed under contract of service from compulsory social insurance cover and these regulations also provide for their inclusion as employed contributors.  This also is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is the first time that doctors and dentists will come into the PRSI scheme. This regulation will ensure that those who are in employment, or under a contract <Col N="999" /> of service, in addition to those who are self-employed, will come in at the same time.</P>
    <P>Part I of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 specifies the employments which are insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Part II of that Schedule specifies employments which are excepted from being insurable. The purpose of this regulation is to delete references in Part II to employment where the employed person is a minister of religion or a member of a religious community, employment as a doctor or dentist and certain employees of local and public authorities.  The deletion of these categories from the list of excepted employments means that, where they are employed, they will automatically fall into Part I of the First Schedule, thereby becoming covered for social insurance as employees.</P>
    <P>The existing paragraph 12 of Part I of the First Schedule which refers to ministers of religion is being deleted as it is no longer relevant in the present context. However, it is being replaced by a provision which will designate clergy and other religious as a specific category of employee.  This is necessary in order to maintain the current Class E status of those ministers of religion who are already included in the system and it will also enable the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts to be modified in respect of this category of persons should this be necessary in the future.  It is estimated that approximately 9,000 employed persons will be brought into the social insurance system as a result of the provisions in these regulations.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6) of section 5 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, these regulations may not be made until a resolution approving the draft regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am happy to recommend the draft regulations to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to oppose the motion by the Minister but I want to raise some questions.  First, I <Col N="1000" /> would like the Minister to let me know what is the definition of minister of religion.  I raise this question very seriously because in my constituency just over a year ago I was involved in protracted discussions with Government Departments and the local authorities in relation to a person who claimed to be a minister of religion in a sect of which he himself was a co-founder, the effect of which was, according to him, to render his income very small and, therefore, to render the differential rent for which he was liable on his local authority house to be reduced.  That gives rise to the next question, what is the income of a minister of religion on which to base any social insurance contributions?  How do we assess the income?  It is clear, obviously, where a minister of religion is employed in a school or a university, but what if he is employed in a private school owned by the religion in question where his remuneration is unclear because he shares the general use of, say, the religious community's facilities, houses or whatever?  For instance, the community may provide cars for the general use of that religious community.  The Minister did not refer to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not expect there would be any problems in dealing with the major issues &mdash; though in certain cases the issues may not be clear for the main churches &mdash; I see a ready loophole here in the case of less well known churches at present in existence or which might come into existence.  In this day and age of so many loopholes, anomalies, evasions and avoidance of everything it seems inadequate consideration has been given to the whole question of definition of minister of religion and what constitutes his income from the point of view of a base for his social insurance contributions. Does the weekly church collection for the support of the priests of the parish which anyone who is a regular Mass goer will know is a regular feature in the Catholic Church form part of the base of the income on which social insurance contributions will be based or would a clergyman in the normal course of Church duties continue to be exempt from social <Col N="1001" /> insurance?  Is it only for clergymen in other employment?  I can think of 101 different categories of work done by clergymen which are not normal parish work and which would constitute employment, but the remuneration for which would be more in kind than in cash such as having a free house or use of a house, use of electricity and so on.  I would like the Minister to tell what consideration has been given to those points.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify whether clergymen and members of religious communities who fall to be socially insured under the provisions now before us will be covered for disability benefit.  It is clear from the Minister's speech that they will not be covered for unemployment benefit or occupational injuries benefit.  Will they be covered for invalidity pension?  I presume married clergymen will be covered for widow's pension and deserted wife's benefit.  That being the case, will there be a differentiation in the contribution levied as between married ministers of religion and members of a religious community and those who are unmarried?  If there is a difference, will the unmarried members be excluded from the provisions of the widow's pension and deserted wife's benefit?</P>
    <P>I raise this question to highlight the fact that nothing in the social welfare code is simple.  The general principle of what the Minister is doing is something the House can endorse but it gives rise to a great many questions.  Anyone who knows anything about our social welfare system will accept it is so riddled with anomalies that every new proposal that comes in to add to the system should be thoroughly vetted so as to avoid further anomalies being created.  I am fearful that what the Minister is proposing here will have the effect of introducing a number of new anomalies and loopholes which have not been thought out.</P>
    <P>Are doctors who work in the GMS now to be charged social insurance contributions on receipts from the GMS?  Is it to be stopped at source or will they be charged social insurance contributions on <Col N="1002" /> all their income?  Will doctors and dentists in the general medical service be considered self-employed or employed? If they are to be treated merely as self-employed, will the Minister not accept that this itself would give rise to a great deal of anomalies?</P>
    <P>There are many questions that could be raised about these proposals.  It is a consequence of the extension of social insurance to the self-employed.  I repeat that the general proposal put by the Minister, not withstanding anything he says, will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds per annum in the years to come, unless the Minister has at the back of his mind and is not disclosing to the House the intention to introduce further increases in the rates of contribution after the review in the autumn of 1990.  If that is the case, the Minister is not being totally honest.  If that is what is proposed, the Minister should come clean and tell those who are in the self-employed sector what is to come in the years ahead.  If there is not to be an increase in rates then I am absolutely certain that this proposal to extend social insurance to the self-employed will cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and the PAYE sector will be hit again, when the main purpose of the extension should be to give relief to that sector who are now carrying far too big a burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced on a trial and error basis and could be expensive to the State.  I have no objection to the definitions but clarification is of vital importance before we get to a stage where it has to be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to dentists, doctors or priests who volunteer their services in the Third World for two or three years, can they continue to contribute to this insurance fund while they are away?  Likewise, there are many who come out of university with certain qualifications and set up their own little business but find that because of the economic climate in the country they have to leave for America <Col N="1003" /> or Great Britain.  Are such people at liberty to continue their payment into the fund?</P>
    <P>I understand the philosophy of bringing everybody into the social insurance net but thousands of young people are emigrating and taking up employment in other countries.  Many are not there in a legal or official capacity and are running away from immigration officers.  They take up employment until such time as the immigration officers catch up with them.  Are we providing anything in this Bill for such people, because sooner or later they will return to Ireland and will become a liability because they are not covered by insurance?  This is a very important aspect of the whole Bill. Because of the present emigration we may be creating a very big liability.  When these people return to this country it is the State that will have to maintain them, be it on unemployment assistance or retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>I will be watching carefully and hoping that in the next review we will broaden the whole thing.  We should give people who have emigrated an opportunity to contribute to this fund.  It is vital that the Minister and his officials sit down to consider this very important aspect of this Bill.  It is new and will have many anomalies that will be detected as we go along.  I have been watching this for some time and this is the first opportunity I have had to put this matter to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this motion.  The Minister has set out very clear objectives which are very much in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Usually I am a bit worried about regulations but in this case I prefer to see it done by regulation because, as Deputy Wyse rightly said, there is a certain amount of trial and error here.  It is a new ball game and it will take a while to identify the various pitfalls that will have to be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to confirm if other categories not covered in the Minister's <Col N="1004" /> designation in this regulation can be included from time to time.  This is very important because there are a number of categories all of which I will not go into today.  I will highlight one in particular. I have already referred to this at a number of committee meetings and in discussions with colleagues in the Labour Party and other political parties.  There is a strong consensus in favour of having the Members of the Oireachtas included and covered in the same way as workers in every other category designated by the regulations.  I do not think that Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament should be dealt with in any other way.  They should be dealt with in the same way as regards A1 contributions and should qualify for the same benefits as anybody else.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister that these regulations be extended to include Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Judges should also be included because they have to work just the same as everybody else and they get old and retire just the same as everybody else.  Some of the most insecure people in the public sector generally are Members of the Oireachtas who never know from day to day or week to week whether they will be employed or not.  They should have the same safeguards as every other category of worker. I term myself as a worker in the same way as when I worked in the trade union movement or on the factory floor.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Members of this House who have worked for 15, 20 or 30 years in industry as PAYE workers and I happen to be one of them.  Those Members, because they were elected to Dáil Éireann, have lost their total entitlement to any benefit.  We are criticised in many respects but if there was a general election tomorrow and I lost my seat, which can happen to anybody, I would not qualify for unemployment benefit even though I have paid into the system for 30 years, simply because I have been here for over five years.  The same applies to Members of the Seanad.  There are a number of Members who could be deemed to be self-employed people who <Col N="1005" /> have other interests and they should be brought into the self-employed category.</P>
    <P>I suggest very strongly, and I want to put on the record of this House, that all Members of the Oireachtas should be brought under these regulations or some other appropriate regulations.  They should get some recognition by way of credit for the period of time which has broken their continuity of social welfare contributions, in the same way as people get credit for signing on for disability benefit or any other form of social welfare benefit or service from the State.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that ministers of religion, nuns and priests have been brought under these regulations because many of these people work very hard for very long hours in the same way as do social workers.  They also work at weekends and they are very badly paid.  People think that ministers of religion and nuns are well off people but I know from speaking to them that their allowance is very small indeed.  To a large degree they rely on charity and on contributions made at services and on a voluntary basis.  They are very vulnerable in this regard.  They should get the same benefits that any other worker in industry or service enjoys.</P>
    <P>I share some reservations about the definition of ministers of religion.  I would like to hear the Minister's definition of what constitutes a minister of religion. We know in the past that people have dressed up in a particular garb and called themselves ministers of religion of one sort or another.  I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say in relation to that.  The proposals are very specific and very clear and are along the lines of the commission's recommendations. I will certainly support them fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and emphasise that in these regulations we are dealing with ministers of religion, doctors, dentists and so on who are in employment or under contract of service.  The Bill deals with the self-employed and the whole area of private practice.  These regulations remove anomalies and create a unified system <Col N="1006" /> and that is important.  I emphasise that they are introduced in the context of what is being done in regard to the extension of social insurance to the self-employed. This is one of the elements which removes anomalies and ensures uniformity in the treatment of people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked about the definition of a person in religion and various other questions in relation to those people.  They are defined in the Bill as people ordained in Holy Orders.  I know the Deputies could have some arguments about that but in future if any maharishis come along they will have to pay their self-employed contributions.  If they have any people working under them who have a contract of service or a stipend they will have to pay their contributions.  I do not think I would like to go any further into the definition but I can tell Deputies what it is in the Bill.  I know in some instances there can be argument about who is ordaining people in Holy Orders but that is basically the situation.  The income base is the income from the job, whatever that might be, secular employment, teachers or whatever.  Normally there is a stipend of some sort payable.  If that is assessable to income tax under Schedule E, that is the income base that will be used.  The same arrangements that apply to other people will apply in those cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell also mentioned the question of priests and parish duties and asked what would be the position in relation to benefits in kind.  They are exempt so there is no problem in that regard.  One might say that members of the clergy might not be very anxious to contribute towards widows pensions because there would not be much likelihood of benefiting from them but the same can be said for anyone who remains unmarried, They, too, contribute to the scheme in the normal way and would not benefit in that way although they would benefit in other ways from the schemes. In that sense the position would be the same as that for any other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what is covered was also raised.  The extent of the social insurance coverage for persons affected by the regulations will depend on the <Col N="1007" /> nature of their employment.  In general, however, most of those affected will be liable to pay either PRSI Class B contributions, as in the case of doctors and dentists employed in the Civil Service or PRSI Class D contributions, as in the case of doctors, dentists and religious employed in the health services and also religious employed in schools, universities and so on.  These different classes cover different things.  Class B covers widows and orphans contributory allowances, deserted wife's allowance and limited occupational injuries benefits. Class D covers the same categories, plus full occupational injuries benefits. That is the question Deputy Mitchell asked.  Doctors will either come into this category or into the self-employed category. If they come into the self-employed category their contributions will be deducted by Revenue.  Only doctors and dentists who are employed under contract of service will be covered by these contributions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse said there was a certain amount of trial and error in the scheme and Deputy Bell referred to the fact that some matters could be adjusted by regulation. That is the value of having regulations. I emphasise that this is designed to remove anomalies and unify the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse referred to doctors or priests who work for a few years in the Third World and he asked what their position would be.  There is also the question of people who are working in other countries such as America or Australia or in the EC.  The Deputy is aware that if such people come back here they can have a means-tested pension if they qualify. Under the amendment which the Deputy tabled yesterday all these benefits would be means-tested.  These people in such cases would never contribute anything and would come into the system on a means-tested basis.  That is not in reality what would happen.  In EC countries rights are transferable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important start and some of the officials here put a lot of work into it.  There are special regulations dealing with volunteers who work in the Third World that are designed to protect their social insurance position.  The regulations we are now talking about will apply to these people as well.</P>
      <P>I have said that EC regulations cover transfers within the Community.  We are negotiating bilateral agreements with some other countries outside the EC such as Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the Channel Islands and Australia to protect the acquired rights of citizens who may go to work in these areas.  We will also be having discussions with the United States.  The Progressive Democrats might feel at home in the United States because there is not too much by way of benefit under their system.  They have a different approach and the means test would be an important factor.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in America they do not have the same kind of approach that is adopted in the EC generally.  Obviously it is not possible to transfer a means-tested system to an insurance system.  That is the kind of problem that arises.  In America great emphasis is laid on occupational schemes.  There are also variations between the different states.  It is not as easy to achieve agreement as it is within Europe.  We will be entering into discussions with the Americans.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell raised the question of other categories which might not come within these regulations.  He mentioned Members of the Oireachtas and judges. I know he is aware of the voluntary contributory arrangements which provide limited benefits.  The question of Oireachtas office-holders and judges is being considered by the National Pensions Board and will be the subject of their next report.  Their position will be considered in the context of the public service as a whole.  We will examine the position when that report is received.</P>

Approximately 3,800 doctors and dentists are involved, mainly in the health board area, as well as 85 coroners and registrars.

Many of the priests and nuns in the diocese of Armagh can be transferred either to Northern Ireland or the South.  They move around frequently and I ask the Minister to keep that in mind because a priest or nun who is working in the Republic could be transferred to a parish in Northern Ireland. That would happen in particular along the Border area from Drogheda to Donegal.</P>

    <P>(3)  Subsection (1) of this section shall apply to any claim for family income supplement which is received on or after the 28th day of July, 1988.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to apologise for the arrangement but this is a question of parliamentary drafting and having it correct for this morning.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on Committee Stage I undertook to have a look at the possibility of making an amendment which would enable higher income limits to apply to families with more than five children.  The current income limit for families with five or more children is £192 per week and this is being increased to £200.  As average earnings are around this level, this limit is still valid by reference to the original criteria of the scheme, one of which as I mentioned previously was to ensure that the family income supplement was not supplementing incomes in excess of average earnings.  However, I consider that for larger families the cutoff point of £200 may not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that in line with our commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a detailed study of the working of the family income supplement is being carried out to identify what adjustments might be necessary.  It would be best to await this study before making any fundamental changes to the scheme.  However, in order to give some flexibility to be able to make changes in the scheme following consideration of the report, I am proposing this amendment which will enable me, by regulations, to vary the upper income limit and the maximum payment depending on the family size.</P>
    <P>The amendments which were proposed by Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Bell and others on Committee Stage were ruled out of order because they could involve a charge on the Exchequer.  We had a lengthy discussion on that subject and I undertook to look at the situation.  I have done that and I have found that if I am to be able to vary in relation to the number of children I will have to take <Col N="1014" /> some additional enabling power in the amendment.  That is what I am doing here.  I want to be able to meet the requirements.  It is quite complex in its working and I would need to have the report before we make our decisions.  We could make a wrong decision if we do something now.  To enable me to meet the requests made by the Deputies, I want to have the enabling power.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for at least meeting some of the amendments I proposed on Committee Stage.  What he is proposing is a tentative step because if he does not issue regulations under this amendment there will be no change in the present situation.  My ambition will only be realised, and even then to a limited extent, if the Minister proceeds to issue regulations under the amendment now proposed.</P>
      <P>The Irish tax and social welfare systems are heavily biased against employment and the OECD have repeated this distressing fact.  One of the principal causes of this anomaly is that in the social welfare code we make provision, and properly so, for a payment for each child, regardless of the number, whereas those at work not only get no money for their children but are not even given a tax free allowance for them.  This means that a married man with ten children has the same tax free allowance as a married man without children, but his outgoings and costs are incomparably greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister proposes to prescribe in this amendment the maximum number of children in terms of which a family might benefit under the family income supplement.  I would have preferred if he had abolished the upper limit of five.  If he does not do that, an anomaly will still exist because anyone on social welfare will be able to get social welfare payments in respect of any number of children.  It could be argued that if there is no upper limit the amount of money a person with a large family could get would be enormous.  Would the Minister not agree that anyone entitled to family income supplement should get <Col N="1015" /> the same payment for each child as the average social welfare recipient?  If the Minister took that step, it would meet the point I raised.</P>
    <P>This is only a small step to remove some of the anomalies which exist in our social welfare code which caused OECD to say that our tax and social welfare systems are biased against labour.  That is the fundamental reason we have such high unemployment.  As I told the House yesterday, in the past two months I have met four or five married men with children, men who have jobs, but who are giving them up because they would be better off unemployed when all the circumstances are taken into account, or, when the difference in being at work and staying at home is so marginal that it is not worth their while getting up in the morning.  This is not rhetoric or hearsay. I can give examples.</P>
    <P>For example, PAYE deductions are penal on a man with many children, who has the same tax free allowance as the man without children.  If he is paying PRSI, which he is, occupational pension contributions and bus fares of £10 or £12 a week, and if his gross income is taken into account when assessing his differential rent, which it is, rather than his net income, if his gross income is taken into account for his FIS, which it is, and if his gross income is taken into account for his medical card, as it is, rather than his net income, he is much worse off at work because he would lose his medical card, his differential rent concession, some if not all, of his FIS and he has to pay occupational pension, PRSI and PAYE contributions as well as bus fares to and from work.  We have to remove these anomalies and this is but a modest step in that direction.  Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment because the Minister has gone some way towards meeting what was proposed in my amendment on this subject.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that this has become a very important element for those in the lower income group who are <Col N="1016" /> at work.  I am amazed at the number of people who still have not applied for this benefit.  A year or two after this benefit was introduced, I find people who could have been in receipt of £15 or £20 a week, but who did not know about it, or did not want or care to apply for it.  The reason may have been that people are fearful of applying for a benefit when it is centralised in Dublin.  Many more people in rural areas would have applied for this benefit if it had been paid through a local office like the employment exchange.  I do not know if there would be any value in that, but as the decentralisation process is now in hand and as there is computerisation, I do not see why this benefit could not be paid locally.  People tend to talk about this and other benefits in the employment exchanges.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister might consider my proposal.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment it is possible for the Minister to prescribe how many children could be covered, or what extensions could be made to the maximum of five children.  I never believed there should have been a maximum, although I have a maximum of ten children in my amendment because I felt that this was reaching the upper limit in terms of family size these days.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their welcome for this amendment.  I have listened carefully to what they had to say.  I examined how I might, in practice, apply those ideas, but I found I would be creating more anomalies if I did so.  This point would need further consideration.</P>
      <P>This amendment will allow me to increase by different rates the amounts for children.  This is the point Deputy Mitchell was making.  At present, the rate will go up by £23 and we would very quickly get to the figure of £16,000.  I want to be able to increase the number of children eligible and this amendment will allow me to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell mentioned decentralisation. He knows I want as much as possible to have this work done locally. We will try to ensure that people know <Col N="1017" /> this scheme is there and that they will make use of it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 11, to delete &ldquo;This section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subsection (1) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 would not make any sense without amendment No. 2 which is the substantive amendment. The amendment before us is different from the amendment I moved on Committee Stage in that it allows the Minister to proceed with his proposal in the Bill to increase the upper income limit to £16,200 as and from the beginning of April.  On Committee Stage the Minister made the point that my original amendment, if accepted, would have meant that regulations would have had to be prepared thus delaying the implementation of the upper income limit provision.  He told us there would not have been enough time to draft the regulations and have them approved by both Houses before April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment will not interfere with the Minister's power to come before the House to amend the social welfare regulations.  Our social welfare legislation is extremely complex.  The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 is an enormous tome and it is incredibly difficult to read through it.  We have had at least one Bill annually amending that Act since then.  Last year we dealt with two Bills amending provisions in that Act and we may have more this year.  Many of the amendments are concerned with a change in the rates of contribution and <Col N="1018" /> such changes are more appropriate to regulations which need the prior approval of the House.  I have heard it said that we will have to think of introducing a new consolidation Bill shortly and in that event I hope the Minister will consider providing for changes in the rates to be made by regulation, to be approved by both Houses.  That would simplify our social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>My amendment is in keeping with the principle of the amendments I moved on Committee Stage which were designed to ease or eliminate the anti-employment bias of our tax and social welfare systems, to help remove the roadblocks to employment creation and employment maintenance. Our employment position will get worse.  My amendment seeks to give the Minister the power to ease the lot of two groups in our society, if he so wishes. I am not seeking to force him to do that but I want to give him the enabling power to do so.  The amendment enables him to vary the rates or to exempt the first portion of income.  He can say that the first £500, £1,000 or £2,000 should be exempt from social insurance contributions and he can increase the rates so that he will not be at any loss in revenue terms.  Yesterday the Minister told us that to exempt the first £1,000 would cost £105 million. I am not proposing that the Minister should contemplate any change that would cost such an amount of money, or any money.  I am suggesting that he should take the power to exempt if he considers it possible and feasible, the first £1,000 or £2,000 and adjust the rates of contributions thereafter upwards, increase the upper income limit upwards, to compensate for that loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>My concern is to ease the relative position of the low paid.  They would be the first group to benefit from any regulations the Minister would introduce in regard to this.  The second group to benefit in my efforts to ease the anti-employment bias of our social welfare and tax systems would be those involved in labour-intensive industries.  If the Minister decided to use the regulations so that in the case of the employer contribution he would exempt the first £2,000 of income but <Col N="1019" /> would increase the upper income limit to £18,000 or £20,000, or would increase the rate thereafter from 12½ per cent to 13½ per cent, he would reduce greatly the bias against labour-intensive industries.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate my point by the example of two employers with the same payroll of £200,000, one employer employing ten people at £20,000 each and the second employer employing 20 people at £10,000 each.  The payroll would be the same but the employer with 20 employees would pay more tax than the other employer. My amendment will allow the Minister to rejig the system so that that will not occur.  We would not tax employment. We are not forcing the Minister to do that but we are giving him the power to do that if he wishes.  We are giving the Minister a lot of flexibility in the amendment.  He may exempt an employee from paying contributions on the first part of his or her income or he may exampt an employer.  He will have power to exempt both, if he wishes.  He will have power to introduce different upper income limits for employer and employee.  We are giving the Minister an enormous flexibility but it is a flexibility he can only exercise with the permission of the House.</P>
    <P>It makes a great deal of sense to give the Minister such flexibility. It cannot be argued that what we are proposing is unwise.  It could only be unwise if the Minister decided to come before us with proposals which were unwise.  Presumably the proposals he would seek to introduce under these flexible arrangements would be designed to remove or reduce the anti-employment nature of our tax and social welfare systems. There are 250,000 people unemployed here &mdash; 20 per cent of our labour force &mdash; and emigration is very high but the Bill, which arises from the budget, does not do anything to ease that problem.  It is very conservative legislation.</P>
    <P>There are many things we can do to ease that problem.  On Committee Stage I proposed the substitution of a social <Col N="1020" /> security levy based on turnover or a part of the employers' PRSI contribution and while that was described as interesting by many Members it was not adopted.  I accept it is a radical change and that there would be difficulties in implementing it but it should not be taken in isolation.  It should be part of a package of measures to speedily change the tax and social welfare environment.  We need to adopt such a package urgently.  Such a move would be a major step towards improving the systems.</P>
    <P>Today's proposal is another step, perhaps not major in itself, but it would give the Minister interesting possibilities in relation to employment creation.  It is just part of a package.  The rest of the package would have to come in the Finance Bill which is due on 8 April.  I expressed the wish that there should be very radical changes in taxation, even though not announced in the budget, to reduce PAYE and substitute taxation on property or wealth.  I do not believe there is the remotest chance of getting such radical changes from this Government, but that is what we need to do if we want to create the right environment for employment creation and maintenance and eliminate the criticism of the OECD which rightly says that our taxation under the social welfare sustem is the most heavily biased against employment in the whole OECD.</P>
    <P>Because the powers given to the Minister are considerable, it is appropriate that the regulations, if proposed, should first come before the House.  I hope that the Minister will be able to accept this amendment as he accepted the main thrust of the amendments I had down concerning the family income supplement. Only in this way will we even begin to make progress in fighting unemployment. Unemployment is adding greatly to despair and to poverty.  What is more, it is adding greatly to the budget deficit.  Therefore, reducing unemployment relieves poverty which is supposed to be one of the main functions of the Department of Social Welfare.  It also reduces the budget deficit which is the <Col N="1021" /> central problem, after unemployment, facing this country.  We should take every and any step to change the environment so that jobs can be created and maintained. I hope the Minister and the House will support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very long discussion on amendments Nos. 16 to 18 yesterday.  In relation to this amendment, I said at the time that the Deputy had put what was seen as a question to the Minister about exempting portion of income or making exemptions of various kinds and I was to look at that question to see exactly what powers I had.  The situation is that at present I have power to exclude, by regulations, certain people; therefore, if we are concerned about people who are on the lowest income levels I have power to exclude them.  At the moment that is done by virtue of the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;under 18 hours&rdquo;. We could do so by another mechanism if we so desired.  That was one question about which I was particularly concerned yesterday.</P>
      <P>I also have the power to change the rates of contributions by regulation. Deputy Mitchell made quite clear that the principal intention of his proposal is to exempt, say, the first £500, £1,000 or £2,000 from the employers' side of the contribution.  That would mean finding that money somewhere else in general taxation, or by using some other mechanism. The Deputy wants to give me, as Minister, this, as he says quite rightly, enormous power and flexibility but under the control of the regulations, of course. This problem, which involves a major area, is not the kind of problem that I would like to tackle by regulation.  The Deputy proposed yesterday a turnover tax instead, but accepted that there would be many complications involved. I have power to make the most necessary exemptions, short term, in respect of workers who have difficulties.  As we said yesterday, one of the problems there is that one would have to ensure that they could continue to receive benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of the present amendment is to fix a lower earning exemption <Col N="1022" /> limit.  If you take the figure of £2,000 which Deputy Mitchell mentioned, and reduce the employers' side of it which has been mentioned at this stage, the total loss to the Exchequer would be £237 million. The employers' element in that would be £160 million.  In effect, what the Deputy is suggesting here is on the lines of exempting employers from the first £160 million and finding that by an alternative form of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Or by removing the ceiling. I presume the Deputy is talking only about removing the ceiling for the employers rather than the employees.  I imagine he would not want to shift the burden on to the employees.  Raising the ceiling with regard to employers would mean a return of a very small part of £160 million.  Therefore, there would be need for some other form of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to increase the rate, of course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in rate would be 5.5 per cent if one were excluding the first £2,000.  The Deputy will recognise that, again, we are talking about something very major.  We discussed this at considerable length yesterday and agreed.  I thought it was a very major development which would need much consideration and I undertook to look particularly at that aspect of the power to exempt particular people.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that at present I have power to exclude particular categories of people, or people with particular kinds of incomes &mdash; lower incomes, in other words.  I am satisfied I have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to accept this amendment it would indicate some intention of applying such a limit.  That would create some expectation, particularly on the part of <Col N="1023" /> employers, that there would be a reduction in the current rate.  I pointed out yesterday that our rate for employers is in the lower level of rates across Europe.  It would be wrong to give the impression that employers are having to pay far too much in this respect compared with their competitors in Europe.  At the same time, obviously we want to keep the amount as low as possible.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the full pay-related system in 1979 was intended to be an equitable system of contributions at all pay levels and it has been generally accepted.  At this stage, therefore, it is not contemplated that any major change should be made without very comprehensive consideration of the implications. When that is done, it will be possible to consider what new amendments are required in the Social Welfare Acts.  For these reasons, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the points made by the Minister although I know the amendments are well intentioned. I regard them differently from Deputy Mitchell in that I always want to know how amendments or legislation comply with ICTU policy.  This amendment, however, reminds me of an FUE pre-budget submission and I have a gut feeling that it is aimed at relieving employers.  I agree that the textile, clothing and footwear industries need help, indeed they needed help 20 years ago but successive Governments did not do much to assist them.  The result is that there is now hardly any footwear industry left, only half of the clothing industry is left and there is no textile industry as spinning and weaving have disappeared.  Those industries provided the lowest paid jobs and relieving employers at this stage is like closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.  Any changes would not effectively assist the industries at which they are aimed.  Even if a course of action was adopted which would cost about £200 million the PAYE sector would pay because when an employer gets relief the <Col N="1024" /> cost is usually transferred to an employee.  Amendment No. 2 (5) states that when regulations are proposed, a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. I agree with that but this issue is too broad and important to be dealt with by regulations.  It is all very well to change benefit rates, conditions of benefit or qualifications for benefit by regulation but this is a major change and, in the hands of the wrong Minister or Government, a very heavy burden of taxation could be transferred to the employee.  I am not suggesting for one minute that that is Deputy Mitchell's intention and obviously a lot of thought has gone into drafting the amendment.  I appreciate that but it would not be in the interests of the people I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is to exempt, by regulation, labour intensive industries.  The Minister should remember that these industries employ large numbers and a very great degree of care must be exercised in this regard.  Let there be no doubt about it, many industries are closing because of overheads and any further imposition of taxation in one form or another which affects employment is a further blow.  If the Minister can see his way to alleviating a burden on a certain sector, the House should seriously encourage him to adopt such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Bell because I am from an area where a large number of people are involved in the textile industry, although not as many as I should like to see.  The staff attached to these firms are as anxious to work in the factory as the manager or owner is to keep it open. The Minister would be very wise to accept such a proposal to have power to exclude certain categories.  It should not be a case of them and us and the fact that the ICTU and the FUE submit proposals to the Minister does not mean that people on different sides of the House should plump for one or the other.  We all have a vested interest in ensuring that there is a proper balance and that commonsense should prevail.  The basic point should be <Col N="1025" /> to ensure that employment is maintained in our industries and that should be foremost in our minds in arriving at any decision.  In cases where the Minister has powers to exclude categories of people in industry, I strongly urge him to exclude some of them, which would be in everybody's interest.  The maintenance of employment must be paramount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell mentioned the textile and footwear industries.  There is also a major problem in the bakery industry which is very labour intensive.  They have to compete with multinationals and the importation of bread and other products. Many bakeries have closed and others are in difficulty.  They should also be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed at the Minister's response.  He stands condemned as being totally apathetic in relation to unemployment.  He also stands condemned as being dishonourable because he gave a commitment that he would be favourably disposed to an amendment along these lines provided it did not affect the increase in the limit.  This raises very serious questions as to whether the Minister's word could ever be taken again but more serious is the fact that not only does this Bill do nothing to ease unemployment but that it also worsens the bias against employment in our social welfare and tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, I am disappointed with the response of Deputy Bell.  His response emphasised and highlighted once again that the Labour Party are one of the most conservative parties in this country and that they are not ready to contemplate change.  They are frozen in outdated ideas.  Earlier I made it clear that the Minister could raise the same amount of money in different ways but the Minister disputed this and said that our amendment, if implemented, would cost between £150 million and £200 million. Of course, no Deputy would make such a proposal and if he did his amendment would be ruled out of order because a private Member cannot propose an amendment which would impose a <Col N="1026" /> charge on the Exchequer.  A number of amendments have been ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister try to mislead the House and the public as he has repeatedly tried to do during the passage of this Bill?  Leaving aside my umbrage at the lack of honour in the Minister the fact of the matter is that we have a grave unemployment problem which is going to get worse as this year progresses and in future years unless there are radical changes in policy on employment.  Fine Gael in their amendments to this Bill have proposed radical changes and make no apologies for doing so.  I concede that legitimate queries can be raised and that our proposals are not perfect but I strongly argue that they would be a hell of a sight better than our existing arrangements which are so heavily biased against employment.  I cannot emphasise that fact enough.  Let me repeat once again what the OECD have said &mdash; we have the most biased social welfare and tax system in relation to employment among those countries in the OECD.</P>
    <P>The criticisms which were expressed yesterday by both Deputy Bell and Deputy De Rossa were legitimate and I concede that our proposals are not without flaws but I would argue that they would be considerably less flawed than our existing arrangements and would afford us the opportunity of easing greatly the tax effect on employment.  I am disappointed that the Deputies were not able to support the overall thrust of our proposals.  Furthermore, I would like to point out that no other party have put forward proposals.  The proposals we made yesterday in relation to a social security levy in lieu of part or all of the employer's contribution, and our proposal contained in the amendment before us, will form a major part of the Fine Gael employment policy which will be expanded on greatly in the coming weeks. Once again, let me say that I am bitterly disappointed at the attitude of the Minister and at the lack of any proposals from either the Minister or anyone else on employment.</P>
    <P>This disappointment is all the greater <Col N="1027" /> in that we are not forcing the Minister to do anything.  We are giving him enabling powers.  Deputy Bell mentioned that he was reluctant to agree to regulations but the entire 1981 Consolidation Act is full of regulations.  At least in this case while the regulations would give the Minister radical powers to manipulate the labour market in favour of employment he would need to have the prior approval of the House before doing so.  I hope that by our putting forward these proposals we will raise the consciousness of the House as regards unemployment in general and will alert the public that the Government have no proposals which will in any way alleviate unemployment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks to alter the definition of reckonable income in relation to a self-employed contributor. Reckonable income is dealt with in great detail on page 6 of the Bill in lines 9 to 22.  It provides for a certain number of exclusions.  Our amendment simply seeks to say that reckonable income should mean gross income.  The reason we are proposing this is that we are concerned <Col N="1028" /> that on the one hand while self-employed persons are brought into the scheme on the basis of gross income they are then allowed certain exclusions of income for the purpose of deciding the contribution they will pay.  At present the PAYE employee pays PRSI on gross income less any superannuation he might pay.  Indeed many employees do not pay a superannuation at all.  The Bill proposes an unfair discrimination.  I will deal later when discussing amendments Nos. 5 and 6 with the actual level of the contribution. It is a question of whether it should be 3 per cent or 6.6 per cent.  There is an injustice in the Bill in that many of the people who will be covered by this scheme while they will have quite large incomes will be in a position to opt to pay a far lower contribution than perhaps an employee with the same level of real income.  The main purpose of my amendment is to counter that aspect.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the explanatory memorandum which points out on page 5 that</P>
    <P>The rates of contribution to be paid by self-employed persons will depend on whether, after the deductions referred to above, they have income assessable to tax.  Where they have, they will be liable for contributions at a percentge of that income &mdash;</P>
    <P>A PAYE worker pays a contribution to the social insurance fund whether or not he is liable to tax and in fact he may not be liable to tax in many cases but is still obliged to make a substantial payment from his income based on his gross pay. It is on that basis that I am proposing this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to define reckonable income as gross income.  Gross income is not defined in the proposed amendment and it could mean all the income of the self-employed person that is earned before any deductions have been made for expenses incurred in earning that income.  It would be totally inequitable not to make allowances for such expenses.  There is an argument as to the extent of the expenses <Col N="1029" /> but most people would agree that certain expenses must be allowable because of the different situation.  More likely, the term is only intended to encompass income after the deductions have been made, but before deductions for capital allowances.</P>
      <P>Capital allowances are given to compensate for the fact that no deduction from trading income is allowable for capital expenditure or for the depreciation of capital assets.  It is accepted that capital expenditure for example on a farm shed or tractor is incurred for the purposes of farming in the same way as expenditure is incurred for the purchase of seeds, fertiliser and other such inputs.  Accordingly, such expenditure cannot be regarded as income and for that reason deductions for capital allowances are made to take account of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government announced their intention to extend social insurance to the self-employed it was stated that the self-employed would pay contributions which would be related to income.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was adopted by the Government and the social partners an undertaking was given that farmers and the self-employed would pay social insurance contributions on the basis of income as assessed for income tax purposes.  The National Pensions Board in their report also recommended that capital allowances should be deducted in calculating reckonable income for PRSI purposes.  The definition of reckonable income proposed in the Bill is fully in line with these undertakings and recommendations.  The Government also decided that the same principles regarding the income base should in future govern the health contributions and the employment and training levy. However, it has also been recognised that after deductions for capital allowances a person with a relatively substantial income could end up paying a very small PRSI contribution.  For that reason a minimum contribution of £208 per year has been provided for.  For the same reason in calculating the prescribed amount, below which no contribution is payable, it will be the annual amount <Col N="1030" /> of income before deductions have been made for capital allowances, which will be taken into account.  It has also been decided to include unearned income in the income base for the self-employed. This includes income from rents, interest and dividends.  There will be differences, but the differences arise because of the different circumstances.  They arise in other countries as well.  Other countries which have brought in a scheme for the self-employed have found that they too have had to make similar arrangements because of the different circumstances of self-employed people.  In those circumstances I do not support the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the level of contribution.  The Bill proposes that in 1988 there will be a contribution equal to 3 per cent of reckonable income.  By 1989 it will increase to 4 per cent and in 1990 it will increase to 5 per cent.  At some point in <Col N="1031" /> 1990 there will be a review of the operation of the scheme presumably with a view to seeing if the contribution can be increased further.  The National Pensions Board recommend a 6.6 per cent contribution and my amendments Nos. 5 and 6 propose a 6.6 per cent contribution.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate about the level of contribution.  Those representing the farming community and the self-employed have argued that they should be on level pegging with employees.  They argue that the level for employees is 2.4 per cent and that therefore their contribution should not be any higher than that.  The Minister has opted for a 3 per cent level.  I would argue that that is not adequate because it does not take into account that there is not an employer's contribution involved in the self-employed sector.  Indeed, the National Pensions Board indicated in their assessment of how much the scheme would cost that something over 11 per cent would have to be paid by the self-employed and the farming community in order to come up to the level which employer and employee pay to cover their pensions. Obviously that would be an extremely severe level of contribution.  I am not seeking to have that imposed but in fairness the 6.6 per cent should be applied. General taxation means usually that the PAYE sector pay the bulk of the social insurance fund in any event.  Rather than having an increased burden on the general taxpayer the level of contributions from the self employed and the farming community should be on a par with that paid by the employer and employee in relation to the pension fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>These amendments propose that the rate of contribution for the self employed should be 6.6 per cent from 6 April 1988 subject to a minimum of £208.  It is at the moment, as the Deputy recognises, subject to a minimum of £208 in any event.  On that side we are in agreement.  The National Pensions Board in their report drew attention to the need for the Government to take into account the ability to pay of the self employed <Col N="1032" /> contributors in setting the rate of contribution. The Government did so and concluded that imposing a relatively high rate of contribution straight away could give rise to hardship for many self-employed contributors given the present economic difficulties they experience.  It was decided, therefore, to phase in the contributions to be paid over a three year period and provide for a review of the cost of the scheme at that stage.  I contend this was a reasonable, pragmatic approach to the question.  Because it is a major change, phasing in over the three years was a reasonable way to do it and that is the way the Government have decided to go about it.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the returns from the self-employment contributions it will be possible to determine the adequacy of the rate of contribution set, and by the end of the third year the actual returns will be known.  We will be away from all the calculations, first the calculations theoretically in actuarial studies, then the calculations being done now by the Revenue Commissioners and from there we will review the position at the end of three years and see whether it is necessary to have any further increase in the rate.  At that stage the National Pensions Board will have reported on the projected cost of social insurance pensions overall including the cost of pensions for employees.  In that context the necessary measures can be taken to put the financing of the entire system of social welfare pensions for employees and the self-employed on a sound financial footing in line with the principle of equalised contributions recommended in the National Pensions Board report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important element of what we are planning.  We are bringing the self-employed into the scheme.  Various questions have been raised by Deputies here in the course of the debate about aspects or what they would regard as anomalies or whatever, but these questions fall to be considered in the context of the social security arrangements generally for employees and the self employed.  The National Pensions Board <Col N="1033" /> are considering those questions and will be reporting in due course.</P>
    <P>The 6.6 per cent rate of contribution referred to in the amendment is the rate recommended by the National Pensions Board on the grounds of equity and is the equivalent of the combined employer and employee rate at this time for old age and widow's and orphan's pensions.  The rate is not based on the principle of equalised contributions but corresponds to the proportion of the overall cost of social insurance currently being spent on pensions. When the review referred to is being carried out full regard will be had to the views of the National Pensions Board which will be available at that stage on the overall financing of social welfare pensions, and in particular to what the appropriate equalised rate of contribution should be for the contributors generally.  That is the question I referred to, that at the appropriate stage of the review the whole question of social welfare security pensions will be considered.</P>
    <P>A 4.5 per cent rate was proposed by the National Pensions Board as a break even rate.  In providing a rate of 5 per cent together with a minimum of £208 the Government are ensuring that the scheme will at least break even, even in the long term.  This rate is associated with a wider income base which includes unearned income and a new collection system.  We must bear in mind that when the NPB talked about 4.5 per cent as the break even rate they were not talking about the wider income base which the Government have included and which includes unearned income and a new collection system which will have a major impact on collection.  Collection was regarded as one of the major problems and is being tackled in the course of the introduction of the extension to the self-employed of social insurance.  The rate contemplated did not include these arrangements in relation to collection. It was simpler for them to say that the Government should work out how they were going to do it, and say, assuming 100 per cent collection on the income base that 4.5 per cent would be a break even.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> We are not going to assume that the collection will be 70, 80, or 90 per cent; that is a matter for the practical management and will depend on what other things are done by the Government at the same time.  Three major things have been done by the Government which affect that. One is the extension of the wider income base to include unearned income.  The second is already the increase from £15,500, the figure used in the studies, to £16,200 as the upper income limit.  The third is the collection system required. These steps have been taken to ensure that the arrangements being made will at least break even.  We will be in a much better position to make judgments on that in a practical way at the review stage at the end of the three years.</P>
    <P>The self-employed would claim that the income base would be greater than estimated.  This is one of the arguments they make in favour of the rate being lower.  Factors that affect the income base chosen are, for example, poor harvests of the last number of years which were used in computations by the National Pensions Board.  They say incomes will be considerably higher because we were back to more normal levels of income last year and they would expect that normally the people concerned would be in that sort of income bracket.  They reckon that the income base, even without including unearned income, just taking the main income base and the calculations done by the board, would not reflect the true income and that the true income will be higher.  I would be delighted to see that in practice because it means that the fund will be even more strongly funded.</P>
    <P>Taking all these considerations into account as the Government do around the table &mdash; all sorts of people draw all sorts of theoretical possibilities and the practical problems are identified and recognised &mdash; but at the end of the day someone has to decide on the reasonable, practical thing to do.  It is on that basis that the Government made the decision in regard to three, four and five per cent with the minima set as they are.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable in all those circumstances to accept the 5 per cent levy <Col N="1035" /> especially since there is the possibility of a review at the end of three years.  I read things that economists and others say, and I can see straight away that they are missing the point; they are missing a whole element that is included in the Government's calculations.  That is because they may take a figure from, for example, the National Pensions Board report and, unless they carry out very extensive consultations and spend a good deal of time on it, they do not realise that certain other things have been changed in the meantime, so what the Government are doing is not on the same base. These are changed in a practical way to ensure that the scheme is financed adequately and properly.</P>
    <P>It is on all those grounds that the Government believe the scheme being introduced at the moment is reasonable and fair to the self-employed contributors, and the Government would not expect that these calculations would be out to any real extent at the end of the day.  Nevertheless we are providing for a review at the end of three years.  In those circumstances I believe that what is here is reasonable and satisfactory and I would not accept an amendment to increase to 6.6 per cent at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy De Rossa is proposing is totally unacceptable. The PRSI contributions are set too high and will cause considerable problems for a large number of people. Farmers and other self-employed people feel very badly done by since people employed in the Civil Service pay 0.9 per cent in PRSI and other people on PAYE, after various deductions and so on, will be paying 2.4 per cent.  The farming community and the self-employed would agree to paying at the same level as every other section of the community, and by that I mean people on PAYE.  Having different categories and different rates of payment is not in the interests of justice and fair play.  There have been tensions between urban and rural people because of being asked to pay at different levels.  Even at <Col N="1036" /> this late stage, perhaps the Minister will try to achieve the implementation of the same level of payment for all sectors. That would be in the interests of all. The farming community are now paying income tax so it would be a great advantage to all sections of the community if this scheme were structured so that the farming community and the self-employed paid the same amount as the people on PAYE.</P>
      <P>On an earlier section my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, proposed excluding people in some of the labour-intensive industries.  That is something that must be borne in mind in regard to this section as well.  A considerable number of firms who were employing many people have closed not because they were unable to pay wages but because they could not pay VAT.  Another issue that caused problems was arrears of PRSI.  I am not condoning the non-payment of PRSI when it is lawfully imposed or the withholding of VAT but it is a fact that people have major problems in meeting their PRSI payments.  We have one of the highest rates of payment of PRSI in Europe and this is one area that is causing firms to close.</P>
      <P>Not so long ago a self-employed person took his own life because of threats from the sheriff.  I listened to his widow on Marian Finucane's programme and was saddened to hear her explain how her husband had been relentlessly pursued by the Revenue Commissioners because of his failure to pay VAT and PRSI.  This was somebody who had worked hard all his life, a sensible businessman who, for one reason or another, was unable to meet the demands and had made every effort to reach an accommodation with the Revenue Commissioners.  He had tried and failed to meet the payments, and when the pressure got too much he decided there was only one way out and took his own life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are huge numbers of business people living in terror of the sheriff and the Revenue Commissioners.  They have tried and are continuing to try to meet their PRSI and VAT payments but for one reason or another they are unable to <Col N="1037" /> do so.  In my constituency recently the sheriff visited a firm because it was not able to meet its commitments.  That business is now closed and the ten people employed there have lost their jobs.  As we speak, there are pressures on people throughout the country to make PRSI and VAT returns.  Businesses will have to close because sheriffs will seize their goods when they are unable to make their tax returns.  If this matter is pursued without a certain amount of commonsense, it will further increase the number of unemployed and the numbers emigrating. That is a point that we should not overlook because if we do, it will be to our detriment.</P>
    <P>Most firms are well able to pay their wages and their normal taxes and are able to meet their ESB charges but the imposition of PRSI on many of these employers will cause further problems for them.  Many of these people, including farmers and the self-employed, have their own pension schemes.  They have been paying into these schemes continuously over the years.  They are now faced with a problem in meeting their commitments to their pension funds and if they opt out they will lose the advantages of the pension funds.  On the other hand they will have to pay PRSI at a rate of 5 per cent.  Whether or not they will be able to pay the full 5 per cent and meet their other commitments as well is questionable in many instances and I worry about this problem.  The Minister knows that the National Pensions Board recommended that there be a break-even situation at 4.5 per cent.  It is unwise and wrong for the Minister to raise the rate to 5 per cent.  This tax should have been introduced at the same rate as for PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about businesses facing the threat of the sheriff.  Let there be no doubt about it, the farmers have also suffered tremendous difficulties in the past number of years.  As the Minister mentioned earlier, bad harvests have been the cause of serious problems.  In 1985 and 1986 when the weather was very bad many farmers lost crops and got into <Col N="1038" /> financial difficulties.  Farmers also experience major problems at present in regard to milk quotas and surpluses.  To impose this rate of 5 per cent will cause even further problems for those people. A number of farmers have received demands from the sheriff and this is causing them enormous stress and worry.  It has been the cause of some people having nervous breakdowns and seriously considering taking their own lives.  There is a very high rate of unemployment at present and industries are unable to meet the demands made on them.  The Minister should have excluded certain industries where there is intensive employment such as footwear, textiles, bakeries and so on.  This House should not overlook these types of industries.  We should ensure that these industries are maintained. We all have an interest in maintaining them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to let us know his views on excluding people from this scheme who are already fully committed to pension schemes.  That matter should be considered.  It is in everybody's interest that we ensure that there is the same rate of PRSI for all sectors of the community.  That would ensure equity, fair play and commonsense and the scheme would have the overall approval of everybody.  At present there are many schemes and charges such as land tax, water charges and so on and some people in the community pay them but others do not.</P>

If there was a certain amount of commonsense, co-operation and dialogue among people they would be able to come to some agreement.  If there had been <Col N="1039" /> discussions with the National Association of Tenants Organisations in regard to bringing in water charges, some agreement might have been reached.  Similarly, in regard to this matter if there had been proper discussions with the farming community and the self-employed, agreement might have been reached.</P>
      <P>I want to warn the Minister that there is a serious backlash developing among the farming community and the self-employed to those charges being imposed.  I can forecast that the Minister will have tremendous difficulty in collecting these charges.  He will have major problems on his hands.  It is unwise of him to proceed with this measure in the way he is doing.  I ask the Minister to use commonsense in this instance and to impose the same level of PRSI on the farming community and the self-employed as that imposed on the PAYE sector.  All sections of the community should pay that tax at the same rate.  If this is done there will be co-operation and the scheme could be a success.  The farming community, people in industry and the self-employed are anxious that the scheme should succeed but it must be brought in at the same level as for everybody else.</P>

Assuming that this proposal had been accepted by the Government and assuming 100 per cent collection, the subsidy for self-employed pensions would be 60 per cent, compared to a subsidy <Col N="1041" /> of 38 per cent for existing contributory pensions.  This assumes 100 per cent collection, as does the National Pension Board's report, which the Minister has dismissed.

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Bell would wait until I have finished?  The principle of equalised contributions is in the eye of the beholder.  Some take the same view as Deputy Enright that the self-employed contribution should be the same as the employee contribution.  If that were the case the cost to the Exchequer would be a great deal more and would not be sustainable.  To that extent I do not agree with the suggestion by Deputy Enright.  Deputy De Rossa proposes a contribution rate of 6.6 per cent.  That is his view of equity and it is also the view of the National Pensions Board.  It is their calculation of the combined employer and employee rate for the benefits under consideration, that is, old age pension and widow's and survivor's pension.  The 6.6 per cent contribution would still leave a subsidy of 60 per cent on these pensions in future years compared to a 38 per cent subsidy for an existing contributory pension.  The third view is that there should be the same subsidy towards the contributory pensions of those in the employed class and <Col N="1042" /> in the self-employed class.  If that were the case the contribution rate required would be a great deal higher than 6.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>One alternative is that the self-employed contribution would be at a different rate from the employed contributory rate.  Of course, the Minister has not enlightened the House on whether he proposes that the level of pensions payable to the self-employed will be the same as those payable to the employed.  That has not been stated by the Minister at any stage.  If we are to assume that they will get the same pensions then it means, as I have maintained all along, that the proposal before us is going to have the effect of costing the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds in future years.  That is why I have the most serious reservations against the proposal.</P>
      <P>I am all in favour of seeking a contribution from the self-employed class towards the cost of existing non-contributory pensions and thereby reducing the net outlay from the Exchequer on non-contributory pensions.  In his statement on 29 July last year the Minister said that that was his principal aim.  I and my party concur with the proposal that there should be a net contribution from the self-employed sector.  As it is proposed, that is not going to be the case, regardless of the claims made by the Minister.  I challenge the Minister to refer his proposal to the National Pensions Board, with the adjustments he claims he has made, so that they can do an actuarial report on it.  I have absolutely no doubt that the Minister is wrong in his figures and that the economists whom he decried are more correct.  In one case their figures may have been exaggerated but certainly they were more accurate than the Minister's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the National Pensions Board did not take into account unearned income, the new collection system or the increase in the upper income limit from £15,000 to £16,200.  I will deal with the last point first.  The Minister is totally wrong in relation to this.  The National Pensions Board used constant figures in assuming both the <Col N="1043" /> income and the outlay from the system. Therefore, the normal indexation which the increasing of the upper income limit virtually entails makes no difference whatever to the calculations.  The Minister is trying to bamboozle and confuse the House by importing that assertion.  It does not change the figures one iota.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new collection system I ask, what new collection system? Throughout their report the National Pensions Board emphasise that their calculations are done assuming a 100 per cent collection rate.  They also say that if we have the same success collecting the self-employed contributions as we have had in collecting the health contribution levy and the youth employment levy, we would need vastly increased rates of contributions to cost the proposal.  All the evidence shows that there will be enormous difficulty in collecting contributions from the self-employed sector &mdash; and it is important to refer to a point that was made by Deputy Bell in his interjection &mdash; until it is propitious for the self-employed to contribute.  In his interjection Deputy Bell said that this is different from the health contribution and other levies because they will not get anything if they do not contribute.  That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that but what I am saying is that the net result of this is that overall they will get more.  The increase in the outlay will amount to more than the contributions and under the proposal, the PAYE sector are again going to be left holding the baby.  I am fearful that once we start this, entitlements will be engendered which, in subsequent law, we will not be able to write out because any attempt to do so would be open to challenge in the courts on the basis of equality and equity with the employed sector.  We will be faced with the liabilities of the system and the only advantage will be the few bob the Government will have got in during the early years.  This is a monstrous proposal which has enormous implications for the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the interjection of Deputy Bell which expressed much of the attitude of the Congress of Trade Unions, of the Labour Party and, I think, of The Workers' Party also, whose view is that there should be a contribution from the self-employed sector.  I want to emphasise that I absolutely agree with that view but we do not want to end up in the position where it will cost us more.  Anybody who has a basic understanding of mathematics will know that this proposal, if implemented, will cost us more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the variables in the proposal? The first variable is the rate of contribution, the second is the income base and the third is the success rate of collection. The Minister or the Government can decide to vary the rate in future years but not to such an extent that would bring in an equal contribution from the self-employed sector as might come from the employed sector.  That would represent a penal imposition which would be totally unsellable and the reason for this is that, according to the National Pensions Board, the average earnings of the self-employed are less than the average earnings of the employed sector.  When it comes to pensions &mdash; the Minister has not clarified this but it has to be assumed &mdash; the self-employed sector will get the same pensions as the employed sector rather than a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  One reason for <Col N="1045" /> the gulf is that the Minister can vary the rates.</P>
    <P>The second variable is the income base. This can be varied by the self-employed themselves because they have a much greater opportunity for treating income in a different way than have the employed sector.  The employed sector have no way of understating their income.  Between employers and employees there may well be arrangements to provide benefits in kind which do not attract pay-related contributions, but in the main there is not remotely the same opportunity for understating income in the employed sector as there is in the self-employed sector.  The self-employed sector will have the incentive to understate their income because contributions are pay-related but benefits are not.  No matter how low a person's contribution he will get the same benefit at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why pay £30 a week if you can get away with £10 a week?  The tendency will be to understate income, if it cannot be avoided altogether.  If a person avoids paying these contributions, contrary to what Deputy Bell thinks he will not be left without an income when he reaches 66 years having passed on his farm or business.  He will go to the health centre and get supplementary welfare, pending his application for a non-contributory pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people who will contribute are those for whom it will be profitable to do so.  There is a third factor.  A person could evade paying these contributions until he reaches 54 years.  If he joins just before his 55th birthday he will get all the benefits after ten years' contributions rather than after 30 or 40 years' contributions.  This scheme is riddled with this type of loop-hole and clearly has not been properly thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the rate of collection. <Col N="1046" /> What evidence is there that we will have any greater success collecting these contributions than we have had with the health contributions, which were supposed to have some influence on a person's health entitlement?  People have evaded paying their health contributions in the self-employed sector and they will do likewise here.</P>
    <P>I have the gravest apprehension about the proposal before us.  For that reason, I see Deputy De Rossa's proposal as an opportunity to tease out in more detail than has been possible up to now the pros and cons and the projected costs of this proposal.  Chapter 19 of the report of the National Pensions Board, page 21, <i>Income Base</i>, subsection 4.4, reads:</P>
    <P>In order to express the cost of the proposed arrangements as a percentage of reckonable income it is also necessary to establish an appropriate income base.  Using information in Appendix C we have estimated the total reckonable income of those liable to make contributions, which exclude those in Category A, to be of the order of £1,200m.</P>
    <P>The percentage costs set out in the remainder of this Chapter are based on this estimate of income.</P>
    <P>And here is the important line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>It has been assumed that all contributions due will be collected in full and no provision has been included for any possible shortfall.</P>
    <P>I repeat, no provision has been included for any possible shortfall.  One would have thought it prudent and reasonable to make provision for a 10 per cent or 20 per cent shortfall.  The report goes on to say that on a break even basis, and assuming 100 per cent collection, we need a 4.5 per cent contribution rate.  The effective rate the Minister is proposing is 5 per cent.  That means we need a 90 per cent collection success rate and that is what the Minister is implying he will get. How does that compare with the collection success rate in relation to health contributions or the youth employment levy?  For some reason it is very difficult <Col N="1047" /> to get by way of parliamentary question or other methods accurate figures of the collection success rate in those areas, but one thing is clear and that is that the collection success rate is less than 30 per cent, and probably a great deal less.</P>
    <P>We now come to the income tax paid by the self-employed sector.  The National Pensions Board judged the average figure in respect of a self-employed person to be £1,200.  From that sector I think we got £36 million last year, a very tiny proportion of the tax collected.  One thing we can be certain is that the collection success rate of income tax from the self-employed sector is way below that from the employed sector, and is way below 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is indisputable that the end result of the Minister's proposal will cost the Exchequer tens of millions of pounds, especially after year ten.  Costs will start to accrue after year three when the first widows of the self-employed will be able to draw the widow's contributary pension. The problems I have outlined are not the only ones, there are also problems in relation to retirement.  There are no retirement conditions and that has enormous implications for handing over farms and businesses to the younger generation, which I presume we would all regard as a desirable objective, but we will not go into that now.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are going for the quick buck, to hell with tomorrow, grab a few bob today.  It is 1977 all over again.  I have been in this House long enough to remember what was said in 1977 and the implications of those promises.  I remember Deputy McCreevy, a Fianna Fáil Deputy, saying that as a result of those policies there would be 250,000 people unemployed. At that time we had 80,000 people unemployed and his colleagues laughed at him. Those policies did lead to 250,000 people unemployed.  As a result of this proposal in ten years' time the Exchequer will be worse off by tens of millions of pounds per year.</P>
    <P>The problem is to get a proportionate contribution based even on the figure of <Col N="1048" /> £1,200 in respect of the self-employed. One would need a contribution rate way in excess of 6.6 per cent which would almost certainly have the effect of worsening the rate of collection success, and that would not solve the problem. This is a very defective proposal from the Minister.  Deputy De Rossa is proposing we give effect to a recommendation by the National Pensions Board but, that would not ameliorate the adverse aspects of the proposal to any significant degree.  I challenge the Minister to put his money where his mouth is and refer the proposals back to the National Pensions Board to ask them to assess the amount of unearned income, to reassess their estimate of earned income and to do a recosting on the basis of the changes the Minister said have been made and present to us the actuarial cost of this over the next 40 or 50 years.  I accept that it will be dearer over 40 years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that some people are concerned but I do not think it is a major problem at this stage.  We are talking about a taxation regime 12 years from now but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that <Col N="1051" /> it would be difficult for the Minister for Finance to give details of what the taxation regime might be for 1989.  It is premature at this stage to indicate, or speculate on what regime should or may apply after the year 2000.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister concede that in the past one of the major sales tools in the hands of Irish Ministers seeking investment here has been that the corporate tax regime, as far as the rate of profit tax is concerned, was guaranteed up to the end of the century not to be above 10 per cent?  Will the Minister agree that long-term assurances diminish in value as we come closer to the date?  Will the Minister agree that it is desirable that the present regime should be replaced as soon as is convenient with a longer-term perspective that could be offered to companies as a means of inducing them to come here, given that it has been our experience that the existence of such an assurance up to the end of the century has been valuable? Will the Minister agree that we should roll that forward in some form at an early date?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 10, 11 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission's proposals for indirect tax harmonisation will be the subject of detailed discussion and negotiations among the member states. This process is at an early stage and it is not possible at this point to predict the final form the proposals will take.  Appropriate steps will be taken as matters advance to inform the public generally and trade and other interest groups which may be affected by the developments. The possibility of a Green or White Paper on the subject is not ruled out but is not planned in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated in response to an earlier question in the House, it is clear that the proposals as they stand would create very significant budgetary problems for us due to the loss of Exchequer revenue which would be involved in their full implementation.  A working group of officials from my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners was established to work out preliminary <Col N="1053" /> revenue implications of the proposals. They put the revenue loss at approximatly £470 million in the first year and £350 million annually thereafter.  Some means of mitigating such a serious revenue loss will have to be found in the Community discussions.</P>
    <P>The implications for costs and prices in this country will depend on the final shape of the package as settled by the Council of Ministers.</P>

There will be a reduced rate in the range of from 4 per cent to 9 per cent but, probably more important from my point of view, the zero rate at present operated by Ireland and the UK will then disappear.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be looking for favourable changes in the Commission's proposal and for special consideration to be given to Ireland because of the difficulties we would face.  There is no way, now or in the foreseeable future, that the Exchequer could do without £470 million in one year and £350 million on an annual basis thereafter.  Something will have to give in between.  A number of methods could be considered such as broadening the tax base elsewhere, further reductions in public expenditure, a direct contribution from the EC budget to the Exchequer or favourable changes in the Commission's proposals plus, as the Deputy has suggested, derogation. However, I do not think derogations will work in the future.  When difficult discussions are taking place during the night at EC level member states often decide, for the sake of getting an agreement, to give a derogation to another member state for one year.  However, it is very difficult to have derogations renewed for a second year.  We should during the negotiations finalise the regime we are going to live under for years from 1992 onwards.</P>

      <P>I apologise for being late, a Cheann Comhairle.  Would the Minister agree that to publish a very substantial discussion document on the implications of VAT and on its rates would inform public discussion?  At the moment, for instance, the idea of putting VAT on food is so frightening a prospect to many politicians that it cannot even be discussed, whereas at least if there were <Col N="1055" /> a document in which its implications were set out there would be more rational debate.  Has the Minister any proposal to produce either a White Paper or a discussion document so that the public debate will not be conducted on the basis of prejudice alone?</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that Value-Added Tax Refund Order No. 20 (S.I. No. 10 of 1987) already exists to provide partial relief from VAT on qualifying donated medical equipment and this avenue should be explored by the parties involved who wish to purchase this unit. Contact should be made in the first instance with the Department of Health who have a primary role in operating the scheme.  Budgetary circumstances do not permit of any extension of the scheme at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very large sum of money, a sum of £100,000, for the screening unit, raised entirely by voluntary effort and which will benefit the public generally, in this instance will the Minister consider full relief of VAT?

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should love to be able to agree fully with the Deputy but I have to say &mdash; and I did not know the exact cost which the Deputy says is £100,000 &mdash; that the scheme which is operating at the present time which allows the VAT rate to be reduced from 25 per cent to 10 per cent covers equipment costing £25,000 or more bought with voluntary donations.  Therefore, this piece of equipment should qualify.  I am also informed by the Department of Health that they have received no application under the scheme for a VAT reduction in this case.  Perhaps through the Deputy's efforts here today the hospital authorities may be informed that they should apply to the Department of Health.  On the basis of what the Deputy tells me, that the equipment costs £100,000, anything over £25,000 means that the VAT is reduced from 25 per cent to 10 per cent, so they have that concession.  As I said in reply to the question earlier, budgetary circumstances do not permit of any extension of the scheme at present.</P>

      <P>In 1986, the Commissioners of Public Works completed a study of the feasibility of restoring the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal which concluded that the estimated cost of restoring it for navigation would be of the order of £16.5 million at that time.  As stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 50 of 6 May last, this precludes any possibility of undertaking it in present economic circumstances.  The magnitude of the cost also inhibits the seeking of EC Regional Fund aid for the project as even if that were forthcoming a substantial proportion of the expenditure would still have to be borne by the Exchequer.  It is unlikely also that there would be sufficient money forthcoming from the International Fund to cover the cost of such a project.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the income tax exemption under section 2 of the Finance <Col N="1060" /> Act, 1969 for certain earnings of writers, composers and artists resident in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Where the conditions required by the section have been satisfied concerning original and creative works regarded as having cultural or artistic merit, there is an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to allow the exemption from tax provided for in the section.  I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the relief is being administered in accordance with the provisions of the section.</P>
      <P>While a decision as to whether a particular work qualifies for exemption may take a significant amount of time, because of the consultative process involved in each case, the Revenue Commissioners have assured me that in general no inordinate delays are occurring.

Will the Minister consider introducing a system that where a decision is not given in a certain period &mdash; in the case of planning permission a decision has to be given within a certain period &mdash; it should be granted or deemed to be refused and leave given to the person to appeal?  At any rate, a definite decision should be made by someone.  Will the Minister agree that it is most unsatisfactory to have an unstructured consultative process with no time limits?

The Revenue Commissioners say that most applications for <Col N="1061" /> which complete documentation is received are dealt with within two or three months.  The Deputy said that the complaint came from the accountants but I should like individual details because we only get a small number of representations &mdash; fewer than 20 &mdash; each year about the relief.  These are nearly always concerned with whether a particular claimant should qualify for relief, not with delays.  However, we will take action if the Deputy furnishes details.  The Revenue Commissioners also said that, since 20 March 1987, they have received 243 claims for the relief.  The applicants in about 180 of these have been informed that Revenue have made a favourable determination in their case or that they have been unable to do so; 27 of the remainder were received very recently and are in the process of being transmitted to the authoritative body.  Eighteen are with the body for decision and the rest &mdash; about 20 &mdash; are currently being processed.  That is a fairly good record on the basis of our information but if Deputy Quill, Deputy McDowell or any other Deputy has information in regard to <Col N="1062" /> delays we will be glad to have it and we could then make further investigations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that only one gaming licence with an expiry date later than today had been issued by them in relation to premises with a Dublin city address.  In addition approximately 60 licences with a Dublin city address were regarded as continuing in force by the Revenue Commissioners by virtue of section 18 (3) of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956. That subsection provides that, where a District Court refuses to issue to an appellant a certificate authorising the issue of a gaming licence, any subsisting licence held by the appellant shall continue in force pending the resolution of any appeal in respect of that refusal.</P>
      <P>The implications of the Supreme Court's judgment yesterday on a case stated by the Circuit Court in the matter of an application for a certificate are at present being studied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the circumstances in which the Revenue Commissioners could have issued even one gaming licence with an expiry date after today in view of the resolution of Dublin City Council in January 1986 to revoke Part III of the Act? If the Minister does not have this information, will be direct that an inquiry be held, because it was in total disregard of the resolution of the city council and outside the powers of the Revenue Commissioners? Am I correct in believing that the 60 licences continuing in force were issued for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985? In the clear and unambiguous terms of the resolution of the Dublin City Council in January 1986, the licences could not have been open to continuation which is, in effect, what Mr. Justice Griffin said in the Supreme Court yesterday.  He made it clear that when the resolution was passed anything that referred to previous years could not be the subject matter of litigation.</P>

      <P>The last part of my tortuous query is to ask the Minister if he agrees that the Supreme Court's judgement yesterday was no more than a clarification of what must have been abundantly clear to anyone in authority and concerned with this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that in relation to the one licence it was a mistake by the court but, once the court <Col N="1067" /> had issued the licence, the Revenue were obliged to comply with it.  The Deputy asked about the other 60 licences, I do not know the years for which they were issued but I assume it was prior to 27 January 1986.  The Supreme Court judgment was delivered yesterday and nobody in the Department of Finance or Justice would have received it yet.  When it comes to hand it will be carefully studied.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total amount collected to date from the youth employment levy/ youth training levy; the total amount outstanding in respect of these levies from (a) farmers and (b) self-employed at the latest date for which figures are available; the steps which are being taken to ensure that outstanding amounts are collected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Liability to the employment and training levy, as it is now termed, took effect from 6 April 1982.  The total amount collected from the levy up to the end of 1987 was £462.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment and training levy due from full time farmers was collectible by <Col N="1068" /> the health boards for the tax years ended 5 April 1983 and 5 April 1984.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collecting the levy from part time farmers and other self-employed persons for those years, and from all farmers and self-employed for subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The total amount of arrears, as at 30 September 1987, owed by full time farmers to the health boards, who remain responsible for the collection of these arrears, was £3.9 million.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that at 31 December 1987, a total of £64 million was outstanding, £16.3 million from farmers and £47.7 million from other self-employed persons, in respect of the years for which the commissioners are responsible. This total of £64 million is an estimate and on the basis of previous experience that amount will be subject to downward revision on closer examination, on appeal and for various reasons.  Likewise, the amounts outstanding to the health boards are based on initial assessments of income, and it is expected that the arrears will be reduced on production of actual accounts, and on appeal.</P>
    <P>In addition to the usual billing procedure, most of the health boards, in an effort to recover outstanding arrears of the levy, have also instituted legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that demands and reminders are issued regularly to those who are liable to the levy.  The commissioners say that the level of inquiry about the incentive scheme to bring tax affairs up to date, which I announced in my budget speech, leads them to expect improvement in the collection of these arrears in the current year.</P>
    <P>I also announced in my budget speech, in relation to the reduction of the flatrate VAT refund to farmers, that I would consider restoring the refund rate, currently at 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent next year, provided that the problem of all levy arrears is resolved satisfactorily through the co-operation of farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lack <Col N="1069" /> of effort on the part of the Minister and his Department to collect these levies. The amount outstanding, according to the Minister, at 17 June 1987 was £52.1 million of which £40.2 million was owed by the self-employed and £11.9 million by farmers.  The figure has now gone up to £64 million with £47.7 million owed by the self-employed and £16.3 million owed by farmers.  In June 1987 the amount owed to the health boards was £4.5 million and this has only been reduced by £1 million.  Can the Minister tell us why these levies are not being collected at a time when those in the PAYE sector, whose earnings are an open book, cannot afford to pay for health services?  Can the Minister tell us why no determined or vigorous effort is being made to collect these outstanding levies particularly at this time when people are hungry in this country?</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by his last remark but I agree with him when he says that it is appalling that such a large amount of these levies is still outstanding but I can assure him that every effort is being made by the health boards to collect them. Legal proceedings have been instituted in a number of cases, and also by the Revenue Commissioners, in order to collect these arrears.  As has been pointed out on numerous occasions, the total figures given are only estimates and it is no harm to put the matter into perspective. The amount likely to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners out of the total of £64 million is approximately £12 million, £9 million from the self-employed and £3 million from farmers.  The health boards are likely to collect about £1 million. The amount of employers' and employees' contributions outstanding from employers is £117 million of which we expect to collect £46.7 million.</P>

This has been agreed by the unions through a process of negotiation and through conciliation and arbitration.  I should point out to the Deputy that there are 106 people employed in the eastern region where there are 4,838 kilometres of channel and the financial allocation for this year is £1,274,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of withholding tax from payments in respect of professional services by certain persons, including doctors in the general medical service scheme, is provided for in Chapter III of Part I of the Finance Act, 1987. The relevant provisions are being administered in accordance with the legislation.</P>
      <P>I have met representatives of the medical profession and a number of meetings have been held recently with officials of my Department about the financial impact of the deduction at source, particularly, in individual cases.  I accept that the system can impose significant financial requirements in individual cases. However, the main effect is on a once-off basis.</P>
      <P>To limit this effect I introduced clearcut provisions in last year's Finance Act which allow interim refunds to be made in certain circumstances.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that these arrangements are working satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>In my discussions with representatives of the profession I have indicated that I would be prepared to have the working of the system examined in the light of any representative sample of cases which the profession might wish to submit and my Department have made a similar offer.</P>
    </Speaker>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his very full reply.  Prior to Christmas the Minister informed the House that somewhere in the region of £20 million had accrued to the Exchequer from the implementation of the withholding tax on professional fees.  How much of this was contributed by doctors under the GMS scheme and what level of interim refunds have now been paid?

      <P>A sum of £7.5 million of the £20.1 million in 1987 was in respect of taxes withheld under the GMS payments to doctors and pharmacists, the bulk of them attributable to doctors.  In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question I do not have the details in relation to any payments but the Revenue Commissioners indicated in January that a sample survey of 12 tax districts showed a relatively small number of claims &mdash; 113.  In general the claims were being dealt with expeditiously and there was no evidence of complaint about undue delay.  More recent inquiries to tax districts have indicated that there are no delays or problems in districts in dealing with interim refunds.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At the end of 1987 no refunds had been made. After Question Time or during the week, would the Minister supply me with figures for refunds that have been made?  Is the Minister aware that the main difficulty that arises is that there are many doctors in the GMS scheme that operate totally in the public sector and who do not have a private practice and, consequently, the 35 per cent withholding tax applies to their turnover rather than to their income.  To get interim refunds they must bring their tax affairs up to date.  They <Col N="1078" /> must pay up front the tax due for the last tax year and then 35 per cent of their current year turnover is withheld.  They are paying full tax plus 35 per cent of their current turnover and in several cases doctors in the GMS scheme are operating on a very low income and they cannot on that income sustain their wives and families.  Will the Minister look at the individual cases with a view to speeding up the interim refund or, alternatively, spreading the burden over a number of years while they bring their affairs up to date?  There is a real problem and I would like the Minister to take a personal interest in this.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question about interim refunds that have been paid, I will see if that information is available and will have it passed on to the Deputy. I accept, as the Deputy says, that the system can impose significant financial requirements in individual cases, hopefully on a once-off basis.  When we debated this last year the Deputy was very vociferous in that regard.  We should ask the medical profession to accept this offer and have a representative sample of cases the profession might wish to submit given to the Department.  We could have those examined and see how we could streamline the thing and it is important that we do that.  We are over the worst of it in relation to the impact it has, with the exception of these individual cases where hardship can be caused.  However, even in the legislation there is provision for certain hardship cases.  We need the information in these individual cases rather than a global condemnation of the system that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>No. National debt issues are contractually binding on the State and there is no question of attempting to renegotiate those terms and conditions of a contract which are fixed.  Only in so far as some foreign currency loans to the State contain provision for prepayment or refinancing at the discretion of the State before the full term of the loans expires are the terms of such borrowings capable of legitimate adjustment.</P>

      <P>While I accept the onerous contractual obligations on the State in this regard, let me ask the Minister, especially when the bank profits to be announced in May of this year are, to the best of my information, to be more successful than ever with higher profits for the banking groups as in the last number of years, whether the Government have considered this question.  Has any advice been given to the Minister from his advisers in the foreign debt section of the Department of Finance? Have the Government considered this question at all?  While I accept the contractual obligations, it is not unknown for people to renegotiate.  Have this Government discussed this question or has the Minister received any advice as to whether it is possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all those because they do not arise.  I <Col N="1082" /> cannot deal specifically, as the questioner intends, with the associated banks because we have banks, insurance companies, pension funds, building societies etc.  The information I can give to the Deputy in relation to domestic debt and the licensed banks is that the licensed banks are required by the Central Bank to hold a specified minimum proportion of their resources almost entirely in Government paper.  The associated banks &mdash; the AIB, the Bank of Ireland, the Northern Bank and the Ulster Bank &mdash; were holding £1,943.9 million which was £507.5 million more than the required minimum in Government paper, that is gilts and Exchequer bills, at 31 December 1987.  This represented 11.7 per cent of the domestic debt and 7.4 per cent of the national debt at that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

As I said, we have not just the associated banks, we have insurance companies, pension funds and building societies.  It would be impossible to do as the Deputy says.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Our approach is positive in regard to elimination of controls on a phased basis.  Ireland has complied with the liberalisation obligations introduced to date except for certain restrictions on the purchase by residents of foreign securities.  As the Deputy knows, we have a derogation from them and we got another one to the end of this year. Taking into account that the further relaxations I announced in November became operative on 1 January, we will review the whole matter again by the end of this year.  In November 1987 the Commission presented proposals to the Council of Ministers which aimed to remove all remaining restrictions in eight member states &mdash; there are very few restrictions in eight of the Twelve &mdash; as soon as the necessary legislative measures <Col N="1084" /> can be completed.  During the German Presidency they are pressing to have the measures adopted before the end of their term in June next in so far as the eight member states are concerned.</P>
      <P>Transitional arrangements covering the new obligations are proposed for the other four member states to end-1990 for Ireland and Spain and the end 1992 for Greece and Portugal.  In discussions on full liberalisation Ireland has supported the principle while highlighting the difficulties it could cause for some member states including Ireland.  We are seeking to ensure that the transitional period for Ireland will be extended to 1992 which is the target envisaged in the Single European Act for the completion of the internal market.  The other member states concerned are also seeking extensions of their transitional periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are positive in our approach on a phased basis as the Deputy asked in his question.  The main objectives of these exchange controls is to strengthen the balance of payments and external reserves, increase the capital within the State and reduce disruptive currency flows at times of exchange rate speculation, basically to protect our currency. As long as there is proper management and control of our finances there will be confidence in this economy and in our currency and therefore there will be very little need for these exchange controls. As we move to 1992 we will have full liberalisation.  But we have to negotiate our way through that and have a positive approach on a phased basis.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to ask supplementary questions on the basis of a tabular statement which I have not seen.  On the question of the land frontier, are customs officers actively seeking illicit drugs at the land frontier or are they so occupied with other activities that drugs are not a priority?  Second, could the Minister inform the House if the tabular statement contains seizures of synthetic drugs?</P>

      <P>In relation to the first question, I am sure customs officers are active in every place, but there have not been any seizures at land frontiers, only at ports and airports.  The drugs in question mentioned in the four pages for the particular years are herbal cannabis, cannabis resin, cocaine, heroin and others. What the others contain I am not quite sure.  I must confess to not being a professional in relation to whether these things are synthetic or otherwise.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the serious delays which are now occurring in the clearing of lorry transport by customs officers on duty on the Border with Northern Ireland; if he has any plans to alleviate this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the volume of traffic over the land frontier with Northern Ireland at Dundalk Road Station <Col N="1096" /> (for imports) and Carrickcarnan Frontier Post (for exports) has increased to such an extent recently that greater delays in the clearance of goods through customs during peak times are being experienced than had hitherto been the case.  However, available staff are deployed to the best possible advantage so as to keep delays to the minimum.  If the Deputy supplies details of specific instances where serious delays occurred at Dundalk Road Station or Carrickcarnan Frontier Post these will be investigated.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the commissioners are not aware of any serious delays at other customs stations or posts on the land frontier.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am informed by somebody who experienced a serious delay that it is impossible to get clearance before 9 a.m. in the morning because there is nobody on duty conducting this type of work until 9 a.m.; later in the day, during the course of a mid-morning tea break there is nobody on duty, and again at lunch time there is nobody on duty.  The journey now to the ports, for example, Larne, which would normally be a three hour run from north County Dublin is taking six hours as a result of delays.  I cannot vouch for it because I have no experience of it but according to the information supplied to me it is the method of deployment of customs officers that is causing delays rather than the volume of traffic.  I would like the Minister to comment on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in the volume of traffic and we are deploying the staff to the best possible advantage.  But I understood that it was possible for people crossing any land frontier to make arrangements outside normal working hours.  I accept fully what the Deputy says in relation to the individual case but if the details are passed on to the Revenue Commissioners we will have it examined and everything will be done to overcome these inordinate delays.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Apart from any information I might pass on &mdash; and it is difficult to pass on information which is given on a confidential basis &mdash; could the Minister make a commitment to the House to initiate an inquiry into the procedures for export by lorry to Northern Ireland at the moment with a view to alleviating the difficulties that are being experienced at the moment by exporters from the volume of traffic, from the procedures that are being applied and also as a result of the security situation?  There is a difficulty.  I would like the Minister to make a commitment to have it examined.</P>

I have seen some references in the papers myself to delays there.  We just have to ensure that we do not have any inordinate delays.  Once we have the full facts regarding these problems they should be corrected by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like at this stage to take the opportunity to pay our respects and <Col N="1098" /> thanks to the customs officials who are operating along the border not only in relation to this issue of imports and exports but in relation to the 48 hour travel restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I concur with the Minister on that.  The customs officers on the Border have a most difficult task but I would like the procedures under which they operate to be looked at because there is a significant added cost now being incurred by people who seek to export through the Northern ports.</P>

    <P>I must apologise to the Deputy that two of the three Priority Questions were in the form of a table, but there was so much information being sought that it was the only realistic way to put it forward. It is much the same as was announced in the programme in 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Again, it is difficult to frame supplementary questions on the basis of unseen tabular statements.  The point I am getting at and on which the Minister might be able to help is that the Minister has announced <Col N="1099" /> a number of locations around the country. In accordance with the Government's programme of decentralisation, civil servants will be moved from Dublin to these provincial locations.  The Minister has already provided information about the number of civil sevants for each location and the timescale he envisages. But I do not know &mdash; and I do not know if anybody else knows &mdash; if the Minister has identified Departments or sections of Departments in Dublin which will be moved.  It seems that the Government policy is to have voluntary rather than compulsory decentralisation.  Taking that as a principle it would be impossible to designate a key section of a Department for a provincial location.  One cannot be sure if the section designated would throw up enough volunteers to move or not.  It seems that the wish has come first to have civil servants in country locations but there has been no assessment of who should work in the rural locations and who should work in Dublin and what sections of Departments should work in the country.  I wonder is the decentralisation programme simply a method of accommodating young ladies who travel home every Friday night on provincial coaches or is there a serious attempt being made to decentralise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is planned to decentralise to Galway, Defence &mdash; finance branch; to Ballina, Environment &mdash; group water schemes, driver testing, housing grants; to Sligo, Social Welfare &mdash; old age pensions, widows' pensions, free schemes and child benefit; to Cavan, Agriculture &mdash; accounts, land policy and farm development; to Athlone, Education &mdash; salaries; to Letterkenny, Social Welfare &mdash; records branch (part of it); to <Col N="1100" /> Killarney, Justice &mdash; finance.  Sections of the Revenue Commissioners will be transferred to Limerick, Nenagh and Ennis.  It has not been decided what sections will be transferred but it will be decided at the time draws nearer.  In so far as Waterford and Dundalk are concerned, An Post and Telecom were in those areas but they are no longer under out responsibility.  We have not yet decided on what Departments will be going to those two areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is it not the case that all decentralisation of personnel will be on a voluntary basis, that no applications are being sought from anybody more senior than principal officer and, consequently, that any section which would require an assistant secretary as the top person in the hierarchy is not being decentralised?  In effect, are we not talking about the decentralisation of a multiplicity of people with clerical skills to perform a variety of low level clerical operations for the Departments the Minister has nominated? Is it not the case that there is no decentralisation of key elements of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be decentralisation of certain elements of Departments but whether they are key elements depends on the particular Department. The scheme is voluntary.  Particular sections in Departments will be offered transfers to whatever location and if there are not sufficient people in those sections wishing to transfer, transfers will be offered across the system where there are thousands available.  I understand that in relation to the Department of Social Welfare, which is one of the most advanced Departments, in one section there are 150 people wishing to transfer. The required number is 300.  By offering the transfer in other areas there will be no difficulty in getting the 300 people.  The kind of staff who will be transferred are in general services across the spectrum of the Civil Service and it is as easy for them to work in salaries sections in the Department of Defence or Justice as it is <Col N="1101" /> to work in the salaries section of any other Department.  They would be doing the same sort of work and therefore it does not lead to any problems or complications. The proposal is not in any way compulsory; it will be a totally voluntary system.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker, Deputy Mitchell, had discussed the whole scheme extensively and I would like to cover much the same ground.  I would immediately like to repeat the points I made last week on an earlier Stage and that is to say exactly what the benefits of the extension of the PRSI to the self-employed and farmers will be. There are a number of positive aspects. First, it will give pensions and benefits to <Col N="1136" /> the people involved, as is their right, just like the rest of the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not totally <i>au fait</i> with timing but having been called, I would appreciate being allowed to continue. I would not disagree with Deputy Mitchell speaking again later.</P>
      <P>The second benefit is that the extension will provide pensions for widows and orphans, as a right, and will therefore remove the worry that was hanging over these people previously, a worry which was expressed to many of us as public representatives.  It will remove the ludicrous situation I have referred to previously and which was discussed here this morning but which a number of speakers, including Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Wyse, seem to have ignored, that is the present payment of over £250 million from non-contributory benefits to the self-employed and farmers.  The scheme will also broaden the contribution base to the whole social insurance scheme generally and will provide a greater degree of equity.  The bottom line on those points is that a radical move in the long wished for and widely recommended national pensions scheme is being made.  It is the first positive move in that direction since 1978.  The Minister has to be lauded for his proposals.  When all the conflicting views and points made here today are out of the way it will become more obvious that the Minister has taken the correct course.  He has taken the middle ground, as it were, he has been fair in regard to implementing the charges and he has still allowed for a review in three years time should that be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not blame the public for being confused when looking at a report of <Col N="1137" /> today's discussion when, for instance, Deputy Enright and Deputy Mitchell from the same party were in total conflict. One of them claimed that there would be a total backlash from the hard pressed farmers and the other claimed that we were not charging half enough and that we were to spell out the reasons.  Deputy Enright said it was obvious that there would be a total backlash and that we are dealing with a very dangerous situation. Again, this is in conflict with what Deputy Harney said yesterday.  She told us that because the Government are in a giveaway situation the complaints from outside have died down and that everybody has accepted the scheme.  Either Deputy Enright or Deputy Harney is wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell agreed with some points but he ignored what was convenient to him.  He analysed in detail the cost of the scheme and again that was in total conflict with what Deputy Enright, his party colleague, said.  He ignored the £250 million being paid out at present, the broadening of the contribution base and the raising of the ceiling for contributions which will be done shortly. These factors have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>An important aspect, and he flitted across it, was the new collection system. He more or less sneered at the idea of even mentioning a new collection system. In the budget debate here previously I said that I thought it was ludicrous that the State has a different system of collection for health levies and youth employment levies from the system for collecting tax.  If the State took a case against a person for non-payment of one levy it would have to repeat the same process in the case of another.  The Southern Health Board have experienced great costs in sending out hundreds of solicitors' letters in trying to collect health levy charges.  It was a crazy situation and in many cases the cost was greater than the income.</P>
    <P>It is very important to recognise that to improve collection generally the Revenue Commissioners have introduced an integrated collection system which combines tax, health contributions, social <Col N="1138" /> insurance and employment and training levies.  It has been the case with regard to some of the smaller levies that it has been very costly to try to collect them through the courts.  The whole process is now being simplified.  The person paying will get a more accurate assessment and will know exactly what he owes.  This is a very important aspect of the new scheme.  Experience with the levies has been used to demonstrate that we will not have a 90 per cent or more collection rate.  The radically changed system which is now being introduced will eliminate such difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to unearned income.  We are all aware that there were easy ways of legally dodging payments. These loopholes must be plugged.  The Minister will now take unearned income into consideration and charge on it.  This will certainly make a difference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell has not examined the question of broadening the bases.  Everybody seems to ignore the fact that £250 million of taxpayers' money is being spent each year due to the absence of the kind of scheme now being introduced.  This factor must be taken into consideration. I should like to be positive rather than negative.  Deputy Wyse and I represent the same constituency which has a mixed urban and rural population.  We have very few stud farms in Cork South Central. Every week people come to us who have not taken out cover and who are fighting for the minimum rate to be made available to them.  I have dealt previously with the humiliation of people who have given 40 or 45 years of service to the State and who have to appear before local politicians or dignitaries to have a means test carried out in respect of a pension. They should have it as a right.  I would emphasise the benefits in this scheme for widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adopted a fair line by phasing in this scheme over three years. Everybody realises that we must take account of ability to pay.  There are differing opinions in the House.  Deputy De Rossa says the figure is too low, while Deputy Enright says it is far too high. The Minister has taken the correct option <Col N="1139" /> in going for the middle course.  I have looked at the various recommendations made since 1978, although I have not had the privilege of seeing Mr. Massey's television show.  I accept the Minister's figures as correct.  There is to be a review after three years and if any problems have developed they can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Wallace, also represents an urban/rural constituency. Deputy Enright was worried about the tension which exists between rural and urban communities because of the different levels of payment.  Perhaps things will be more relaxed when people realise they are getting their benefits as a right.  Certainly there was tension in relation to the collection of charges such as the youth employment levy and such issues were deliberately used to divide the community. We are proposing to get away from all that.  The method of collection is very important and our country is too small for these tensions.</P>
    <P>It is being said in regard to television licences that so many are not paying that the cost is raised for those who do.  This new scheme of social insurance could lower the cost for everybody.  The £250 million which goes to the self-employed and farmers who have not contributed must come from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have taken the easy option of doing nothing.  Instead he has brought about this debate and we are learning as we go.  Side issues are now being brought into the discussion.  The self-employed and farmers are looking at the situation of Civil Service employees. It must be remembered, however, that they have a totally different rate of benefit and that their pensions are covered under a separate payment.  We are heading towards equality, with everybody paying the same and getting the same benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister was accused yesterday by Deputy Harney of giving away taxpayers' money.  She was worried about stud farm owners and the like but I am more worried about the people I represent in my area.  Some of the early misconceptions about this scheme have been cleared up and people have become better informed <Col N="1140" /> about it.  They should know what is available and they will be thankful in the future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously that the people further along the line are the ones who will thank, and remember the Minister for extending this scheme.  I have had figures thrown at me about what will happen in 40 years time.  Perhaps what happened in the past is that people got so bogged down in looking at what was going to happen in 40 years time that they forgot about what would happen in the next few years.  I believe we have to act now and act positively.  We have to make sure that the days of touching the forelock and of people going along in a very humble fashion saying, &ldquo;please, may I have something even though I may not be entitled to it&rdquo; are got rid of.  I want people to have benefits as a right.  They should have to pay for the services and they should get them.  As I mentioned in relation to children's allowances, I am not worried about emotive arguments or the extreme cases that are trotted out here.  I do not believe that is good practice, whether it happens on television or in this House.  I represent the average person and I believe he recognises that this is a good scheme.</P>
    <P>The arguments in relation to incomes and how much should be paid have, to some extent, been dealt with.  Deputy Mitchell muddied the waters a little this morning when he referred to the 100 per cent collection rate.  All of these factors have been taken into consideration. Leeway is provided in the Bill through the extra ½ per cent, the increase in the ceiling and the extension of the base. Nobody's figures can be so accurate that they can say the scheme will break even but there is room for movement if there are any problems.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to what I believe is the bottom line in this Bill.  For ideological and other reasons we will have different views on the rates that should be charged.  Some people will base the rates on purely economic factors and try to protect one particular group so that they will not be expected to pay anything. <Col N="1141" /> That is to be expected but I ask them to support the concept of fair play for all. People should pay what they can afford to contribute and they should get benefit in kind.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of a number of things but in fairness I believe that Deputy De Rossa agrees with the principle of the Bill even though he disagrees with the figure proposed.  I hope that having listened to the Minister he will accept that all aspects have been covered and that he will withdraw his amendment. The attitude of people who have said, &ldquo;No we do not want this because the people we represent can look after themselves&rdquo; those who have been damning in their criticism causes me some worry.  I am worried about the people who say &ldquo;Our people are all very rich, they can provide for themselves and put money in the bank.  We are not too worried about the badly off people but look at all the money you are going to give to some millionaire.&rdquo;  These are the kind of emotive arguments we can do without. We should have a positive discussion on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in recommending the Bill in total.  I think Deputy Mitchell said we could use this opportunity to look at the scheme.  I would disagree totally with that because it is a reasonable scheme.  Reference was made to gross income and the Minister pointed out that reasonable allowance would have to be made for expenses.  This, again, is also a reasonable approach.  People will pay on their income, as assessed for income tax purposes and there will be a single rate so people will know what they have to pay.  I do not see any strong arguments against the proposal.  It is a very positive move.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier &mdash; and this might seem like strong language &mdash; that I thought it was an indictment of past Governments and Ministers that there had been no proposal since 1978 to bring in a national pensions scheme.  I am sure the people who sat in the House during that time must have had feelings on it but nothing was done.  I believe a balance has been found.  That is not saying the rate is <Col N="1142" /> too high or too low.  The bottom line of this Bill is that there will be equity for everyone, people will get their entitlements as a right, the contribution base will be broadened, as recommended in all reports, there will be a fair return on what is contributed and the £250 million which is at present being given away &mdash; and I say this in particular to Deputy Wyse and Deputy Mitchell &mdash; will cease. For all those reasons I strongly recommend the scheme and I ask Deputy De Rossa to accept the figures as put up by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a number of points.  While listening to the debate, which has been very constructive, I cast my mind back to hundreds of similar discussions in relation to the setting up of pension schemes.  It is amazing that many of the points and arguments made during this debate occurred over and over again in the debates on the setting up of pension schemes for workers in the industrial and commercial sectors.  The same factors are always involved &mdash; the trade union push to get the pension scheme on behalf of their members and the employer normally resists it.  When agreement is finally reached one sector pushes very hard for it, normally the older sector, the middleaged people are divided on it and the younger element, who have the longest to go in the scheme, are opposed to it because it is so far away they do not think about it.  Consideration has also to be given to the level of pension and what contribution the employer or employee should make and there is always conflict on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I am satisfied with the explanation that was given by the Minister but I want to emphasise that there are so many imponderables.  So many things can change &mdash; the number of people who enter the scheme, their income, the returns they make, the number of people who try to fiddle the system and the people who emigrate &mdash; that it would be virtually impossible for anybody to forecast accurately what the situation will be in 20 years time.  That is the way it has been in every pension <Col N="1143" /> scheme I have been involved in and there is no difference in relation to this one.  If there is a shortfall in the fund the actuary will say that the position is that we have less income or more income than we anticipated and we can give less or more benefits, as the case may be or, alternatively, we have to recommend that the contribution from the employer or employee should be increased by X per cent, X pence or X pounds during the next number of years when there will be a further review of the situation.</P>
    <P>That is the way it looks to me at this stage.  In three years' time when the fund has been established it will be possible to see more clearly where we are going.  I emphasise that in my opinion not alone should there be a three-year review but there should be annual reviews after that. The figures will be shown in the Estimates and in the figures from the Department, but it would be necessary to have a professional reassessment of the scheme not only after three years but annually after that.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that pensions schemes can go wrong in a very short time if a proper check is not kept from an actuarial point of view.  If the Minister of the day is satisfied with the advice he gets, that 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent should be the figures decided on for the first three years, we will agree with that, but we will be keeping a very close eye on this and constantly inquiring into how the scheme is going.</P>
    <P>If the farmers are asked to pay too much they will not pay anything.  The fact is the farmers do not want to pay anything, no matter what they are asked to pay.  I do not mind Deputy Enright making this point because he obviously has many farmers in his constituency. Probably if I had as many farmers in my constituency I would be saying the same thing.  There are farmers in County Louth and I will be telling them that this is a fair introduction to the scheme to which they are being asked to make a contribution and we will not support them if they try to opt out of it.  They opt out of too many things.  The roads in County <Col N="1144" /> Louth are in bits because they opted out of the rates on agricultural land and then they did not want to pay the land tax. Now they want to pay it.</P>
    <P>I will give a typical example.  The president of the ICMSA on the radio last night said he had met with Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil. The decision of his members &mdash; and he was speaking for the majority of the members of the IFA as well &mdash; wanted the land tax, £10 per adjusted acre index-linked. That is what the Labour Party were saying five years ago.  That is what the Coalition Government were saying. Now the bulk of Irish farmers are saying that is what they want because they do not like the system they have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had a land tax this new proposal would be easier to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The PAYE workers do not like the system but they are stuck with it and they have to pay.  The scheme cannot work if a man does not make a voluntary contribution but can benefit by a non-contributory pension.  We do not have to go into the farming and rural areas to find examples of this.  We see it in the urban areas too.  Millionaires with very large businesses transfer them to their sons, and six months later they are granted non-contributory pensions for the rest of their lives.  That should be stopped.  That can be stopped because when these people transfer their businesses to a family member they should be considered as having an income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a young boy who comes to see us in our clinics and tells us he was awarded £8 unemployment assistance. We check with the Department and they tell us his means were X amount because his father or mother is working.  At the other end of the scale, a man owning £1 million of property can transfer it to a family member and get a full non-contributory pension, having paid nothing into the system.  Yet the young schoolleaver who cannot get a job is given £5 or £8 a week &mdash; it is impossible to live on such a small sum &mdash; because his father or <Col N="1145" /> mother is working and is deemed to be providing board and lodging.  That loophole has to be plugged.</P>
    <P>My hair stood on end when I heard what Deputy Mitchell had to say.  I agree with him.  The message should go out loud and clear from Dáil Éireann that if this Bill is brought in, the farming community and the self-employed will be included and that loopholes as regards non-payment will be plugged.  We should join forces to stamp out this abuse.  No section of the community should say they will not pay and that the PAYE sector will have to carry the can.  We can stamp out this abuse very easily under the regulations. That is another reason I supported the extraordinary level of regulations in this Bill by comparison with other Social Welfare Bills.  Those regulations should be used to close loopholes and the self-employed should be told that if they do not contribute to the scheme they will be pursued through the courts the same as anybody else who does not pay what he is entitled to pay.</P>
    <P>The scheme cannot, and will not, succeed if any sector of the community is allowed to opt out because other people will have to pay, that is, the PAYE sector.  There are many thousands of people in small businesses who are only making a living.  They are not rich men by any means, but they have to contribute to this scheme the same as a farm labourer or a corporation worker who is taking home £95 or £100 each week to keep his family.  We can make all the excuses we want.  We can say this person or that person cannot afford to pay, but if everybody pays his fair share it will be cheaper for all.</P>
    <P>I take the point raised by a number of Deputies that we do not know what the outcome of this scheme will be.  This is a new ball game.  Every new pension scheme ever introduced in the commercial, industrial or any other sector has to be constantly monitored and reviewed because there will be problems.  There will always be the sharks who try to beat the system and the regulations have to be strong enough and fair enough to deal with that minority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> I do not believe this debate is about the difference between farmers and industrial workers.  I welcome this Bill because for the first time we have legislation which to some degree brings the industrial worker. the farmer and the self-employed under one umbrella.  It is a great pity that this cannot be done in all walks of life.  The farmers should not use their political muscle to get what they want.  If they do, industrial workers, and those in the PAYE sector will have to ask themselves, &ldquo;what is the point in us paying if the self-employed and the farming community are not prepared to pay their fair share&rdquo;? Most of the self-employed are in favour of this proposal.  As a result of consultations I had with some of them I am satisfied that the 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent is acceptable to them.  A small minority are advocating that they should not have to pay anything but they should not be allowed to influence or dictate to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often I agree with my colleague from Louth, Deputy Bell, but having listened to his contributions in the debate I can agree with most of what he has said.  Like Deputy Bell I welcome the decision to have a statutory review after three years.  I accept that we will have an opportunity to review the scheme when dealing with the Estimate for the Department but it is important that the Department should monitor the scheme.  In effect, we are looking into a crystal ball to try to discover whether we will be in the black or in the red in 50 years time but, as Deputy Dennehy said, we will have to take the plunge at some stage.  I understand that we are one of the few west European countries whose self-employed are not liable for PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that people at the end of their working life should get a pension. It is important that they should know they will be paid a minimum sum to help them make ends meet.  Very often it is pointed out to me that those who contribute all their lives to such a fund get a certain return when they retire while a person who retires here after working <Col N="1147" /> in England, having invested his or her money, is entitled to a non-contributory pension once he or she proves they are entitled to it.  The decision to extend the scheme to the self-employed will eliminate a lot of the means testing for contributory pensions and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned a figure of £360 million after ten years and the Government have set the rate of contribution at 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent over the next three years with a promise of a review then.  Last weekend I received a deputation of farmers who saw this as the thin end of the wedge.  I do not know if it is but I am happy that a review will take place after three years. The Government will have a better understanding of how the scheme is progressing and will be better able to give details of the position in regard to widows and orphans pensions.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board suggested a figure of 6.6 per cent but acknowledged that the figure would have to be based on the ability of people to pay.  The decision to taper the contributions was a good one.  If those being brought in under the scheme were to be hit with a big demand in the first year they would find it difficult to make ends meet.  The Minister has adopted the best system.  At a later stage the rate may be increased to 6.6 per cent, or higher.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have placed a lot of emphasis on reports by economists questioning the Minister's figures.  The Minister has responded to those queries but to date nobody has challenged the figures he has put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The economists, who criticised the Minister's figures, have gone to ground.  If their figures are correct they should have questioned the Minister's figures but they have not done so because their figures were based on wrong assumptions.</P>
      <P>The Minister's figures were based on unearned income and on raising the ceiling from £15,500 to £16,200.  I agree with Deputy Bell that some people will do everything possible to avoid paying their contribution.  For that reason I welcome the decision to change the collection system.  Too many people are not paying their health contributions or the youth employment levies.  They are not being pursued in the courts because the amounts involved are small.  I agree with the proposal put forward by the Minister that the Revenue Commissioners should sue for tax, youth employment levies and health contributions in the one action rather than making separate applications to a court or seeking warrants in respect of one sum that is outstanding.  I do not agree with instituting separate proceedings for the different levies.  This is the first time that the Revenue Commissioners have been brought into this and I think the move will prove worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The decision to introduce self assessment for the self-employed was a good one.  The estimate issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the self-employed will include the contribution to the new fund, and other levies.  That is one way of ensuring that the money owed is collected on time and not left outstanding for years. Deputy Mitchell alleged that the scheme would cost millions but I do not accept his figures.  Most Members have accepted the Minister's figures of £50 million annually which is very conservative.  Even economists agree with that figure.  Rates of 3, 4 and 5 per cent over the next three years are reasonable and I do not think anybody will quibble with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I received a deputation of <Col N="1149" /> farmers.  I was not invited on to the rostrum in Castlebellingham but that may be due to the fact that I do not represent as many farmers as Deputy Bell.</P>

      <P>This deputation came in and I took the wind out of their sails. They had not known until then that they would get the benefit of a widow's pension and an orphan's pension after three years.  One or two were astounded at that.  Obviously, they were not given the correct information.  They then had to acknowledge that the rates of 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent were reasonable. What they were worried about was that in three years' time or later on it might increase to a higher figure.  We all have to acknowledge their fears.  However, it will not go out of all proportion; it cannot. The Minister and the Government have shown that the National Pensions Board came up with a figure of 6.6 per cent. Obviously, there are other elements in that that they have to take into account, such as ability to pay and ensuring that it is reasonable in the circumstances, given the economic state of the country.  Everybody who is involved with this, by and large, is in agreement with the extension. We quibble about the rate of payment but a medium has been agreed upon and that should be accepted by all in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points on this amendment.  First, it is clear that it was unfortunate we had not the time on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill to discuss this area because of the guillotine that was applied yesterday.  Many of the questions being raised on this section should have been answered by the Minister but he will not have an opportunity to do so because we are now on Report Stage.  The question of a backlash was referred to by Deputy Enright.  To my way of thinking, and as expressed by a number of other Deputies, if the backlash is to come at all it will come from the PAYE sector because <Col N="1150" /> they, at the end of the day, will carry any additional burden that might arise from this scheme.  It will have to be drawn from general taxation.</P>
      <P>The point has to be made that what has been proposed here is quite a generous scheme for the self-employed and the farming community.  There is a limit to the income which can be taken into account after taking out all the exemptions. There is a limit on the earnings, which can be assessed for these contributions &mdash; I think it is about £16,000. It will be 3 per cent of £16,000 at a maximum.  People cannot be asked to pay any more than that.  It is reasonable to assume that anybody who, having taken all the discounts and exemptions into account, still has reckonable earnings of £16,000 is not a poor person by any means and can well afford the £9 a week which 3 per cent would work out at on earnings of £16,000.</P>
      <P>I am a voluntary contributor to the social insurance fund.  I was a Class A contributor for very many years before I came into this House.  My sole income is the income that I get from this House. My contribution on social insurance is 6.6 per cent up to, I think, the first £15,000 and 1.9 per cent on £500 after that.  It would be reasonable to expect other categories who are being brought into this scheme to pay at least that level of contribution. I do not claim for a moment that the contribution I am paying is insignificant &mdash; it leaves quite a hole in my income &mdash; but I have been advised by those who know the ropes in relation to pension schemes and bonuses that the value I will get at retirement age is far ahead of anything that I might get if I did not pay it and put the same amount of money into a private pension scheme. There is no comparison between the two returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept there can be an argument that people are concerned that if it was fixed at 6.6 per cent that would be an unwelcome burden on those who would have to pay.  There is a maximum this year of 3 per cent on £16,000 which works out at about £9 a week.  If you are in the tax net but have no tax return, the <Col N="1151" /> minimum amount payable is £208 which is £4 a week and those who are outside the tax net, who do not have to make a tax return, simply have to pay £2 a week. That is a very good deal in anybody's language.  What I am arguing is not to eliminate the £2 or £4 a week, but simply to ensure that those who have significant incomes will pay a rate at least in line with the PAYE employee and the voluntary contributor, one of whom is myself.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the self-employed and the farmers should be equated in terms of rates of pay with the employee.  It is said they contribute something around 2.4 per cent.  That varies up and down.  It is a fairly arbitrary figure in any event, not a specific calculation of X number of percentage points which an employee or employer pays into a pension fund <i>per se.</i> Leaving that aside, perhaps it would be fairer to argue that the amount which the Exchequer has to pay into the fund in order to subsidise the pensions should equate for the employee and the self-employed.</P>

      <P>I understand from the pensions board that it would work out at about 11.6 per cent, that is, if my reading of the report is correct.  I am not even arguing that that should be done because I can see it might be an unfair burden.  In terms of equity, the 6.6 per cent should be plumped for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell is a little too generous in accepting that the figures arrived at were purely on the basis of actuarial figures, that the 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent were calculated on a mathematical basis and that political considerations had no part to play.  The 3 per cent is quite close to the figure which employees pay at the moment and it seems that was the figure the farmers and the self-employed were looking for.  In order to defuse the opposition which could be expected to be mounted from the IFA and various other organisations of the self-employed <Col N="1152" /> against this measure, a lower figure was agreed on to start with.  I can understand when the Minister talks about having a pragmatic approach why he did so, but I do not accept, in fairness to the rest of the community, to the people who pay the vast bulk of taxation, that we should pander in this way to the self-employed and the farming community.  It is not a huge burden and the value which they will get at the end of the day in return for what they pay in will be way beyond the amount which will have been paid in.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I wish to make. It is one which has not been referred to at all by any other Deputy, as far as I am aware.  It arises in the report of the pensions board.  It is that unless the self-employed are treated as the equivalent of both employer and employee for the purpose of PRSI contributions the self-employed will be at a competitive advantage in the labour market.  Let me quote the National Pensions Board's statement:</P>
    <P>. . .  there will often be a choice between employing an employee to carry out a particular duty, or else contracting with a self-employed person to do so.  Clearly there is no good reason why the choice should be other than neutral from the income tax and social insurance aspect, which in turn implies that the self-employed person should also assume responsibility for the employer's contribution that would otherwise be avoided.</P>
    <P>That is a point worth keeping in mind when we are considering this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made a case in relation to switching a PRSI contribution based on income to a levy based on turnover on the basis that it would assist employment.  If we fail to ensure that the level of contributions paid by the self-employed is at least in line with that of the employer-employee combined in relation to this matter, we will be giving the self-employed a competitive edge in the labour market.  More and more people will be made redundant by firms and reemployed as contract labour which, in turn, deprives the contracting person of <Col N="1153" /> cover under a whole range of social legislation. For that reason I wish to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 36, after &ldquo;contributors&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and none of the entitlements, which would otherwise accrue arising from self-employed contributions made under this Act, shall accrue until the Minister arising from the review, tables before both Houses of the Oireachtas an actuarial report showing that over a 40-year period, the net outlay of the Exchequer on all old age, widows' and orphans' pensions will not be increased over and above the outlay that would have occurred had not self-employed contributory pensions been provided for under this Act and, if arising from this actuarial report, it is decided on grounds of cost not to continue with the self-employed contributory pension scheme any contributions made shall be rebated.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have already had an extensive discussion on the question of pay-related social insurance for the self-employed on amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  Therefore, and in view of the short amount of time remaining I will just formally move the amendment and ask the Minister to accept it on the basis that it would give him an opportunity to vindicate his claim that his proposal will not cost hundreds of millions of pounds in the future as I contend it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that the introduction of social insurance for the self-employed would not give rise to a net increase in the burden on the Exchequer in financing social welfare. However, the manner of achieving this aim as proposed in the amendment would be unacceptable on a number of grounds. It would create uncertainty for contributors and would introduce a serious degree of uncertainty into the system as far as self-employed persons are concerned. Those who paid contributions in <Col N="1155" /> the early years would have no guarantee that these contributions would ultimately be reckonable for social insurance pensions. They would not know whether they would have to settle for a refund of the contributions paid.  As a result, persons with private pension cover would be left in a position of not knowing whether and to what extent they should adjust their level of cover to take account of the social insurance entitlements they would be acquiring.  Others would be left in a position of wondering whether it would be necessary to take out private pension cover and, if so, what level of cover they should obtain.</P>
      <P>The second reason is that it could have a negative effect in relation to compliance.  Contributors might be reluctant to make their contributions or might delay paying them until they were sure that such contributions would be reckonable. This in itself could have such an effect on the contribution income that it would not be possible to forecast with sufficient accuracy the ultimate net cost of the scheme to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The third reason is that it would have an effect on individual claimants and it would also have a serious effect on them at a time when they would be vulnerable. For example, a widow whose husband had previous insurance as an employed person and who with the addition of the self-employed contributions paid prior to his death would qualify for a contributory pension could have to spend up to two years not knowing whether such pension would actually be payable.  Similarly, self-employed persons with previous insurance on reaching the age of 66 would also have to undergo a period of such uncertainty.  This would be contrary to the basic aim of the scheme and social insurance generally which provides guaranteed benefit if the contributions and other conditions laid down are satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review provided for would enable the Government to determine what the financial implications of the new scheme would be for the Exchequer.  It would <Col N="1156" /> then be possible to make whatever adjustments were necessary and these would operate over a 47 year period.  The outcome of the review could be no change or, if changes had to be made, an adjustment in the rate of contribution or in the level of future increases in the benefit or some combination of both.  It has to be emphasised in this context that there would be no additional cost to the Exchequer in absolute terms for at least 13 years and that in the early years of the scheme the Exchequer would benefit significantly.  Deputies on all sides of the House have recognised this fact.  Accordingly, there is plenty of time and scope to make whatever adjustments may be necessary to ensure that the cost to the Exchequer of the proposed scheme over the 50 year period referred to in the National Pensions Board's report would not exceed the cost of continuing the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>Given such a timespan the short term safeguards provided for in the proposed amendment are not necessary.  Apart from all the other considerations which I have referred to and which would be damaging to the scheme, any adjustments would be of a minor nature.  The homework has been done by the National Pensions Board, by the Revenue Commissioners, by the Department of Social Welfare and by the Government.  All have done their homework on this scheme.  Actuarial studies have been carried out by the best experts in Ireland who have high international standing. The Revenue Commissioners have estimated the income and they are conservative estimates.  I emphasise again that the estimates on the income side are conservative.  I support them and so, too, should this House.  We are introducing a major scheme and we must have confidence in our own experts, in those who serve us within the public service and in those from outside who have assisted us in the work we have done.  We must have confidence in them and there is plenty of time for review.</P>
    <P>There is no need for this amendment which has been put forward by Deputy Mitchell.  It would have the effect of undermining confidence in the scheme.  I <Col N="1157" /> have confidence in this scheme and I am happy that the scheme is more or less right at this stage.  I think other Deputies recognise that we should go ahead and get this scheme up and running and see how it will perform.  We have our own experts and rely on them.  We will continue to rely on them.  In that context, since we are coming to the close &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to divide my time between Deputies Donal Carey <Col N="1158" /> and Síle De Valera and if the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, wishes to come in he is more than welcome.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this serious matter on the Adjournment.  At the last meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board a decision was made to downgrade Ennis General Hospital and to reduce the number of beds from 96 to 76.  That 76 includes six day beds so the actual number of beds is 70 &mdash; 40 medical and 30 surgical beds.  This is very serious because Clare is a very large county with a population of 90,000 people.  Up to February or March last year there were 127 beds in the hospital and we were told that the reduction last year to 96 was a temporary measure, a holding operation.  This year the beds have been further reduced to 76.  The situation is intolerable.</P>
      <P>Today in Ennis General Hospital they had to refuse to admit patients.  The programme manager in Limerick has now directed the Regional Hospital in Limerick not to admit patients from the Clare catchment area.  In Clare people have been returned home because of the inability of hospitals in the area to admit them.  The authorities in Ennis tried to get a patient admitted to the Regional Hospital in Galway and they were unsuccessful. There are real, unexaggerated fears for the lives of people in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reducing the number of beds we are substantially reducing the number of surgical beds.  There are two very efficient surgeons employed in the hospital.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that able professional men will not sit around for too long twiddling their thumbs if they cannot get the beds to cater for the number of patients they are capable of operating on.  It is only a matter of time until one of those surgeons looks elsewhere for employment.  There is a very efficient staff, two very good physicians, a good radiologist, a good anaesthetist and an excellent nursing staff.  The nursing staff have catered for from 112 to 123 patients in recent times, while only having a staff complement to cater for 96 patients.  They have been very dedicated and have provided an excellent service in <Col N="1159" /> the county.  A number of them have now received notice along with a number of other workers in the hospital.</P>
    <P>There is a very real problem in the county.  I have come here this evening to ask the Minister for Health, whom I believe to be a reasonable and understanding man, to look at this serious problem and to see that the criteria applied in relation to the decision that was arrived at by the Mid-Western Health Board could not be the same as the criteria applied to Nenagh.  The CEO in a meeting we had with him prior to the health board meeting stated specifically that he was applying the same criteria to both hospitals. I contend that the same criteria cannot apply, because Nenagh General Hospital services people who also have ready access to Ballinasloe hospital, Clonmel hospital and Limerick hospitals and they are not very far either from Portlaoise. The situation in Clare is quite different. From Clare to Limerick is as far as from Roscrea to Dublin and the problem is compounded by the fact that the road infrastructure from Clare to Limerick is not as good as the road infrastructure from Roscrea to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a position to examine the problem.  He knows there is a report on the general hospitals in his Department that specifically states certain things that should be done in relation to general hospitals.  If he looks at that report he will find it recommends that the general hospital in Ennis should be upgraded and that a number of hospitals around the country should be downgraded and closed.  It is unfortunate that the Mid-Western Health Board were not directed by the Department of Health to follow the guidelines in that report.  Will the Minister advise the CEO to apply different criteria to the recommendation he made to the Mid-Western Health Board?</P>
    <P>I am also asking the Minister to make a special subvention to the Mid-Western Health Board for Ennis General Hospital specifically.  Only last week I read on the front page of <i>The Kerryman</i> that the chairman of the Southern Health Board was in a position to come to the Southern <Col N="1160" /> Health Board and make an announcement of an extra allocation of funds to that region in order to keep a ward open in Tralee General Hospital.  If the Minister and the Department can do that for Tralee, surely they can do it for Clare?  I am asking the Minister to do that.  I know he is a reasonable person and will take into account the problems that arise in relation to Clare.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister happy that Clare should be the only county on the entire west coast that will not have a major medical facility?  Every other county on the west coast has a major medical facility and what was decided a few weeks ago in Clare substantially downgrades the facility we have.  If we are to continue down that road we will end up with little more than a glorified district hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for agreeing to this Adjournment motion regarding a matter we raised on six or seven other occasions.  I also thank my colleague, Deputy Taylor-Quinn, for allowing me time to speak.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn has outlined the problem facing Ennis General Hospital following the recent decision of the Mid-Western Health Board to reduce the number of beds available in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a question for written reply on the Order Paper today asking if the Minister was satisfied with the make-up of the beds with 40 medical, 24 surgical, 6 day-only surgical and 6 ICU beds.  From the reply he seems to be satisfied, but in terms of medical economics as practised by Comhairle na nOspidéal, consultants and other medical groups, 76 beds in a general hospital is below the guidelines.  Confusion seems to exist between the Department of Health and the Mid-Western Health Board about the number of beds required.  In a written reply to a question put down by Deputy Barry Desmond recently the Department of Health indicated there would be 80 beds in Ennis for 1988, so even four additional beds would be of some benefit to Clare people.  The minimum beds set down by Comhairle na nOspidéal was 80 beds for an economic <Col N="1161" /> Ennis General Hospital.  As Deputy Taylor-Quinn said, Clare will be the only county on the west coast without a general hospital.  We have been accused in our own constituency of lying down under this matter.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry yesterday to get a letter from the Taoiseach saying he saw no purpose in meeting Clare County Council to talk about Ennis General Hospital.  I thought it appalling that a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach would not meet the Fianna Fáil dominated Clare County Council to discuss the problem of Ennis General Hospital.  The other night I attended a public meeting which was dominated by Fianna Fáil people who are concerned about the hospital and at long last are aware of what cuts mean and the decisions that are going to be taken which will affect County Clare.  Fianna Fáil people realise now the U-turn by Fianna Fáil, particularly by the Minister for Health.  Previously in this House, I, like Deputy Taylor-Quinn, praised the Minister for his forthrightness in coming before this House and being open about what he proposed to do.  I have read in a Tipperary paper that the Minister for Health said he was not going to implement the FitzGerald report on hospitals. Implementation of that report by stealth will be almost the death of Ennis General Hospital because, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn pointed out, one of the surgeons will surely make a move to leave.  According to statistics I have from the Mid-Western Health Board, the number of surgical bed occupancies in Ennis General Hospital in 1987 amounted to 3,657. In the previous year the number of surgical bed occupancies was 2,163 and the theatres were then being reconstructed with money provided by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond. Clare people are concerned about this downgrading.  Because of the general demeanour of the Minister for Health and his interest in his own profession Clare people thought they would have had the minimum required standards for a general hospital.  The Ennis Action Committee, the consultants, nurses and doctors in Ennis General Hospital all indicated that 76 beds are not enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> I appeal to the Minister at least to grant the Fianna Fáil-dominated Clare County Council an audience and explain to them why he feels 76 beds are sufficient.  I do not want to go back to Clare as the messenger boy telling them that I am sorry, the Minister would not explain.  I want the Minister himself to explain why he is confident about this matter, because all the experts in my constituency tell me it cannot work.  How does the Minister see it working?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for giving me some of her time and an opportunity to talk about this very great problem.  Great concern and anxiety exist in County Clare at the decrease in beds from 96 to 76 in Ennis hospital.  It is difficult to accept such a decision by the Mid-Western Health Board, considering they made a decision in 1980 to promote the county hospital to a general hospital with 218 beds.  This decision was confirmed on 2 May 1980. The 218 beds was based on the 1971 census in which the population of County Clare was 75,000.  Clare now has a much increased population, 92,000 and the need is now for a greater allocation of beds than the Mid-Western Health Board are at present prepared to give.</P>
      <P>To put things in perspective, let me give some facts and figures with regard to admissions to the hospital in 1987. The admissions were 3,439 plus 1,120 day admissions, out-patient surgery clinics 4,968, casualty 17,592, X-rays 23,000 approximately and specimens processed in the laboratory were about 50,000.  The facilities in Ennis Hospital are certainly not being under-utilised.  The Ennis allocation for 1987 from the Mid-Western Health Board was £4.019 million.  The 1988 allocation is £3,008,390.  There is obviously a large shortfall here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would not be realistic if we were not at present to accept that cutbacks must be made, but in this climate when we are trying to save money it is hard to see a decrease in beds in Ennis.  The cost per bed per year for Ennis is £34,280. This figure happens to be the lowest in the Mid-Western region.  For the regional hospital in Limerick the allocation is <Col N="1163" /> £41,470 per bed per year, so it seems there is an increase there compared to the cost per year for Ennis.</P>
    <P>There is concern with regard to the running of the Mid-Western Health Board and health boards generally.  The Mid-Western Health Board have a substantial allocation of £83 million and within that they should be able to run the kind of health services and health care we would expect in the Mid-Western Health Board region particularly in County Clare.  Unfortunately, this does not seem to be done at present.  I would like the Department of Health to ask the Mid-Western Health Board for details of accounts on administration costs, particularly with regard to expense accounts.  I would like to see a greater accountability to the Minister on behalf of the health boards in general.  It is a question of priorities and I do not believe the priorities of the Mid-Western Health Board are those of the people of Clare at this moment.</P>
    <P>We need retention of the Ennis hospital and we would like to see it expanded not only because of population concern but because of the existence of Shannon Airport, because of Symtex, because of Moneypoint and indeed, as has been pointed out by my colleague from the opposite benches, because of the distance involved, particularly for those people who live in west Clare.  It is paramount that they have the kind of service that we wish to see in Ennis Hospital.  We want to see that hospital being maintained and, if at all possible, improved.  I would ask the Minister to impress on the CEO of the Mid-Western Health Board the need to ensure that Ennis Hospital continues as an acute hospital and that the hospital needs at least a complement of 96 beds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much the concern of the Deputies about services at Ennis General Hospital.  I am glad of this opportunity to set the record straight regarding Ennis, as of late there has been much rumour and speculation concerning the future of this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I took up office as Minister for <Col N="1164" /> Health in March last year it became clear to me that if we were to contain the level of public spending on the health services and yet maintain an acceptable standard of health care some rationalisation of existing services and facilities was unavoidable.  As more than 50 per cent of the health budget goes on the hospital services it was evident that particular attention would have to be paid to this sector to ensure that services and facilities which were no longer essential to the system were phased out or adapted to meet the challenge of changing practice in hospital medicine.  Accordingly, I set up a review group to examine the entire hospital system.</P>
    <P>The review group's findings underlined the fact that in the country as a whole there was a surplus of acute hospital beds by reference to established and agreed planning guidelines and in particular there were more beds than could be adequately supported by the funds available and which were agreed by this House as being adequate to fund a satisfactory level of health care.  Specifically in the Mid-Western Health Board area a similar pattern emerged and it was imperative that hospital services in the area be rationalised.  This House is already well aware of the initiative taken by me to phase out public hospital facilities at Barringtons Hospital and to strengthen and improve the services at St. John's and Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like to say first of all that the level and scale of services at the general hospital in Ennis is a matter for the health board to decide in the first instance.  The board have the statutory responsibility for the administration of health services within their own area and in my view they are best placed to decide on what the local needs are.</P>
    <P>My Department have maintained close contact with the Mid-Western Health Board in relation to the measures they were proposing to contain expenditure within approved limits and indeed I met with the chairman and chief executive officer of the board as recently as 9 March last.  In considering the organisation of hospital services in the area the Mid-Western Board took account of the fact <Col N="1165" /> that hospital beds were situated in several different centres within a relatively compact area and clearly this was not a sound basis on which to develop an efficient hospital service.  In the case of the maternity unit at Cahercalla, Ennis, the board decided that the annual number of births was not sufficient to justify a consultant staffed facility at this centre. Accordingly, it was decided to transfer this maternity service to the Regional Maternity Hospital in Limerick.  At the same time it was only logical that the gynaecology work carried out at Ennis General Hospital should be transferred to Limerick Regional Hospital.  I am aware that some concern was expressed about this decision but I am satisfied that this new arrangement is in the best interests of mothers and their babies.</P>
    <P>The board have given detailed consideration to the provision of hospital services for County Clare and decided that Ennis General Hospital should continue to provide acute medical and surgical services for its present catchment population.  The catchment population of Ennis General Hospital is not the population of the whole of Clare because 27,000 people in Clare are in the catchment area of Limerick Regional Hospital and another 5,000 are in the catchment area of Galway Regional Hospital.  In determining the precise level of services to be provided and the number of beds required it was necessary for the board to consider the population of the area and its characteristics; the number of patients who travelled outside Clare for hospital services and the relationship which exists between Ennis General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  At this point I would like to emphasise that the board's priority in relation to hospital services is the development of a full range of specialised facilities at Limerick Regional Hospital to serve the whole population of the mid-west.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of all the factors involved the board decided that a total of 76 beds covering the specialties of general medicine and general surgery and intensive care-coronary care would be sufficient to provide an adequate level of service.  The board are <Col N="1166" /> currently drawing up a budget in line with the proposed bed complement and the level of service to be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of course that even in spite of the current difficult financial situation certain improvements have been carried out at Ennis General Hospital in recent times.  For example, a scheme of upgrading of the operating theatres and surgical wards was carried out in 1986.  In addition the board carried out an extensive scheme of fire prevention works throughout the hospital.</P>
    <P>I am aware of course that from time to time the hospital has experienced some overcrowding difficulties.  This is common to all hospitals at times. However, these are due mainly to seasonal factors and the situation is being kept under regular review by the board in consultation with officers from my Department.  I would like to deal with one or two points that were raised.  First, this is not a downgrading of the hospital. The hospital will continue to fulfil the role it has always fulfilled in providing an acute medical and surgical service for the people.</P>

Investigations are proceeding in those cases.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1104" /> that on 19 December 1987 customs officers obtained two search warrants and searched the premises of the persons in question.  A quantity of goods of non-State origin was found in each case.  One of the persons involved claimed ownership of all the goods but was unable to produce any documents relating to them.  In the absence of evidence that duty had been paid on the goods they were seized.  On 21 December 1987 the owner produced invoices relating to the purchase of certain goods in the State. He claimed that these invoices related to some of the seized goods.  After completion of inquiries, the Commissioners are prepared to accept this claim, and to release the goods which can be related to the invoices.  The owner has produced no evidence in regard to the remainder of the goods.  The Commissioners are not satisfied that duty has been paid on these goods, and they have been advised that the evidence supports forfeiture of these goods under the Customs Acts.</P>
      <P>The customs officers involved in the seizures are attached to the special patrol unit based in Dublin and the search of premises was carried out as a normal part of their daily work.  No additional costs were involved.</P>
      <P>Goods are not seized if the customs officer is satisfied that the receipts produced are genuine.

      <P>Works of art, like all other taxable goods, are generally liable for VAT at point of entry, irrespective of whether the importer is registered or not.  Non-commercial galleries and museums and other approved institutions may import works of art not intended for sale free of VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since commercial traders may reclaim VAT paid at point of entry and may export VAT-free there is in effect no tax-related inhibition to the development <Col N="1107" /> of a fine arts trading centre in Ireland. Private purchasers are, therefore, the only effective payers of VAT in Ireland. This business would hardly be sufficient to sustain a significant international level of activity.  In so far as sales are concerned, access to the more developed and lucrative markets for works of art in centres abroad, such as London, explains the high value of works of art exported as against imports.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that VAT no more impedes trade in works of arts than it does any other taxable commodity.</P>

      <P>In my Financial Statement of 27 January last, I indicated that real GDP growth in 1988 was projected to lie in the range of ½ to 1 per cent.  I also said that the trend in GNP growth would depend on the level of net factor outflows, the outlook for which was subject to major uncertainties; but that if these flows were to show the same trend as in 1987, there would be positive GNP growth this year. As to the detailed basis for these projections, I would refer the Deputy to the document <i>&ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget 1988&rdquo;</i> which was published by my Department also on 27 January.</P>

      <P>There is an ongoing process whereby staff, while not redundant in the sense of having no work can be more usefully and cost-effectively redeployed to other work of higher priority.  To date, some 420 staff have been redeployed on this basis since March 1987, and the process will continue. Virtually all Departments have had and will continue to have staff redeployed from them in this manner and the main recipients are the office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>For several years past the value of tax reserve certificates issued has been extremely small and does not warrant the continuation of this scheme.  While easier access to certificates and more attractive rates of interest would probably result in greater demand, the principal consideration must be whether these certificates facilitate the collection of taxes. They were introduced originally in 1962 to serve as a temporary investment vehicle for persons wishing to provide in advance for certain tax payments.  I believe that there is no longer a need for such a facility because of the range of opportunities now available for short term investment.  While a high interest rate would probably stimulate demand, this would be self-defeating because of the cost to the Exchequer.  Consequently, I am arranging that the issue of these <Col N="1109" /> certificates will cease with effect from the end of the current income tax year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a statement regarding the cost implications, the numbers involved and the rationale underlying the facility extended to certain Civil Service grades in relation to recognising time spent in acquiring qualifications and/or experience prescribed for appointment to certain recruitment grades along with actual service for the purposes of pension entitlements; the reason only some grades have been selected; the reason such a facility, if it is acceptable for some public servants, is not available for all; whether this is not defensible in the present economic climate; and the criteria which were used in reaching this decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1984 the Civil Service Arbitration Board recommended that up to ten added years for superannuation purposes should be awarded in cases where the minimum entry requirements specified for appointment to certain posts in the Civil Service precluded appointment by age 25 and hence prevented an officer from acquiring full pensionable service &mdash; which is 40 years &mdash; by age 65 &mdash; the maximum retirement age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arbitration Board found that there was, and I quote, &ldquo;a legitimate <Col N="1111" /> grievance on the part of the claimants who, due to the recruitment restrictions pertaining under the particular competition off which they entered the Civil Service were unable to accrue full pension by age 65&rdquo;.  This recommendation was accepted in September 1984 by the then Minister for the Public Service and is now being implemented.</P>
    <P>Because of the various conditions attached to the granting of these added years, individual awards cannot formally be made until an officer's retirement.  It is not possible, therefore, to supply firm details of the numbers affected or of the cost of implementing the finding.  It has been estimated, however, that the annual cost would be of the order of £300,000.</P>
    <P>The scope of the claim was explicitly limited to professional, technical and specialist grades and did not encompass any other classes of civil servants who are, generally, recruited at an age which enables them to have earned full pension by the time they reach retirement age.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the grant of free added years are not confined to the Civil Service.  Similar arrangements have existed for some considerable time in the local authority and health board areas but were restricted to professional officers only; in 1987, however, the terms of the Arbitration Board's finding were extended to technical and specialist grades in these areas.  The introduction of corresponding arrangements for State-sponsored body staff has also been agreed in principle with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the reports in the media to the effect that a number of the paintings in the National Gallery have deteriorated due to deficiencies in the air-conditioning system.

The Commissioners have drawn up a programme to completely refurbish the gallery on a phased basis including the provision of a modern air-conditioning system which will enable the temperature and humidity levels to be maintained within the acceptable range.  The proposed scheme would also include redecorating of the gallery.</P>
      <P>Planning for Phase I incorporating the most urgently required work is at an advanced stage and subject to a decision on funding for the project in 1989-91 a contract for this work could be placed towards the end of this year.

This sum is in addition to the annual scheduled payment of £2.05 million.

      <P>Irish companies currently holding Class C authorisations issued by <Col N="1124" /> my Department to carry out non-scheduled helicopter operations are: Irish Helicopters Ltd., Westpoint Hangar, Dublin Airport; Celtic Helicopters Ltd., Block C, Dublin Airport; Helicopter Hire Ltd., Mountcharles, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The standard conditions attaching to a Class C authorisation are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The non-scheduled service(s), as described in the authorisation, may not be extended or amended, except with my prior approval.</P>
      <P>(2)  The service(s) shall be carried out with the aircraft listed and with no other aircraft.</P>
      <P>(3)  The provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1986, and of all Orders, Regulations and Directions made or issued thereunder shall be complied with in so far as such provisions are applicable.</P>
      <P>(4)  No change shall be made, without my prior approval&mdash;(a) in the personnel of the board of directors or the ownership of the company holding the authorisation; or (b) in the persons who hold shares in the company or in the size of their shareholding.</P>
      <P>(5)  The holder shall enter into a special contract with every passenger to be carried under the authorisation or with a person acting on behalf of such passenger, for the increase to not less than the Irish Pound equivalent of SDR100,000 exclusive of costs, of the limit of his liability as a carrier under the Warsaw Convention of 1929, as amended by the Hague Convention of 1955.</P>
      <P>(6)  No operations may be undertaken between Ireland and external points, served on a scheduled basis by other Irish carriers, without my prior permission.  In this connection, the word &ldquo;points&rdquo; means &ldquo;airports&rdquo; except where two or more airports serve the same town or city when it is to be construed as the town or city in question.</P>
      <P>(7)  The holder shall, on request, furnish to me any information or returns required by me as to the business carried on and flights made in any period specified.</P>
      <P>(8)  The authorisation is non-transferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> (9)  In the event of the holder breaching the terms and conditions of the authorisation, I reserve the right to amend or revoke it without notice.</P>
    <P>In the case of Celtic Helicopters Ltd. and Helicopter Hire Ltd., the following additional conditions have been imposed: (1) Flights must be operated under Visual Flight Rules (VFR); (2) single engined helicopters with a gross weight of less than 5,000 pounds may only be used; (3) the holder is not permitted to perform offshore or lighthouse servicing operations.</P>
    <P>I have indicated recently to Celtic Helicopters Ltd.  that, subject to the company satisfying my Department on certain financial, technical and safety requirements, I would be prepared to remove these additional conditions from their authorisation.</P>
    <P>My general policy in relation to helicopter licensing is to ensure the safe and orderly development of helicopter services to ensure that the needs of this sector of the air transport market are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of beds to be provided at Ennis General Hospital is a matter for decision by the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.  The board have given careful consideration to the question of hospital services for County Clare and have decided that Ennis hospital should continue to provide acute medical and surgical treatment for its present catchment population.  In determining the exact level of services and number of beds required it was necessary for the board to examine the population of the area and its characteristics; the number of patients who travel outside the county for hospital treatment; and the relationship which exists between this hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. Following assessment of all these factors <Col N="1132" /> the board have decided that a total of 76 beds, covering general medicine, general surgery and intensive care-coronary care will be sufficient to provide an acceptable level of service.</P>
      <P>My Department has also given this matter detailed consideration in the light of the review of the acute hospital system carried out last year.  In the circumstances, I endorse the arrangements being made by the Mid-Western Health Board to rationalise hospital services and I am confident that Ennis hospital will continue to provide a satisfactory level of care for its patients.</P>
