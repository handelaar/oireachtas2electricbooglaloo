      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a firm decision has been made by the Board of the National Gallery regarding the appointment of a director since 19 October 1988; if such a decision has been communicated to him; and if so, when he will be in a position to make an announcement on the appointment of a director.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery has appointed Mr. Raymond Keaveney, former Assistant Director in the Gallery to the post of Director.</P>
      <P>Dr. Patrick Wallace has been appointed Director of the National Museum of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the <Col N="1154" /> Taoiseach's reply is he in a position to say if it is the intention to appoint an assistant director to fill the vacancy created by the appointment of Mr. Raymond Keaveney, which is welcome?  In view of the fact that there was a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme and an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> dealing with the serious condition regarding the roof of the gallery and the state of repair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to state when the new director will be able to supervise these very urgent works in view of the fact that many paintings were seriously damaged as documented on television and in newspapers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are being made to provide some assistance for the new director.  A substantial sum of money has been provided for the necessary improvements in the gallery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has completed his considerations of the proposal to (a) transfer the National Museum, Dublin 2 to the Custom House, Dublin 1, (b) transfer the Department of the Environment and other users of the Custom House to modern office accommmodation, and (c) provide for the Oireachtas to acquire the vacated museum space in order to ensure a suitable building to house fully and comprehensively the National Museum on the one hand and enable all of the Oireachtas political parties and associated staff to be properly accommodated within the perimeters of Leinster House; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1155" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal does not seem practical or cost-effective. Considerable costs would be involved in rehousing the staff currently accommodated or to be accommodated in the Custom House and the relocation of the entire National Museum to the Custom House would also be very costly.  The purpose of such costly relocations at Exchequer expense is not clear since the Custom House is, in its present use, being maintained in its architectural splendour basically for the purposes for which it was designed.  In addition, the National Museum building in Kildare Street was specifically designed and built as a Museum and is an outstanding example of such architecture and should, in my view, be retained as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply to the earlier question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the reply was self evident I did not think a supplementary was necessary.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the spirit in which the question was posed related to a fairly broad timetable, I am not talking in terms of the next year or so?  Having regard to that, would he and his people not recognise the following three points: first, that whatever about the external architectural splendour of the Custom House it now fails to meet minimum legal standards of office accommodation internally, that upgrading the building to such standards would be expensive and would destroy entirely, the architectural splendour to which he refers; secondly, would he not agree that the museum is badly housed at present, whatever about the original intention for the building, and third, would he not agree, following what the Ceann Comhairle had to say this time last week or a little earlier, that there is a need to consolidate the accommodation of this institution within the perimeter of Leinster House?  Perhaps, in time the resolution of those three problems would <Col N="1156" /> result in the formula I have suggested.  I recognise the cash constraints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best I can do is put those points to my advisers and ask them to consider them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Taoiseach is suggesting that I put these points in some detail to him?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included in the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The desirability of what I am suggesting is mentioned in the question. I am simply asking if the Taoiseach would be prepared to give his views on such possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans for such a discussion.  Regular contact, at Government and diplomatic level, on issues of concern to us, is of course maintained with US administrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have in mind a formal meeting but rather that the Taoiseach might make contact with the retiring President by telephone.  I am sure the Taoiseach could get through to the President even if there is not a hot line from here to him.  I want to raise with the Taoiseach the fact that there is an historic opportunity for the retiring President who is of Irish stock, to do something to acknowledge that Irish background.  I have in mind that the Taoiseach would raise with that retiring President the situation of the illegal Irish in the United States and to make an executive order to legalise their status as he did for the Nicaraguans and for the Poles.  Would the Taoiseach accept that as being a timely suggestion, now that President Reagan is <Col N="1159" /> about to retire and approach him on that basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has already happened. The first day I met President Reagan I raised with him the question of the young Irish in the United States.  The recent substantial conditional number of visas which have been allocated were authorised by the President as one of his last acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may have missed the point and may be reading far too much into the Rudino legislation. I am talking about the position of the illegals who cannot qualify for additional Donnelly visas or otherwise, presently estimated at about 100,000.</P>

      <P>I tried to raise this matter last week but the Taoiseach transferred this particular question.  What I am saying to him is that he now has an opportunity to raise the position of approximately 100,000 illegal Irish immigrants with a retiring President of Irish stock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to overelaborate. All I want to do is clarify what exactly I want the Taoiseach to raise with the President.  I am asking the Taoiseach to ask the President to do for the 100,000 or so illegal Irish immigrants as he did for 200,000 Nicaraguans and a similar <Col N="1160" /> number of Poles and to make an executive order before he leaves office to legalise their status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, at the recent Heads of Government meeting at Rhodes, any discussion took place on the harmonisation of taxes after 1992; and if he outlined the measures to be taken by the Government to make this a reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement I made in this House on 7 December on the outcome of the Rhodes Council and to the Presidency's conclusions which have been laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach appreciates that there is some confusion as to precisely what Ireland's attitude is towards the harmonisation of taxes by 1992.  It will be very helpful for those who may be affected by any decision the Government may make if they were to know as early as possible whether the Government, as I believe they should, will pursue the harmonisation of taxes as vigorously as possible or are we going to seek a derogation?  Would the Taoiseach agree that those questions should be answered for the general public as quickly as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin City Council sought in 1986 the designation of Dublin as a European City of Culture in the context of a resolution in 1985 of the European Community Ministers responsible for Cultural Affairs to have an annual celebration of a Community city as a European City of Culture.  This was the only application received from Ireland at the time.  The Government supported it in competition with other European cities and succeeded in having Dublin so designated for 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true to say that the Government did not have to seek applications and that the country chosen could designate the city?  In that context, would it not have been appropriate for the Government to choose some city other than Dublin?  Obviously I have a preference for one particular city but there are a number of other locations outside of Dublin which could have been nominated and which would have been welcomed.</P>

With regard to the Single European Act we agreed that there is a need to make progress on the full implementation of <Col N="1164" /> the Single European Act and my Spanish colleagues indicated that the internal market and the social dimension of the internal market would be priorities for the Spanish Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if talks will be initiated with the Prime Ministers of Britain, Denmark and Iceland to decide the ownership of Rockall; the fishery and exploration rights surrounding that rock and other areas in dispute on the Continental Shelf and elsewhere in the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raises a number of issues in his question.  In so <Col N="1165" /> far as the question related to Britain, he will be aware that an agreement on delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain was signed in Dublin on 7 November 1988.  The text of that agreement was debated and approved by the Dáil on 29 November 1988.  It will enter into force when the necessary procedures, such as de-designation of a small area by Ireland, and the enactment of British legislation to give effect to the agreement, have taken place and notifications to that effect exchanged with the British.</P>
      <P>The agreement settles between ourselves and Britain exploration and exploitation rights on part of the Continental Shelf known as the Rockall Plateau.  As I informed the House, during the course of the debate on the agreement, ownership of Rockall and the fishery and exploration rights surrounding the rock were not dealt with in that agreement.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are also aware, Denmark and Iceland have made very extensive claims to areas of the Rockall Plateau. These claims, which have been rejected by the Government, as well as the other issues identified in the question, remain to be resolved.</P>
      <P>When the agreement delimiting the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain, which is a bilateral agreement affecting only the parties to it, has entered into force, any outstanding issues including the matters raised in the question will come up for consideration by the Government.  In the interim I do not propose to take any initiative in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister specifically if he would initiate talks with the other three countries making claims but he does not seem to have answered that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not appreciate that it would be utter madness to enter into any such talks with either Denmark or Iceland, that we have had extensive talks over a long period of years which my predecessor, Deputy Barry, helped further and that as a result of these <Col N="1166" /> talks we have reached an agreement with Britain, which has been debated in this House, delimiting what we see as our respective shares of the Continental Shelf.  This agreement has been reached in respect of areas in dispute to some extent with Denmark and also with Iceland. With all due respect, the Deputy's suggestion makes nonsense in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  May I ask the Minister why he referred in his initial reply to the fact that there are claims by Iceland and Denmark to some of the grounds concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not appreciate that we have reached our maximum position and that if we enter into talks with Denmark and Iceland it can only be at our expense.  We are protected largely by reason of the fact that the British part of the Continental Shelf is between us and the Danish and Icelandic claims to a very great extent.  We do not want the Danes or the Icelanders coming into the Rockall plateau area which we have divided with Britain.  That is in our national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10, 33 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined to the Dáil the steps taken by the Government to develop emigrant advisory services in the United States.  These include the establishment of immigration working committees in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Chicago; the appointment of an immigrants liaison officer in New York; the publication of &ldquo;Guides for New Emigrants&rdquo; in the main cities; and improved liaison with city and Church authorities.  In addition our five offices in the United States &mdash; the embassy and the four consulates &mdash; work closely with emigrant organisations and provide assistance and advice directly to our citizens. I believe that as a result of these efforts we now have a network of services for our people in the United States that is responsive to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as voluntary organisations are concerned, the Government is appreciative of the activities of the Irish Immigration Reform Movement and other <Col N="1170" /> groups working on behalf of our young people.  The IIRM is represented on the immigration working committees which operate under the auspices of our consulates and which both the Taoiseach and myself met on our visits to the United States.  We have indicated that any request for official funding including one for the setting up of an Irish immigration advice centre supported by the Immigration Working Committee and backed by detailed proposals and costings will be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that the request from the Irish Immigration Reform Movement for £100,000 to enable them to establish an emigrant advice centre will be favourably considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly look at the request but we have made very substantial efforts already to ensure that much of their concerns have been met. They are represented on the various committees which work with the embassies and consulates in the cities in the United States.  I might say that all of this effort stems from our work as a Government during the past 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Without getting into an argument or damaging the positive response which I seem to be getting from the Minister, would he bear in mind two things: first, every major ethnic group in the United States has an emigrant advice centre and it seems very much out of order that we do not have one, particularly in the light of the increasing number of Irish emigrants there during the past number of years and, secondly, that the city of New York has allocated $30,000 for the support of such a centre and that the very least we can do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are doing tremendous work in supplementing the work already done there.  If we take New York city as an example, the Church has a tremendous network there and the personnel in that area have been supplemented by further personnel from the hierarchy in Maynooth.  Our embassy is the hub of the system and a special officer and staff in the embassy co-ordinate all of this work.  Setting up in a centre or a building in a city like New York is not really the answer to this problem.  As the Deputy knows, it is a question of co-ordinating the work of the various parishes, trade unions and voluntary organisations throughout the city.  As the Deputy is well aware, New York is really an amalgam of four or five cities and it is a question of co-ordinating what is there setting up a structure, supplying personnel and help through that committee rather than setting up a building in New York city.</P>

I and other Members of this House have correspondence dated 17 November 1988 indicating that this is what the group are looking for.

We have established this network for the first time co-ordinating the various groups.  They are represented on all the committees and are making a contribution, along with the trade unions, the churches and other voluntary groups. They are not fully representative of all the Irish-Americans involved, nor are they full representative of all the strands in the Irish-American community.

      <P>The reason I established a co-ordinating committee is precisely the reverse of what Deputy Higgins is saying. There are other Irish-American organisations. I mentioned the churches and the trade unions already.  There is also the AOH.  The Immigration Reform Movement is representative of just a segment of recent immigrants.  I have sat around tables with these people thrashing out these questions for hours on end.  I know that if these committees get a chance they will perform some good.  I do not claim they will perform everything. They are representative as far as possible of all the various elements in the complex of Irish-American society.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 11 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement makes clear that the subject matter for the review is the &ldquo;working of the conference&rdquo;.  As I indicated in my detailed statement in Dáil Éireann on 16 November, the working of the Conference is dealt with in Articles 2-10 <Col N="1176" /> inclusive of the Agreement.  The operation of these articles, individually and collectively, is therefore included in the scope of the review.</P>
    <P>The approach by the two Governments to the conduct of the review is set out in the communiqué issued after the meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference on 2 November.  Work is now proceeding in accordance with the approach outlined in the communiqué.</P>
    <P>As regards the involvement of Unionists, the communiqué of 2 November stated that &ldquo;each government would take careful account of views expressed to it, both on the past experience of the conference and on any changes which might be desirable in its scope and nature&rdquo;.  It is of course open to Unionist leaders, and the Unionist community, to avail of this invitation to submit views, which has been reiterated on several occasions in recent months.</P>
    <P>There has already been an opportunity to hear in considerable detail the views of party leaders and other members of Dáil Éireann during the full day discussion on the review on 16 November. The subject is, of course, also dealt with during Question Time, as on 9 November and again today.  However, the Taoiseach would be prepared and delighted to have discussions with party leaders on the matter in the New Year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the extradition affair between Britain and Ireland will not damage the important work of the review.  Will the Minister clarify whether the work of the review is only taking place at official level, whether any joint initiative was agreed between the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, at their recent bilateral meeting in Rhodes and whether the issue of the operation of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act by the British side will be raised at the Anglo-Irish Conference meeting tomorrow in view of the Attorney General's findings in the Ryan affair?</P>

      <P>I will answer the last <Col N="1177" /> point first.  At recent meetings of the Conference we have brought the utilisation of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act to the top of the agenda.  I would again propose tomorrow to raise it and to point out the efficacy of it in dealing with many of these cases which otherwise have caused contention and sensationalism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and have affected relations between these islands by reason of that sensationalism.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act should be operated to a far greater degree that heretofore.  It represents a way in which many of these cases can be dealt with.  I am not privy to what takes place between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher at their private meetings. Regarding the first point made by Deputy Kennedy, I am certain that the review process will continue and that the Conference will continue its effective operations, despite certain views that are held in regard to extradition and the proper utilisation of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his reply quoted the statement of last month and said he hoped the Unionists would avail of it to submit their views.  Is anything being done informally to ascertain their views?  Is there any contact by his Department, through the Secretariat, with certain Unionists to try to bring them into the process?  The Minister will know that I am not in favour of this long review of the Agreement.  Can he assure us that it will be finished by the end of January and will come before this House very early in February?  The length of time being taken to carry out this review is damaging.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in regard to the Agreement.  We will let past views go by in this respect.  The Agreement and the Conference represent the one anchor of hope through which we can talk to the British Government and deal with Northern Ireland affairs, doing so in a quiet committee style manner rather than engaging in any megaphone diplomacy.  That has been the main achievement of the Conference and it has enabled us to discuss matters in a reasonably calm atmosphere.</P>

It would be ungracious of me, and I will not indulge in it, not to welcome the change of attitude by the Minister towards the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act and the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

So far as the Official Unionist Party position is concerned there has been, until now, no response.  An offer has been made to them by the British Government and on several occasions by the Taoiseach to take part in discussions and we await their response.  The Unionists know they are welcome to participate during the review process in any discussions concerning improvements in the Anglo-Irish Agreement or Conference or outside that context altogether.  They are free to come in on any parallel talks where it might be appropriate and constructive to have such talks, without prejudice in any way to the operations of the Conference.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I have raised this issue on several occasions at recent meetings.  It was embodied in the communique of the last few meetings. Both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have had discussions on the matter and the Attorney General here has had discussions and talks in that regard with his counterpart in Britain.  As we are all aware, the Attorney General has referred specifically to it in the context of the Patrick Ryan case as a possible avenue of meeting the problem, in that it is quite clear that some of the offences with which Patrick Ryan is charged could be appropriately dealt with under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act if we got the required co-operation through evidence from British sources.  The Attorney General has said that in the second last and last paragraphs of the report which has been presented to the House.</P>

Those preliminary talks are under way as a result of instructions from both the last Conference and the previous one.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12, 29, 38 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office the Government have sought to alleviate the position of out of status Irish immigrants in the United States by promoting changes in US legislation which will address their problem.  I have outlined to the Dáil on several occasions the activities of the Taoiseach, myself, and our diplomatic representatives in the United States in this regard.  A major result of these efforts has been the passage by the US Congress of the Immigration Amendments Act which was recently signed into law by President Reagan.  As the Taoiseach has already said, thanks are due to President Reagan for expeditiously doing so.  The Act will provide significant new opportunities &mdash; probably as high as 25,000 extra visas &mdash; for Irish citizens in the next three years.  The Government are also committed to exploring further with our friends in Congress the question of long-term changes in US immigration legislation when Congress returns in the new year.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion for an Executive order or decree to grant an amnesty or to legalise the out of status Irish I am advised that the US President does not have the statutory power to make such an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, in relation to the two aspects of the recent legislation, only those who originally applied for the Donnelly visas will be considered and that the Berman visas will apply to 161 countries?  Therefore the vast majority of illegal Irish in the US will not be considered for visas under either heading.  Secondly, would the Minister accept that the President of <Col N="1182" /> the United States has authority to make what is known as an EVD order, as he did in relation to 200,000 Nicaraguans in 1987 and as he had previously done for a similar number of Poles?  Would the Minister not accept that now is the time for the Irish Government to press this retiring Irish-American President to make a similar order to relieve the position of illegal Irish immigrants in the United States?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, our thanks are due to President Reagan for signing the legislation, legislation which, as the Deputy says, does not solve the problem totally but which was very necessary as an interim measure.  It was the last Act passed by the last Congress.  A number of emigrants who are now out of status in the United States applied originally from their addresses in Ireland and are included in that bank of 20,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>More than a few.  Furthermore, my Department took up this idea a few months ago through our Washington embassy.  We took legal advice and consulted the United States Administration, including the National Security Council, on the powers of the President in the area the Deputy referred to.  We have been advised by the United States authorities that the position of aliens in the United States is governed by statute. Unless the US Congress determines otherwise the President does not have the power to grant an amnesty or to legalise illegal immigrants.  I will read on further and tell the House where he does have discretionary power because there may be some confusion here.  If necessary I will give all this information in a letter to the relevant Deputies.  The Administration does have discretionary powers to grant relief from deportation to national groups under an arrangement called extended voluntary departure &mdash; EVD &mdash; which matter has been raised in recent months by the IIRM who I presume have informed the Deputy.  Perhaps that is what the Deputy has in mind. <Col N="1183" /> I should say that to date that blanket relief from deportation only of people who, for political or humanitarian reasons, cannot return to their countries, it has been interpreted on that basis only. That is the advice of the US State Department and US Attorney General to our ambassador in Washington.  We followed up this matter.  There are other aspects that hightlight what I am saying.  Basically it is in that narrow context only that the President has a particular power which really relates to deportation and does not cover the case of Irish immigrants at all. That is entirely a matter for US domestic legislation, through Congress.  I might add that, on Senator Kennedy's recent visit, he assured me that he was already working and lobbying within the Senate to have this Bill reintroduced, if necessary improved, and that he and Senator Simpson would start down that road again as a matter of priority when the Congress resumed.  We shall then have more time to get comprehensive legislation in place, whereas the legislation of some months ago was of an interim type. I think we did very well to get it.  At least it has overcome a very real interim problem.  I hope I have given the Deputies a comprehensive reply.  We are really beginning to have a debate rather than questions on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in that sense it was a failure despite the promises given in this country and the hype about it in the media.  I am sure the Minister would agree that a number of people were misled by the high expectations with regard to the provisions of that Bill.  Is the Minister aware that the co-ordinating committees of which he speaks have met more infrequently since the failure of that <Col N="1184" /> Bill?  Furthermore, is he aware that that co-ordinating committee structure in America is breaking up at present because of lack of support, they feel, on the part of our Government and also as a result of lack of resources?  I might add that that is first-hand information I have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let us endeavour to be positive about this.  We must remember that we are dealing with the United States authorities who, in turn, are dealing with matters within their jurisdiction.  I find that we are listened to very benignly in regard to any matters we raise, indeed much more so than other States, and are given more room to manoeuvre in this and other areas.  Here I might pay tribute to Congress, many leaders in Congress and to the President himself in that respect.</P>
      <P>The first thing that struck me when I visited the United States early in September last was more or less what Deputy Deenihan has said, that there was no prospect of getting the comprehensive legislation through; that was the reality of the matter which has been proved by subsequent events.  It was my impression then that all we could do was to go hard for what we got &mdash; the 25,000 visas in this interim period.  I was so guided by very shrewd people on Congess, people like Congressman Donnelly &mdash; to whom this country should be in eternal debt &mdash; and others like him who advised me that that other legislation, desirable and all as it was, would have to be put in abeyance but that we would have to have something in its place in the meantime.  That was the reasoning behind what has happened subsequently.  I know it is not adequate but it goes a fair bit of the way to meeting an immediate problem.  Let us hope that the comprehensive legislation &mdash; which can now be examined without the pressure of an early election &mdash; will be produced early in the New Year and passed before the end of next year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to have one last go to ascertain whether an executive order could <Col N="1185" /> be made within the last month of the outgoing President's term of office?  It should be remembered that the power is there for him to do so under the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act.  The procedures are there, as outlined by the Minister in his comprehensive earlier reply, for what is known as extended voluntary departure which, coupled with work permits, would take one halfway there &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised from the United States that this is an avenue well worth exploring.  I would beg of the Minister not to miss this opportunity with President Reagan about to leave office within the next month but rather to explore that avenue fully to ascertain whether it is possible to get him to exercise the powers he has to make an executive order which would solve a problem for so many young Irish immigrants there?</P>

      <P>The decisive step towards a settlement of the Cambodian problem is the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia under effective international supervision and control as well as guarantees that Vietnamese forces will not re-enter Cambodia after their withdrawal.</P>
      <P>In the event of a withdrawal effective steps should also be taken to prevent any armed group from seizing power by force or resorting to the threat of force to intimidate the Cambodian people and, thereby, deprive them of their right to choose their own destiny.  Cambodia must be free both of Vietnamese troops and any propsect of a return to the appalling activities of the Khmer Rouge. Nothing sort of internationally supervised general and free elections can satisfy the genuine aspirations of the Cambodian people for self-determination and independence.</P>
      <P>Contacts are at present taking place between the different parties to the conflict and between their supporters as well in order to work out the basis for a definitive settlement.  The Twelve of the Community have declared their support for this process.  However, it has not as yet arrived at a point where agreement on all the points of a settlement are imminent. When that happens.  Ireland will be ready to join with its partners in the Twelve in arranging for appropriate supervisory machinery for the settlement.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that a pre-condition to any solution in Kampuchea and Cambodia is the withdrawal <Col N="1187" /> of Vietnamese troops?  I should have thought that that could be arranged if the Vietnamese were satisfied that the Government would take over once they left, or that at least they could be influenced to adopt that attitude?  Would the Minister agree that one of the wishes of most democracies in the world would be that the Khmer Rouge should not have any part in the future government of Kampuchea?  Is that not also dependent on the attitude of the Chinese Government providing a refuge for the leader of that organisation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry has correctly analysed the position.  If you like, it is a game of balance between the departing Vietnamese troops and the creation of a new Government, after properly supervised elections, which will not have within it what I would regard as a very serious component, that is the presence of the Khmer Rouge or any element of that kind.  Memories may be short but not so short as to forget about Pol Pot and what happened there.  If a proper régime or government administration can be put in place &mdash; following supervised elections &mdash; it would be the hope that that Government could function adequately without the Vietnamese troops or a Khmer Rouge involvement, which would be the ideal of all right-thinking people and which is what the Community of Twelve are agreed should happen.  Indeed the Community of Twelve are bending their energies to arrange that matters would evolve precisely in that direction.</P>

      <P>It is proceeding at the moment.  There is the difficulty that the Vietnamese are not keeping up the pace of withdrawal because of what Deputy Barry referred to, the danger that on their vacating power the Khmer Rouge will be in an unduly strong position.  A lot of hopes are pinned on what Sihanouk can organise with other parties in Vietnam. The international community, be it the 12 or the United Nations, are willing to help in any way they can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 46 and Oral Questions Nos. 27 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's view of the denial of a visa to Yasser Arafat to enter the United States for the purpose of addressing the United Nations General Assembly on the question of Palestine was made clear to the United States in a number of ways.  On 30 November, Ireland voted in favour of a resolution in the UN General Assembly which characterised the decision as constituting a violation of the international <Col N="1190" /> legal obligations of the host country under the Headquarters Agreement establishing the UN in New York.  The resolution deplored the host country's failure to grant the requested visa and urged it to reconsider and reverse its decision.</P>
    <P>A declaration issued by the Presidency on behalf of the Twelve member states of the European Community on the same day stated their belief that in accordance with the Headquarters Agreement and the opinion of the legal counsel of the United Nations.  Mr. Arafat should be allowed to address the UN General Assembly in New York.  It called on the US Government to review the legal arguments and reconsider its decision.  On 2 December, the host country having informed the UN Secretary General that it saw no basis for changing its decision, Ireland voted in favour of a second UN General Assembly resolution which decided &ldquo;in the present compelling circumstances and without prejudice to normal practice&rdquo; to consider the agenda item, question of Palestine, at the United Nations Office in Geneva during the period 13-15 December 1988.  We did so because we wished to express support for the opinion of the legal counsel of the United Nations that the visa request fell, <i>inter alia,</i> under Section II of the Headquarters Agreement which provides that invitees of the United Nations shall not be impeded in their access to the headquarters district and that the request should, therefore, have been granted.  In the circumstances that developed we believed that to withhold support for the transfer of debate to Geneva would be to fail to support the UN in its role as a forum before which all parties to the Middle East conflict could set out their positions on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian National Council's acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for an international conference, and its explicit condemnation of terrorism, represent an important evolution in the position of the Council.  Acceptance of Resolutions 242 and 338 implies acceptance of the right of all states of the region, including Israel, <Col N="1191" /> to exist within secure, recognised and guaranteed borders.  Since the Venice Declaration of June 1980 this principle and the principle of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination with all that this implies have been regarded by Ireland and by the Twelve as being on an equal footing.  Each of these is fundamental to a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.</P>
    <P>The criteria in international law applicable to recognition of states are that the state possess a defined territory, a permanent population, a sovereign government exercising effective control and a capacity to enter into international relations.  It will be clear that while Israel continues to function as an occupying power the Palestinian state proclaimed on 15 November will lack some or all of the above attributes.  The conditions for the granting of formal, legal recognition are not, therefore, present.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Ireland does consider that, in the context of a comprehensive settlement, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination includes their right to an independent state, if they so wish.  It is, thus, our hope that the independent Palestinian state proclaimed on 15 November will become a reality in territories decided upon by negotiation in an international peace conference under UN auspices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply with which I agree 90 per cent. The Government have adopted the right attitude.  Does the Minister consider that the conditions are now present to allow a conference to be held in the Middle East in view of what Yasser Arafat said in the last two days about the recognition of Israel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into the disputation in that whole area, but certainly the international conference can only be held on the basis of recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination, to a State within boundaries to be negotiated, and the <Col N="1192" /> right of Israel to its continued sovereignty. That must be the bedrock of any international conference.  That is the attitude not just of Ireland but of the 12 who are all together in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the practical measures which have been agreed at the recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference to achieve the objective laid out in paragraph 8 (b) of the Joint Communiqué after the summit of 15 November, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Conference meeting of 25 March agreed on the urgent need to give new impetus to its work on a programme of special measures to improve relations between the security forces and the community in Northern Ireland and to build confidence in the administration of justice.  The conference directed officials of the two Governments to draw up a new programme of work on these issues.</P>
      <P>The ongoing work of this group of officials has been reviewed by subsequent conferences, and at the last conference meeting on 2 November.  At that meeting, the British side described a number of recent measures adopted in this area while we submitted our views on the need for further work in this area.</P>
      <P>Since then the group of officials have continued their work and the matter will be reviewed again at a meeting of the conference which will take place tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that a number of measures were put in train to commence last March, that they were reviewed in November and will be reviewed again tomorrow.  Is it not possible to introduce these piecemeal rather <Col N="1193" /> than waiting for a total package to be run?  The efforts to build confidence in the security forces among both communities, particularly the Nationalist community, are of primary importance in bringing about equilibrium in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects along those lines which will be attended to tomorrow.  One is the need to eliminate harassment at various checkpoints and the need for the presence of RUC personnel at these checkpoints.  At present there are check points which are not fully supervised in the sense that there are not any police personnel present.  A similar aspect applies to the whole area of the accompaniment of army and quasi-army patrols by RUC personnel.  We should make a particular start on the matter of the checkpoint supervision because, from the correspondence coming into our Department, there is a growing number of complaints in regard to harassment at those points.  That is something that can be ascertained; it is something specific that can be dealt with. It is not like a patrol that can happen in the middle of the night.  There are ascertainable checkpoints with rotas set out and there should be, in our view, high RUC personnel presence at these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  It is something that is extremely important and which was referred to a number of times in the Agreement and in the communiqué so the Minister is rightly pursuing that. However, that is the negative side.  There is also a positive programme of work that should be set out.  Relations between the security forces and the Nationalist population in particular, but between both populations, can be built up and fostered so that that degree of trust and confidence can be instilled into the Nationalist community with regard to the security forces. That is just as important as getting a high level of accompaniment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 35 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to establish an advisory committee on the specific problems of human rights foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government attach considerable importance to the question of human rights in the formulation of foreign policy and play an active role on the Third Committee of the UN which deals with human <Col N="1195" /> rights matters.  Ireland has also been active in this regard during our six year membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights, to which we were first elected in 1983.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggested allocation to a senior official to responsibility for co-ordination of policy in this area, I consider that the current arrangements within the Department, which provide for the co-ordination of all political matters, including human rights aspects, are satisfactory.  These arrangements ensure that due account is taken of human rights considerations in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy across the board.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that the present arrangements for the training of officers for the diplomatic service adequately reflect the priority attached &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; by successive Irish Governments to human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions dealt more with the internal arrangements of the Department of Foreign Affairs, particularly the human rights dimension to these.  Is the Minister aware, if one takes the European Community countries as a simple example, that in the Netherlands a senior Foreign Affairs official has been allocated the task of co-ordinating human rights aspects of foreign policy, that a year ago the French Foreign Ministry allocated a similar post and that in October of 1983 the Spanish Foreign Ministry allocated such a post? Might I ask the Minister, if this is the road our partners are taking, why can we not, without being simply imitative, on this 40th anniversary, allocate overall responsibility to some senior official?  So as to complete matters in relation to Questions Nos. 23 and 35, can the Minister tell the House if the training of diplomats for posting abroad includes human rights preparation and if their reports from areas to which they are posted include a description of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Ireland has a very particular part to play in this area.  It has a niche of its own.  That is why we have been represented on the specialised United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  The mere appointment of specific officers to particular Departments is not the answer, unless the political will for human rights permeates all aspects of the Department's foreign policy.  In Ireland that does happen.  It affects all our decisions taken at the United Nations and elsewhere.  We do not lag behind anyone in our advocacy and implementation of human rights proposals.</P>

The Attorney General would prefer not to have to depart from that practice.  However, the situation which has arisen &mdash; or, more accurately, has been created &mdash; in the present case is quite unique, and the Attorney General has reluctantly come to the conclusion that it would be less undesirable to depart from practice than to allow speculation to replace fact about a matter of very considerable public importance.  He is, therefore, issuing this statement summarising the circumstances relevant to his decision so that there should be no doubt in the minds of anyone, in this country or elsewhere, as to the facts of this case.</P>
    <P>At 10.50 on the night of Friday, 25 November 1988 Patrick Ryan arrived in this jurisdiction aboard a Belgian military aircraft having been released from custoday in Belgium after an extradition request from the British authorities had been refused by the Belgian authorities. In the early hours of Saturday, 26 November four warrants, issued in London in respect of Patrick Ryan, were received by the Garda Commissioner from the Metropolitan Police.  In the four hours between Patrick Ryan's arrival and the receipt of these warrants the District Court was not asked to issue a provisional arrest warrant (and it is during that period, and no other, that the law would have allowed a provisional warrant to be issued) for legal considerations, which are not relevant to this decision.  Replacement documentation, correcting certain defects, was received from the British authorities on Sunday, 27 November.</P>
    <P>Consideration of this case involved questions of law and questions of fact. The questions of law included matters of English law, Belgian law, and complex legal issues concerning the law of conspiracy, the extra-territoriality of <Col N="1201" /> offences in English law and in Irish law, corresponding offences, and other matters. The questions of fact included the confidential material which had been supplied to the Attorney General by the British Attorney General on Friday evening, 25 November.</P>
    <P>The necessary consideration and examination of these issues by the Attorney General, with his legal advisers, commenced without delay and continued as expeditiously as was consistent with the care required in such matters.  On Thursday evening, 1 December, further information and clarification was sought from the British Attorney General concerning the material which he had furnished.  This was supplied late the following evening, Friday, 2 December.</P>
    <P>Between the Monday and the Thursday, certain material published in Britain, in newspapers and on radio and television, came to the attention of the Attorney General.  He also became aware of the nature of references to the case made in the British Parliament. These matters are more specifically referred to later in this statement.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, requires the Attorney General to direct that a warrant for the extradition of a person from the State shall not be endorsed unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, he is of opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute that person, founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>Even before the passing of the 1987 Act it was part of Irish law that any application for extradition should be founded on an intention to prosecute based on a sufficiency of then-existing evidence, and that otherwise extradition proceedings would be an abuse of the process of the court.  Before the passing of the Act, therefore, it would have been improper for the Attorney General to initiate or permit the initiation of proceedings for extradition if he became aware that the then intention of the requesting country was not to prosecute but was, for example, to obtain the person for questioning.  The existence of <Col N="1202" /> such a state of affairs would not normally have been apparent to the Attorney General, and the 1987 Act now requires that he obtain sufficient information to satisfy himself regarding these matters and, if not so satisfied, to direct that the warrant shall not be endorsed by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Independent of the provisions of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, the Attorney General must ensure that a proposed extradition application to the courts complies with all other requirements of the law and Constitution of the State.  These include, for example, such matters as that the offences charged are offences known to the law, and correspond with offences under Irish law, and that the supporting legal documentation is correct and in order.  He must also be satisfied that the proceedings do not otherwise infringe the requirements of law or the Constitution or involve an abuse of the legal process.  The Attorney General is designated by the Constitution as the chief law officer of the State and is the guardian of the public interest.  It is he who bears ultimate responsibility for the initiation and conduct of extradition proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the present case the extradition documents concerned four offences, specified in four separate warrants.  In respect of the charges in two of the warrants the Attorney General, having considered such information as he deemed appropriate, has formed the opinion that there is, on the part of the relevant prosecution authority, a clear intention to prosecute and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  In the light of what follows he has not found it necessary to reach any final conclusion in regard to the charges in the other two warrants.</P>
    <P>Before referring to the matters which have been published in Britain concerning the case, it is necessary to record that this is not the first occasion when material has been published in Britain concerning a pending extradition case, although in no previous instance have the prejudicial statements attained the pitch and extent of those in the present case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> Earlier this year the Attorney General had cause for serious concern arising from reports on British television of the events surrounding the execution of certain extradition warrants and the charges to which they related.  British television news reports showed the scenes of the aftermath of a number of explosions which had occurred in Britain previously and linked them to the charges on the warrants.  It was clear that these reports were based, at least in part, on information that had come from official sources. The Attorney General was extremely concerned at these developments, which he considered to be highly improper and potentially damaging to the integrity of the extradition process.  He, therefore, telephoned the British Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, on the same day and raised these specific matters.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General does not propose to go into the details of what was said.  However, he thinks it proper, and necessary, to say that he drew the British Attorney General's attention to the objectionable nature of any prejudicial material being published in connection with a pending application for extradition and prior to trial and to the fact that this was a matter which he is obliged to take into account when exercising his responsibilities arising from a request for extradition.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General viewed the publication of the material in that case with such concern that he requested the Garda Commissioner and others to conduct inquiries as to the source from which the information had come.  As a result of the inquiries he concluded that the information had come from official sources in London.  It should be said that there is no question of the Crown Prosecution Service being the source.  While the Attorney General was satisfied that the television reports in question, although prejudicial, were not such as materially to affect the due process of law, he was deeply disturbed that that process could be put at risk by the publication of such material and, therefore, he brought his <Col N="1204" /> concerns to the attention of the British Attorney General on the day in question.</P>
    <P>In the present case also, matter has been published in Britain which the Attorney General has been obliged to consider.  Before reaching a conclusion with regard to these matters, the Attorney General directed that a full report be prepared for his consideration on the widespread publicity given to this case in Britain.  Such a report was prepared and was submitted to the Attorney General. With the assistance of this report and other information available to him the Attorney General has had the opportunity of examining the depth and breadth of the material published in Britain to an extent probably not possible for most people.</P>
    <P>The material in question consists of references to Patrick Ryan which have appeared in newspapers, particularly newspapers with a large circulation, and on radio and television, over a protracted period.  They consisted, <i>inter alia,</i> of attacks on Patrick Ryan's general character, often expressed in intemperate language and frequently in the form of extravagantly-worded headlines, and also assertions of his guilt of the offences comprised in the warrants&mdash;and, indeed, assertions of his guilt of other offences in respect of which no charges have been brought.</P>
    <P>Many of these statements were expressed in a form which would lead the public to believe that they came, directly or indirectly, from sources who were in possession of facts which conclusively established their truth.  It is also clearly apparent that a wide range of reports contained or were based on information which could only have originated from some official source.</P>
    <P>An equally serious matter is the making of certain statements in the House of Commons.  The tone, tenor and contents of much of that was said carried an assumption or inference of guilt on the part of the person named in the warrants issued by the court in London.  Many members scrupulously avoided saying anything prejudicial.  The prejudicial <Col N="1205" /> statements were perhaps, epitomised by the making of a direct attribution of guilt by one backbench member on the very first day on which the matter was mentioned and subsequently by the hostile reception received by another member from a significant number of backbenchers because he qualified the word &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The House of Commons proceedings were widely and fully reported in the media.  They raised the case to a unique status and can only have intensified the impact and lasting effect on members of the public of what was being published in the written and broadcasting media. Further, the statements in the House of Commons must, because of their origin, carry particular weight with potential jurors.</P>
    <P>That being so, the Attorney General has had to consider whether it is open to him to ignore the effect of these statements on members of a jury which would try Patrick Ryan if he were extradited to Britain.  He has concluded that he cannot ignore it.</P>
    <P>Every citizen has a constitutional right to a fair trial.  The Supreme Court has made it clear that the Extradition Act, 1965, ought not to be operated in such a manner as to violate the constitutional rights of those affected by its operation, and that even where the expressed statutory requirements have been fulfilled the Act may not be administered or applied in a way which would infringe such constitutional rights.  The right to a fair trial includes a right to protection against the creation of prejudice or animosity in the minds of potential jurors such as would effectively deprive a person of the right to a non-biased trial.  The presumption of innocence is not a procedural rule governing the onus of proof at a trial.  It is a fundamental principle of substantive law.</P>
    <P>Any decision to prosecute implies no more than that there is an issue to be tried as to whether the person charged is guilty or not guilty.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Attorney General, the effect of the material which has <Col N="1206" /> been published has, manifestly and inescapably, been to create such prejudice and hostility to Patrick Ryan that, were he to be extradited to Britain, it would not be possible for a jury to approach the issue of his guilt or innocence free from bias.  Having regard to the extreme nature and extent of the prejudicial material published the Attorney General has had to conclude that this prejudice is irredeemable.  No direction to the jury by the trial judge to ignore the prejudicial matter to which they have been exposed could be effective in removing the bias which has been created.</P>
    <P>That being so, the Attorney General is of opinion that it would be improper, and an abuse of the process of the courts, to initiate extradition proceedings in this case.  The initiation of such proceedings, in the face of the objective evidence before the Attorney General in the case would be to operate legislation in a manner which would violate the constitutional and fundamental rights of the person affected by its operation.</P>
    <P>The due process of law is intended to do justice in each individual case.  It would be against the public interest to abandon that principle for the sake of broader policy considerations.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General wishes to emphasise that his decision does not involve the formation by him of any view on the system of justice of the requesting State.  The question of a fair trial arises only because of the unique circumstances of this particular case and the issue concerns only the capacity of any system of trial by jury, however fair the system might be, to provide a fair trial in those circumstances.  The Attorney General expects, and hopes, that the case will remain a unique one and that the particular circumstances that required him to arrive at this decision will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>The process of extradition is, and remains, part of the law of the State.  It has and will continue to be used.  This, however, does not end the matter.  The charges which have been brought against Patrick Ryan are of a most serious kind, and they should be investigated by a <Col N="1207" /> court.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, provides a means whereby certain serious offences committed outside this jurisdiction may be tried here. Such a trial may, under Irish law, take place before a court of three judges without a jury.  Heavy penalties are prescribed by Irish law for those offences.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has requested the British Attorney General to have the evidence available to the British prosecuting authorities in this case examined with a view to the identification of all charges which could be tried in this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, now that the Attorney General has concluded that there was a sufficiency of evidence in relation to two of the warrants before him, he has discharged his obligations under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, and that the remainder of the treatment of this case should be left to the courts?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that in a case of this kind it is open to the person to plead before our courts that pre-trial publicity and comment are of a nature to prejudice his case?  Is the Taoiseach not further aware that section 8 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, extends the provisions of section 44 of the 1965 Act with this precise kind of situation in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that this is a matter for the Attorney General who is entrusted by statute to discharge these functions without approach or interference from any other person.  Therefore, it is not for me to comment on the validity of the decisions of the Attorney General.  It is clear from the statement the Attorney General has made, and which I have read to the House, that he formed a clear opinion that because of the way in which matters developed, he would not be justified in having these warrants endorsed because he could not be certain that the person concerned would secure a fair trial in <Col N="1208" /> Britain if he were extradited to that jurisdiction. I do not know that I can say a great deal more than that.</P>
      <P>It is well established law that the Attorney General is not just an executive of the State but also a quasi-judicial person who has been described in the courts as the forensic defendant of the general public.  In that regard, it would be the duty of the Attorney General to ensure that no member of the general public was subjected to any detrimental treatment and if he formed an opinion either under the 1987 or the 1965 Act that a person's constitutional rights might be interfered with in any way, he has an obligation as Attorney General, according to our courts, to act to ensure that the citizen would not be so deprived of their constitutional rights.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that there are provisions in our law, inserted there as recently as 1987, that are designed to ensure that our courts when hearing cases like this take into account the very factors that the Taoiseach has mentioned?  Is the Taoiseach not surprised that the existence of those provisions has not been referred to in any way by the Attorney General?  Further, is it not extraordinary, to say the least, that the Attorney General in his statement should give notice of his intention to examine the use of the 1976 Act in a case like this, and would the Taoiseach not agree that it would have been far more prudent on the part of the Attorney General, if he believes that course should be followed, to seek the evidence from the British authorities before announcing his intention to examine the use of the 1976 Act?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the legislation that was passed here a year ago, and which was renewed indefinitely in this House last week, there are two grounds set out on which the Attorney General is to satisfy himself, or be satisfied, in regard to the question of extradition?  In respect of two of the warrants, at least, in this case, the Attorney General was so satisfied and he then made the decision not to have the <Col N="1210" /> warrant endorsed on a totally different third ground, which was not included in the legislation and may I ask the Taoiseach why that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, as I have pointed out, the courts have said very specifically on a number of occasions that the Attorney General is not just an arm of the Executive, that he is not a servant of the Executive, but he is the forensic defendant of the people.  That is the phrase used.  Therefore, in that connection he will have a function under the 1965 Act and the courts have also clearly indicated that in no way should anybody be deprived of their constitutional rights under the 1965 Act.  Therefore, as the forensic defendant of the people, and the individual in this case, he would consider it obligatory to ensure that even under the 1965 Act, apart from the 1987 Act, a person would not be dealt with detrimentally.</P>

The Deputy made a very important contribution at one stage. But as the Deputy knows, the Government after mature consideration decided that the Attorney General is a quasi-judicial person; he has been so described by a former chief justice and, therefore, it seemed that he was the person best fitted to discharge this obligation.  I do not think this case disproves that in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be made available to the Deputy.  My colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, will speak later on the Supplementary Estimate for the Vote for the Office of Public Works for which he has direct responsibility.  I will, therefore, confine my own comments to the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Finance and <Col N="1363" /> the Vote for the public service early retirement payments.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for my own Department is required for three purposes &mdash; to make additional moneys available to the western development fund, to enable increased repayment to the Central Fund of advances made by the Exchequer to the Industrial Credit Corporation and to provide for recoupment to the Industrial Credit Corporation plc of revised figures for losses which arose in respect of high risk lending in the manufacturing sector.  I propose to deal briefly with each of these items.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware the Government decided, as one of the recent series of measures to stimulate growth, to allocate an additional £350,000 to the western development fund.  The moneys will be used to assist the establishment of timber harvesting projects in western counties.  These projects will promote the further development of our natural forestry resource and are expected to generate 60-70 new full-time jobs at full production.</P>
      <P>The second reason for the Supplementary Estimate is to enable repayment of an additional sum to the Exchequer in respect of losses incurred by a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Corporation plc, the Shipping Finance Corporation.  In the mid 1970s the Shipping Finance Corporation advanced loans of £10.8 million towards the financing of two ships at Verolme Cork Dockyard.  In 1986, the owner of the ships defaulted and, after some negotiations, a sum of £2.9 million of the loan principal outstanding was written off by the Shipping Finance Corporation.  My Department agreed to a write-off of a corresponding amount of repayable Exchequer advances, and this amount must now be repaid to the Exchequer. Because of a saving on the existing allocation the amount required by way of Supplementary Estimate is £2,751,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third item relates to losses under an industrial development loan scheme operated by the ICC.  The losses referred to arise in respect of high risk loans advanced by ICC in the manufacturing <Col N="1364" /> sector under the terms of a scheme, known as the development finance scheme, agreed between ICC and my Department in 1980.  Under this scheme the Exchequer accepts 40 per cent of the credit risk on certain loans advanced by ICC to clients who might not otherwise have been able to obtain finance for their projects.  The main reason for the increase in the amount involved under the scheme for this year is that during the early years of a loan, bad debts are relatively rare.  As the scheme has matured, losses have increased, probably peaking in this year.  This scheme is being phased out, in the light of the increased sources of capital now available for investment purposes.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this Supplementary Estimate, I would point out that because of savings of £1,100,000 within the Vote the net amount needed by way of Supplementary Estimate is £3,391,000.</P>
    <P>I will now move on to the Vote for public service early retirement payments. A further £18 million is now required for this Vote.  Eighty million pounds were originally provided for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There are two principal reasons for this divergence from the Estimate.  First, because of the voluntary nature of the scheme it is very difficult to predict which staff members will avail of the terms, and since the payments due to individuals on departure vary according to their age, salary levels and length of service, the total cost of the package is difficult to predict.  Second, the scheme has been more successful than we anticipated. Particularly, the announcement on the termination of the early retirement scheme for public service employees over the age of 50 has led to a large volume of later applications which, it is estimated, will bring the total cost of the scheme to £98 million this year.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in July 1987 to introduce a package of voluntary redundancy in areas of the public service where staff had been identified as surplus to requirements.  In November 1987 we decided that the early retirement terms should also be offered to employees aged 50 and over in the Civil Service, health <Col N="1365" /> boards and non-commercial State bodies. These early retirements create vacancies into which staff who are no longer required in their present work areas, but who do not wish to leave the public service, can be redeployed.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced because the Government accepted that it was necessary to reduce the size of the public service.  Over the last two years we have examined critically the entire range of public expenditure and have decided to scale down activities in many areas: it follows, if the intended savings are to be made, that the numbers of staff engaged on those programmes must fall.  In order to facilitate this, we therefore decided to offer an incentive package to ensure that public service staff numbers would fall to the desired levels.</P>
    <P>The policy has been highly successful. Over seven and a half thousand people will leave the public service under the scheme this year, in addition to the 1,135 who accepted the terms in 1987.  These reductions in numbers have been achieved on an entirely voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The costs of the scheme are substantial: £8.4 million was issued from the public service early retirement payments Vote in 1987, and the requirement for this year is now expected to be £98 million. It will be necessary for us to maintain a very restrictive approach to public service recruitment for some years in order to achieve the full benefit of the resulting pay savings.  We have therefore decided that the policy adopted last year will be continued in 1989.  No vacancies may be filled in the Civil Service without the consent of the Minister for Finance, and no vacancy may be filled in any other area of the public service, excluding the commercial State bodies, without the approval of the Minister responsible and the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The voluntary redundancy package will continue to be available on a restricted basis in 1989.  It will be available only in areas where staff have been identified as surplus to requirements or where adherence to the financial provisions in the 1989 Estimates will require further reductions in staffing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> With these comments I commend these three Supplementary Estimates to the House.  If Deputies wish to raise any points in relation to the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Finance and the public service early retirement payments, I will be glad to address them in my reply at the end of this debate.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Treacy, the Minister of State, will address any points relating to the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>The first item in the Vote for the Office of Public Works is the additional allocation of £239,000 sought for Subhead D for the purchase of sites.  The Government have taken decisions on the Office of Public Works building programme for next year and purchase of the required sites now will facilitate orderly progress of the programme. The commissioners are also negotiating the purchase of certain lands for conservation.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £516,000 is required this year for Subhead E for the capital building programme.  I am particulary pleased to be seeking this sum, as it arises primarily because of better than anticipated progress with the major development at Dublin Castle.  I want to emphasise that this superb project will be completed faster than we had anticipated and within the original budgetary target set in 1985.  For these reasons I am taking this opportunity to pay the highest compliment to the team involved in its execution.  I might add that I hope the media will devote at least as much attention to this success story as it has to less successful projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance and supplies subhead, F1, will need an additional allocation this year.  The Government have decided that, from the beginning of next year, individual Departments will assume <Col N="1367" /> financial responsibility for contract maintenance works in the buildings they occupy.  Details of this change are outlined in the General Note in the Abridged version of the 1989 Book of Estimates. In the period since the Government took this decision the Commissioners of Public Works have been actively encouraging contractors to claim their money immediately on completion of maintenance works in order to avoid, as far as possible, the situation where the accounts would not be cleared until next year, and would then have to be met by the individual Departments.  In the normal course of events contractual commitments on maintenance works, amounting to about £1 million, would be carried from one year to the following year.  Given that the contractual liability in these cases rests with the commissioners, I believe the case for providing the additional sum of £937,000 is compelling.</P>
    <P>The energy costs subhead, F4, needs additional funding of £450,000.  Deputies will be aware that individual Departments have, this year, assumed responsibility for their own energy costs. Heretofore these costs were charged to the Office of Public Works Vote.  The sum of £804,000 provided in Subhead F4 in the original Estimate was intended to clear departmental energy costs, incurred in 1987, but not billed until this year. The sum was also expected to cover the energy costs of certain prestigious buildings and other premises in the case of the Office of Public Works.  There have been minor teething difficulties with the operation of the new system which have left doubt as to the correct subhead of charge for the energy costs of some accommodation. The excess on this subhead is directly offset by a saving on the energy allocation provided in subhead B3.  The difficulties I mentioned are currently being resolved and this will be reflected in the 1989 Book of Revised Estimates.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £94,000 is sought for inland waterways this year.  The sum is needed to cover the cost of purchasing transport vehicles.  Since taking over responsibility for the canals in July 1986 <Col N="1368" /> the Commissioners of Public Works have been examining ways of making better use of the existing resources.  The previous owners of the canals adopted the practice of hiring vans for the transport of the work crews to the areas in which they were needed.  In the medium and long term this practice is significantly more expensive than the cost associated with owning the vans.  In the circumstances the commissioners are purchasing six vehicles for use by the canals workforce.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required for the arterial drainage subheads, L2 and L3, is £296,000.  Deputies will be aware that it was necessary to introduce limited short-time working on the drainage programme recently.  The matter was disputed and the Labour Court considered the case in October.  On 19 October the Labour Court recommended that, pending consideration of the issue by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> short time working should cease.  The additional sum sought for these subheads will allow drainage workers to be maintained in full time employment for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>At the outset I mentioned that this is a token Supplementary Estimate.  Deputies will see from Part 2 of the details that significant savings, totalling £1.73 million, are expected on certain subheads.  An increase of £799,000 on the original Appropriations-in-Aid Estimate is also anticipated.  I propose to give details only of the significant factors in both cases.</P>
    <P>A saving of £321,000 is forecast on subhead A1, due to the rate of take up on the early retirement offer and the non-filling of vacancies.  The bulk of the savings on subhead F3 is due to the fact that FÁS will be paying rents this year in respect of accommodation occupied by them.  This matter had not been settled when the 1988 Estimates were being framed and, accordingly, provision was made in Vote 10 for these rents.</P>
    <P>The saving of £146,000 expected in subhead M is due to the takeup on the early retirement offer and a decrease in <Col N="1369" /> demand for spare parts for the machinery used on the arterial drainage programme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the projected increase in Appropriations-in-Aid. Firstly, the income from charges at Dún Laoghaire Harbour will be higher than anticipated.  Furthermore, the popularity of our parks and monuments for our visitors continued to increase and, this year, the income will be the highest on record.  I believe that these latter increases are not only a sign of a general pick-up in tourist activity, but are also a tribute to the outstanding quality of the commissioners' work in the conservation and amenity fields.</P>
    <P>I commend this token Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his recent promotion and to wish him every success in this most difficult ministry of any Government, particularly of this Government, especially when we consider that financial policy is so central to overall Government objectives.</P>
      <P>My party have no objections to any of these Estimates.  We see them as part of the normal prudent housekeeping which is necessary at this time of year.  It appears that the Government's borrowing requirement will be somewhat less than 40 per cent of that which was budgeted for in the budget.  Consequently, the necessity for Supplementary Estimates does not arise this year and certainly does not arise in respect of the Estimates put before the House.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty at all in accepting subheads K, L and M in Vote 7, Office of the Minister for Finance, and I presume that in order to improve the position for next year a decision has been made to pay before the end of this calendar year rather than there being any necessity to bring these items into the Estimate for the current year.  If it would lead to an improvement in the position for next year I think any Minister for Finance would do it and it presents me with no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to raise one or two points in respect of the public service early <Col N="1370" /> retirement scheme and I hope that in replying the Minister will take the opportunity to respond to them.  Our time is very limited and therefore I will not dwell unduly on this matter but will proceed by way of question.  The original Estimate was for £80 million and this is now being raised to £98 million.  An estimate was given of the sum that would be drawn from the Central Bank so as to pay lump sum payments.  Subsequently, there was a variation of this figure if I recall correctly a statement made by the Minister's predecessor.  I would like the Minister to explain to the House what the present position is.  Is all of this money, £98 million, going to be drawn down from the Central Bank or is part of this figure going to be provided by the Exchequer, seeing that the Exchequer is now in a better position than they thought they would be?  I know that all of the money received from the Central Bank passes through the Government's accounts but I would like a more detailed breakdown as to what portion of the £98 million will be drawn down as part of profits in advance from the Central Bank and what portion will be supplied by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also reaffirmed today what is implicit in the 1989 Estimates, that the Government's policy on recruitment in the public sector will continue in 1989 and that the early retirement package will be made available once again but only in circumstances where staff are surplus to needs in the opinion of the Minister for Finance.  It seems that the Minister will have to take a look at this area in greater detail in the context of the forthcoming budget.  In the Estimates for 1989 there are several patterns but that which strikes one most forcibly is the one that indicates that while there have been real cuts in many Departments these savings have been swallowed up to a large extent by real increases in other Departments. When one examines the Estimates one will see that effectively pay increases are swallowing up the savings made in other areas.  What is clearly emerging is that while programmes remain in position across line Departments there are insufficient civil servants <Col N="1371" /> to deliver the particular services.  This also applies outside the Civil Service, for example, in the health boards, in local authorities and, increasingly, in some of the semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>This leads to two difficulties, the first of which is that all of these programmes are left lie there waiting for the day when things improve sufficiently, when the traditional level of expenditure will be provided.  I did not see any evidence of a restructuring of Government spending as distinct from a reduction in Government spending.  Does the Minister have any further plans to restructure Government expenditure in so far as it relates to the number of people on the State payroll, either directly or indirectly?  I am not convinced that a continuation of the early retirement scheme along with the embargo, admittedly in a more targeted way, will achieve the end which the Minister and the rest of us desire.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult in future wage agreements to hold the line on pay particularly if inflation remains quite low.  The numbers on the payroll will have to be reduced further rather than there being an attempt made to control the level of pay which the existing group receive.  Has the Minister considered reconstructing some of the activities of Departments so as to take out some programmes and offer them to outside agencies?  Some programmes could be dropped completely although in others the services provided are desirable and, in many cases, vital. Has the Minister considered the possibility of offering programmes, along with the staff who run them, who would effectively either become employees of new semi-State companies or alternatively of the private sector, to outside agencies?  I believe the movement has to be in that direction.  There are around 180,000 public servants but I presume, through the effectiveness of the redundancy programme, this number has been reduced further.  Perhaps the Minister will give us the correct figure when replying but restructuring public expenditure, rather than continuing to cut in every annual budget, would involve further reductions <Col N="1372" /> in numbers and if this is to be consistent with maintaining services it seems that there is only one way to go.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter at an early date.</P>
    <P>I would also like to thank the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works for his very detailed statement on why the additional sums required under Vote 10 are necessary.  I have no comment to make on this but he is right to draw attention to the fact that the Office of Public Works who are frequently subjected to quite trenchant criticism have had some notable successes. It is appropriate when there are major successes, such as the beautiful work carried out on the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and the restoration of Dublin Castle, not only ahead of schedule but within budget, that this House and people outside, too, should note them.  There have been major successes within the public sector, but it has not been fashionable to praise the public sector in recent years.  I believe it is about time some balance was restored and where there are real successes we should praise the people involved.  The work done on the castle is a notable success and I applaud the Minister in drawing the attention of the House to this work.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister of State will get an opportunity to reply to this debate but perhaps the Minister will take up one point in relation to these Votes: will he make a policy statement on the Government's intentions on arterial drainage for 1989?  I understand that those regions in the process of submitting integrated regional programmes to the Minister's Department, through the filter of the Minister for the Environment, are not including arterial drainage works in their integrated regional programmes.  If arterial drainage is to have a place in the economic development of regions it seems that it more than anything else needs to be integrated and if it is not included in the integrated programmes, is it the intention not to have any further major arterial drainage schemes under the 1946 Act?  I should like the Minister to take up that point.  We are finishing <Col N="1373" /> the debate at 5.30 p.m. and I am sure my esteemed colleague, Deputy McDowell, would like to contribute to the debate.</P>

      <P>Time constraints and also my own inclination will restrain me to brevity on this occasion.  I should like to join with Deputy Noonan in congratulating Deputy Reynolds on his appointment as Minister for Finance.  I wish him well with his appointment.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that it is a most difficult task but I have no doubt that he has the will, determination and competence to carry out his functions properly and efficiently and to carry on the good work that has been done in relation to the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate what I said before in this House in relation to the public service early retirement scheme.  Its popularity, which has been mentioned by the Minister, is an indication that perhaps it was over generous in its form and a bit too diffuse in the way in which it was targeted.  I accept from the Minister that in the forthcoming year the scheme is to be more closely targeted to areas of surplus employment but it strikes me that it is necessarily a blunt instrument to achieve certain results to use a voluntary retirement scheme.  Although I appreciate the industrial relations aspects of voluntary rather than compulsory retirement, I would have preferred, and still would prefer, the Government to specify the size and composition of the public service and its deployment in the form of some kind of White Paper.  I should like to know what end is in view, what the final targets are for each Department and whether or not, as Deputy Noonan said, it is proposed to scrap individual programmes and to perhaps amalgamate agencies and reorganise the division of the apparatus of State into different Departments?  In this context I think this House is entitled at some stage <Col N="1374" /> to get from some member of the Government a long-term strategy on public service employment spelt out.  This may not be the time to do it, and I am not suggesting that the Minister should do so between now and 5.30 p.m., but it should be done in the long term.</P>
    <P>I wish to inquire whether the Government are willing to issue a long-term strategy paper in relation to their semi-State banking operations, including ACC, ICC and other such bodies.  It seems that ICC in particular are a body capable of being made independent, self-sufficient financially and fully commercial and, of course, in that context they are a body who are capable in the long run, in principle at least, of being divested of their Government ownership and put into the private arena to compete in the post-1992 single European financial services market.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister of State's speech on his Estimates, I should like to refer to two points.  I agree with him that it is wrong for this House to criticise always the Commissioners of Public Works when things go wrong for them but never to give them praise when things go right for them.  It is wrong for those who like myself believe that the Office of Public Works should be substantially restructured and the commissioners' activities redefined on a narrower basis and for those who oppose the present structure of the Commissioners of Public Works to criticise what they do as a reason for justifying their restructuring. That is not fair.  I do not do this because, like Deputy Noonan, I agree that they do many fine things and many jobs which it is hard to envisage any private sector body doing.  However, in other respects they do jobs which might be more efficiently done by other bodies.  I hope what I have said will not be taken as a criticism of the individuals involved but it is a criticism of the structure under which they operate.  It is an old-fashioned structure and concept which dates from the 19th century and even though it is now being changed so as to make individual Departments responsible for their own housekeeping expenses, it seems that in <Col N="1375" /> many respects a further and more radical change is needed in the Office of Public Works to get the best value for money for the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dublin Castle project I wonder if the Minister could take a suggestion on board.  The castle is, albeit by about 50 or 60 yards in a corner of my constituency and I very rarely have the opportunity when listening to debates about the Office of Public Works to hear anything about something in my constituency. I have looked over the hoardings into this void in which the original moat of the castle has been excavated and various buildings put in place.  I would love to have a look around the castle and rather than chance my arm and say &ldquo;I am a TD and I should like to have a look around&rdquo;, I suppose the best thing to do is to ask the Minister to allow Members of this House to see the work being carried out in the castle.  In advance of an official opening to which everyone will come on their best behaviour and in their best suits and stand around and have a sip of sherry, if the public finances extend to that, the Minister should invite Members of this House, while the works are in progress, to see the nature and the size of the works which the Commissioners of Public Works have undertaken and succeeded with, when the extent of the works is obvious rather than just show us at the end &mdash; and most people in this House have not been in the relevant buildings &mdash; the finished product. I should like to see the work in progress and should like the Minister to make that opportunity available to Members of this House on a formal basis.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the inland waterways. I note that the Minister is looking for extra money for a specific purpose in relation to the inland waterways.  In that context I should again like a long term statement of policy as to who will control the canals, how they will be operated, what goals are being established for the management of the canals, what usage levels are being contemplated and how improvements, especially in the inner city areas through which they flow, will be <Col N="1376" /> made.  I believe, and this is one bugbear of mine in relation to the canals, that there is huge scope for integrating the Royal and Grand Canals more fully &mdash; and I know they are to some extent already integrated &mdash; into some form of youth training for unemployed young people in the areas through which they run.  Much work has to be done on the canals.  Because a lot of it is labour intensive but non-capital intensive, if young people were offered the opportunity to do something constructive in relation to something as worthwhile as conserving the canals and the system of canals, and the training opportunities which the woodwork, stonework and horticultural work associated with the canals offer them, this would be a desirable long term aim.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Noonan I have no objection to these Estimates.  I have no major comment to make on any of their technicalities except to wish both the Minister and the Minister of State well in the execution of their duties.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for the expression of their good wishes for success in the future in what no doubt everyone appreciates is a very difficult ministry.  I will give the Minister of State a couple of minutes to reply to the specific points raised.</P>
      <P>I want first to refer to the points made by Deputy Noonan.  With regard to the supplementary figures for subheads L and M, I should like to remind the Deputy that they are matured liabilities.  Whether I liked it or not, I could not put them on into next year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would make sure they were brought into this year.  They are all matured liabilities and as such must be included this year, irrespective of the state of the finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank are providing £51.4 million this year instead of the £18 million that was being spoken about because of the improved position in relation to Exchequer finances.  With regard to Government efficiency, the House can be assured that I will be looking at every <Col N="1377" /> aspect but this is not the time for a major statement on the matter.  This Government do not stand back from change.  We set up the Ministry of the Marine and brought together many functions under its aegis.  We set up the office of the Minister for Food, which was long overdue since the State organisational structure had been spread all over the place, involving many Departments and agencies. We will continue to look at areas where efficiency can be achieved because we must continue the downward pressure on Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year my predecessor gave a forecast in the budget that public service numbers would fall by about 9,000.  It appears that this target will be met.  The fall in numbers will slow down in 1989, when employment in the public service is tentatively forecast to fall by some 3,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of pressure on pay as a result of low inflation.  I tend to take an opposite view.  For the first time in years workers are getting real increases in their wages.  The inflation rate is around 2 per cent.  The public sector are getting an increase of 2.5 per cent and others are getting more than that.  I do not see any excuse for pressure for an increase in wages.  For many years high inflation was eroding the value of any wage increase.  We will keep the matter under control because we must continue the downward pressure on Government expenditure.  We still have major overheads and it costs £2 billion annually to service the debt.  Public service pay and two or three other Departments eat up the rest of the money.  We must continue to manage the State finances in an efficient and effective manner.  I will not stand back from any organisational change.  I have certain things in view but <Col N="1378" /> it is too early yet to speak about them.  I must first have them tested within the Department to see if they can run. Deputies can be assured that we will be returning to this topic early in 1989.

    <P>Since taking over responsibility for the canals from CIE in 1986, the Office of Public Works have commissioned a major management and development strategy report which will form the basis of future plans.  This report &mdash; the Brady. Shipman and Martin report &mdash; has been widely welcomed as being a very imaginative, feasible and practical report pertaining to the canals.  A start has been made on the huge backlog of maintenance work.  This has involved the purchase of several major items of equipment.  It is hoped, resources permitting, to continue to make progress on the detailed plan to develop the full <Col N="1379" /> potential of this valuable amenity.  We are seeking European Community funding for substantial improvement works on the canals.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on <Col N="1380" /> the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The original net Vote for health for 1988 was £1.109,944, including a capital provision of £41,030,000.  This excludes an amount of £20.1 million which is being drawn from Vote 46 in respect of the general increase and other special increases under the 1987 agreement on pay in the public service.</P>
    <P>The movement of a Supplementary Estimate for a token sum is to allow the use of additional Appropriations-in-Aid accruing in the current year.  The additional receipts amount to £14.1 million in total and arise under the headings of health contributions receipts under EC regulations and the proceeds of property sales.</P>
    <P>Apart from the additional Appropriations-in-Aid there are unexpected funds in the existing Vote provision which, with the appropriate subhead adjustments, will allow for the bonus payment of certain health cash allowances. The unexpended funds arise mainly in respect of the cost of special pay increases provided for in the original Vote which will not now arise until 1989.  The total cost of the bonus payment is £0.9 million.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is made up as follows:</P>

    <P>The additional yield of £9.8 million from this source has arisen in line with the 1988 general trend in income-related revenue.  The effects of the tax amnesty and the introduction of self assessment for the self-employed are reflected in the extra yield.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3.7 million over and above the original receipts forecast under EC regulations has arisen.  These receipts are subject to currency variations and the original forecast cannot, therefore, be precise.  Under the regulations in question each member state is, subject to agreement, required to meet the health care costs incurred by another member state in respect of its migrant workers, which includes pensioners, as well as the dependants of such workers.</P>
    <P>The receipts shown in the Health Vote under this heading represent the net payment due to this country from the UK authorities.  In the case of other EC States, we operate on a reciprocal non-reimbursement basis, due to the relatively small number of migrants involved. The methodology and costings on which the receipts are based are approved by the EC Audit Board in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The sale of the premises formerly occupied by the Health Education Bureau realised £636,000.  The health promotion unit which assumed the responsibilities of the bureau will now be located at Hawkins House.</P>
    <P>It is intended to use £13.5 million of the additional Appropriations-in-Aid to meet the grant requirements of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board for 1988.  As Deputies will be aware the GMS scheme or choice-of-doctor scheme is demand led.  The increased user <Col N="1382" /> demand evident in 1988, requires that the resources made available to fund the scheme be now adjusted.</P>
    <P>The continuing increased demand in the choice-of-doctor scheme undoubtedly demonstrates the key role which those in general practice play in the provision of health services.  The importance of this role has been one of the principal factors in the drawing up of the revised remuneration package for doctors participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department are completing the necessary arrangements to ensure that the new contract is issued to the participating contractors during next week.  The new arrangements were accepted by the Government and by a large majority in the IMO's July ballot.  It was clearly understood by all parties to these negotiations that the arrangements would apply to all participating doctors.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements represent a satisfactory balance between the legitimate interests of doctors, management and patients alike.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of an extraordinary general meeting of the Irish Medical Organisation which took place over the weekend.  In that regard the IMO have not formally communicated to me that there is any change in their position regarding the agreed introduction of the new arrangements from 1 January next.</P>
    <P>The allocation to the GMS (Payments) Board for 1989 provides for the implementation of the new contract.  The terms of the new contract will ensure a better quality and a more comprehensive and cost-effective general practitioner service.  Indeed the position of the role of practitioner within the primary health care area remains pivotal.  The new contract will assist, I am confident, in the delineation of the role primary care staff in general and a clear understanding of their unique role and contribution.</P>
    <P>The revised package does not only cover remuneration for current services. It also provides for a contribution towards a superannuation scheme as well as enhanced training opportunities and nursing and secretarial support.  This <Col N="1383" /> package is fundamental to the continued evolution of general practice as the cornerstone of an appropriate primary health care delivery system.</P>
    <P>While the framework of the new contract is in my view most valuable, the clear provision for a comprehensive review at the end of next year and regularly thereafter provides an opportunity to take account of experiences in operating the new contract.</P>
    <P>The purchase price of Hawkins House paid by the Office of Public Works was based on the capitalised value of the floor space previously let to the OPW and already occupied by Government Departments.  This in effect meant that the additional floors previously occupied and later vacated by private tenants were obtained free of charge.  The total refurbishment costs which fall due for payment in 1988 amount to £636,000.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that the refurbishment costs are offset by the proceeds of property sales, both realised and anticipated, and by a reduction in the requirement for rented accommodation. As I have already said, the former Health Education Bureau premises have already been sold and the premises currently occupied by the Adoption Board will be offered for sale when the board move to Hawkins House.  There will be a continuing benefit to the Exchequer commencing in 1990 due to a reduced need for office space which is currently rented. Based on present rates the letable value of the vacated rented space is about £250,000 per annum.  Apart altogether from this economic benefit there will be the increased efficiency inherent in operating from a centralised location.</P>
    <P>Adjustments between subheads of the Health Vote and within the overall level of grant available will provide for the cost of meeting the bonus payment of certain health cash allowances, in line with other long term social welfare benefits.  The bonus payment, which amounts on average to 65 per cent of the normal weekly payment, will benefit some 33,000 disabled recipients and their dependants. In addition the bonus payment will also benefit those in long term care who have <Col N="1384" /> no means of their own and who are in receipt of the weekly spending allowance. This is an indication of the Governments commitment to giving priority to those who are financially the least well off in our society.  As Deputies will see, this is a technical Estimate and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The detail of this Supplementary Estimate is minor.  I would describe it as technical housekeeping. Unfortunately, the Minister did not refer to many of the topical issues in the health service that are preoccupying the minds of so many people who are not only serviced by the health sector but also working in it.  At the end of 1988 we can now review the disastrous effects of the failure of the Minister for Health to respond adequately to the growing crisis in the health service.  There have been real cutbacks in finance to the health service, without the necessary policy adjustments to protect public patients from hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this short debate I wish to outline the aspects which I consider to be most unsatisfactory.  The first of these, as I have repeated many times, is that of waiting lists.  Last week at Question Time in the Dáil the Minister failed &mdash; I fear, deliberately &mdash; to give precise information on the numbers on out-patient and in-patients waiting lists.  From my information on different hospitals, from consultants, management, general practitioners and others, I estimate that there are at least 50,000 people awaiting appointments on an out-patient or inpatient basis.  Short waiting lists for periods of weeks or even months are not unreasonable.  However, the current chronic position where patients have to wait two or three years for operations is simply unacceptable.  I am specifically referring to the appalling situation whereby 8,000 public patients, most notably old age pensioners, are waiting for orthopaedic hip replacements.  Similar waiting lists apply to ENT treatment and ophthalmic surgery.  Even routine general surgery and vascular work on an elective basis has ceased in some hospitals for the last three months of this year on <Col N="1385" /> account of their budgetary restrictions. The Minister has failed not only to introduce an effective response to these needs but has allowed the position to deteriorate without acknowledging the problem.</P>
    <P>Because of the specific problems in the short term I contend the Minister should introduce, as a short term measure, contract allocations to those hospitals with specialties on a unit cost basis to clear the backlog of cases.  In the long term the answer must be to allocate finance to hospitals on the basis of clinical budgeting and harnessing consultants in the exercise of cost control.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn briefly to the psychiatric services.  I have visited different health boards in recent times.  There have been one or two recent cases of concern.  I am becoming increasingly concerned about the accelerated programme of discharges of psychiatric patients into inadequate or often non-existent community care facilities. It appears that the period of rehabilitation of such patients in certain parts of the country has been cut short.  In some cases this has been counter-productive, with patients regressing and not being discharged.  Also for voluntary patients I fear there may be indequate community nursing arrangements to oversee patient needs beyond the straightforward requirements of day care centres and night hostels.  I want the Minister to ensure that a reasonable degree of caution is shown in this area so that the overall policy principle which we support, of de-institutionalising the psychiatric services, is not brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the dental services. The Minister has often referred to the working party chaired by his Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, on the dental services.  Having read their report I know now why he has not seen fit to publish it. It clearly states that the obligations on health boards to provide a dental service to the 1.96 million people eligible for free dental care under section 67 of the 1970 Health Act are not being met.  The whole of our dental service is in a state of utter chaos.  The Irish Dental Association clearly are not operating the PRSI dental <Col N="1386" /> benefit treatment scheme effectively. Since 1985-86 the poorest people in the community, in varying degrees have had no routine, adult dental service such as the provision of dentures and rectifying tooth decay.</P>
    <P>There are some 24,000 people awaiting orthodontic care.  In some cases they are being obliged to pay privately over double the rate applicable in Northern Ireland, up to £1,800 for a service.  There is urgent need for a national strategy on dental care, resolving the anomalies between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health schemes, providing for a comprehensive preventive programme on tooth decay and gum disease.  That should be an absolute urgent priority. I welcome the recommendations of the report of the Working Party and would hope they would be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>I might turn now briefly to the Voluntary Health Insurance.  I have requested a public debate on this matter many times in this House which has been denied.  The VHI have lost over £30,000 for every day this Minister has held office in the Department of Health.  For example, over the two financial years covering March 1987 to the end of February next the VHI will have lost, in net terms, £22 million, unprecedented in their 30-year history.  Under the provisions of the 1957 Act establishing the Voluntary Health Insurance the Government have clear responsibility for the finances and policies of that State body. The fact that the Minister did not initiate a recovery programme this time last year will cost VHI subscribers £10 million. Even to this day I cannot understand the inordinate delay and neglect of this extremely grave matter.  I note that only last month the VHI issued a public statement saying they hoped to have their recovery programme in place by 1 December, which date has now lapsed.</P>
    <P>What is required is a reorganisation of VHI plans into three categories of cover to facilitate the three types of private hospital care, which are: pay beds in public hospitals and low technology private hospitals.  Cross-subsidisation will <Col N="1387" /> have to cease from the cheaper plans to the more luxurious cover.  In future hospitals should be paid by the VHI on a cost-per-treatment basis, based on average bed stays and competitive costings between hospitals.  Other formulae allow exploitation of scarce VHI funds.</P>
    <P>Another report commissioned by the present Minister, an excellent one, related to care of the elderly.  One of the most important demographic changes occurring in this country is the increase in our elderly population.  It is estimated that there will be a 20 per cent increase in the total number of those over 75 years of age by the year 2006.  I wish to commend the report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly published last October which clearly pointed out the need for reorganisation of the health services to meet the needs of the elderly. At present there is a limbo obtaining between the geriatric, psychiatric and community care services for the elderly. Unfortunately, the Minister has not yet given any clear commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of that report with regard to the provision of day care centres, day hospitals, the development of geriatric medicine in general hospitals, the provision of sheltered accommodation, the establishment of back-up nursing panels on a part time basis for home nursing services and the need to meet the individual health care needs of the elderly such as chiropody, hearing aids and dentures.</P>
    <P>It seems pointless for the Minister to commission such reports if he is not prepared to act on their recommendations. Surely the Minister must now give some unequivocal commitment of even a gradual response to these recommendations. Some of the changes recommended, such as district nursing teams, clearly are matters of reorganisation rather than of extra resources.  If the Minister is to deny adequate geriatric beds he must provide proper community care facilities.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to the current review and new GMS contract to be implemented from 1 January next.  Recent events in <Col N="1388" /> relation to the revised GMS contract for general practitioners have raised questions as to the implementation of the negotiated memorandum between the Irish Medical Organisation and the Department of Health.  I have stated publicly that I favour a system of capitation payments to doctors.  I note that this Supplementary Estimate allows for an additional £13.5 million of GMS expenditure. It appears to me that the current row is not about patient care but rather about money.  It would be unacceptable for taxpayers to get the worst of both worlds after 1 January next.  By that I mean a fee-per-item system of payment for some and a capitation-type payment for others &mdash; with all the bonuses of holiday pay, pensions, locums and so on &mdash; which could only result in an increased cost for the same service or, in some cases, perhaps even a lesser service.  It is not possible to devise a scheme that will suit every circumstance of general practice ideally.  Therefore I favour the introduction of the new scheme provided a national formulary on drugs is included and a proper incentive scheme for more diagnostic work to be done at general practitioner level.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Child Care Bill has had its Second Reading in this House.  It is now time to make financial provisions for the statutory responsibilities in relation to child care services which will devolve on health boards under the provisions of that Bill.  Such will include referral centres for cases of suspected abuse adequately staffed; residential facilities and foster resource groups to provide alternative care for children at risk, as deemed by the courts and deprived families will require back-up social worker support and counselling. All of these specific needs render it necessary for there to be, from 1989 onwards, a child welfare budget within each health board.  To date the Minister had declined to give such a commitment. I call on him, in replying to this debate, to specify what resources he feels the provisions of this Bill will entail and what arrangements he is making therefor.</P>
    <P>As long as I have been spokesman on Health for my party it has always been <Col N="1389" /> necessary for Fine Gael to spell out their alternative strategy.  We accept that there are budgetary restraints on all spending Departments given the current fiscal position.  However, I wish to make it quite clear that, while we will not oppose this Supplementary Estimate, we shall reserve our position in relation to next year's Health Estimate Vote.  My strongest criticism of this Government's health policy is the fact that they have allowed little or no planning or any coherent health policy to develop in tandem with financial restraint.  This has led to much hardship and yawning gaps in our health and welfare services.</P>
    <P>I believe savings can be effected in the purchase of drugs on the basis of renegotiation of the present agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries based on European prices for the same drugs.  It is my belief that a saving of £8 million out of a total budget of £120 million would be eminently reasonable.  Similarly, non-medical supplies could be purchased more economically, thus yielding even further savings.  In terms of staffing I do not accept the need for eight individual health board finance and personnel departments given the capacity of modern computerisation.  I would specifically instance the Department of Education and the way salaries are dealt with for the many different grades of teachers.  In the Dublin area we are getting bad value for money also in relation to the management and lack or rationalisation of our laboratory services.</P>
    <P>Some health boards have achieved major savings in the areas of catering and energy conservation in hospitals.  If the lessons learned in some hospitals were applied nationally substantial savings could be made without having any negative effects on patient care.</P>
    <P>The Minister has placed health boards and hospital managements in an impossible position in trying to operate his cuts without policy directions as to how to implement them without further hardship. Year to year financial allocations virtually make planning impossible.  The Minister should get Government <Col N="1390" /> approval for three year financing for the health services.  If this can be done for TB eradication I cannot see why it should not apply to health care.</P>
    <P>Many people who have given a life-time's service to health feel that this is the best time to reorganise our health services to achieve lasting reform that would focus resources on patient services and preventive medicine.  I regret that this Government, despite their pre-election promises are simply giving us more of the same, have failed to implement any radical reform initiated by their predecessor and have allowed the health service to deteriorate to an unacceptable level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The way we deal with Estimates in this House is very unsatisfactory. This applies to the way we deal with the general debate on the Estimates and it applies equally to the debate on a Supplementary Estimate.  If one were to glance quickly at this Estimate one would assume that we are just talking about giving the Department an extra £1,000 and one would wonder what all the fuss was about.  Behind that £1,000 and the housekeeping mechanism engaged in here lies a very sorry story indeed, because the GMS payments board are running out of money.  If this Estimate were not to go through, salaries perhaps for last month and for this month could not be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the essential largest sum of money being provided is for the GMS payments board, it is appropriate to dwell for a few moments on the new proposed payments scheme for doctors participating in the GMS.  Over the last few days I expressed a number of reservations about the manner in which the scheme has been handled.  From the Department and the IMO point of view, a lot of lessons need to be learnt.  The Minister referred to the fact that a majority of doctors voted in favour of the proposals last July but only 58 per cent of doctors participating in the GMS participated in that vote.  We are within three weeks of the implementation of this new proposed method of paying the doctors in the GMS <Col N="1391" /> and all that the Minister can say is that within the next week he will be able to send out the new contracts.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister should postpone the implementation date for this new payments scheme.  It will not be feasible, in less than three weeks time, to move to this new scheme.  What will happen is that one set of doctors will be paid under the new system if it suits them, and another will be paid under the old system if it suits them.  I am reliably told that because the State is in a legal contract with all the doctors in the GMS, the State cannot unilaterally break that contract. If that is the case, and the Minister continues with this proposed implementation date, after 1 January, there will be two methods of paying doctors.  It will create more confusion than we have already.  I regret that this has led to a lot of bitterness and division between GPs.  At the end of the day it is the patients who will suffer.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the new system, I favour some movement towards capitation. Many in this House have said that one of the difficulties in relation to the way consultants are paid for public patients is that they get a fixed salary regardless of the number of hours worked or the number of public patients they see. That is not satisfactory.  We are proposing to move to that system to pay doctors under the GMS.  That will lead to a two-tier service at GP level, the one area of the health service about which I never hear a complaint.  Although the GP service is costly it is not by any means the major cost to the health services and the doctors' salaries proportion of it is only about one-third or less of the overall cost. Patients whether private or public, whether medical card holders or not have easy access to their GP.  After the implementation of this new proposed method of paying doctors, I fear that that will not be the case.  I agree with the Irish College of General Practitioners, the body responsible for professional standards in the area of general medicine when they say that there are not enough <Col N="1392" /> incentives for doctors to visit the terminally ill, the elderly and the handicapped in their own homes.  They said that they would like to see a performance sensitive contract.  I always favour, if possible public servants and doctors being paid in relation to some kind of incentive mechanism.  All of us perform better if that is the case.  I appeal to the Minister to postpone the implementation date beyond 1 January in the interests of unity among doctors and patients.  The patients and the 1.3 million medical card holders are the real sufferers if this continues as proposed.  I appeal to the Minister to consider organising an independent ballot of all the doctors participating in the GMS.  Doctors will not buy a pig in a poke, and it is no wonder that last Sunday's meeting ended in such confusion with both sides taking a different view as to what did or did not transpire. It is not good enough and it is a pity that this whole issue has led to this bitterness and confusion.  That will continue if the Minister persists with implementing this scheme in less than three weeks time.</P>
    <P>The cost of drugs relates to the more expensive side of the GMS.  Reference was made to the new drug formulae. Unless it is compulsory for people to prescribe from those new formulae there is no point in having them.  Having it on a voluntary basis will not work.  Will the Minister reconsider this?</P>
    <P>In relation to the issuing of prescriptions and so on it is crazy that private patients can get prescriptions for up to six months in the case of the pill for instance, whereas a public patient has to return every month.  Many women object to that.  That is another area where money can be saved and I hope it forms part of any new proposals to be introduced.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Dáil the Leader of my party raised a question in relation to the number of committees established by the Minister for Health since he took up office in March 1987.  I was aware of quite a number of committees but I was surprised at the two-page answer which indicated that 21 committees had been <Col N="1393" /> appointed by the Minister.  The Minister also said that that list of 21 did not include departmental <i>ad hoc</i> groups which the Minister had also set up to perform administrative functions.  If there is anything that characterises this Minister's term of office so far, it is the fact that he makes few decisions himself.  Anything that is difficult, contentious, controversial or requires thought and imagination is passed on to a committee and then, as Deputy Yates indicated, the committee's report is shelved to gather dust.</P>
    <P>In relation to one of those committees, the group who considered Temple Street Hospital, is the Minister now in a position to tell the House what he intends to do about this hospital?  I understand that a decision was to be taken this week.  It is not fair to people working in Temple Street or anywhere else to have to continue operating under a cloud of such uncertainty.  It is bad for the morale of the patients, the doctors the nurses and anybody with anything to do with the hospital.  The Minister has all of the reports and has had a lot of time to consider them, so there is no reason why the Minister should not make very clear what he intends to do about Temple Street Hospital.</P>
    <P>If the Minister intends to divide Temple Street between Beaumont and the Mater Hospital that would be most regrettable.  It would divide up the expertise built up over a long number of years in Temple Street Hospital.  It will not be possible for the one paediatrician operating in the casualty unit there to give the same level of service between the two hospitals.  The same applies to the other staff.  That would be an appalling decision for the children particularly in the north inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also refers to the cost of refurbishing Hawkins House.  The initial sum allocated is £663,000.  Last week a question was raised by my party in the House as to the cost to the Department of Health of transferring their administration from the Custom House, Apollo House, Joyce House and Upper Merrion Street and so on, to Hawkins House.  The <Col N="1394" /> answer was that they did not yet know what the cost would be.  I understand that the Department have entered into considerable cost in moving their administration to Hawkins House.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the cost because I am told it is not an economic one and, if not, why did they transfer their administration to Hawkins House?</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the sale of buildings which the Minister said was bringing in some revenue to the State.  I recently raised a question about the sale of many of the buildings owned by the voluntary hospitals.  When hospitals are amalgamated or moved to new, de luxe buildings, the State should have some way of recouping a certain amount of money from the sale of their old assets. After all, the State has spent an enormous amount of money on these buildings, inflated their cost and value and, therefore, should gain some revenue when the buildings are sold.  I was sorry to hear that only in relation to two Limerick institutions any money was forthcoming to the State although the amount in question was very small.  The State should look again at the question of ploughing in resources with no strings attached.</P>
    <P>The health services have, for some time, been in crisis.  When people say that, they are accused of being irresponsible but one could not live with one's eyes open and not see the appalling things going on in the health services, the long list of public patients waiting to get into hospitals for essential operations.  Our health service is expensive and bureaucratic. There have been many cuts in relation to the provision of care at the professional end and very little in relation to administration.  The Minister for Health is not taking charge of his portfolio. He seems to be happy to pass on responsibility to health boards or committees of one kind or another.  That is not good enough.  In a small country like ours, £1.3 billion should be more than enough to provide a fairly decent standard of health care for all our citizens.  It is time the Minister looked at the way public hospitals are funded to ensure that <Col N="1395" /> moneys given to them are not simply given in advance each year as a block grant with no strings attached.  He should ensure that they are required, in return for that money, to take a particular number of patients in each of the different categories.  That is extremely important because too much discretion is being left to the hospitals.  As a result, when we get to the middle of the year, some of the more emotive areas are cut back because they will get more publicity.  The Minister for Health needs to take charge and to ensure that any public moneys given to health institutions are for specific tasks and not at the discretion of CEOs, consultants or matrons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on the way Estimates and Supplementary Estimates are taken in the House.  I wish to add my voice to the dissatisfaction at the way they are presented, that spokespersons are given the Estimates a matter of days in advance and that there is a formal statement by the Minister and a response by Opposition spokespersons.  I have raised the question of a change at meetings of the Whips and I hope it can be implemented next year.  It will mean that there will be dialogue across the Floor, where Members may ask questions which will elicit responses from the Minister.  It will be like a Committee Stage debate which will help us all in this regard.  It will make for a more constructive session than simply a formal statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who handle health portfolios are almost weary of the type of Estimates presented.  We dealt with the Estimate proper on 23 June last and I predicted that the provision of £1.109 billion would cause havoc in the health services.  That prediction has come true. By every objective measure of service, the system over which the Minister presides is breaking down and falling apart. We have heard the litany of hospital closures, the list of bed closures, the lengthening waiting list for elective surgery in every health board region and cutbacks in ambulance services.  In my own health <Col N="1396" /> board area, a private enterprise tried to step into the breach to provide an ambulance service to replace the one that had been withdrawn but it has also collapsed so people have been doubly hit.  The unfortunates who had their service withdrawn in the South Eastern Health Board area invested money and lost it when the private enterprise system, which was supposed to provide them with cover and some measure of security in case they became ill, also collapsed.  There was no help from the Minister, his Department or the South Eastern Health Board, whom I hold responsible for their loss.</P>
    <P>In relation to community care provision, there is a list of hardship.  The same applies to dentistry and orthodontics. Virtually every day in the House, Members from every county seek to raise urgent cases of children who require orthodontic or emergency dental work. In many health board areas, all that is available is extractions.  A proper service is not available to the vast number of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare introduced a scheme for spouses.  He might be interested to know that not a single dentist in County Wexford operates that scheme.  If a spouse wishes to avail of treatment under the scheme, she is referred outside the county but she must go on a waiting list as only a handful of dentists operate in the South Eastern health board region.</P>
    <P>In relation to opthalmic surgery, many are waiting for cataract and other operations. Their sight is steadily disimproving as the wait goes on month after month.  The Minister's cold and calm response to all the crises that have been outlined &mdash; not just by me and other politicians &mdash; but, more pointedly and objectively, by health service workers who are trying to operate the system, is to present a Supplementary Estimate that amounts, in net terms, to a token.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have fought health cutbacks tooth and nail.  In every Estimate which the Minister presented, we pointed out the consequences of forcing them through, aided and abetted by other conservative parties.  We have obviously <Col N="1397" /> lost that battle in 1988.  We failed to move the Minister and the Government from their cold and uncaring path of cuts. However, even the Minister must be aware, from his political clinics, of the myriad of tragedies which are represented by the cold statistics we talk about in the rarefied atmosphere of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>During the Estimate debate proper in June, I spoke of the experience of one hospital by way of anecdote.  I referred to the Meath Hospital, Dublin.  This evening, because I am firmly of the view &mdash; and maybe it is part of my national school training &mdash; that illustration is far more forceful than talking in blunt global terms of millions of pounds, I want to mention one case history to the Minister which might spark his conscience, and that is to talk about another Dublin hospital, St. Vincent's.  By way of anecdote I will tell of an experience I had last Thursday.  I received a phone call from a patient in Waterford who is suffering from an abcess on the liver.  He is a very sick man, as was attested to me by his friends and his GP, and he required urgent medical attention.  His local hospital, Ardkeen in Waterford, was unable to provide the required treatment and he was referred to a specialist in St. Laurence's Ward, St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, one of the largest and most important of our national hospitals.  He was anxious to get this treatment and asked if there was anything I could do to facilitate his early admission to this hospital.</P>
    <P>I telephoned the ward sister.  I spoke to a very caring woman who told me that they had been instructed by the hospital administrator that there were to be no elective admissions into St. Vincent's Hospital until 2 January next at the earliest. The only admissions were coming through the casualty ward, on stretchers, and they were the only cases they had the authority to deal with.  She told me there were &ldquo;stretchers everywhere and we cannot deal with the congestion&rdquo;&mdash; her words.  When I asked her what were the prospects of admission for this very ill man from Waterford she pulled out his file and said he was listed as an urgent <Col N="1398" /> case, but that he was one of 100 urgent cases listed for admission and that he would have to take his place in the queue. That is a scandal.  For us to be talking in global terms about a health service when there are seriously ill people who cannot get the medical treatment they require is a scandal.  I call on the Minister to address himself to that scandal.</P>
    <P>Next year's provision offers only more of the same, further pressure on the health boards and further pressure on voluntary hospitals which will close more beds, reduce services further and further divided the type of health service available to our people.  There will be a quality and immediate health service for those who can pay.  I am sure my friend from Waterford could have his operation immediately if he had the money, but what do we offer those who do not have money, who are dependent on the public health service?  We offer them a waiting list with a hope and a prayer that they will avail themselves of the facilities before their condition worsens to such an extent that they will be beyond help from the medical services.</P>
    <P>The other Deputies referred to the single largest item in this Supplementary Estimate &mdash; £13.5 million to the GMS Payments Board, an overrun of a magnitude which alarmed us all.  But more to the point, I am disappointed, even alarmed, at the remarks in the Minister's speech which do nothing to allay the concern and confusion among the general public on the future of the GMS from January 1 next.</P>
    <P>I understand there is an emergency meeting of the IMO tonight.  The Minister should address urgently what type of services will be available through the GMS to medical card holders and the general public in the New Year.  As Deputy Harney suggested, the one element in the health service that seems to be providing support to the general public, and in particular to medical card holders, is the GMS.  They know if they fall ill they can call on their GP, but there is an element of doubt creeping in whether a comprehensive service will be available to them.  I ask the Minister to <Col N="1399" /> address that point more forcefully than he has done already when he responds to this debate.</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments of the Fine Gael spokesman on Health in relation to the Child Care Bill.  One of my most strident comments in my Second Stage contribution on that Bill was the requirement for a specific, clear and defined allocation of moneys to the health boards if the goods intentions of the Bill are to be realised.  It is clear from every submission from every caring agency that all the good intentions in the world are not worth a bag of beans if the resources are not provided to enable those good intentions to be realised, if the staff, training, and facilities are not provided in each health board area.  I would ask the Minister to clarify that point, although it will be probably more appropriate to next year's Estimate debate because a long and protracted Committee Stage debate will lead this legislation to be enacted through both Houses of the Oireachtas hopefully before next summer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said it was the practice of Fine Gael to spell out the alternatives. I would remind him that on one occasion when we were discussing an Estimate, his immediate predecessor, Deputy Allen stated, in what I describe as Ramboesque fashion, that Fine Gael were totally dissatisfied with the Estimate provision and pledged &mdash; and got considerable media coverage &mdash; on Friday that Fine Gael would oppose the Estimate.  Needless to say, that decision was changed between Friday and Tuesday when the vote took place.</P>
    <P>Temple Street Children's Hospital is an issue which has caused great public disquiet in recent weeks and months.  I understand that today the Minister had a meeting with the chairman of that board. If he has given this information to the board and the chairman, he might now tell the House the exact allocation to Temple Street Children's Hospital for next year and what his intentions are for the future in relation to the provision of specialist children's hospital facilities in the capital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> This Estimate offers no hope to all those people who are dependent on a public comprehensive health service to meet their needs in times of crisis.  At a dinner attended by affluent, well-heeled individuals in recent days, the Taoiseach got great cheers and support when he suggested the Government were on course and would follow through with more cuts in public expenditure programmes. I can assure the Minister and the House that the cheers of the affluent will not drown the cries of the poor and the weak who depend on a public health service in their time of distress.  No service and no sector of public expenditure fits more acutely into that category than the health services.</P>
    <P>This Minister has presided over the dismantling of a proper public health service. For that reason the Labour Party will oppose this token Estimate and demand that a proper health service is provided for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to comment on the last speaker's statement that it was this Minister who started to dismantle the health services. It is a regrettable fact that the former Minister for Health, a member of the Labour Party, started to move away from the provision of a comprehensive health service.  The fact that the Government are continuing in that direction is to be deplored and we shall oppose it at every opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, tonight I wish to speak on the major row between the Department of Health and the IMO on the changes in the GMS service, which affect more than one third of the population and which have not been debated in this House.  We have an opportunity to refer to it today.  However, there has been no major debate in this House on the fundamental provision of health services for the people of this State for as long as I can remember.  There is as much need for an Oireachtas joint committee on the health services as there is for a committee on Foreign Affairs which I have argued for.  We are spending over £1,000 million on our health services, much of <Col N="1401" /> which, it has to be said, is wasted.  Nevertheless, I would argue that the present direction and strategy being employed by the current administration is not improving matters.  Attempting to save money by simply forcing more and more people into the private health sector is not going to provide a comprehensive health care service for the people.  It simply results in the creation of a two-tier health care system, whereby those who have the money to gain access to the best health care, will get it and those who do not will take their place in the queue which gets longer and longer as the days go by.</P>
    <P>The recent decision by the Minister for Health to freeze the allocation to health boards for 1989 at the 1988 level is an effective cut of 3 per cent in real terms. That again can only mean greater cuts in the provision of health care services &mdash; in areas such as the services for the mentally handicapped, the disabled and indeed in some hospital services as well.  It is really deplorable that this House has not got down to debating the direction in which we want the health services to evolve and develop.  We are in the process of creating a new health care system by sleight of hand.  This is a disgraceful way of dealing with a major element of the quality of life enjoyed by citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>There is a squabble between the IMO and the Department of Health on the capitation fee system of payments.  I am not in favour of the proposed system, not because I am opposed to a capitation fee system &mdash; I believe that is the best way of paying for the service &mdash; but it will only work if a capitation fee system is applied to the population as a whole.  The only way in which a capitation system will operate properly is that a free GP service is available to all citizens.  If the proposed system, as it stands, is introduced for GMS patients, there will be an inbuilt incentive for general practitioners to see their GMS patients less frequently, to give them less attention and instead to concentrate on the private patients in order to boost their income.  So far as I am concerned that will follow, as automatically as night follows day.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the sole intention <Col N="1402" /> of the new system is to save money and cut back on the services available to the one-third of the population who qualify for the GP service under the GMS scheme.  Effectively we are planning to cut back the services for the poorest in our society simply to save money and without considering the knock-on effects that will have on the care available to those people.  It has to be acknowledged that because they are part and parcel of the one million poor in our society, they need more care and attention than those who are better off.  I do not support the current system.</P>
    <P>Professor Dale Tussing did most of the pioneering work on health economics and he advocated very strongly that there should be a shift from hospital care to primary health care, leading to a reduction in costly hospital beds and a consequent shift to community services. He also advocated a shift in community services so that non-physicians would deal with the minor ailments that people normally go to GPs with.  However, he argued that if that system were to work, we would have to introduce a free general practitioner care for all, otherwise a two-tier health service would continue to evolve at the expense of those who most need medical care.</P>
    <P>The draft agreement between the IMO and the Department of Health changes the method of payment to general practitioners from a fee per item to a capitation fee.  The scheme will allow for pensions for general practitioners and for study and annual leave and will help pay for back-up staff.  On the face of it, it looks like the system Professor Dale Tussing was proposing.  However, when you consider that it will apply to only one-third of the population, it is clear that this is not what he had in mind.  So as far as I am concerned, there is a need to argue for a comprehensive medical system that is available to all citizens.  No doubt, others will argue that that simply means providing free medical care for those who are well off, and that is so, but if we have an equitable and fair taxation system, there is not reason that the cost would not be clawed back from those <Col N="1403" /> who can afford to pay directly.  In other areas such as education the experience has been that those who can afford to pay choose to pay, and there are quite a number of people who pay VHI premiums at present who are fully entitled to avail of hospital care and the GMS service &mdash; 15 per cent of those paying the VHI subscriptions do not have to. However, they see it as a means of avoiding the queue to see a consultant or to get into hospital.  If we addressed that problem, the service might be more productive.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to consultants needs to be seriously examined.  We need to introduce a new contract for consultants that will ensure that hospital consultants, in particular, would see their public patients under the same conditions that they see their private patients and that they would be given exactly the same care and attention as private patients.  I have some minor experience of dealing with consultants in public hospital wards and it is like being in a cattle yard, with dozens of people in the one room and half a dozen consultants talking to their patients about their ailments, examining them and so on in a way which lacks dignity for the patient who goes to see them.  In no way will a consultant deal with his private patients in this fashion.  I argue that, just as GPs have to sign a contract that they will treat their GMS patients in the same way exactly in terms of waiting rooms, consulting rooms etc., as they treat their private patients, consultants must be obliged to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals.  I put a parliamentary question to the Minister last week for written reply in regard to the number of children waiting for ear, nose and throat operations.  The reply I got was that 780 children are waiting for such operations in Temple Street and 250 in the Crumlin hospital.  That is more than 1,000 in those two hospitals alone.  I indicated last week that I knew a child who needed an operation urgently because the child was losing its hearing, yet a consultant in <Col N="1404" /> Temple Street told the parents of that child that at least 200 children were waiting for operations which were more urgent than this child's.  If this child loses its hearing it will not recover it.  Fortunately, due to the determination and tenacity of the parents concerned, they have managed to get the child into another hospital.</P>
    <P>The reality is that 780 children are waiting to get into Temple Street and 200 children are waiting to get into Crumlin hospital for serious operations.  Their condition may not be life-threatening but the children need the operations particularly in relation to hearing.  I understand from those in the medical profession to whom I have spoken that if a child's hearing is not adequate in the first two to three years of its life, then its capacity to learn how to speak is impaired and the probability is that it will never recover fully the capacity to speak properly.  I put it to the Minister that, while technically the 1,000 children waiting for ENT operations in these two hospitals in Dublin may not be at risk of their lives, other factors should be taken into account when deciding whether an operation is urgent.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the resources necessary at those two hospitals to clear the backlog of children waiting for these operations.  Temple Street say their waiting list is two and a half years long.  Clearly, something is radically wrong with our system when 1,000 children can be waiting for operations of this kind.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the resources even in this one area.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, in his meeting with the health boards' chairmen and chief executive officers and advising them of their allocations for 1989, laid particular emphasis on the dental services.  He expressed his concern at the level of dental services provided throughout the country and particularly at the waiting lists of adults awaiting dental treatment, the absence of concentration upon children's dental services and, indeed, in a number of areas the numbers of children awaiting orthodontic treatment.  Health boards at his instigation are currently preparing proposals which will address over a given time span the difficulties I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that a phased programme throughout health boards generally must take place during next year to ensure that appropriate levels of development take place in the dental area.  Provision has been made in the health capital programme for further planned development in the area of water fluorination, which is very important as has been mentioned already by Deputy Yates.  The Department's deputy chief <Col N="1407" /> dental officer is currently engaged, at the request of and with the co-operation of the management, in the preparation of a plan of systemically addressing the deficiencies in dental services provisions. Indeed, I will be meeting with the Irish Dental Association tomorrow to discuss the report with a view to bringing about a major improvement in these services.</P>
    <P>I heard a comment made by Deputy Harney of the Progressive Democrats in relation to the number of committees the Minister has established to review certain aspects of the health services.  I believe this is a proper and planned approach to the health services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the Minister's approach in appointing committees in particular areas to obtain the best possible advice and then to act in due course <Col N="1408" /> on the advice is a very proper approach to the health services, because this is a very complex area of development.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Supplementary Estimate, the move by the Department to Hawkins House is a very worthwhile exercise.  It brings all the different sections of the Department together.  We are a very efficient, hardworking, streamlined Department.  The fact that we will be together in one building means that we will be more efficient.  I look forward to that move which is taking place at the moment and which will be completed early in 1989.  I would like once again to compliment the Minister on the excellent work he has undertaken since he became Minister in 1987.  The fact that he has expertise as a medical practitioner himself has contributed greatly to this success as Minister.</P>

      <P>I am hoping to cover some points raised in this debate. I would like to start by congratulating the Minister and I hope that on 1 January the new capitation scheme will come in.  In the longterm it will bring a better quality of general medical service directly to the patient and increase the facilities where they are needed, where the patients live, rather than having them trek for very minor procedures and for tests into a large high cost, high technology medical centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal for a moment with the dental services.  As we have heard, there has been a review committee considering this area for the past year and a half.  They have come up with a very comprehensive review and with some proposals for the restructuring of the dental services.  The dental services are unique among the medical services provided in that they deal mainly with people in need, people in pain.  People do not normally think about dentists until they are suddenly stricken with a toothache. In the Dublin area generally if a toothache comes on after normal surgery hours or at the weekend or on a long weekend, one finds there is very little chance of the pain being relieved until the next working day.  One of the areas I believe was not <Col N="1409" /> looked at by any study of dental services is the provision of emergency dental services out of hours or on long weekends. An emergency service could be provided, with the co-operation of the health boards, the dental hospital and dentists in general practice.  I am not talking about a great service dealing with major facial injuries or anything else.  I am speaking about the person who looks for and cannot find treatment for a toothache out of hours.  For approximately £40,000 a year there could be set up in the Dublin area an emergency service.  This relatively small amount of money would go a long way towards alleviating much distress.</P>
    <P>Other problems in the dental services are the lack of orthodontic treatment available under the medical card system to people in need.  The main problem here is lack of manpower.  We do not have enough orthodontists who are willing to work in the health board services or in the public services.  One way around this would be to create in the health board areas non-consultant hospital dental training posts.  One does not have to go to a dental hospital to train as an orthodontist; one can train outside in clinics under supervision.  We should look at this and create these posts for some years to see if they work and if we can alleviate the long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>We produce every year approximately 60 dental surgeons.  Their training course is as long as that of doctors.  Yet when they are qualified, at great expense to the State, most of them leave the country to seek work abroad.  Over the years they come back into the system but, before they leave, we should consider the introduction of an intern year for dentists.  If, these 60 dentists, before they got their qualifications or their licence to practice, had to do a year in the public dental service, we would be going a long way to alleviating the manpower shortage.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to deal with is the accident services in the greater Dublin area.  This service is putting great pressure on hospital beds.  The accident services are working well, probably too <Col N="1410" /> well.  The voluntary hospitals on the accident rota in Dublin admit approximately 600 patients a week.  This means there are 600 beds taken up.  The problem arises when a patient who is booked in for an ear, nose or throat operation, a gallbladder operation or whatever, is contacted by the hospital either on arrival or before they arrive to inform them that the bed has been taken by a patient brought in as a very urgent case.  We will have to look at this problem.  I know there is a subcommittee dealing with this. I would reiterate that the accident services are working well but it is the pressure they are putting on what we would call the cold cases, the routine admissions to hospitals, that is causing disruption. We should look at the possibility of opening a hospital to deal purely with accidents in the Dublin area.  This will eventually come and we might as well start looking in a serious way at the idea now, at the implications and the cost.</P>
    <P>In regard to the hospital services in Dublin generally, complaints arise about people not being treated or not being admitted to the hospital when they felt they should be.  Great play was made here about the ear, nose and throat services in the Dublin area and about the waiting lists for admissions to them.  We could start making savings in the hospitals and recycling the money into the clinical area. I am talking about making savings in the non-clinical area &mdash; pathology, radiology, biochemistry, administration etc.  In most hospitals in the Dublin area there is not just duplication but triplication.  In any given area where there are one, two or three hospitals, they all have full blown pathology departments when one pathology department could service two or three hospitals.  We could look carefully at this to see how savings could be made; but there is no point in making savings if the money is going to be taken out of the service.  It must be put back into the clinical area where it is needed.</P>
    <P>To come back to dentistry again, there seems to be a groundswell of opinion in favour of closing the Dublin Dental Hospital.  This would be a backward step not just for Dublin but for dentistry in <Col N="1411" /> general.  The Dublin Dental Hospital has served not just Dublin but the whole of Ireland for the last 100 years or more and it has given a good service.  In the last two years it has managed to increase its services at no extra cost to the State. Through streamlining and savings in administration they have managed to increase the service to the people in this area.  They also provide a teaching service. This is an area that is not entirely in the bailiwick of the Minister for Health.  It falls between Education and Health and this House and the people outside it should be aware of the great service this hospital has given over the years.  It is a community-orientated service which tries to give the people what they need.  For this they should be applauded.</P>
    <P>I look upon our medical and dental schools, whether they are in Cork or in Dublin, as national assets.  They should be developed and there is no reason why we should not look upon them in the same way that we look upon the international services offered by the ESB, Dublin Gas, Bord na Móna and so on.  We should be selling the services offered by those colleges throughout the world and we should encourage foreigners to train at them.  It would not mean any cost to the Irish taxpayer and the graduates would be good ambassadors for those schools and for this country.</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate.  Deputy Yates complained that I did not deal with topical issues in my opening statement and he was correct because I confined my remarks to the Supplementary Estimate.  I reject his allegation that there is a crisis in the service. We have a first-class quality service thanks to the dedication of the staff working in it and the commitment of administrators in health boards and voluntary hospitals.  The service in our hospitals and at community level is first class.  I have always accepted that there have been problems in regard to waiting lists, particularly for certain high tech procedures <Col N="1412" /> such as orthopaedics and hip replacements. It is only in the last 12 years that hip replacement has become a popular procedure and the demand for that service has grown at a rate faster than any of us expected.  However, we have had waiting lists for hip replacements for the last five or six years.  They did not come about since we took office and I am glad to say that we have done something about them.  With the Arthritis Foundation of Ireland we have provided two new operating theatres in the only stand alone orthopaedic hospital in the country, Cappagh, and that is an indication of the Government's commitment to alleviating that problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates expressed concern about the discharge of patients from psychiatric hospitals to the community.  I would be concerned if there were specific cases and I should like him to bring them to my attention.  It should be remembered that the decision to discharge a patient to the community is a clinical one.  There is no particular cost saving involved because it is just as expensive to provide a community service as it is to provide a hospital service for a long-stay psychiatric patient. I have assured the House, and the public, that we do not intend to follow what occurred in Italy and in parts of the US.  In those countries patients were discharged from hospital at a time when hospital facilities were not available for them.  We are not going to allow that to happen.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Leyden, chaired a committee on the dental services.  In that regard Deputy Fitzpatrick made a constructive contribution to this debate. I agree with his comments about the integration of the dental services and the need to use the available facilities to provide an improved dental service, including the use of the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that as soon as I became aware that a problem existed in the VHI I asked consultants to investigate and report back to me.  The consultants reported to me in <Col N="1413" /> October and within one week I had given the report to the chairman of the VHI. The board asked the consultant to take over as recovery manager and, in order to facilitate that, I appointed him a member of the board of the Voluntary Health Insurance.  We should look back to the term of office of the Coalition because during that time they refused a request by the VHI for an increase in premiums.  That request was made in respect of the end of 1986 and the early part of 1987.  The two major hospitals in the service were built and came on stream during the term of office of the Coalition. It would be no harm if Deputies, when debating the difficulties of the board, considered what happened during the term of office of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney referred to the GMS negotiations and Deputy De Rossa spoke of what he called a row and a squabble between the IMO and the Department of Health.  I should like to assure the Deputy that there is not a row between the IMO and the Department.  The difficulty is within the Irish Medical Organisation. The Department of Health negotiated with the IMO &mdash; John Horgan chaired the meetings &mdash; and a proposal was voted on by that organisation.  It was accepted 2:1.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to say that most of the committees I set up reported within four to six weeks and gave me some very useful information. For example, I established a committee to deal with computerisation of the health services.  I admit to the House that I am not an expert on computerisation but I was glad to have experts in that field advise me.  The advisory council on health promotion will make a very valuable contribution to the improvement of the quality of health for all our people.  I set up a committee to look at the question of hearing aids and I do not make any apology for not being an expert on hearing aids or the technology of them.  I am not concerned if Deputies feel we should not have committees or that we should pick an answer off the top of our heads and implement it.  It is possible to do that in Opposition but not in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Harney that it is not fair to have people in Temple Street Hospital working under a cloud but I should like to ask her, who is responsible for that?  A consultant of Temple Street Hospital was the first person to reflect on <Col N="1415" /> the quality of the service at that hospital. Some of his colleagues agreed with him and the Opposition jumped on the band wagon.  A &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme followed and people were asking me not if I was going to close Temple Street but why I was allowing it to remain open.  I was left with no option but to ask a person to have a look at the hospital.  I am glad to say that the report endorsed my view on the matter.  A similar view was expressed by the matron and the nurses of the hospital, that there is a high quality of service for children at Temple Street.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the minute that is left to me I would like to mention a few of the various areas where there has been progress over the last 12 months.  Beaumont Hospital was opened, a health promotion unit was set up, Cavan, Mullingar, <Col N="1416" /> Castlebar, St. James's and the Mater Hospitals were either completed in terms of building or of equipment so that they would be ready for service in 1989.</P>

      <P>Services for child sexual abuse were provided in two hospitals. Temple Street and Crumlin and money was allocated to each of the eight health boards.  Legislation in the areas of adoption, of tobacco products and of clinical trials was brought through this House and the Child Care Bill is before the House. The GMS negotiations were brought to the stage where they were balloted on by the IMO.  We anticipated the danger in the Voluntary Health Insurance and took the appropriate action to ensure that the VHI would continue to provide a high level of service to the people.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I would repeat something I have said before to those who say that the health service are in a state of crisis. Last year 500,000 people were treated as in-patients in hospital and 1,500,000 people were treated in hospital as outpatients. That does not include the number of people who were treated by their own general practitioners.  Nor does it include people who attended private hospitals or who attended consultants in their private clinics.  That, for a nation of 3,500,000 people, is proof enough that there is a proper level of good quality service available.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In view of the disruption that will be caused to public viewing and listening choice by the termination of unlicensed radio, and unlicensed television deflector systems long before alternatives are available, that Dáil Éireann urges the Minister for Communications to introduce an amendment to the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, 1988 to permit him discretion in deciding dates after the 31st December, 1988, on which that Act would come into force in respect of unlicensed radio stations and of UHF deflector systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this motion I would like to make it clear that my party will facilitate the Minister in every way possible in passing the appropriate legislation if he agrees to introduce it in this House either tomorrow or before the end of this session.  It is important that we ask <Col N="1419" /> the Government to adopt a commonsense approach in respect of this issue.  We are trying to phase out unlicensed broadcasting operations and all parties in this House recognise the desirability of the period between the closure of the old and the opening of the new being as short as possible.  Indeed, the Minister has repeatedly stated that this is desirable.  It is now clear that the introduction of the licensing system for the distribution of multichannel television signals in rural areas is still a long way off.</P>
      <P>In May of this year the Minister promised the publication of a policy paper in which many of the issues which have been raised in respect of the MMDS system and its feasibility would be assessed in detail but as of yet he has not been able to publish that paper, nor has the Minister been able to publish the regulations which have to be put in place before licences could be issued.  As Deputies are aware those regulations have to be presented before this House within 21 days of their publication when Deputies will have an opportunity to decide whether they are appropriate and whether they should give them their assent.  It is clear that those two issues will take considerable time to deal with. Obviously they are causing problems in the Department because the Minister was quite ebullient in May about his hopes of bringing these before us but we have not seen them yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the lingering health concerns people have expressed about microwaves, be they founded or not, as we have yet to find out from the Minister's policy paper, there is no doubt that equally this will cause problems for planning permission for such a procedure.  I am convinced there will be a very long delay even to get to the position where MMD operators can start installations.  Installation will be a major task as the Minister indicated to the House the scale of coverage of the areas to be dealt with is going to run to about £200 million.  We are talking about a very major investment <Col N="1420" />&mdash; £300 per household to be served and several million pounds in providing the equipment to distribute it.  There is no doubt that the 150,000 people who are going to lose their BBC and ITV television service on 31 December will have to wait for a very long time, probably 18 months at least, before they will have an alternative television system.  If the people affected lived in Kinsealy or Swords I believe we would feel much more intimately what it means.  The Minister must be aware of the grave concern that is growing in the areas affected and we must show due consideration for that concern.</P>
    <P>The is the most important issue which we have to face.  These people have in good faith contributed to a system which provides them with a service which they have a right to expect and the Minister is rightly trying to provide a system which will give a similar service, and in time further channel choice, to people in rural areas.  It is important that an assessment is done and that people are satisfied with the proposal the Minister is making.  It is also important that there is a sensible phase-out from the old to the new system in this area.  The abrupt stopping of the old system on 31 December will do nothing but bring into disrepute what the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>The Minister expressed his hope that some of the 25 proposed licensed radio stations would be in operation by March.  To be honest I do not think that is a realistic hope.  The Minister has to consider what has to be done following 20 January.  A very long schedule will have to be completed before we have <Col N="1421" /> radio broadcasting to replace the unlicensed stations now available.  First, the commission will have to choose suitable candidates and the Minister knows the complexity of the conditions which were laid down.  Very complex criteria were set for selecting applicants from among the now expected 200 or more applications for 25 places.  These applicants will have to be assessed and interviewed separately to see what they have to offer.  Their expertise, experience, the programme quality they are offering and ownership will have to be investigated in great detail under the terms of the Act. The extent of their news coverage, whether they should bear a 20 per cent quota and so on, has to be decided.  This is a very detailed investigation which will have a very important long term bearing on broadcasting choice in this country in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very serious if that was rushed, under the Minister's urging to get things going quickly, in a way that what we in this House so carefully put together on Committee and Second Stages of the Act was not observed adequately.  The Minister knows that the commission have to draw up codes of practice governing fair news coverage, decency, advertising, party political broadcasts and fees and royalties payable by the stations.  None of these things will happen overnight and the commission will need time to put these codes of practice in place so that we will have a service we can stand over. After that the stations will have to obtain a correct location and planning permission which as the Minister knows can take a minimum of two months to get. More likely this permission will take four months and if there are requests for further information or appeals this may take even longer.  The stations will have to get their equipment cut to the frequency they are being allocated and I have been told that the delay in getting this equipment could be up to two months.  There is no way in which the March deadline can be achieved unless the Minister hands a licence to someone who is already in operation.  It is clear that the Minister does not have any great meas on that. <Col N="1422" /> I believe one would be misleading the House to suggest that the March date is realistic.  The reality is that unless the 31st date is modified half of the current radio audience who are listening to unlicensed stations will have no choice for a minimum of six months or perhaps longer because many stations will be starting from scratch.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that there is nothing sacrosanct about 31 December. The Minister changed from a March date to a December date and there is no international obligation, agreement or anything of that sort which suggests that 31 December has any great significance.  In June the House agreed to that date having heard assurances from the Minister about the speed with which he was going to publish assessments on MMDs and regulations about MMDs and the speed with which he was going to appoint the commission and have licensed broadcasters operating before the end of the year, as he told the Seanad.  That has not been realised and naturally problems have arisen along the way.  It would be a pity if the Minister felt so bound by legislation that he could not come back into the House and say it has not been possible to achieve what he assured the House in June he would be able to achieve, and change that date so that he would have discretion to introduce a date of enforcement for this Act in an orderly way and in tandem with the introduction of licensed broadcasting and licensed television distribution systems.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out it has to be borne in mind that it is the Legislature here who failed for a period of ten years &mdash; half of them when Fianna Fáil were in Government and half when Fine Gael were in Government &mdash; to respond to a demand which we all know existed. Unlicensed deflectors and unlicensed radio filled that vacuum and because they have continued largley without official obstruction since then, it would be totally misleading to suggest that they are somehow lawless pariahs who have been feeding off us and should be outcast.  They have provided a service, employed many <Col N="1423" /> talented people and have listeners and supporters in many households up and down the country.</P>
    <P>At the weekend the Minister argued that the extension from 31 December would undermine the credibility of the Government's broadcasting policy.  I say to the Minister that surely the opposite is the case.  The credibility of this legislation will depend on the public's respect for its reasonableness.  If the Minister proceeds to officiously enforce his powers by taking all of these alternatives off the air before there is a substitute for them, all he will succeed in doing is bringing the new law into disrepute.  Obviously non-enforcement of the law would be wrong and that is why we are asking the Minister to do the sensible thing and change by way of a simple amendment the enforcement date which has put him into a straitjacket and from which he should release himself. As I said we will be happy to facilitate the passage of an amending Bill if the Minister introduces it.  If the Minister is not going to accept this motion he should make it clear to the House whether he is going to proceed to use his powers and issue notices which will deprive all of these operations of electricity, telephones and so on, close them down and leave many people without a choice.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;change the date of the enforcement of the regulations from 31 December to whatever accommodating date he can find.  It is interesting that it was Deputy Lawlor who interrupted me. The problems posed by the implementation of this legislation will be at their worst in the west.  There will be a shut down from Donegal to Kerry.  In my area notice has been issued to close down on 17 December.  During the term of office of the previous Government we had experience of a shutdown in Limerick and the ensuring repercussions.  In asking <Col N="1424" /> the Minister to extend the date I am not asking for something extraordinary.  Our motion really compliments the Government on their efficiency in bringing in this legislation but there does not appear to be time to bring forward the regulations and get the details sorted out, prior to the closedown of illegal operators, which would enable the continuation of the facilities which exist.</P>
      <P>I speak for the west because these changes will affect us most of all.  The deflector system in our area is used to bring BBC, Channel 4 and UTV to the most remote areas.  It is of benefit to the west economically because visitors to an isolated area can have the choice of six channels.  The Minister has indicated that the new MMDS system will be introduced and in view of the constraints which he indicated are to be put on it, it will be some time before all the details are resolved.  During a debate in this House on 27 May last the Minister made a solemn promise.  He stated:</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that I have noted their points and I will put together a properly documented case answering the various points.</P>
      <P>He has not even done that for the trade. In our constituency it will cost at least £750,000 to set up a station to look after the western area.  The Minister of State who is present is a native of Galway and he knows that the area along the western coast is very hilly.  The MMDS system is only of benefit on the flat.</P>
      <P>The Minister should listen not only to this side of the House but also to Fianna Fáil Deputies.  If there is the loss of these three channels over the Christmas period the heat will be a lot greater than the Government are experiencing on the rod licence issue.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to set a reasonable date.  The date proposed &mdash; 31 December &mdash; is not reasonable.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Bruton on bringing this matter before the House.  I will confine my remarks largely to local radio as it affects Dublin.  My <Col N="1425" /> colleagues will be dealing with the situation in the west and in other parts of the country.  It is proposed under this legislation to implement before the end of the year the licensing and regularisation of local radio.  This is to be welcomed and we would be broadly supportive of the general Government line on it.  However, to proceed with the regulatory or repressive side without allowing for licensed radio to get under way would be very detrimental.  It is symptomatic of the attitude that pirate radio operators are inherently lawless.  They are essentially people who developed an area in advance of legislation.  Many Governments must take the responsibility for our slowness in responding and regulating matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation did not relate to this era.  Local independent radio is a welcome and exciting development which is growing enormously.  The idea that people involved in it are essentially lawless is absolutely ludicrous and is not borne out by the way in which the public perceive them or the way in which many of them handle themselves, with some frightful exceptions.  There are always exceptions in every walk of life. They provide a very valuable service for this city.  They are popular and well liked. They provided an access for classes of people who by and large did not find their accents and interests represented on the national airwaves at that time.  RTE have in this respect followed independent radio.  Radio was made accessible as a profession and occupation to many more people.  These stations have provided employment.  There are people who have been working for perhaps five years in local independent radio and have taken out mortgages.  Some of them who are constituents of mine have been in touch with me and they are applying for jobs in Britain because they have been given protective notice and are due to end their work by 31 December.  They are facing a very unsettling Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> In Britain there is an extraordinary development of local radio.  Sixteen new satellite channels are coming on stream which are capable of beaming into Ireland at a time when our airwaves will be silent.  There will be no outlet for Irish talent or independent radio activity and these new channels will develop markets and audiences which it will be very hard to win back when we eventually license our own people.  It is extremely important that there should be a smooth transition and that the timescale should be as tight as possible in order to maintain employment and keep talent in the country.  If they were assured that there would be at most a gap of two months, most people would stay in the country and await the outcome, despite the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>What is the situation at present?  The Minister broke his silence at the week-end, three weeks before the implementation of the regulations.  We have not heard a word about timescales until this motion was put down.  It obviously gave the Minister a kick in the pants and the impetus to set a timescale and make a statement.  I believe statements are on record from members of the broadcasting commission that the likely date for the issue of licences would be the end of next year.  The Minister indicated at the weekend that it would be in about six weeks' time.  Perhaps even that is not a desirable development.  We do not want a hiatus between the closing down and the opening afterwards, but also we do not want the commission making hasty decisions about the issuing of licences which will be vitally important for the quality of the service on offer.  It is not desirable that the Minister should put pressure on the commission to move faster than it is wise for them to go.  In that event we would have rushed and unsatisfactory decisions.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons it would be wise for the Minister to pause and consider taking the kind of action proposed here. The attitude in the Department towards illegal radio has always been hostile.  I can understand that, but the Minister should be able to stand up and insist on <Col N="1427" /> a proper balance.  We have a responsibility in that it has taken us as a Legislature such a long time to organise for independent radio and we should try to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible.  We are not talking about an activity which in its essence is illegal. It is only illegal because we have not provided a legal framework within which these stations can operate.  The public enjoy listening to these stations and we should not penalise them for periods that might extend to six, seven, eight or nine months.  British and European channels will be beaming in increasingly over the next 12 months while we are denying our own industry an opportunity to compete on an equal footing.  I hope the Minister will support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion I do not want to promote illegal radio or television stations.  The general overall legislation will work provided sufficient time is given for reputable interest groups to get themselves organised.  This is the main thrust of our motion.  There is an unhelpful attitude towards isolated rural communities along the west coast. Surely a system can be devised to allow screening of the programmes until a technical solution has been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer specifically to local radio and how the legislation will affect local communities.  Firstly, local radio operations provide very necessary jobs along the west coast which is devastated by unemployment and emigration.  For example, in one station in Killarney over 15 people are employed and pay full PRSI and other necessary contributions. Unlike our national airwaves, these stations provide very cheap advertising for the showband business and give a sufficient amount of air time to local show-bands and people who make records.  The closure of those stations will have a damaging effect on the showband business and on the sale of records which are recorded by Irish artists.  Those people are very concerned about the closure of the stations. I am surprised that people within the Fianna Fáil Party who have a vested <Col N="1428" /> interest in this business are not shouting more about it.  If the boot was on the other foot they would be kicking hard.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the House that local radio stations provide a very essential service for old people in isolated rural areas.  I am very familiar with this aspect in Kerry.  I know a number of families who have been devastated by emigration and the only comfort the parents have is listening to the local radio station.  They feel that national radio, which devotes much of its air time to Dublin, the midlands and the east coast, is remote from them.  They look to the local radio station to provide them with entertainment and local news.  It also provides a very essential service for the sick and for old people who live in remote areas.  People who are confined to their houses will not be able to do without this very essential service.  A major aspect of my argument is that old people and rural communities will suffer most from the closure of these stations.  I admit that they are illegal but when they are taken off the air there will be a void that will not be filled for a long period, possibly six to nine months.  I appeal to the Minister to consider extending the date for their closure.  As indicated in the arguments already made by Deputies Carey, Bruton and Flaherty, this is possible within the legislative framework.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The western dialect is being expressed very clearly here tonight. We are talking about two matters in regard to this issue, first, local radio and, secondly, the deflector television system. Many people listen to local radio stations. The one that is applicable to the area in which I live is Radio West.  Many people will be very unhappy when that station is put off the air at midnight on 31 December. It would not be too bad if a guarantee was given that within a very short time some other system would be provided but so far as I can gather this will take some time.  When we are told by the Department &mdash; I have a certain amount of experience in that area &mdash; that something will be done within a month, two months or three months, we can be sure that it <Col N="1429" /> will not be done until much later.  I would say to the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, that it is necessary to make some amendment to the Act to allow these stations remain in operation until such a time as they are replaced with the proposed new stations.  People do not want to have to wait a long time between the closure of these stations and the setting up of the new stations.</P>
      <P>I am most interested in the television system known as the VHF deflector system, which is in operation in the west at present.  That system is transmitted to homes along the western seaboard from a transmitter on a high hill.  It costs £15 a year plus a small amount for a special type of aerial.  Many people do not fully appreciate the service they are getting under this system.  The people who live in the Dublin area and on the eastern coast receive RTE 1, RTE 2, BBC I, BBC 2, UTV and Channel Four without having to have any additional equipment on their homes.  The English channels are beamed directly from Britain and there is no problem.  The problem arises in my area and in many other areas.  In my area the service is transmitted from Mount Mary, near Creggs in Glenamaddy, by a man called Joe O'Neill.  That service is also transmitted to the Mayo area and down as far as Gort where one of the Ministers of State resides.  That Minister receives that illegal service, as does another Minister of State who is here tonight, Deputy Treacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said the pirate stations must close on 31 December but that the VHF system can remain in operation. That is not good enough.  The legislation that was passed by this House imposes very heavy fines on the people concerned. Those people cannot take the chance of operating the system after the appointed date because firstly, the owner of the land in question can be prosecuted; secondly, the suppliers of the power, the ESB, can be fined and, thirdly, the person who operates the system can be fined.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he will turn a blind eye to that matter. There are very few Members of this House who could talk with authority on <Col N="1430" /> the subject.  Indeed I cannot accept the limited education I received from the people who operate the system.  What is proposed is the introduction of a system known as the MMDS, that is the multipoint microwave distribution system. There is no guarantee that people living in rural areas will ever benefit from that system.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that more of us did not contribute to the relevant legislation in the course of its passage through this House.  I see the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Brennan, listening to me attentively.  It is my hope that he and his colleagues will react to what I am saying.  I know that the Minister of State spends some of his vacations in the west. The present recipients of this illegal system will not be recipients when the Minister of State goes there next year, when possibly he will have to answer some questions.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State can make a laugh of it if he wishes but there are many people in those rural areas who will not make a laugh of it.  I have five children who love to watch this or that programme.  Much as we may despise the British for a number of things they do it has to be said that they transmit some very interesting programmes one might like to view occasionally.  Therefore it is necessary that we in the west have the same access to television programmes as those people living in the Dublin area, or within the Pale, to use a much bandied phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For general information purposes I should add that the new system involves an investment of at least £300 per household in addition to other charges of <Col N="1431" /> approximately £100 annually.  It is possible that the motion tabled by Deputy Richard Bruton here this evening will be passed.  There was also the motion with regard to Barrington's Hospital in Limerick which was successful.  Yet there was no action taken in regard to that matter. I remember also a few years ago controversy about an industry in Kilkenny, the Greenhills towel factory, when the Government got a kick in the pants but when no action was taken either.  In this case there will be considerable public reaction unless the relevant Act is amended to allow some operators carry on, as some of them will do indefinitely because the signal can never be replaced in some cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the motion before the House.  There has been a tendency in this House over the years to introduce and pass laws that cannot be implemented.  I think immediately of the rod licensing laws, litter laws, laws relating to dog licences and so on.  A point in favour of the Minister for Communications &mdash; who did not come down in the the last shower &mdash; is that he was able to introduce the legislation which the Fine Gael Party, when in Government, were unable to do for a variety of reasons. Points against the Minister are that he introduced no assessment in respect of the MMDS system; nor did he introduce any regulations which should be laid before this house for 21 days; there was a four months delay before he appointed the commission to deal with radio stations and he has accepted applications for licences in respect of television transmissions without the regulations having been laid before the House for 21 days, as is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be fear of the law that will knock out the deflector systems and local radio at the end fo December.  Those who took the initiative, had the motivation and interest to provide a service which the State was unable to provide for many years, will now be liable to £10,000 fine or two years in jail.  This means they will not continue their operations on account <Col N="1432" /> of that fear after 31 December.  As has been pointed out, there are penalties for secondary offences in respect of those who supply access, power or whatever.</P>
    <P>Local radio on the west coast from Malin Head to Cork has provided a valuable service, local news, information and so on and can be beefed up from a balanced point of view.  I accept that the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> radio is not as serious as that pertaining to the deflectors because the commission are considering applications.  For example, there are three applications from County Mayo which should not take long to decide. Mayo County Council passed a unanimous resolution &mdash; that is, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members &mdash; six months ago against the MMDS system being introduced at all.  Last evening 500 people attended a public meeting in Kiltimagh. It is one of the contradictions of Irish life that many of those people, for instance vehemently opposed to extradition and all that Mrs. Thatcher and her Government stand for, would say to one: whatever you do, keep the BBC service coming into our houses because it is a valuable service and we appreciate it. Fianna Fáil should show some commonsense in this regard.  The Minister should take cognisance of the comments of Ministers and Deputies along the western seaboard because the public are speaking to them in relation to this important matter.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Communications has had extensive experience in politics.  Some years ago he pulled a stroke in Wheatfield when he produced instant trees.  He cannot produce instant satellite coverage or radio signals.  In terms of the popularity of his party, which is quite high at present, I would advise him to seriously consider extending the remit of these operations until some time as an alternative becomes available.  A 75-year old man in Blacksod, the next parish to New York, said to me, through a fog of pipe smoke: I like to watch snooker on the BBC; whatever you do do not put an end to that.  It must be remembered that one-third of the people in that area are over the age of 65.  If this little comfort is <Col N="1433" /> to be taken from them, then it will be seen to be discriminatory.  I would ask that Fianna Fáil look at this from a commonsense point of view and extend the relevant date until such time as an alternative becomes available, when the agrument about the MMDS being the be-all of systems will no longer obtain.  If there is not such an extension granted then I foresee a great deal of controversy.  The issue is simple so far as rural people are concerned, that is that if one depresses the button on a television set and it does not work, there is something wrong.  In this case if their screens are blank they will take it to mean that the Government have withdrawn that service.  That is how they will view it.  They do not understand the technical arguments of distribution systems, of microwave, wavelength allocations or whatever.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take cognisance of the fact that 180,000 households are at present benefiting from this very valuable service and I would ask that it be extended.</P>

In so doing he was tackling a problem that had been allowed fester over a ten year period, indeed one which successive Governments had failed to tackle, or had been unwilling to tackle, as was the case with the Coalition Government because of the political divisions within that Government on that issue.

I refer to the pirate radio stations who for ten years amassed significant financial gains.  There was simultaneously a genuine group of people who refused to get into broadcasting because, in so doing, they would be in breach of the law; because of their respect for that law, they remained aloof even though they had the capacity and capability to operate such radio stations.  Because a situation has been allowed to proceed for ten years, a niche in the market has developed and these stations attracted a younger audience which were not being catered for.  When it became obvious that the law was unenforceable the only rational thing to do was to change it.  This minority Government came to office and grasped the nettle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When addressing the NIHE Conference last Saturday the Minister when discussing the future of broadcasting confirmed that there would be no extension of the end of year deadline for pirate stations.  I laud that decision.  To grant an extension would undermine the credibility of the Government in what they are setting out to do.  It was fitting that the Minister at that conference warned pirates that any pirate operating after that date would automatically be barred from getting a franchise.  Coupled with this resolve is a promise that some of the legal stations will be on the air by the end of March.  The gap in service being provided is not inordinate.  While the pressure from illegal stations is understandable it begs the question &mdash; should we once again allow ourselves to crumble under pressure from pirate radio stations?</P>

Because of the time constraints, the stations obviously found it extremely difficult to be viable.  By closing down the pirate stations at the end of December, Cork local radio station is being given an opportunity to gain some advantage in advertising revenue.  By extending their hours of broadcasting, the large audience that they have had up to now will also be extended.  That is a very significant development for Cork.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I briefly suggest with regard to local radio in the capital city that the chaos and risks that have existed for the past number of years are quite unacceptable and intolerable.  It had reached the stage in parts of my constituency that some of the emergency services were in danger.  Ambulance short wave services and other very essential telecommunications networks, such as those of the Garda authorities, were all at certain times having some problem with their networks because of totally uncontrolled and illegal broadcasting.  Some order was urgently necessary.  To be fair to Deputy Bruton, recently on radio he <Col N="1440" /> discussed this matter of a Private Members' motion and accepted fully that his party in government with the Labour Party just could not get agreement, despite how desirable it was that some progress should be made on this issue. We have now put legislation through. Is there anything more beneficial to an urgent debate than having a deadline of 1 January?  The allocation of licences, the matter of the commission, those who are interested in applying for licences, the whole range of people who will be involved from January 1 had better get moving and get moving very quickly and efficiently.</P>

I have heard Deputies Carey and Donnellan on this and Deputy Jim Higgins pointed out that there is no doubt in his mind and his colleague from East Mayo will be making a very strong case to the Minister, based on the situation down there and on the threat of lack of service from 1 January.  Would it not have been more prudent for the Fine Gael party to have come into the House in the month of January or February if they see no decisive action being taken and nothing being done?  They could then put this business on the agenda for debate in this House.  Why come in and pre-empt the situation and let it be imagined that there is some acceptability for the mishmash and chaos that have occurred on the local airwaves and in the TV service to the west coast?  If defies logic, they have muddled and fuddled and failed miserably for four years, arguing among themselves, having actually introduced a Bill and run away from its getting a Second Reading. They were concerned that it might lead to the downfall of the previous Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Wireless and Telegraphy Act 1988&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) to permit him to grant a provisional sound broadcasting licence to any person or body presently providing an unlicensed radio service and who made a submission to the Independent Radio and Television Commission in accordance with requirements of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 prior to the 21st November last;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) to permit him to grant a provisional licence to unlicensed television <Col N="1447" /> UHF deflector systems presently transmitting TV signals from channels other than RTE.</P>
    <P>Such provisional licences to be granted where it can be shown that no interference will be caused to signals from legal systems and where the operator complies with all other existing requirements of the Broadcasting Acts, such licences to remain in force until licences presently provided for in the Broadcasting and Wirless Telegraphy Act, 1988 and the Television and Radio Act, 1988, are issued by the Minister for Communications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to bring about a situation whereby there can be an extension of the requirements on a legal basis.  One of my criticisms of the Fine Gael motion is that it is not just a question of extending the date beyond 31 December because, as we know, all broadcasting services operated by stations other than RTE are illegal.  The only thing that changes at the end of the year is that the penalties will be greatly increased and it is expected that that will drive the legal operators off the airwaves.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the Sound Broadcasting Bill late last year, which was subsequently reintroduced as the Radio and Television Bill, he pointed out the difficulties successive Governments had in getting illegal broadcasters off the air because there was no alternative legal system available to them.  In introducing the Radio and Television Bill he said it was a means whereby we could have an orderly winding down of the illegal system and the coming on stream of new, legal services.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of tonight's debate is to underline the fact that after 31 December, if the Minister holds the line he has been following of late &mdash; indeed, he seems to have backed himself into a cul-de-sac on this issue &mdash; there will not be any alternatives because it is impossible, as previous speakers have pointed out, to bring on stream licensed, legal radio services within a short time.  There will be a major gap in a market which <Col N="1448" /> is, undoubtedly, a very big market.  The illegal stations would not have existed for the past ten years if there had not been a demand for the alternative choices they provide.  It is totally undesirable &mdash; and unacceptable &mdash; that a long gap should be allowed to exist between the end of the year and the coming on stream of the new station.  The Minister, prompted by the motion put down by Deputy Bruton, seemed to act fairly hastily in announcing that 25 new local radio stations would be advertised, as they were today, and that applications would be made as a result of that advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £19,400,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>There are a number of items covered in the net £19.4 million being sought in this Supplementary Estimate.  The extra funds required stem from greater demands for the payment of private housing grants and malicious injury recoupment claims from local authorities than was anticipated when the 1988 Estimates were prepared in 1987.  The gross extra amount sought is £26.514 million but this is offset by increased receipts and savings on the grant to the Housing Finance Agency and some non-voted Exchequer capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original provision for new house grants in 1988 was £17 million.  This amount was intended to cover payments <Col N="1449" /> of the £2,000 new house grant for first time house purchasers and the £2,250 new house grant which was terminated in the March 1987 budget.  The extra £4 million is required to enable additional new house grants maturing for payment this year to be paid within the year and thereby avoid any possible hardship for applicants which might otherwise arise from the carry over of payments into 1989.  The additional demand is accounted for mainly by an upsurge in new house grant applications related to the termination of the £2,250 new house grant.  The number of applications for the £2,250 grant was 6,595 while the number of grants approved was 5,166 with a value of £11.6 million.  This grant will, in fact, account for about £5.7 million of the total expenditure on new house grants this year.  A balance of £5.6 million approximately in outstanding approvals of the £2,250 grant will fall due for payment next year.</P>
    <P>Three thousand three hundred applications for the £2,000 new house grant for first time purchasers have been received this year to date while anticipated expenditure on this grant will amount to about £15.3 million in 1988.  Much of this expenditure relates to grants which were approved in previous years but did not mature for payment until this year.</P>
    <P>When the Government terminated the 1985 house improvement grant scheme in the 1987 budget, commitments totalling £260 million approximately had been incurred under the scheme.  It is difficult with an open-ended grant scheme of this magnitude to predict accurately the requirements which will arise in the following year.  When the 1988 Estimate was decided on, it was expected that the full 1987 allocation of £100 million for the house improvement grant scheme would be paid in 1987.  However, the actual outturn at £87 million turned out to be lower than anticipated.  As the general economic climate began to improve, more of the grant approvals began to be taken up.  As a result, an extra £10 million for house improvement grants is required this year.  The extra money will enable grants to be paid in 1988 to about 3,000 <Col N="1450" /> applicants who would otherwise have had to wait until 1989 for payment.  Expenditure under the 1985 house improvement grant scheme will, by the end of the year, amount to some £160 million.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the area of malicious injuries.  My Department recoup to local authorities expenditure incurred by them on malicious injury awards.  In 1987, £19.6 million was recouped to local authorities and this Supplementary Estimate brings this year's provision to £28.75 million, representing an increase of over £9 million on 1987.</P>
    <P>Deputies must be wondering why such a large amount is required this year, especially in view of the 1986 amending legislation.  In order to explain this position I will outline briefly the background to malicious injuries recoupment.  Due to the rising cost of malicious injuries to local authorities, a non-statutory arrangement was introduced in 1974 to put a ceiling on ratepayers' liability.  The scheme provided that, if the cost of compensation to a local authority in any financial year exceeded the product of a rate of 20 pence in the £, the excess was recouped to the local authority from the Exchequer.  This scheme was given a statutory basis by the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981.  The 1981 Act was subsequently amended by the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Act, 1986, the effect of which was to limit the scope for malicious damage claims to instances caused &mdash; (i) by riot; (ii) by malicious act of an unlawful organisation; and (iii) by malicious act of an organisation outside the State engaged in advocating violence for purposes relating to the State or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the 1986 legislation the entire cost of claims is recouped to local authorities as well as their legal costs.  In 1987 a sum of £2.35 million was paid to Donegal County Council for incidents at Ballybofey and Letterkenny.  Expenditure on claims under the 1986 Act in 1988 amounts to nearly £400,000 and the number of claims pending against local authorities is relatively small.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, when introducing the Second Stage of the <Col N="1451" /> Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, 1986, in June 1986 foresaw that &ldquo;the full extent of the savings to the Exchequer resulting from the enactment of this legislation will not become apparent for a year or two&rdquo;.  This prediction was correct.</P>
    <P>Individual claims for compensation against the local authority must be made within 14 days of the incident.  Experience has shown that a considerable time elapses before a claim is either settled or determined by the courts.  Equally, many claims are lodged as a matter of course and never pursued by the claimants.  The initiative in pursuing a claim rests with the claimant and proceedings may be commenced at any time within three years of the incident.  This is the main reason expenditure on malicious injury recoupment is still so high even after the enactment of the 1986 legislation.</P>
    <P>It has always been difficult to estimate in advance each year the expenditure requirement for malicious injuries and this year is no exception.  The biggest difficulty is in trying to anticipate in advance the level of claim payments and to take account, if possible, of any large individual claims that may be finalised in the coming year.  An example of this in 1988 is the settlement of one claim for the burning of a church premises which will cost in excess of £3 million when all costs are included.  If the local authority fail to pay claims as soon as they are determined or registered in the court, interest can accrue to the claimant until payment is made.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will meet all recoupment demands arising to the end of the year and I feel reasonably confident at this stage that the requirement for 1989 will diminish considerably.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate includes a provision of £14,000 to meet the general expenses of the National Roads Authority in 1988.  These expenses comprise travelling and subsistence allowances and the annual allowances for the chairman and certain members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The launching of the new Authority in July this year marked a departure in road development in Ireland.  For the first time <Col N="1452" /> we have a single Authority with functions in relation to the improvement and maintenance of national roads and access roads to our principal ports and airports.</P>
    <P>When I launched the Authority last July, I indicated that they would operate initially on a non-statutory basis and that legislation would be required in due course to establish the Authority on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned when opening the debate, the extra expenditure detailed in the Supplementary Estimate is somewhat offset by, <i>inter alia,</i> additional receipts from the EC in 1988.  These receipts comprise recoupment by the European Communities under the FEOGA Western Package of a portion of State expenditure on a national programme to stimulate agricultural development in the west of Ireland.  In March 1988 the European Council concluded a review of the western package with a decision to increase, from 1 January 1988, the amount of EC aid available, the region qualifying for EC aid and the proportion of expenditure recoupable under the FEOGA Western Package.  This enable Ireland to apply for a higher amount of EC recoupment than previously anticipated, with the result that £1.837 million more than estimated was paid into my Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>The net Supplementary Estimate is further reduced by savings of £5.277 million on the £11 million grant provision for the Housing Finance Agency.  This grant assists the agency in matching the cost of funds raised by conventional borrowing with the return from income-related repayments by borrowers.  The savings have been made possible by the reduction in interest rates and favourable exchange rate trends brought about by Government policy, and the increasing capacity of the agency to fund loans from capital repayments by borrowers.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to refer to the motion which I will be moving later in relation to the 1986 Excess Vote.  The need for this Excess Vote arises from the ESB's failure to pay the full £24 million determined by the Government as their contribution in lieu of rates for 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> The ESB are statutorily obliged under section 7 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1982, to pay to the Minister for the Environment a sum in lieu of rates as determined by the Government each year.  That sum could not exceed the amount which, in the Government's opinion, the ESB would pay in respect of the ESB generating and distribution network but for the fact that such property was technically exempt under the ESB Acts.  The ESB contested the size of the annual amounts demanded.  The situation came to a head in 1986 when, despite considerable efforts at both departmental and ministerial level, the ESB paid only £8 million of the £24 million deemed due for that year and decided to initiate legal action for the refund with interest of what the board regarded as overpayments in respect of the years 1983 to 1985.</P>
    <P>Inevitably this gave rise to an excess on the 1986 Environment Vote.</P>
    <P>This issue was addressed and solved within one week of the Government taking office in 1987.  My colleague, the then Minister for Energy, had discussions with the ESB and indicated that legislation in the pipeline could include a provision to remove any doubt about the requirement of the ESB to pay the amounts demanded.  The ESB immediately paid over the £16 million outstanding. Deputies will recall that the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1988, confirmed the validity of the payments made since 1982 and provided for the imposition of full rates liability on the ESB.  This actual rates liability will arise in 1989 when rates will be levied by individual local authorities on ESB valuations, determined by the Commissioner for Valuation under the provisions of the Valuation Act, 1988.  This Act provides for the global valuation of public utilities and for the apportionment of the global valuation between the rating authorities. Thus the payment by the ESB of a single sum to my Department will not arise from 1989 onwards.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the Supplementary Estimate, on the matters I have raised, and <Col N="1454" /> on the 1986 Excess Vote.  I will take note of any points raised and, in so far as it is possible, reply to them at the end of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Estimates and, in particular, to discuss some of the issues raised by the Minister.  I would also like to refer briefly to one or two matters which have not been referred to in the Estimate and which would have been expected to have been contained in them.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that when the National Roads Authority was established by the Minister, he stated that he wished the Authority to make submissions to him by September on the draft blueprint for road development.  Indeed on that occasion, when announcing the names of members and welcoming them to the first meeting of the Authority, the Minister said that the Government had already approved publication of the blueprint, subject to some consultation with the Authority and that he planned to publish it in the autumn.  The Minister stated that the blueprint to be published was to provide the policy and planning framework for our road network for the next 20 years. It was to contain a comprehensive statement of the main policy issues affecting road development and set out an assessment of the medium to long term needs for the entire road network, national, regional, county and urban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we head into the last week of this Dáil session before the Christmas recess, it is noteworthy that the autumn has long since past and the winter has arrived. The Minister still has not published the blueprint for the national road network and despite having asked the members of the National Roads Authority to make a very urgent and immediate comment to him on the draft blueprint, we still have not seen what the Minister intends to <Col N="1455" /> publish.  It is particularly appalling that this is not published in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has stated that it is this Minister's responsibility to put together the infrastructural proposals &mdash; which presumably by and large mean the road network proposals which will be the base for this country's application to the European Structural Fund for funding for roads.  I find it odd that the Minister when referring to the provisions to meet the general expenses of the National Roads Authority makes no mention of when this blueprint will be published and made available.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of urgency that we publish the blueprint.  Everybody on all sides of the House wishes to know the Department's plans for our road network, both in the context of the national primary routes and other roads, in particular county roads.  At present, the local authorities have a major problem due to the cut in the rate support grant and due to the lack of adequate provisions to maintain county roads.  In various parts of the country they are facing a major crisis and tertiary roads &mdash; roads that are regarded as minor roads from the perspective of the Department of the Environment but are of considerable importance to the local communities which they were originally designed to serve &mdash; are effectively breaking up all over the country.  Having visited many parts of the country in recent weeks to examine our road network, I think portions of our county roads could be best described as a lunar landscape. It is extraordinary that more lives have not been lost on our roads, due to the collapse of our county road network, than have been lost to date.  This is a matter of considerable concern.  The lack of an adequate county road structure is going to impact on the lesser developed parts of the country that require good road networks both for industrial and agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very false economy to provide inadequate funding for the maintenance of county roads.  Apart from the possible cost in terms of human life, the financial cost that local authorities will <Col N="1456" /> have to bear in future for accidents resulting from roads that are grossly inadequate, will in the long term far outweigh the actual cost of maintaining our roads in a proper condition.  I am surprised that in his reference to the National Roads Authority, the Minister gave no explanation as to why the blueprint, which was promised to be published in the autumn, has not yet seen the light of day, and there is no indication that it will see the light of day this side of Christmas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate when this blueprint will be published.  When the National Roads Authority were established, the Minister said he was going to allow them some months to see how they worked before putting them on a statutory footing.  I would like him now to tell us when he intends to put that body on a statutory basis, when he intends to bring the necessary legislation before this House and map out the powers of the National Roads Authority and how in legislative terms they are to interact with local authorities throughout the country. Again the Minister just says blandly that at some future time he will be bringing before the House the relevant legislation, but there is no sign of it.</P>
    <P>The Estimate deals with providing funds for grants for House purchases and improvement grants some of which have now been abolished by this Government. It would be remiss not to put on the record of the House that at present a major housing crisis is developing in particular in the public sector in that during the year 1989 it is projected there will be fewer than 1,000 new houses completed by local authorities.  The housing lists we saw growing in the seventies to crisis proportions by 1981 are growing again, and local authorities throughout the length and breadth of this country are being deprived of funding they require to enable them to meet basic housing needs and comply with their statutory obligations under the Housing Acts to provide adequate housing for those who cannot afford to provide it for themselves. The Minister has indicated in this House previously that he does not believe we have a housing crisis.  I ask him to <Col N="1457" /> look at reports produced by a variety of organisations such as Threshold, Focus Point and others who are mapping out clearly from a non-political perspective &mdash; they have no political axe to grind &mdash; that we have a growing housing crisis which needs to be confronted.</P>
    <P>One item, surprisingly, is not referred to in the Estimate and one would have expected that it would be here.  I was looking forward to this evening's debate to welcome the Minister taking action in this area and I am disappointed to see now that no action has been taken.  I recollect the Minister some six weeks ago flying over the Munster area, looking down on the flood waters of Cork city and county and telling the people in Cork he would provide the necessary funding to help to defray the cost of damage done by the flood waters.  He assured us in the House a couple of weeks ago that that was not a public relations exercise, that it was an exercise with serious intent and, indeed, that finance would be provided to meet the needs in the area and make good the damage caused by the flood waters in Cork.</P>
    <P>Indeed, over different parts of the Munster region very real damage was done not just in the context of damage suffered by individual householders or businesses.  Due to the flooding in the Cork region a road network which was already collapsing has been further damaged. There is an urgent need for funding to be provided to the local authorities in the Munster area to make good the damage caused by the flood waters some weeks ago.  It is a great disappointment that the Minister who saw fit to fly over the area and look at the flood waters has nothing to say in this Estimate to the people of Cork who were affected by the flooding and has provided no funding for them.</P>
    <P>This is a brief Estimate debate.  A great deal more could be said.  I do not want to go on at length.  I want to give my colleague an opportunity to come in.  I would like to refer very briefly to two other issues.  The Minister referred to the western package and EC funds we have.  I would like to ask one brief question.  On <Col N="1458" /> a number of occasions in this House the issue has been raised of the Structural Funds we are seeking from Europe next year, the way in which plans are being put together for the seven designated regions and the fact that the ultimate plans for each of these regions must be submitted to Brussels by 31 March 1989.  Will the Minister or the Government be bringing before the House in draft form the plans that are being put together for the seven designated regions for debate and discussion in this House and, if necessary, for amendment by this House prior to those plans going to Brussels in March 1989?  Will the consultant's report which is being commissioned at tremendous cost &mdash; I understand some £300,000 &mdash; to deal with the Dublin region be published and will it be available for debate and discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister devoted at least 20 per cent of his speech on this Estimate to the ESB and the way in which this Government dealt with that issue. The £24 million it is proposed to raise is in my view a hidden tax which he did not indicate to the public prior to the last election, and he is passing it on.  My problem comes from my constituency.  The Minister did not say in his speech that, while the ESB are now to be levied with rates, and have been valued, the money will be collected by Clare County Council and the Minister in his wisdom will deduct the same amount from the grants being paid by the Government to Clare County Council.  In effect, the local authority will have nothing despite the huge development, the hardships suffered by the people of Clare and the problems which have arisen because of the huge lines that went over our county.  Despite all these <Col N="1459" /> problems the Minister is going to grab everything.  That is no encouragement to local authorities.  If you want to have any confidence in the members of local authorities you must at least give them the opportunity to spend the rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very active in promoting a property tax.  How does he think he is going to get the support of the Clare colleagues who are looking at it, as Deputy Shatter looked at it, as a lunar surface pockmarked with potholes from the southern end to the western end?  The Minister is trying to do a PR exercise here, to give people the impression that local county councils have plenty of money, that they are not getting value for money he is giving them, when in Clare County Council alone there were 53 redundancies of road workers.  That prevented even the ordinary drains at the side of the road being opened and led to further deterioration in the quality of the roads.</P>
      <P>The only other thing I want to mention is the great disappointment in my town of Ennis at the lack of initiative by the Minister in applying the Urban Renewal Act.  He said nothing about that in his speech.  We in Ennis have shown the Minister of State that we have investors prepared to invest up to £1 million in the Parnell Street site and the Minister refuses to designate it.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is about the Department of the Environment.  The Minister's speech is not truly about the environment in the broadest sense of the word.  To a large extent it is dominated by what I would see as tidying up areas of economics on the fringes of the built environment, but I hoped that most of our time in here would be spent on the key issues which seem to me to be not the accountancy side of the new house grants or house improvement grants, which in a sense are the kind of give and take one expects in annual expenditures in this area, and the speech is fairly typical from that point of view.  I hoped we would have heard a little from the Minister on what I would call the green environment <Col N="1460" /> and there is not one word in his speech about that.</P>
      <P>It is not that the Minister does not need to seek more resources in that regard if recent answers of his in his House are anything to go by.  In the last couple of weeks the Minister was in a position to tell the House, in the area of dumping of toxic waste, that his Department did not have a list of sites in respect of which landfilled dumping was at present taking place.  The process of dumping which is euphemistically called landfill basically means dumping on sites around the country, a practice which is banned in other enlightened countries. Those are the kind of issues that are the heart of the Environment Estimate, and not some of the fringe and fairly typical tidying up of peripheral economic details with regard to the expenditures in certain areas, like house improvement grants, which are neither here nor there in the medium to long term but which are the natural outgrowth of the inability of anybody to predict exactly how much expenditure will occur in one year or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that there is not even a paragraph or two at the very least about the area, the true area, the green environment about which I think this House is concerned and about which the people are increasingly concerned because they believe that right around the country under a variety of headings we are gradually witnessing an environment that is in crisis whether that be because of the difficulties of air pollution and smog in city areas, the difficulty of effluent into the rivers and streams, the issue of toxic wastes being dumped at uncontrolled and apparently uncontrollable and unlisted sites, the illegal incineration of toxic waste around the country, the questions which arise in relation to incineration at sea which I gather is to some extent controlled, or any of the other myriad of assaults on the environment.  Those are the things we would like to hear a bit more about.  I would suggest respectfully that when the Minister comes in here the next time to talk about the environment that he might <Col N="1461" /> address some of those points because they are the key points.  I do not think some of the stuff that is in the Minister's speech this evening is <i>apropos.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a specific question.  I know that he and Members on all sides of the House are increasingly concerned about this area of the green environment.  I wonder if he will consider the establishment of an all-party Dáil committee to discuss environmental issues.  I was very taken by the fact that in our Question Time session here a couple of weeks ago no time could be afforded to some of these very important issues.  I felt that the Minister had a great deal to say about it and certainly I had.  I am sure Deputies Shatter, Kavanagh, Sherlock and others who are here, and my colleagues on the far benches there, would agree that if we had the chance to discuss some of the issues, which are in some cases somewhat technical and in other cases need insight into international experience, that might be best done by a committee of the House. We have established committees in regard to other areas which at least could not be argued to be any more important and, in some respects, might be said to be a lot less important than the fundamental question of the environment because if that is not correct, if the quality of our environment is not right, then all other issues pale into insignificance.  I am suggesting that the Minister might consider establishing a committee of the House on the environment.  Like any spokesman in this issue, I have been doing my own research and I have found that there is a very substantial volume of experience internationally which is available to us. As a small island country off an island country off the coast of Europe we have some advantages.  In commercial terms we have a market edge and in environmental terms we should have an edge as well and we are eroding that very rapidly. Some of the reasons are inadequate legislation, inadequate enforcement of legislation or inadequate sanctions, and fundamentally underlying all that, totally inadequate education on the real value <Col N="1462" /> of the environment, and that starts in the schools and the homes.</P>
    <P>I am simply saying to the Minister here tonight that he might consider the establishment of that all-party committee as I believe it would allow us to go into many of the issues that are raised at the moment in a very sketchy, peripheral way and have them debated and discussed and examined in fullsome detail.</P>
    <P>Any other area of Government policy gets Dáil time and attention.  We spend most of our time talking economics.  We have debates on the budget.  We have debates on the Adjournment which invariably are about economic issues. Occasionally we discuss issues on other areas of national importance; but as an issue in itself the environment tends to be a bit of a Cinderella and it needs a great deal more time and attention and at the moment that time and attention is not afforded in the normal way in this House.  This debate is the first on the environment in recent times, leaving aside some of the Bills we discussed, and invariably they are not about what I would call the green environment.  The Planning and Development Bill and other Bills that would come within the Minister's ambit, including the constituency division Bill, could hardly be called issues that deal with the green environment, whatever about the political or other environment.  Therefore, I am making a plea tonight for us to address seriously in this House, in some structured way, the key issues which are confronting us, which are all about us, which are about dereliction in our cities, decay in some of the green environmental areas, all those things which we do not give enough time to.  I am not accusing the Minister of not giving enough time to his own Department; frankly, I do not know whether he is or not, but I am willing to believe that he is givig a fair amount of attention to it.  However, it is not emerging here, we do not see it and it is not occupying our time in this House.  I would like it to be much more centre stage because I believe it is fundamentally important.  At present it is, to some extent, seen as a peripheral area which is discussed if we have not <Col N="1463" /> something more important to talk about. I do not believe that is the way it should be seen.  Maybe the Minister would react to that suggestion of an all-party committee.</P>
    <P>I would like to also make a concrete suggestion.  In terms of structuring what is known as the Department of the Environment at the moment, the Minister might review the present arrangements which appear to me to have no distinction drawn between environmental areas and local government areas which would be basically what the Minister is speaking about tonight; he is talking about local authorities, house improvement grants, malicious injuries, the normal activities of local authorities and their interplay with the Department of the Environment. In fact unless there is a rethink in terms of how the Department is structured, it seems to me that much of the day-to-day exigencies of the built environment and the arrangements in place between local government and Government will, if one likes, put to one side the key areas, the fundamental area of quality of life, quality of environment.  I wonder if the Minister would consider a restructuring within his Department, a separation of the two areas into two clear administrative areas so that there is one <i>corpus</i> of responsibility resting on one group of officials for policy in the area of the environment in the true sense of the word, while other officials in another wing of the Department get on with the job of local government which is fundamentally different.  I recall, when the Department of Local Government, as it was then known, was retitled the Department of the Environment, feeling that it was not simply enough to change the name of the place if there was not some new commitment at its heart.  Indeed some of the steps since then would indicate that we have gone backwards &mdash; I am talking about the dismantling of An Foras Forbartha and other various watchdog elements that were in place in relation to the green environment, although I know the Minister himself has a commitment in this area and is serious about it.  I am simply saying that I am not <Col N="1464" /> sure that it is manifest and perhaps those two steps might result in some progress in this area.  I refer to an all-party committee and a review of the structure of the Department itself.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment, when winding up, on some of the comments made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his reports, which inevitably deal with the Department of the Environment, some of which are a repeat of previous years.  I am not going to go into them now because time or inclination do not allow; but there are indications that there is a bit of tightening up to be done in the Department of the Environment and a lot of that is about how resources are used.  In these days of very tight cashflow and very tight revenue it seems reasonable that one might ask each Minister in turn and, in this case, this Minister, what exactly has been done about the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to each of the specific references, some of them a little unflattering in recent years in the area of the Department of the Environment, because ultimately that officer and his officials who do an excellent job on behalf of the people of this State, are trying to ensure best value for public money.  I have no doubt that that is an aim close to the Minister's heart.  I should like to know what systems have been put in place and what changes have arisen directly out of the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his most recent report.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comments in regard to malicious injury claims.  In the course of his speech the Minister said that his Department recoup local authorities' expenditure incurred by them on malicious injuries awards.  That is standard practice.  I should like to know if the Minister has carried out any form of investigation into the manner of assessment and the way in which some of those claims are contested, considered or treated by local authorities.  My experience tends to indicate that wherever one is not directly footing the bill a different attitude is adopted in relation to how one responds to claims.  It is fair comment <Col N="1465" /> to say that there have been instances in respect of which it would be reasonable to have a suspicion at the very least that some of the claims were substantially inflated because the view obtained that somehow it was not a specific named local authority or a specific set of officials who were handling it but some type of large amorphous public purse that eventually funded the cost.  It appeared that the view was that one did not rigorously oppose or evaluate such claims because the bill was being passed on to central Government.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say if in the area of malicious injuries claims there is a slight degree of soft underbelly.  I accept that the Act introduced by the Government to deal with malicious injuries claims has helped but as one with an interest and an experience of how local government functions there is room for massive improvement in that respect. The most central issue in the Minister's speech is local government reform.  I hesitate to mention it because people tend to get a wry smile when they talk about local government reform these days.  At present a plethora of local authorities of varying degrees of efficiency and skill are handling a very mixed bag of responsibilities and some are doing it better than others.  The Minister would be doing the country a service if he could say when and how extensively he will be introducing a major reform of local government which is long overdue.  They are the issues I would like to spend the valuable time of the Dáil debating.  I am disappointed to note that there was not one word about the green environment.  I hope the Minister will be good enough to respond to the queries I have raised, particularly the suggestion of an all-party committee and the restructuring of his Department.</P>

      <P>On the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate I would have expected the Minister to tell us that he was doing something to relieve the parlous state the Government, since they took office, have plunged local authorities into.  The Minister's reign in the Department will be remembered as a time when local authority services were destroyed because of a reduction in the rate support grant.  The Minister has not made any money available to local authorities to make up the shortfall they have suffered as a result.  At meetings of the General Council of County Councils the Minister promised members that he would reorganise local government and in doing so would tackle the issue of local financing.  However, after almost two years in office no such proposal has emerged and the Minister has continued to apply the cutbacks imposed on him by the Minister for Finance.  He may appear to be making cutbacks in his Department but, in effect, what he is doing is transferring taxation to local authority level.</P>
      <P>When service charges were introduced the idea was to ensure that employment was maintained at local level.  They amounted to about £30 in 1986 but in my local authority area that charge has risen to £142 for the coming year.  That is not a service charge; it is a straightforward local tax which is being imposed so that local authorities can provide all types of services and not for water, sewerage or refuse collection as was originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Minister to reduce the rate support grant has left most local authorities with huge overdrafts they do not have any way of reducing.  It has also meant a huge reduction in the number of people employed by local authorities. The number employed in Wicklow has been reduced by 40 per cent in the short time that the Minister has been in office. The Minister may be happy with that <Col N="1467" /> but I should like to tell him that local authorities are not able to provide the minimum of services.  Our roads are in a deplorable condition, hedges have not been cut and very few local authority houses are being repaired.  The services which local authorities traditionally provided have been done away with.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to decide whether to reorganise local authorities in the coming years.  He will have to make local representatives aware of his plans for the future.  If he continues to reduce the amount of the rate support grant to local authorities while at the same time expecting them to increase the service charges I can tell him that he will be destroying a service that has operated for more than 60 years.  That will be his epitaph after his period in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the rates paid by the ESB, a point highlighted by Deputy Carey.  Such rates are imposed and collected by the local authority but taken off the rate support grant.  In effect, local authorities are being asked to do the collection work for the Minister.  There is little consideration for the fact that such rates are not paid on time and that local authorities must carry huge overdrafts while waiting for payments.  Our county was despoiled with pylons which take up an area of ground equal to that taken up by four or five reasonably sized houses. Wicklow gets all the negative appearance from all the pylons erected in the county while the Minister gets the money.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the responsibility for valuing property rests with the Department of Finance and not with the officers of the Department of the Environment.  The argument as to who should pay rates on any property can be contested in the courts.</P>
    <P>The local authority house purchase scheme, which includes a £2,000 grant, is being used as a means of offering a more attractive scheme to the purchaser which <Col N="1468" /> is good but, of course, the Minister does not pay the £2,000 back to the local authority. I think he should since he is pushing the scheme very hard.  I know he told the county managers to get on with the scheme and that he was very disappointed with the response.  He should be aware that this plunges local authorities still further into debt.  When the Department of the Environment come up with a good scheme they should carry the expense as in the past and should not pass it on to the local authority.  I am sure we are all in agreement that the scheme is an attractive one but the great losers are the local authorities.  The Minister can claim credit for giving very good value to the purchaser but it was the local authorities and the previous Government who built the houses, unlike the present Government who stopped building houses.  If one looks at the record of local authorities one will see that every time Fianna Fáil have been in office since 1970, local authority house building stopped.  It came to an end as no money was provided.  Never has it been so bad as in the last two years. I know that in my county five houses have been built in the last two years when in three years while I was Minister for the Environment about 600 were built.  The Minister can laugh at that but these are the hard facts and he knows it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has brought to an end the building of local authority houses.  Not only is he causing <Col N="1469" /> problems for people who are looking for houses but he has also brought to an end small building concerns in many areas because of the cessation of grants to encourage the repair of houses and the stopping of local authority building.  The Minister cannot be very proud of his two years in office.  He may have some time to reverse that trend.  I hope that in the next year we will see a change in his attitude towards local authorities and the fine work they have done.  I hope we will see the re-organisation of local government, the first part of which was introduced by me.  I would like to have had more time to deal with it, it is there for him so why does he not get on with it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to refer to is the grant for the improvement of houses.  The figure given by the Minister of £260 million is very sizeable.  I would remind him that he paid much of that grant to well-heeled people who were very quick to avail of it.  That should not have been the case because now we have a situation where people cannot get a grant for the actual improvement even where the light is showing through the roof.  The Minister should introduce grants to enable people to sink more wells so that they can provide running water in their homes.  There are 700 homes in the north Cork area without running water.  The number of houses in towns that still do not have bathrooms is a question that should be addressed.  The exclusion of grants to local authorities for small sanitary schemes is to be deplored because these schemes enabled local authorities to provide assistance to people.  The local authority building programme has also slowed down and the lists are growing again.  The condition of tens of thousands of dwellings is substandard and successive Governments have no coherent housing policy.  It is <Col N="1470" /> about time the Government issued a White Paper on housing.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the problems that have arisen for people who have lost their jobs and cannot afford to pay back SDA loans.  I would ask the Minister to look at that problem to see if the time for payment could be extended. According to newspaper reports the Government are to introduce a new tax which will be paid by virtually every householder in the country, including local authority tenants.  It is clear that what the Government are planning is not a property tax but simply a tax on homes and the other properties such as land, race horses, jewellery, works of art, expensive cars and yachts &mdash; optional luxuries for the rich &mdash; are not to be taxed.</P>
      <P>The only adequate way to finance local authorities is by way of guaranteed block grant from central taxation.  I would refer briefly to the 1986 excess expenditure.  I will not dwell on it but I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of the serious position that has arisen in my own county of Cork where companies have successfully appealed their valuations, for instance, the refinery and many other industries in Cork which have left the local authority in a very bad state.  As a result there are huge demands for repayments by such companies to the local authority.  That is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold the view that the establishment of the national roads authority should be used as a means to facilitate the widespread privatisation of road construction and the road network.  No independent analysis or research has ever been produced to support the view that private enterprise is more efficient or cost effective than the public sector in the planning and development of our roads system.  I would refer to the fact that roads in many areas at present are in an appalling and dangerous condition.  It is time this matter was addressed because people are howling for some work to be carried out on road maintenance and improvement <Col N="1471" /> which has been neglected for the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>At the end of the day it will cost much more to restore the roads to a reasonable standard.  I would ask the Minister to consider making some increase in the funds available under the heading of special housing aid for the elderly.  Good work has been done under that scheme but it has only been a scratch on the surface where, elderly people are living in homes which, perhaps, were cottages that were purchased under a tenant purchase scheme years ago or old farmhouses. In many such cases, the provision of windows and doors is not sufficient, much more work is required to be done.</P>

      <P>One of the major items that was introduced by the Minister this year was the tenant purchase scheme.  I welcome it in its entirety.  It is a wonderful scheme.  As chairman of the Dublin Housing Committee, I had a problem on reading certain press reports in relation to that scheme, I spoke to the Minister about it and he assured me that there has been a fantastic rush, particularly in the Dublin area, to take up the special terms. As everyone is well aware, this is a once off effort.  It enables all tenants to purchase their own homes.  The Minister has informed us that 30,000 tenants &mdash; that is 40 per cent of those eligible &mdash; have applied to buy their own homes.  This is an unbelievable success story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following various meetings of housing officers with the Minister he impressed <Col N="1472" /> on them that everything possible should be done to allow any tenant who wished to buy their own house to do so, regardless of whether they had the price of the house, or whether it had been valued or whether they were in a position at that time to purchase.  Once an application is made before 31 December they are entitled to buy the house at any stage after that date.  I would suggest that every tenant should consider purchasing their own house and to make application to buy the house under the special discount terms available under the scheme.  As I said earlier it is an excellent scheme and one that should be welcomed by everybody. It is the dream of every Irish man and Irish woman to own their own house. This is a great opportunity to do that.  As it is a once-off scheme we should make sure it is widely publicised.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister that in this, his second year in office, he has made a strong move to control smog in this city.  Some may call him &ldquo;the Minister for smog&rdquo; but I have no doubt that he will go down in history as the Minister who did away with the problem of smog.  He has done more than any other Minister in that Department during the past 20 years to alleviate the problem of smog in this city and he is to be congratulated for that.  One often wonders if it is only the people who live in Cabra or in Ballyfermot who are responsible for the problem of smog in this city.  We all know that each person in this city who burns coal, or other smoke producing fuels, is contributing to this problem and it would help greatly when the weather turns cold, as it did a few weeks back, if they were to consider burning smokeless fuels regardless of where they live in the Dublin area.  Each of us as individuals has a responsibility to look after our neighbours but sometimes we forget this very quickly and point the finger at the Government and everybody else.  Each of us could help in alleviating this problem. While legislation is necessary, each of us has a particular role to play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> Reference was also made to the problem of pollution.  Last week in this House I spoke about the beauty of Ireland and the potential in tourism.  We have wonderful lakes and rivers which are being polluted not only by industrialists but also by many farmers who just do not seem to understand or bother about the damage that is being caused to our rivers by effluent seeping from their farms.  By acting quickly the Minister has helped greatly in the alleviation of this problem.  If one looks at the statistics it is clear that the number of fish kills is very much down this year.  Being from Dublin I do not know a great deal about life in rural Ireland but I believe that the extension of the western package to the poorer parts of Ireland has helped greatly.  I believe that people living in the areas covered by that scheme are able to apply for grants to help in alleviating the problem of pollution arising from the seepage of effluent from farms and industrial sources. At this point, I would like to congratulate the Minister and to say to him that he is doing his bit and that it is up to the rest of us to work as hard as him.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to congratulate the Minister for setting up the National Roads Authority in July.  This was a move in the right direction and I look forward to benefiting from the fruits of their endeavours over the next few years.  With that I hand over to my colleague.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers on this side of the House I support the Supplementary Estimate which has been presented to the House this evening by the Minister.  In this Supplementary Estimate the Minister is seeking extra <Col N="1474" /> funds for the payment of new house grants and house improvement grants. This will be welcomed by those who have carried out very extensive improvements to their homes.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider, when the financial position improves, the reintroduction of house improvement grants as there is absolutely no doubt that both the new house grant and the house improvement grant led to an improvement in the living conditions of many people.  I know, of course, that the £2,000 new house grant is still available.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for introducing the local authority tenant purchase scheme which was very widely welcomed by local authority tenants throughout the country.  This scheme has helped many people fulfil their ambition to own their own homes.  Each person living in this country has a desire to own his or her own home and it is nice that we have a Minister for the Environment who introduces a scheme which enables local authority tenants to fulfil that ambition.  The Minister has recognised that some local authority tenants will have difficulty in complying with the requirements of the tenant purchase scheme before the end of December and as a result he has agreed that those who apply may have their applications considered at a later date.  Some speakers have spoken about what the Minister may be remembered for after his term of office.  I believe he will be remembered as the Minister who made it possible for local authority tenants to own their own homes.</P>

      <P>Being a former member of a local authority the Minister is as well aware as I am that local authorities are grossly underfunded.  In fact, they are no longer able to fulfil their roles as development corporations, a role which they are capable of fulfilling and a role they must fulfil in the future so as to tackle the problems particular to rural Ireland.  It is well to remember that members of local authorities feel a sense of frustration at present and we in this House do not remember as often as we should the generous contribution which has been made by members of local authorities. They are doing a good job, getting very little thanks in return.  Because of the present restriction on funding their task is becoming more and more difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that inadequate funding leads to inefficiencies. Because of inadequate funding it is difficult for local authorities to operate as efficiently as they should.  On the other hand, Government policy on funding has forced local authorities to examine their spending programmes and perhaps this is a blessing in disguise as there is absolutely no doubt that public bodies, be they local authorities or health boards, did not get the return they should have got from the funds which were available. If and when adequate funding becomes available, it is my view that members of local authorities and the management of local authorities will look very carefully at their spending programmes so as to ensure that they get the best return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quickly make the point that <Col N="1476" /> commercial rates and service charges are too restrictive and selective and are not an adequate or satisfactory means of raising funds for local authorities.  Therefore the Minister and the Government will have to look at alternative sources of funding.  My final point, and I am sure the Minister would be very surprised if I did not make this point, is in relation to county roads.  There is absolutely no doubt that our county roads structure has deteriorated.  When the Minister is introducing Supplementary Estimates again I would ask him to seriously consider coming before the House with an Estimate which will provide adequate funding for members of local authorities so that they can tackle the problem of the deterioration of the county road structure throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will never get to that.  I should like to make two or three points in relation to this Supplementary Estimate. The house purchase scheme has been a great success in my area of Dublin County Council where there has been a 38 per cent uptake of the scheme.  This is a phenomenal achievement and I congratulate the Minister on introducing the scheme.  There is a difference between what I would call the maintenance mentality and the ownership mentality, and the individual who owns his house has a dignity and pride in his house and neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Keating that there should be a distinction between what I <Col N="1477" /> would call the mechanical and physical elements of the Department of the Environment, namely, the grants and potholes, and the health and environmental areas &mdash; the protection and development of our environment.  In this respect I would refer to air pollution, smog and, in the area of the Department of Energy, the protection of our seas and the nuclear issue.  That is a very valid point but to be fair to the Minister he has been given a very broad spectrum of responsibilities. He has handled and undertaken these responsibilities with vigour and has been very protective of our environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to local government reform, I am a member of Dublin County Council which has 78 members and it has come to the stage where it is almost impossible for us to manage our affairs. I know there is a report on the Minister's desk with regard to local government reform which proposes the establishment of three authorities in the county area. I would encourage the establishment of these three authorities because it would take care of many of the problems which we now have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In this respect I want to refer to the housing area.  In many new sprawling urban estates some three bedroom houses are now occupied by unmarried mothers, many of whom are unable to cope.  If we give back responsibility to local areas, with some imagination, local autonomy and initiative from a new local authority system within the Dublin area on a community basis, I believe we can tackle many of these real social problems. I am aware that the Minister knows that this is a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the southern cross route.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has been given special responsibility as co-ordinator of the EC Structural and Regional Funds.  During the next five years we will be presented with the most amazing challenge of all time.  I know the <Col N="1478" /> Minister will take advantage of these new funds and I hope he will direct them in particular to the Greater Dublin area and that he will build an EC route from Belfast around Dublin to Rosslare.  I now pass on to my learned colleague from the Dublin area who I know will support me in congratulating the Minister and wishing him well with his new task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the road authority I want to make the following points.  The Labour Party support the concept of a road authority.  The Minister knows this but I want to put it on the record of the House.  The Minister has been very tardy in getting the operation off the ground because until they are properly established on a statutory basis, having regard to the realities of the regulations which govern these areas, they cannot do their job.  The fact that they <Col N="1479" /> have been so inadequately resourced &mdash; and this Supplementary Estimate gives testimony to that &mdash; is an admission in public of how insubstantial the authority have been to date.  I am simply asking the Minister to proceed with something which is a good idea.  I am not going to take up my time criticising the Minister; Deputy Hyland has praised the Minister with so many words of honey that the poison contained within them will slowly emerge when the smog clears.</P>
      <P>With regard to roads, the southern cross route, etc, I want to make the following points.  Unless the legislation is brought forward very quickly for the necessary fast track arrangements &mdash; I am not mixing metaphors &mdash; which can be made to bring about the speedy construction of roads in the Greater Dublin area, which is probably the worst authority for the building of national primary roads, we are not going to get the centre hub of the road radian wheel right in this country.  I ask the Minister to expedite the drafting of the necessary legislation which is required to give effect to that authority.  Perhaps that is when the western ring which will link the N1 with the N11 will be completed.  I share Deputy Kitt's aspirations in that regard.  He may then formally tell his colleagues in the engineering section in the Custom House and in Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation that the eastern bypass has been buried democratically, is not to rise again in any shape or form and the Euro route &mdash; I forget the precise designation &mdash; will run west of the city linking the outer and inner suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the time and of Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn's anxiety to contribute to the debate.  The Minister has the support of the House and the possibility of European money to do something about roads.  He has deferred the publication of the document on the national roads plan and perhaps he might explain why.  We want to support the Minister but he will have to <Col N="1480" /> show us how.  We are suspicious of the Minister's failure in this regard to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for sharing his time with me.  I suppose it would be remiss of me not to wish the Minister well with his new responsibilities in relation to the allocation of funding under the EC Structural Fund but I would say to the Minister that there is very great concern at the overall manner in which the committees in the seven regions are being managed at present.  There is concern at the manner and nature of the input into these committees and in particular the lack of local government input from the point of view of local government public representatives. I think the Minister would be the first to agree with me that nobody knows the scene on the ground better than local county councillors and urban councillors in their respective counties.  It is unfortunate that a more definite input is not being made into the seven committees and SFADCo in my area.  This situation needs to be changed and I ask the Minister and his Department to urgently examine this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my constituency &mdash; and I am going to be parochial on this matter &mdash; it must be said that County Clare has one of the worst road networks in the country.  The condition of the county roads in Clare are absolutely appalling at present.  Since the Minister took over as Minister for the Environment the funding to Clare County Council has been substantially reduced.  Unfortunately the Minister did not continue the percentage of funding to Clare County Council which was given by the previous Administration. If he had done that, Clare County Council would have had £10.7 million more to spend on the roads in County Clare than we have had under the Minister's jurisdiction.  This reduction in funding is very evident from the conditions of the roads throughout the county.  Needless to say this has a serious <Col N="1481" /> impact on potential developments and industry coming into the area.</P>
    <P>Another area of tremendous significance is urban renewal.  Ennis Urban District Council made an application to the Minister for funding under the urban renewal programme.  At present people in Ennis who have property or who intend purchasing property are extremely reluctant to carry out any improvements in that section of the town because they believe some moneys for these improvements will come from the Department under the urban renewal programme. While those people are awaiting that money the centre of Ennis is becoming more and more derelict and it is unfortunate that this is happening in the capital town of County Clare.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister met a deputation from Shannon Town Commissioners who are extremely anxious to be recognised as an urban district council. We had hoped that the Minister would be in a position by the end of December to allocate this status to Shannon and there is great disappointment that he has not yet seen fit to do so.  Perhaps he would let us know what progress has been made and when he will raise the status of the town commissioners in Shannon.</P>

    <P>I thank Deputies who contributed.  A number of points were raised which I will try to deal with as best I can in the time available. I am disappointed that Deputy Shatter and one or two other Members, particularly Deputy Keating, do not understand the rules of procedure as far as Supplementary Estimate contributions are concerned.  I am not permitted under Standing Order 128 to raise matters not included in the Supplementary Estimate. To express disappointment that I did not <Col N="1482" /> deal with a whole range of issues is nonsense and I wish they would pay more attention to the procedures of the House in this regard. Deputies Shatter, Quinn and others referred to the National Roads Authority. I agree that they need a statutory basis to do the job properly.  They cannot do without it and I am giving it my urgent attention.  I particularly wanted to give them a little time to operate on a non-statutory basis before starting the detailed drafting of the Bill.  We must get the Bill right because the National Roads Authority will have to deal with an enormous amount of work and last for a very long time.</P>

      <P>I doubt it.  Quite a large legislative framework will be involved and the Authority will have an important role to play in the development of our infrastructures.  Several policy issues are to be addressed in the blueprint for roads and it is intended to publish it.  Of course it is ready and it has been considered by the National Roads Authority.  They have made their submission to me and everything is cleared.  We are awaiting the finalisation of the intervention rates and related matters.</P>

      <P>No.  I am referring to matters related to the Structural Funds. These must be settled before the blueprint is published.  That is the proper way to do it.  We will then know precisely where we are going and precisely what has to be done on the national roads.  The report will then be published.  When the blueprint is in place and arrangements for the Structural Funds draw down has been agreed in the national plan which is to be submitted before March, the National Roads Authority will have a <Col N="1483" /> statutory basis.  I agree that this is absolutely essential.</P>

      <P>I am very familiar with county roads and how they are developed.  Some reference was made to cutbacks in regard to county roads.  In 1986 the then Coalition Government provided £5 million for the maintenance and improvement of county roads throughout the whole country.  On coming to office I decided there was a need to redress the problem which existed and I provided £15 million in 1987.  Because of the continuing problem, I also allowed £15 million in 1988, while in 1989 I have agreed to allow £19.5 million.  A sum of almost £50 million will have been provided in three years, which is more than the accumulated total for nearly 20 years before that.</P>

      <P>I can cite not only the Air Pollution Act but the issue of licences for industrial plants and the regulation of SO² emissions.  I dealt with water pollution and the question of cleaner rivers. We had 162 fish kills in 1987 but fewer than 40 this year.  For the first time ever we have received recognition for dealing positively with the whole question of water pollution.  Directives have been put in place regarding drinking water and bathing water and they are being monitored properly with good results.  We provided grants for the private sector to deal with waste, whether toxic or hazardous. I undertook a feasibility study regarding the disposal of toxic waste. That is now on my desk and I will be making the necessary decisions shortly.</P>

I ask Deputies to urge those involved to get in their applications this week because some of the offices will be closed for a few days after Christmas.  I increased the amount of money available for housing aid for the elderly by another £500,000 to £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interest rates have gone down by 6 per cent since the Government took office and local authorities have made savings on their overdrafts. The voluntary redundancy scheme, together with the controls on numbers employed, have reduced numbers by almost 5,000 or 14 per cent since 1 January 1987.  Annual net savings to the local authorities are <Col N="1486" /> estimated at £37 million and the Government have funded lump sums amounting to £23 million during that period.  The Government's early decision on Estimates means that local authorities hold their estimate meetings much earlier than heretofore.  The result has been the better management of expenditure programmes and significant improvements in revenue collection.  This can be verified.  The Local Loan Funds Act, 1987, streamlined financial transfers between the State and local authorities, eliminating waste and improving the local authorities' cashflow. Grants for the strengthening of county roads have gone up from £5 million in 1986 to £19.5 million in 1989.  That is a very significant improvement.</P>
    <P>In 1987 we had the usual whirlpool of spending on the back of ever increasing borrowing.  It had to be stopped and we did it.  The elected councils have displayed a remarkably responsible attitude towards their spending arrangements and the assessment of how to get better value for money.  In 1988 the spiral of increasing debt on local authorities has been reversed and deficits no longer exist in an increasing way on local authorities.</P>

I wish Deputy Sherlock would stop giving misinformation about these matters.  Short term working was eliminated in 1988 and we hope to maintain that position in 1989. Considerable progress has been made on all fronts, both regarding the green environment and the built environment, and it is generally recognised that that is the case.  There is more talk now about the green environment and about dealing with that environment in a positive way than there was in this House or this country for 30 years.  The reason is that there is an environmentalist in charge of the Department of the Environment.  I welcome criticisms concerning the green environment because that strengthens my hand in the places where I get my assistance.</P>

      <P>I can recall the Minister of State on this side of the House, as Opposition spokesperson, dancing and prancing and doing jigs in relation to what we were doing in Government and in particular what our Minister for Fisheries, former Deputy Paddy O'Toole, did.  He objected very vehemently on many occasions when the then Minister came back from Brussels with deals which were far superior and more beneficial to the fishing industry than the deal he and the Minister returned from Brussels with last week-end. I would like to ask the Minister of State what went wrong in Brussels.  What were the Minister, the Minister of State and their negotiating team doing and why has there been such a disastrous result?</P>
      <P>It is not enough for the Minister and the Minister of State to come back here and tell us that the EC wanted a reduction in quota to 63,000 tonnes.  That is not a justifiable argument because everybody knows about the negotiating tactics adopted in Brussels.  It is not enough for the Minister or the Minister of State to come back here and tell us that scientific evidence suggested to them that there was a need for conservation of the fishing stocks and that, in order to conserve the stocks, they had to accept this reduction. I understand from many people in the fishing sector that they do not rely very much on the scientific evidence that is available and that many of the so-called scientists who are giving this advice have not the resources to do the type of investigation required to present the Minister with sound advice on this matter.  To put forward these arguments to justify an abysmal disaster in the negotiations in Brussels is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister here this evening will have positive news for us and for the fishing people in particular because they are very concerned about this matter.  I would like the Minister to outline to this <Col N="1490" /> House why this 12.5 per cent reduction came about and why he accepted it.  Why did they fail in their negotiations?  Obviously, they had not got their case properly prepared and ready.  This is most unfortunate because many people are totally dependent on the fishing industry.  Many young men have bought small boats and are making substantial repayments to BIM.  How are those men to make their repayments next year when the quota has been reduced by 10,000 tonnes?  What will be the position of those people or will the Minister compensate them for the loss in quota?</P>
    <P>A major announcement was made over six weeks ago by the Minister, the Minister of State and BIM regarding the creation of 400 jobs in the fishing industry over the next three to four years.  That includes some jobs in the quota area.  The mackerel quotas are being concentrated east of a four degree line.  That is a serious matter because it will be to the advantage of the larger ships, many of which will be tempted to land in Denmark, Scotland and Holland.  This will result in a substantial loss of jobs because the ships will not land in Ireland.  I understand from fish processors that already this year there is evidence of a 50 per cent decrease in the fish landed for processing purposes. When we add to that the 12.5 per cent decrease in the quota, their future looks extremely bleak.  I should like to know what consoling words the Minister may have to offer such people.  Can he tell them clearly what is Government policy in relation to future landings of fish here? Are the Government prepared to allow boatowners to land fish in other countries? I fail to understand Government policy in relation to job creation when they have nothing specific in this area.  If fish are not to be landed here then how can one create jobs in the fish processing area?  I foresee that in the future not only will no new jobs be created but existing ones will be lost, which is very serious.</P>
    <P>Many issues arise out of these most recent negotiations in Brussels into which <Col N="1491" /> I should like to go in greater detail but time does not so allow me.  The Minister might elaborate for the House as to what is the policy of his Department <i>vis-à-vis</i> those people faced with financial disaster in the coming year, whose jobs will be placed in jeopardy.  The Minister has a responsibility to this House and the industry to account for the abysmal stewardship of himself and his Minister in Brussels over last weekend.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Minister and his Department devise a plan immediately for the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy in 1992.  It is equally important that they would emphasise within the EC the importance of our fisheries industry.  They should bring the attention of the EC to the fact that we have an under-developed fishing industry, so that we would warrant disadvantaged status in this area recognising that our counterparts have a fully developed fisheries industry.  The Minister did not get that message across successfully in Europe.  I find that difficult to swallow when I recall the type of objections advanced from this side of the House by the Minister when in opposition. The Minister in Government has shown himself up as the sham he was in opposition.  It would appear that the line pursued in opposition has been changed, with a complete turnaround, which is indeed unfortunate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that there is an air of doom and gloom obtaining within our fishing industry at present. I travelled through Killybegs on Saturday last and noted very little activity.  Most of the fishing fleet was tied up, the processors closed down, and people moving <Col N="1492" /> around without any work, people who should be working right up to the end of this month.  That was the position obtaining there even before the latest negotiations in Brussels took place last weekend.  At present the Killybegs fishing fleet are not allowed to fish for mackerel. They are debarred from fishing for herring. I understand that the fishing of cod has been banned also for the remainder of the year as has the fishing of black sole, so that there is very little fishing taking place at all.</P>
    <P>Almost three years ago to the day I remember another Adjournment Debate in this House in which I and the Minister of State participated.  The Irish mackerel quota had expired mid-December and there was a heated debate about the hardship caused to Donegal.  The season has been closed for the past fortnight.  Yet there has been hardly a word about it. This is very serious indeed.  I should like to place on the record just how bad is the position.</P>
    <P>There were two major points to be considered in the negotiations that took place in Brussels over the past weekend. There was, first, the drastic reduction of 12.5 per cent in the mackerel quota.  Let there be no doubt about it, our fishing industry is as good or as bad as our mackerel quota.  Pelagic fish constitute the backbone of our fishing industry, fish such as mackerel, herring and horse mackerel.  If their quotas are properly managed we can have an excellent fishing season whereas, if there are not adequate quotas for them, there will be a disastrous season, which is what has happened.  That is why it is so serious for the future of our fishing industry, for the excellent fleet in Killybegs and for the future of the people who invested so much money.  One must ask what the future holds for them when the quota has been reduced by 12.5 per cent to 69,000 tonnes.  I remember endeavouring to defend quotas of 80,000 and 90,000 tonnes which was difficult but it is absolutely impossible to defend a quota of 69,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> The second outcome of the negotiations in Brussels last weekend was that we were given access to the North Sea. We heard so much about the four degrees west line to which we were never allowed access before.  I regard that access as a mixed blessing because I foresee it presenting difficulties to our fish processors, particularly those in my constituency.  I know that if our fishermen and their boats are allowed into the North Sea the likelihood of their bringing that fish back to Killybegs &mdash; involving 60, 70 or 80 hours steaming &mdash; is very remote indeed. Indeed, I have it on good authority that of the 25,000 tonnes available up to a fortnight ago &mdash; when they did not pass the four degrees line &mdash; less than 50 per cent was brought back to Killybegs.  That is one of the reasons for there having been so little employment there this year. One cannot blame the fishermen.  If they are allowed in there, they will catch fish, sell it to the highest bidder, land it in Scotland, get it on to a Klondiker destined for the Continent.  If one can do so one will not steam back to Irish processors providing them with the fish which, in turn, will provide jobs for them. That is the greatest weakness I perceive in the most recent negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that the EC Community want to develop every region, peripheral as well as central.  Where could one find a more peripheral region than our west coast, whether it be in Deputy Taylor-Quinn's, my constituency or any other where unemployment is so high? Indeed unemployment is twice the national average in my county.  Over the years the fish processing industry created more than 1,000 jobs.  I shudder to think what will be the future for these people if the fish is not available.  I wonder what will happen the many hundreds of families stretching from Donegal town to Mountcharles, to Killybegs, through the Gaeltacht, to Glencolmcille, Kilcar, Carrick, right up through The Rosses, Glenties, Ardara where there is transport laid <Col N="1494" /> on for people to work in these processing factories.  There are 1,000 people working in those areas season after season.  If the fish is not available in the future, if it is to be landed on the Continent, or transferred at sea, what will happen these families, where will the jobs come from? I foresee it leading to even more emigration and, God knows, there is already sufficient in my county and the country as a whole.  I see entire families leaving. But if these jobs are lost it will lead to even more, thus weakening even further the fabric of society in the west.</P>
    <P>The immediate problem is that of the protection of jobs.  It is my opinion that the Minister of State and his colleague did not play their cards correctly in Brussels. We are a peripheral region of Europe. We have received a very small slice of these quotas only &mdash; 4 per cent of the total allowable catch.  If we are to take a <i>pro rata</i> decrease, as will larger countries, we will suffer even more.  I do not know that that point has been adequately stressed in Brussels.  I do not want to make political capital out of this matter; there has been sufficient of that in the past. We are all for the future of our fishing industry, of our fleet and for the protection of jobs in the processing industry. I saw several processors on television over the weekend.  Indeed, they telephoned us here outlining the very bleak future indeed for them.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn has said that we shall have to renegotiate in Brussels.  However, that is way ahead in 1992.  Unless we take some remedial action immediately it will be a very dim, bleak future for our fishing industry.  It is my opinion that the latest negotiations in Brussels constituted a bad weekend's work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn said it was unfortunate that we had to come in here tonight to debate the outcome of the negotiations in Brussels but I am delighted to have the opportunity to relate to the House what <Col N="1495" /> happened in Brussels.  Before Deputy McGinley and Deputy Taylor-Quinn realised what was in the package they decided to make political capital out of it and they rushed to the media ill-informed and showing a lack of political maturity, interested only in personal publicity and giving no service to the industry.  It has been proved here tonight that there is nothing there but tunnel vision.  In the intervening days I would have thought they would have tried to educate themselves and would have consulted all involved in the industry.  They have obviously only been in consultation, if at all, with one side of the industry.</P>
      <P>The Common Fisheries Policy was agreed by a Fine Gael Government on 1 January 1983 and Deputy McGinley and Deputy Taylor-Quinn were part of that administration.  The Fianna Fáil Government were not responsible for that policy but we had to work within the structures agreed by a former Fine Gael Minister. The quotas were allocated between the various member states as a result of the Common Fisheries Policy accepted by the Deputy's colleague at that time. Neither I, my Minister nor my party would have accepted the conditions laid down in the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>

      <P>When we assumed office in March 1987 there was a quota of some 80,000 tonnes and 73,000 tonnes were caught but less than 50 per cent of that catch was processed.  People were allowed to fish indiscriminately.  There was no management and no consultation with the industry.  The fish were sold over the side to the Klondikers just because there was an election pending and because the Minister for Fisheries at the time had resigned and Deputy O'Toole had assumed responsibility.  The Government of the day were not courageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGinley talked about going <Col N="1496" /> through the town of Killybegs last week. I refer him back to the middle of February 1987 when in Killybegs 7,000 tonnes of a quota of 80,000 tonnes were landed and that all processed ashore.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>Our first priority on assuming office was to seek additional mackerel and we secured an additional 10,000 tonnes, bringing us up to a total of 17,000 tonnes for the autumn-winter fishing.  As a result of responsible management and in conjunction with the industry we were in a better position to ensure that our fishing vessels could land fish during the autumn-winter fishing season.  This management régime, set up by the Minister and myself and our officials, continued into the beginning of this year when our spring fishing was not exhausted in the middle of February but was exhausted naturally at the end of May and when 99 per cent of the fish caught were processed ashore. We did not allow Klondikers in to take the fish from our boats as did the previous administration.  We left almost 24,000 tonnes for the winter fishing and we closed it only some few days ago.  Deputy McGinley was critical of the closure of it, but he was equally as critical when we opened it on 3 October.  He said ours was a cosmetic exercise.  It was not a cosmetic exercise within the first fortnight when some 6,000 tonnes were landed in the town of Killybegs.  Whoever is briefing the Deputies did not tell them that the 1,000 tonnes which arrived in Killybegs had to go back to Scotland because we were unable to process them in Killybegs. The Deputies should consult all facets of the industry prior to making ill-conceived statements.</P>
    <P>Certainly all of the fish did not come down this year.  Does Deputy McGinley suggest that we should not allow our boats outside of the four degree line? Does he suggest that we should not take up our mackerel quota?  We should, and we should strive to achieve additional quantities during the year.  If our fishermen are not allowed to do that, British <Col N="1497" /> and Continental boats will be in the fishing grounds three to four weeks before the Irish boats.  Is there any economic acumen on the far side of the House? They would allow them in well in advance of our fishermen and the fish are one to three to the kilo.</P>

      <P>There is a perception in this country that the success or failure of negotiations in Europe depend on the mackerel quota and that is tunnel vision.  Last year's quota was 79,250 tonnes.  The scientific advice was for 63,480 tonnes.  We secured an increase to 69,280 tonnes.  We would have liked to have come back with much more but we must look to the importance of conservation, and look to the generations of the future.  While I would not fully accept the scientific advice it would be irresponsible totally to ignore it.  We must always consider the maximum stock which may be fished within safe biological limits.  We on this side of the House are committed to the long term future of this important renewable resource.</P>
      <P>In relation to other important species, we ensured that we increased the catch of horse mackerel which is a non-quota species with a tremendous future.</P>

      <P>We vigorously and successfully opposed a Dutch suggestion for the fishing of horse mackerel to a limit of 30,000 tonnes for industrial fishing because it would discriminate against vessels in this country.  Both the Minister and myself returned from Brussels with a 33 per cent increase in our herring quota as compared with this time last year.  Due to our management and conservation measures in the Blaskets we secured another 4,000 tonnes there.  While we may have dropped 10,000 tonnes in <Col N="1499" /> mackerel we have an increase by 11,000 tonnes in herrings.  Deputies might not be aware that the value of herrings would be one and a half times the value of the mackerel and would be fished by the same boats.</P>

We have achieved in cod a further increase of 2,000 tonnes, bringing us to 11,700 tonnes, in saithe 60 tonnes, bringing us up to 4,670 tonnes, in whiting 230 tonnes, bringing us up to 17,400 tonnes, in plaice 470 tonnes, bringing us up to a total of 3,380 tonnes, in sole 35 tonnes up to 675 tonnes, and in prawns 490 tonnes bringing us up to 9,805 tonnes.  We increased haddock quotas by 1,650 tonnes, bringing us up to 4,090 tonnes. Compare that with the situation in the UK where they had a quota of 128,000 tonnes last year reduced to 54,000 tonnes.  The Deputies do not want to know the truth about this matter.  They <Col N="1500" /> are only aware of what has happened in mackerel.</P>

      <P>The UK authorities do not maintain central statistics broken down on the basis of nationality for homeless persons or for persons receiving unemployment benefit or assistance.  Consequently there are no official UK figures for the number of Irish in Britain that might be homeless or unemployed.</P>
      <P>I should say however that the absence of official figures does not mean that we are unaware of the problems encountered by our emigrants in Britain.  We are concerned for their welfare and our Embassy is active on their behalf in London and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 42 together.  I take it Question No. 31 refers to derogations from Community measures pursuant to the Single European Act which itself cannot be the subject of derogation at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is necessary to consider each proposed measure individually, it is the general policy of the Government that recourse to derogations should be minimised, in order to promote the fullest integration of Ireland both in the Community and in the completion of the internal market, in line with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Government therefore seek to ensure that Community measures will be sufficiently flexible and <Col N="1216" /> where necessary, adjusted, or differentiated, to fit the varying circumstances and levels of development of member states.  Such an approach would avoid the need for member states, including Ireland, to seek numerous derogations.</P>
    <P>At present Ireland is seeking derogations in only one area namely the draft directives on lorry weights and dimensions. The European Commission have proposed three directives incorporating maximum weights and dimensions for two, three and four axle lorries, buses and coaches.  Ireland is seeking derogations from these draft directives in order to allow sufficient time to embark on a programme which will permit our roads and bridges to be strengthened to carry the heavier loads.</P>
    <P>The proposed &ldquo;Blueprint for Road Development&rdquo; will contain a strategy for the necessary strengthening of the roads infrastructure to carry heavier lorries, together with a proposed time scale for implementation of EC limits where derogations are being sought.  In this regard it would be our intention that the increased structural funds would assist in the improvement of our road infrastructure.</P>

In deciding whether or not to provide assistance from the fund the Government takes account of the scale of the disaster, the numbers of people affected and the extent to which they are affected, the <Col N="1217" /> relative poverty of the country concerned, and whether an appeal has been received by the Government for assistance.</P>
      <P>A total of £800,000 has been allocated by the Government to date in 1988 to disaster relief in third world countries, of which £515,000 was provided for assistance to the victims of flooding in Sudan, £175,000 for relief to flood victims in Bangladesh, £70,000 in support of the United Nations co-ordinated relief programme for Afghanistan and £40,000 for assistance to the victims of conflict in Mozambique.</P>

      <P>The Libyan authorities are fully aware of the unequivocal view of the Government that any support, moral or material, for the provisional IRA from any source is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I reported to the Dáil on 8 December 1987 that the Irish Ambassador in Rome, who is also accredited to Libya, had on the instructions of the Government travelled to Tripoli on 7 November to make this view absolutely clear.  I stated that the Ambassador had impressed on the Libyan authorities the widespread public concern which has arisen as a result of the threat posed to the peace and security of this State by the apparent attempt to import into the State for use by the IRA a vast and sophisticated arsenal of weapons. I am satisfied that the Libyan authorities are in no doubt as to the position of the Government on this important point of principle.  Our position was reiterated to the Libyan authorities on 30 August 1988.  The Deputy will also recall that the Ambassador informed the Libyan authorities that in the light of recent events the Government would not be proceeding with the trade visit to Libya which has been planned for the period 15-17 November 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made clear in the Dáil on a number of occasions that the Government's overriding concern is to assess at all stages what are the most effective means of ensuring that neither Libya nor any other country offers support of any kind, moral, political or material to subversive elements in this country.

      <P>The Vienna meeting of the CSCE has been taking place since November 1986 and there are indications that it will end early next year.  At this meeting, Ireland, together with our partners in the Twelve, has sought to ensure that participating states will make new and substantial commitments in the area of human rights.  Although negotiations are still going on, I am confident that this will be achieved, and that the human rights provisions in the Vienna concluding document will strengthen significantly the commitments contained in the Helsinki final Act and the Madrid concluding document.</P>
      <P>The expected results will include measures to strengthen the procedures for reviewing implementation of the provisions relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and human contacts. States will be able to make representations on particular situations and cases to the state concerned and bring them to the attention of all 35 participating states.  It will be possible to raise these cases also at the annual sessions of a conference on the human dimension, as well as at the normal CSCE review meetings.</P>

We and our partners believe that, for the attainment of that goal, full respect for human rights and civil liberties is necessary.

      <P>The Government are nevertheless aware of and condemn the acts of aggression, coupled with economic reprisals, by South Africa towards the front line and other neighbouring States in Southern Africa, including Mozambique. Ireland has made its position known at the United Nations where we have for several years co-sponsored the General Assembly resolution on &ldquo;Concerted International Action for the Elimination of Apartheid&rdquo; which also addresses South African action in the countries of Southern Africa.  Ireland also recognises the need to take action to assist those countries in Southern Africa which have suffered as a consequence of aggression by and economic dependence on South Africa.  We participate in the work of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) and with our partners in the Twelve provide assistance for development under the Lomé Convention.

      <P>Support for the peace process in Central America, including the cessation of outside aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements in the region, as expressed in the &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; Agreement of August, 1987, is central to the position of the Government, a position that is shared by our European partners.  In common with them we try to advance and reinforce the impulses arising within the region itself tending to a settlement of its problems by peaceful means.  The Government believe that there should be no external interference of any kind in Nicaragua or elsewhere in Central America.  We have supported UN General Assembly Resolutions calling for the lifting of the trade embargo and for compliance with the 1986 judgement of the International Court of Justice concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>We recognise that considerable progress has been made by Nicaragua in meeting its commitments under the &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; Agreement.  Clearly, however, there is a great need for further steps to be taken in Nicaragua and in other Central American states to achieve the national dialogue, reconciliation, authentic pluralist democracy and respect for human rights envisaged in the 1987 Agreement.

      <P>The resolution on &ldquo;Comprehensive and Mandatory Sanctions against the Racist Regime of South Africa&rdquo;, to which I take Deputy Quinn to refer, was one of a series of eleven resolutions on apartheid considered at this year's session of the United Nations General Assembly.  It was adopted on 5 December 1988 by 123 votes to 12 with 19 abstentions, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>Ireland repeated its abstention vote on this resolution because it called for comprehensive mandatory sanctions, describing such sanctions as &ldquo;the most appropriate, effective and peaceful means to bring apartheid to an end&rdquo;.  The Government do not share this view.  The resolution also contained a number of other elements with which we could not agree, in particular, it singled out Japan, in our view invidiously, and it called for accession to the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports which raises constitutional difficulties for us.</P>
      <P>The Irish representative spoke in the debate on apartheid in the General Assembly on 30 November and delivered an explanation of vote following the voting process on 5 December.  Both the statement and explanation of vote set out clearly our belief that the right policy for the international community is one of steady and graduated pressure for change through carefully chosen, selective, graduated sanctions.  Such sanctions, naturally, should be mandatory &mdash; that is, imposed by the United Nations Security Council &mdash; and implemented fully by the entire international community.  Such action by the security council would have the full support of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Government attach great importance to the commitment contained in paragraph 8 (a) of the Hillsborough Communique that save in the most exceptional circumstances, there is a police presence in all operations by the armed forces, including the UDR, which involve direct contact with the community. The Government are not satisfied with the rate of progress towards the full implementation of this policy and, through the framework of the Anglo Irish Conference, are continuing to press for a significant acceleration in this regard.</P>

      <P>The recent dialogue between the parties directly involved in the Cambodia problem and other concerned countries has given rise to hopes that prospects for a negotiated settlement have improved.  In this connection the process begun at the Jakarta informal meeting which was facilitated by the Government of Indonesia acting for ASEAN and which took place last July is an encouraging step towards a political solution of the conflict.  This meeting brought together in an informal way all the parties to the Cambodian conflict.  We support the constructive efforts made by ASEAN aimed at enabling the Cambodian people freely to decide their own future.  Nothing short of internationally supervised general and free elections can satisfy the genuine aspirations of the Cambodian people for self-determination and independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also support the central role that Prince Sihanouk is playing in the search for a negotiated political settlement.  It is clear that he will have an essential role in <Col N="1235" /> a new independent, democratic, neutral and non-aligned Cambodia.  However, while we support his efforts at national reconciliation among all Cambodians we would consider that any proposal such as Prince Sihanouk has made for a quadripartite coalition Government comprising the four Cambodian factions including the Khmer Rouge will be looked at with the greatest reservations.  The past record of the Khmer Roughe is so appalling that absolutely firm assurances that they will not dominate a coalition Government will be required.  While in the context of the current dialogue it is premature to speculate on the form of any political solution that may be arrived at, this is a consideration that will have to be kept in mind very firmly.</P>

      <P>On 8 December 1988, the Government issued a statement on Mr. <Col N="1238" /> Gorbachev's speech at the United Nations which included the following:</P>
      <P>Ireland warmly welcomes Mr. Gorbachev's statement that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in particular must no longer be an instrument of foreign policy: it is a long-established Irish view that an international order which is built upon mutual fear and military rivalry is inherently unstable.  Ireland greets with satisfaction Mr. Gorbachev's announcement of unilateral cuts in the armed forces of the Soviet Union over the next two years as a very encouraging beginning to the process of reducing the armed confrontation on the continent of Europe.  We hope that the talks which are planned within the CSCE context between the members of the North Atlantic Alliance and the members of the Warsaw Pact on conventional forces in Europe can begin at an early date and can reach a satisfactory conclusion by agreement on the reduction of these forces to lower levels.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its partners in the Twelve share the view that the conventional forces talks, which are due to take place within the framework of the CSCE after the conclusion of the Vienna meetings, should lead to a secure and stable balance of conventional forces in Europe at a lower level.  Our partners are aware of our conviction that such a balance must be reached through and actual reduction of weapons and forces.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the extra cost to the Garda Síochána Vote of pay and overtime arising from the <Col N="1243" /> deployment of gardaí on police duty outside the venue of the concert referred to is estimated at £71,000 approximately. As the Garda role outside the venue was the normal one of protecting persons and property, controlling traffic and generally maintaining law and order, the question of recouping the cost of the duties involved did not arise.</P>
      <P>Members of the Force were also engaged inside the venue on crowd-control duties under a long-established arrangement whereby the Garda authorities, at a charge to the organisers or promoters, make available the services of gardaí, at events such as football matches, race meetings, etc., to perform duties for which they would not normally be officially assigned.  The charge for this non-public duty at the concert in question came to £24,984, which has been paid by the organisers.</P>

      <P>Owing to EC budgetary difficulties, this year's allocation to Ireland under the Community's &ldquo;Free Food&rdquo; scheme was less than half of the amount which was granted for 1987.  This includes an extra 1.338 million ECU (over £1.0 million) which I have recently succeeded in obtaining for the scheme.</P>
      <P>By contrast, therefore, with the scheme which operated in 1987 it has been necessary to restrict eligibility for the current year's scheme to certain clearly defined categories of welfare recipients which were selected in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare.  This was the only way in which it could be ensured that eligible beneficiaries would obtain a meaningful allocation from the limited quantity available.</P>
      <P>The present scheme, as approved by the EC Commission, is restricted to:</P>
      <P>(1)  homeless persons accommodated in hostels and shelters run by voluntary organisations;</P>
      <P>(2)  certain social welfare recipients i.e.</P>
      <P>&mdash;recipients of long-term unemployment assistance who qualify for the fuel allowance,</P>
      <P>&mdash;recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance,</P>
      <P>&mdash;FÁS trainees who qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>For the reasons set out above, it would not be feasible to extend the existing coverage this year.</P>
      <P>Coverage for 1989 will be reviewed when the allocation to Ireland for next year is known.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to institute a system of compensation for poultry flocks affected by the recent outbreaks of salmonella enterititis.</P>
      <P>The poultry industry has voluntarily agreed that a slaughter policy at breeding farm level is the most effective way of securing the earliest clearance of salmonella enterititis from affected poultry flocks.  I strongly support this view and I have committed my Departments extensive resources to identifying the full extent of the problem and to facilitating the removal of the flocks involved.  The monitoring programme undertaken by my Department is proceeding satisfactorily. Most hatcheries and their breeding farm suppliers as well as egg packing stations have now been sampled and the results of analyses available to date are encouraging.  Slaughtering of affected flocks by the industry is proceeding as planned.</P>

      <P>The area in question is one in which a chronic TB problem existed for several years.  Extensive veterinary investigations eliminated other possible explanations of the persistence of the problem.  From June 1985 to December 1987, 57 badgers trapped in this area were subjected to post mortem examination and 16 were found to be infected with TB. The number of reactor animals removed from that area is as follows, 1985, 72; 1986, 5; 1987, 2 and 1988, Nil (to date). Details of this study have been provided to Professor Robert O'Connor of the ESRI for further analysis as part of the overall review he is currently undertaking for ERAD into research findings on the linkage between the badger and TB spread among cattle.</P>

      <P>Because of the current limitations on the availability of Exchequer funds, it is not possible for the present to proceed with a scheme for the designation of environmentally sensitive areas where farming practices appropriate to the preservation of the environment would receive special encouragement.</P>
      <P>However, the matter is one which I intend to keep very much in mind in the context of the availability to this country in due course of increased EC Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The particulars sought are set out in the following tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards my plans to encourage the production and marketing of vegetables in Ireland I would refer the Deputy to the <i>Programme for the Development of Horticulture</i> recently published by An Bord Glas.  This sets out details of a five-year plan aimed at increasing sales of Irish fruit and vegetables on the home <Col N="1256" /> market and increasing exports of these products to a combined value of IR£58 million.  Copies of the publication were sent to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

He received flat-rate unemployment benefit at the maximum rate appropriate in his case until 6 August 1988, when he had drawn 156 days of benefit.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 114, 129 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>At present child dependant allowances continue to be paid in respect of children up to age 21, who are in full-time education, for certain categories of social welfare recipients namely widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners wives.  For all other recipients an age limit of 18 years applies.  The estimated cost of extending this arrangement in the case of the children of all social welfare recipients would be £8 million in a full year.  If the extension were confined to students in second-level education the estimated cost would be £3.7 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of children up to age 16.  Where the child continues in full-time education this limit is extended to age 18 years and applies to all recipients of child benefit.  To extend the upper age limit from 18 to 21 years of age for parents who are on social welfare payments would cost an estimated £10 million in a full year and <i>pro rata</i> in 1989 depending on the date from which the change was introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the social insurance treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons was introduced in October 1987.  The extension enabled dependent spouses, mainly wives working in the home, to obtain dental, optical and aural benefits on the basis of their spouse's PRSI contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was considerable demand for this extension and an analysis of dental <Col N="1266" /> claims from dependent spouses in the meantime shows that their initial treatment needs are significantly greater than those who had already been covered by the scheme.  It is clear that many spouses had neglected their dental health previously because they could not afford the private fees.</P>
    <P>The Irish Dental Association opposed the extension and as a result many dentists were dissuaded from signing the new agreement covering the extended scheme.  Notwithstanding the embargo, however, 179 dentists signed the new agreement and some 95 per cent of these are actively treating dependent spouses. A total of 31,500 dental claims in respect of dependent spouses have been received up to 12 December 1988.</P>
    <P>The most significant proposal in the Report of the Joint Irish Dental Association-Department of Social Welfare Working Group, was the proposal of the Irish Dental Association concerning the introduction into the scheme, of a form of means testing on the basis of the Health Acts criteria.  This is not appropriate in the context of a contributory insurance based scheme.  The report also shows that over 62 per cent of those covered under my Department's scheme have incomes which come within the guidelines laid down for qualification for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the central barriers against reaching agreement between the Department and the Irish Dental Association have turned out to be the level of fees paid to the dentists under the whole scheme and the apparent opposition on the part of the Irish Dental Association to the existence at all of such a broadly based scheme for workers and their dependent spouses under the PRSI system.</P>
    <P>However, independently of the proposals made in the report the Irish Dental Association have recently submitted a claim for a fee increase under the existing scheme to cover inflation since 1987.  This claim is at present being examined in the Department.</P>
    <P>No communication has been received <Col N="1267" /> in the Department yet regarding the proposed withdrawal or partial withdrawal by dentists from the scheme.  It is hoped, however, that agreement on the overall issue may emerge in the context of discussions regarding the fee increase now applied for and this is being pursued.  I expect to meet with representatives of the Irish Dental Association shortly.</P>
    <P>It is realised that the continuing embargo by the IDA is causing inconvenience to some dependent spouses who are living a distance from participating dentists.  In order to minimise this inconvenience, the Minister arranged from the outset for the Department to supply the names of their nearest participating dentists to dependent spouses who wish to claim dental benefit.  Dependent spouses can obtain these names by contacting their local Social Welfare office or by telephoning the Department.  These arrangements have been in effect from the start and are operating well.</P>

      <P>Claimants to certain pensions and allowances such as long-term unemployment assistance, qualify for a Christmas bonus, EC beef distributed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and free fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was a long-term recipient of unemployment assistance and would have qualified for a Christmas bonus, free fuel and free beef if he had continued in receipt of this payment. However, as he is now in receipt of disability benefit, which is not a qualifying payment, he is no longer entitled to these bonuses.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that he is included in the Scheme of Social Insurance for the self-Employed, if eligible, a small enterprise farmer who has not yet been asked to complete a farm profile form, should complete and forward to the Department of Social Welfare a PRSI registration form (Form SE3 &mdash; PRSI Registration for Self-Employed People). A Form SE3 can be obtained at any local social welfare office, FAS office, Teagasc office, or post office.  Elegibility will be determined by the Department on the basis of the information supplied in the Form SE3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of social insurance for the self-employed is a compulsory scheme for those who are eligible.  A farmer who has not yet received a farm profile form is obliged to take the initiative himself in completing a Form SE3 unless he is satisfied that he is not eligible, for example if <Col N="1270" /> his income is below the prescribed figure of £2,500.</P>
    <P>A farmer who requires assistance with the way in which he should calculate his income should ask his local tax inspector for a farm profile form, which will assist him in determining the level of his income.</P>

Appeals against their decisions are dealt with in most cases by the programme managers of the boards.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare his views on the fact that applicants for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance have been asked to sign in advance declarations duly certified by the Garda Síochána on 5 December 1988 that they were unemployed and were not able to obtain suitable employment in respect of weeks ending the 6, 13, 20 and 27 December 1988; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Unemployed persons who reside more than six miles from a local office prove unemployment by attending each week at a signing centre, which in the vast majority of cases is the local Garda Station.  Payment of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit is authorised following receipt at the local office of the certified declarations.</P>
      <P>Because of the constraints placed on the Garda and local employment offices over the Christmas period, it is not possible to operate the normal weekly signing arrangements.  Instead, claimants were required to attend at their signing centre on Monday, 5 December to have their declaration of unemployment in respect of the four unemployment weeks ending on 6, 13, 20 and 27 December 1988 certified. The claimants were advised that if they subsequently found employment during this four week period, they should report the fact to their employment exchange as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that claimants were asked to attend at their signing <Col N="1280" /> centres once only instead of on four separate occasions.  It is not considered that special arrangements of this kind, which apply every year in December are unreasonable given that their sole purpose is to avoid any inconvenience or delay to claimants in receiving their unemployment payments over the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>The penalty clause for early redemption <Col N="1281" /> of loans to the Local Loans Fund applies in effect only in the case of fixed-interest loans.  It was designed to discourage borrowers from the fund from redeeming existing loans and reborrowing at the lower rate of interest if the rate of interest fell.</P>
      <P>I appreciate, however, that some local authorities are facing difficulties if many householders redeem mortgages early and the local authority has to continue paying the Local Loans Fund at a higher fixed interest rate while it relends the money to other purchasers at the current variable interest rate which is lower.</P>
      <P>It would not be justified to remove entirely penalties for early redemption of fixed-interest loans.  However, I am examining, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, possible ways of dealing with the loans to local authorities where there are a large number of early redemptions by householders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that Schedule E taxpayers may claim tax relief in respect of any ordinary annual contributions and special contributions (including additional voluntary contributions) paid to pensions schemes approved under Chapter II of Part 1 of the Finance Act, 1972 or to a statutory pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax relief in respect of the aggregate of such contributions by an employee in any year is limited to 15 per cent of the total remuneration for that year from the office or employment in respect of which <Col N="1287" /> the contributions are paid.  In this regard a special contribution may be treated as an ordinary annual contribution for the year in which it is paid or may be apportioned to such years as the commissioners direct.</P>
    <P>In the case of occupational pension schemes which do not provide facilities for members to pay additional voluntary contributions, the commissioners are prepared, subject to certain guidelines, to approve separately constituted individual pension arrangements to enable members to pay such voluntary contributions. Tax relief will at all times be subject to the 15 per cent limit already mentioned.</P>
    <P>Schedule E taxpayers who are not members of occupational pension schemes would be regarded as qualifying individuals for the purpose of effecting retirement annuity contracts under sections 235 and 235A of the Income Tax Act, 1967.

      <P>The payment was reduced because one of the pensioner's children had attained the age of 16 years and a certificate from a school that the child was continuing in full-time education was not received in the Paymaster General's Office.

      <P>With regard to the proposal for a Statute for the European Company we have, as my predecessor told this House recently, set about consulting all sides of industry and other interested parties about the provisions of this draft Statute. While we are still processing submissions received regarding this matter I feel certain that our approach to the worker participation and consultation proposals in the draft Statute will be similar to that which we hold with regard to the Fifth Company Law Directive; that is, open, constructive and flexible but always conscious of the views of both sides of industry, the employment factor and the implications of the proposals for investment in this country.</P>

      <P>I have no plans for the establishment of a national trade centre. The establishment of such a centre has been considered on a number of occasions in the past.  Because of considerations of doubtful cost benefit and potential conflict of interest with existing retail outlets, the concept has not been progressed further.</P>
      <P>In the promotion of manufactured goods and services, the international trend of successful exporting countries is towards fairs and exhibitions dealing with specific product categories rather than those dealing with a wide variety of products. Specific events are held at times which are calculated to maximise the interest of potential buyers having regard to their business peaks such as those determined by product seasons as, for example with fashion goods.  It will be appreciated that, in general, buyers have only time to go to exhibitions which are of precise relevance to them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the State trade promotion agencies, Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council, assist Irish firms to promote their goods and services at carefully chosen domestic and international events and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>In the lead up to Montreal it was also discussed by officials at the Article 113 Committee which deals with external commercial relations.  This is the main forum below ministerial level.  Both the Minister for Agriculture and Food and myself have been acutely aware of the threat to reduce subsidies on EC agricultural products and have all along given appropriate instructions to their officials who have been attending this committee.</P>

      <P>The making of regulations under section 2 of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and <Col N="1327" /> Protection) Act, 1988, is complex.  The regulations will, as appropriate, prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in a wide range of places and facilities, the definitions and designations of which have to be clear to ensure that the controls to be put in place are practical, effective, easily monitored and enforced.  The Deputy will appreciate the need for clarity where restrictions and prohibitions on individual activity is involved.</P>
      <P>In line with my promise to both Houses of the Oireachtas during the debate on the Bill, that I would consult relevant organisations and bodies on the draft regulations, proposals for implementing section 2 of the Act are being circulated by my Department and I am satisfied that given the nature of the proposed regulations there has not been a delay in their preparation.  I propose to have the regulations in place in January 1989 as a key element in my Department's programme for the EC's &ldquo;European Year Against Cancer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year a review of the range of food items available on the GMS was carried out by a group established by GMS (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>The group examined the range of food products available on the GMS taking retail price, clinical importance and usage into account.  The group recommended the removal from the GMS of a number of items which could not be considered to form a basic and essential part of patient diet.  Therefore, gluten-free biscuits and crackers, and a number of pasta products, among others, were removed from general availability on the GMS list.</P>
      <P>The products removed are low cost items, readily available in supermarkets and retail pharmacies.  Health boards do, of course, provide financial assistance towards the cost of requisites which are not available on the GMS scheme, if there is genuine financial hardship being incurred in their purchase.  Anyone who considers that the purchase of these items is causing them hardship should contact their local health board office to make application for assistance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 237 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>Determination of eligibility for a medical card in any particular case is a matter for the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in reaching a decision about a person's entitlement and to ensure uniformity of decisions in the different health boards.</P>
      <P>In deciding a person's entitlement all income from all sources is taken into account.</P>
      <P>The administration of small farmers' assistance is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  However, I understand that, in accordance with statutory requirements, when assessing means for the purpose of this assistance income from investments or other capital is taken into account and the capital itself is disregarded. The Deputy will appreciate that when assessing means for medical card purposes the availability of capital may well be taken into account by the Chief Executive Officer of a health board when deciding whether a person is, without undue hardship, able to arrange general practitioner, medical and surgicial services for himself and his dependants.</P>

    <P>I am not aware of the activities of the allergist to whom the Deputy referred or of any grave disquiet expressed by the <Col N="1334" /> medical profession about such activities. Treatment for allergies in the public health service in Ireland is provided by registered general practitioners and there is no separate grade of non-medically qualified allergists employed in the public health service.</P>
    <P>All general practitioners employed in the health service must be registered in the register of medical practitioners maintained by the Medical Council as required by the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  It is an offence for a person to falsely represent himself to be a registered medical practitioner when he is not so registered and a person convicted of falsely representing himself as a registered medical practitioner is liable to a fine and/or imprisonment under the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that S.I. No. 18 of 1987, Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987, provides a comprehensive system of control of medical preparations which may only be sold or supplied against a prescription issued by a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist.</P>
    <P>In addition to the medical profession nurses, dentists, opticians and pharmacists employed in the public health service are required to be registered with the appropriate registration bodies.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Employment Equality Agency has referred under section 20 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 certain age limit qualifications for employment in health boards and in public voluntary hospitals to the Labour Court.  The Employment Equality Agency has been requested to furnish evidence to support its contention that the imposition of an upper age limit results in indirect discrimination on the basis of marital status.  In this context, my Department is considering the matter.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by my seeing a deputation at this time.</P>

    <P>There is freedom of access to the existing signposted amenity and other forest facilities.  My Department, however, following on a series of claims for personal injuries, allegedly caused in State forests, have temporarily suspended the granting of further permission for walks to traverse State forest lands pending an examination of the feasibility of developing <Col N="1354" /> legislation which will give greater protection to the State and other landowners.
