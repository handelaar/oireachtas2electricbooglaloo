    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will publish a statement of his priorities in relation to the development of the arts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall aims are to assist the development of our artists, both creative and performing, and to provide support for them; educating the public in the appreciation of the arts; developing the national cultural institutions, and on a regional basis, assisting the development of art and culture groups and bodies, arts centres, threatres and similar locations for cultural activities.  The priorities for development must seek to balance these competing needs so that further progress can be made concurrently in all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to his priorities for the arts is the Taoiseach in a position to outline that proper funding will be established and announced rather than the <i>ad hoc</i> system of the disbursement of lottery funds which we have at present? Does he envisage that those interested, involved and dependent on the arts will be in a position to know their financial circumstances from year to year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1978" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there are a number of major cultural institutions for which my Department have responsibility and to which we have had to resort to lottery funds to support and carry out necessary works, and they are in a category by themselves.  It would be my intention from now on to allocate all moneys for the arts to the Arts Council and give them full jurisdiction over the distribution.  As the Deputy knows, in the early stages of the lottery there were instances where both the Arts Council and the lottery were giving assistance, and this was not satisfactory.  It is my intention that from now on my Department would withdraw totally from this area and whatever resources are available from the lottery would be given to the Arts Council to distribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach said and I take that to mean there will be additional direct funding to the Arts Council in 1989.  We have had a number of specialist reports for the arts in relation to dance and theatre and we had the Benson report on the arts education.  Does the Taoiseach see as part of his Department's priorities the recommendations of the Benson report, have they been totally accepted and will they be funded in the coming years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it that they would serve as a guide rather than that they have been totally accepted.  I am increasingly of the opinion that we should establish a goods Arts Council and entrust to them the task of holding the balance and deciding the priorities between the different sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I acknowledge the fact that the Taoiseach has adopted a Fine Gael proposal in that he is allocating full responsibility for the allocation of lottery funds in regard to the arts to an indepenent body?  Will this principle apply in respect of other areas in which lottery funds are allocated, for example sport and recreation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At present it appears that education in music and theatre are only available in the form of private tuition, obviously with costs involved.  Would the Taoiseach put into his priorities that musical and art education should be included in the curriculum for second level schools in particular, rather than being available only to people who can afford it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil cinneadh foirmiúil déanta acu fós faoin ábhar sin.  Tá dóchas againn, áfach, go gcuirfidh an tÚdarás seirbhís héileacaptair ar fáil arís do Thoraigh agus d'Inis Bó Finne le linn an gheimhridh-earraigh 1988-89.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>An féidir leis an Aire Stáit a chur ina luí ar an Údarás go mbeadh sé an-allta aon ghearradh siar a bheith ar an tseirbhís seo i rith an gheimhridh? Chomh maith leis sin, bhí an tseirbhís ar siúl anuraidh ar feadh chúig mhí agus bhí sí tosaithe faoin am seo.  Go dtí <Col N="1980" /> seo i mbliana níor cuireadh tús leis an tseirbhís go fóill, agus an bhféadfadh an tAire a rá cén uair a bheifear ag cur tús leis an tseirbhís seo don gheimhreadh do Oileán Thoraigh?</P>

      <P>Tá ábhar na tuarascála sin fós á mheas i gcomhar le moltaí éagsúla atá faighte.  Ní miste a lua go bhfuil ceist na tuarascála fite fuaite anois le ceist an airgid a ceadaíodh ó fháltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta ar mhaithe le teilifís trí Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil an dá cheist á meas i dteannta a chéile.</P>
      <P>Is ó RTÉ amháin a lorgaíodh tuairimí go foirmiúil ar an tuarascáil agus tá an scéal fós faoi chaibidil leo.  Fuarthas moltaí ó Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ó ghrúpa i gConamara, chomh maith le roinnt daoine aonaracha, agus tá an méid a bhí le rá acu uile á chur san áireamh.</P>
      <P>Déanfar cinneadh a luaithe is féidir maidir le moltaí na tuarascála.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireadh an cheist seo síos don Aire Cumarsáide, mar ní bhaineann sí leis an nGaeltacht amháin. Bhíos ag caint faoi RTÉ, ach cuireadh chuig Aire na Gaeltachta í.  Mar sin, níl an tAire in ann an cheist ina hiomlán a fhreagairt.  Nach bhfuil sé sin ceart?  Níl an tAire ach ag caint faoi Theilifís na Gaeltachta.  Níl sé ag caint faoi RTÉ agus níos mó Gaeilge a bheith ar na cláracha ar RTÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuir mé in iúl san fhreagra go bhfuil an rud á phlé le RTÉ <Col N="1981" /> maidir le tuilleadh Gaeilge a chur ar fáil, go bhfuil moltaí ar leith acu maidir leis an tseirbhís seo.  Tá sé sin ráite agam anseo ó fuaireadh an tuarascáil.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil ábhar ar bith atá pléite chomh minic sa Teach seo le tamall anuas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Sílim gurb é an tAire Cumarsáide a fuair an tuarascáil anuraidh, bliain ó shin anois, 1987 sílim, agus níl faic socruithe go fóill idir ceachtar acu, an tAire Cumarsáide nó an tAire féin. Níl aon rud socruithe go fóill.  An é sin an rud atá á rá aige?  Níl sé socruithe an mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeltachta ann nó an mbeidh níos mó cláracha Gaeilge ar RTÉ.  Cathain a bheidh socrú déanta faoi sin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin an rud atá ráite agam sa bhfreagra, go bhfuil an rud á phlé le RTÉ agus le daoine eile ón nGaeltacht, le daoine aonaracha agus le grúpaí áirithe ón nGaeltacht, agus nach bhfuil cinneadh deimhnithe déanta go fóill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil sí á meas le os cionn bliana anois.  An bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire go ndúirt an Taoiseach anuraidh gur mhaith leis siúd Teilifís na Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil ach nár cheap sé go mbeadh sé in ann í a chur ar fáil i 1987?  Sin an rud a dúirt an Taoiseach.  Anois tá an tAire ag rá nach mbeidh sí againn i 1989.  An é sin an scéal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is ceist an-mhór an rud seo, agus mar atá ráite anseo agamsa cheana, ní féidir dul ar aghaidh le rud mar seo gan gach uile shórt a bheith scrúdaithe i gceart.  Ní maith ar bith seirbhís de chineál éigin a chur ar fáil mura mbíonn glacadh ag pobal na tíre nó ag muintir na Gaeltachta léi agus caithfimid cuimhneamh, cibé rud a chuirfí ar siúl, go mbeidh sé seo ag cur in aghaidh cláracha eile atá ar an teilifís i láthair na huaire.  Sin an fáth go gcaithfimid a bheith cinnte nuair a rachaidh an rud amach go mbeidh cruth ceart air.</P>

Tá pleananna maidir leis an gcéibh a bhfuil cineál easaontais fúthu. Síleann muintir na háite gur cheart plean faoi leith a chur ar fáil.  Fuair siad innealtóir ó Albain, mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, le scrúdú a dhéanamh ar phlean eile agus dúirt sé go gcosnódh sé thart ar £850,000.  Níl Roinn na nOibreacha Poiblí ag tacú leis sin.  Deir siad go gcosnódh sé i bhfad níos mó ná sin.  Tá an rud ar fad á phlé i láthair na huaire.  Maidir leis an aerstráice, bhí ceist talaimh ann. Ní raibh réiteach faighte ar cé ar leis an talamh, agus choinnigh sé sin siar muid maidir leis an aerstráice.  Ach sin iad an dá phríomh rud a bhí i gceist.

      <P>While I am aware of general complaints by Irish fishermen about quota restrictions, no borrower has advised an Bord Iascaigh Mhara that he is unable to meet his repayments for this reason.  At the end of September this year, the level of collections on BIM loan accounts is the same as for the corresponding period last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is <Col N="1988" /> correct to say that they are tied up for five or six days of the week.  I appreciate that there are problems with quota restrictions. I would certainly like to think that all of the fish we are landing would be non-quota species, but because of the common fisheries policy we entered into on 1 January 1983 we find ourselves in this situation and we will not be in a position to review the matter until 1991-92. The management regime we introduced on assuming power in March of last year has worked to the best advantage of the industry.  The repayments this year are at a very high level, as they were last year.  I would reassure the House that there has been an improvement in the ratio of collections to debts in respect of the direct board loans contingent during 1987.  The overall level of repayments to charges was 80 per cent in 1987 compared with 75 per cent in 1986.  There are special difficulties, operational and otherwise, affecting some 7 per cent of the vessels on which the board has outstanding loans.  If the loans in respect of these vessels were not taken into account the ratio of collections to charges would be 93 per cent.  I would like to pay tribute to all of those in the industry who are making such an effort.  It is at an all-time high.  We would certainly like it to be 100 per cent.  It is my job and the job of BIM to ensure that we have a 100 per cent return as that money is used on a roll over basis for new boats and the refurbishment of boats coming into the fleet.  I am reasonably satisfied taking into consideration the quota restrictions referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy may or may not be <i>au fait</i> with the number of boats from the west coast which are fishing in the Celtic Sea at the moment. <Col N="1989" /> I received a request from sections of the industry last week to close the Celtic Sea because of the quality of the fish there.  I was not happy to accede to that request because I am quite satisfied that the quality is reasonable.  The price being paid there at the moment, from £14 to £18 a box, reflects the demand that is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Molloy has corresponded with the Department and that a number of individuals are concerned.  We have a regime in place and there is still a reasonable quantity left in the Celtic Sea.  As a result of the closing of the area around the Blaskets this year, south of Cobh next year and south of Dunmore East, known traditionally as Bagginbun, we achieved an additional 3,000 tonnes which was welcomed by the industry, the processors and the fishermen.  We have no intention of closing this area and will only do so if we find the quality of fish is not reasonable and that they were not being sold for human consumption but were going to make fish meal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerning the inadequate fishing allocations, the Minister is probably aware of the latest proposals by the EC to have the mackerel quotas reduced next year from 79,000 to 62,000 tonnes.  This will have a disastrous effect on the fishing industry in Donegal and Ireland.  Killybegs is in a particularly serious situation.  What steps do the Minister and the Government intend to undertake to counteract these proposals from the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in <Col N="1990" /> Brussels at a meeting of the Council of Ministers.  Some indications were given that it was, by and large, a meeting to decide on prices.  The meeting to decide quotas will be over the weekend of 9 and 10 December.  I fully concur with Deputy McGinley that this proposal will have serious effects on our industry because the 79,350 tonnes we have at the moment, together with other quotas and other swops we received, have brought us well in excess of 90,000 tonnes.  We are having difficulties on the west coast at this time, one of which is that quite a substantial amount of our quota was not landed into the country this year.  This is something that I will be taking a very serious view of in the future.  Any Government should ensure that the majority of fish is landed into the country and processed here so that jobs are created on-shore.  Unfortunately, because of weather, and maybe other conditions, almost half of the mackerel quota this year was landed on to luggers from eastern Europe.  This is something we will be looking at very closely.  We will have to try to entice the boats to return to shore where the price is much better.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 165 together.  There are nine marina development proposals with my Department at present, apart from Dún Laoghaire, and these will fall to be licensed under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  The applications are at various <Col N="1991" /> stages in a process operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister be a little more specific and outline to the House exactly where these nine applications have come from and what varying stages of development each of these is at?  Can the Minister explain to this House why there is no grant aid available for such developments while the Minister for the Marine has given us to understand that grant aid is available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The main role of the Department is to create a positive environment for such developments.  We are doing that.  All development proposals are considered by the foreshore section of the Department under sections 2 and 3 of the 1933 Act.  EC support may be available for structural development projects which may have a marina component but there is no direct grant aid available for a marina <i>per se.</i> However, if a marina is part of the overall development grant aid may be available.  I should like to tell the Deputy that there are five stages involved in the processing of applications.  The first stage is the receipt and processing of the application.  At the second stage further information may be required.  At the third stage an advertisement may have to be placed in the newspapers by an applicant, if that is recommended by the Department.  The next stage is when the Department may have to consider objections to the proposal and the decision making stage is the final one.  There are three proposals being considered under the heading &ldquo;further information&rdquo;, four under the stage where we consider objections and two are awaiting decisions.</P>

What promotional efforts are being undertaken by the Department in England, Europe and the United States in order to attract big yachts here so as to make the marinas viable propositions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unwise to give the names of the two projects. Applications come from harbour authorities and individuals.  I should like to tell the Deputy that one of the projects awaiting decision is Dunbur in County Wicklow and the second is at Cheekpoint in County Waterford.  I should like to repeat that the main role of the Department is to create a positive environment for such a development.  Marinas should be commercial propositions.  Most of the applicants are aware that grants are not available for such projects unless they form part of a harbour development.  In such cases applications come from harbour authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I could understand the Deputy's concern if we had not received any application but we have <Col N="1993" /> received nine applications.  I have advised the Deputy that two of these applications are at an advanced stage in the process. I do not think the Deputy should be critical of the Department if we seek further information.  We must take the common good into consideration and take into account any objections to such projects. We must ensure that marinas do not affect navigation, traditional sea harvesters or existing amenities.  It is accepted that we are creating an environment for investment in such projects. We have been told that by the year 2000 the greatest single industry will be that of leisure and we hope that marinas here will benefit from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1986 the Minister ordered a public inquiry into the designation of the area for aquaculture. The inquiry was held in Killybegs and the initial part of the proceedings was rather acrimonious.  The report which was made available to the Minister, dealt with Inver, St. John's Point and McSwyne's Bay.  In February 1987 the Minister appointed to the Department immediately after the general election, my immediate predecessor, decided that Inver Bay should be designated.  The public inquiry covered all of the area, including that referred to by Deputy McGinley, St. John's Point.  We do not think it is necessary to hold a further inquiry because at the earlier inquiry we ascertained all the relevant information. Those concerned about the designation expressed their views at that inquiry.  The main problem in aquacultural development is fear of the unknown and people should be made aware of what is involved. We have received letters of concern from the various people.  A decision is imminent in relation to the designation and all of the concerns were taken into consideration. I can tell the House that the area I am proposing is smaller than the area for which the applicants applied.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.  I am at present reviewing port policy in the context of the enlarged Community Structural Funds, the completion of the <Col N="1997" /> internal market and the opening of the Channel Tunnel.  The twelve harbour authorities including Waterford Harbour Commissioners which cater for virtually all of the throughput at commercial harbours for which I have responsibility have at my request submitted their development plans covering the next five years. The plans are being considered for inclusion in operational programmes at national or sub-national level which are at present being prepared for submission to the EC.  These programmes will be submitted in conjunction with the national development plan.  Details of the time-scales involved for the submission of the national development plan were given by the Minister for Finance in his reply to Questions Nos. 38 and 40 on 25 October 1988.  That reply also indicated the time-scale for an indication by the European Commission of the extent to which it is willing to provide assistance from the Structural Funds in respect of the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>The address in Question No. 10 is not properly worded, it should read &ldquo;Bellview, County Kilkenny&rdquo; as Bellview is on the Kilkenny side of the estuary.  The Minister in his reply stated that 12 harbours had been singled out as being eligible for applications for EC funds.  Have all those harbour authorities actually filed applications and plans for the works they wish to carry out and, if so, is he going to put the applications to the Commission in Europe in the order in which they have been received or in a certain order which he thinks is most desirable?  Will the most worthy cases be presented first or will all 12 go together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary that all 12 go together.  I will not detain the House with the names of the 12 but they include Waterford and various others in the south-east.  We have looked for some further information.  The plans have been submitted to us and have been costed by the harbour authorities.  It would be wrong to submit them on a priority basis, on the basis on which we received them.  We will certainly submit <Col N="1998" /> all of them if we feel they would qualify on a cost benefit analysis.  We must, of course, be convinced that expenditure on them would be justified.  In short, we will do an analysis on them when all the information is available.  They must be submitted before the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of the 12 port authorities have already submitted plans and can the Minister say if any of these plans have already been passed on to Brussels?  I got the impression from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that Cork harbour has already been singled out for some grants.</P>

      <P>We have received applications and proposals from the 12 but we have reverted to them, looking for further information.  Whatever the Deputy may read in the paper none of them has been submitted.  I am sure the House will agree that it would be foolish and irresponsible of us to submit them for the sake of submitting them.  A cost benefit analysis will be done.  As stated by me and by the former Minister for Finance they have to be submitted before the end of March and we must have a response from the Commission within six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will commence shortly after we have a response which, I understand, according to the regulation must be before the end of next year, in September, we would hope.  The intention is that developments on those applications which prove to be successful would commence at an early date because the development of these harbours is vitally important.  If we look at the Community as a whole we will see that we will be the only country on the <Col N="1999" /> periphery.  Because of the advent of the Channel Tunnel the UK will be linked to the Community and the development of our harbours is, therefore, of vital importance.  I am well aware from experience in the past of the importance of the harbour to which the Deputy has referred.  We knew full well that it was the one at Bellview in County Kilkenny which he was referring to.</P>

We are particularly interested in the results of their analyses because of marine life.  We are in constant touch with both the Department of the Environment and the Nuclear Energy Board.  In relation to shellfish the Department commenced a shellfish sanitation programme, the objective of which is to monitor not only the shellfish themselves but also the waters in which they live. The Department of the Environment have responsibility in this matter but we have a particular interest in it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17, 39, 44, 157, 158 and 166 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are convinced that <Col N="2002" /> the potential for water sports and sailing and tourism development based on such activity has been badly neglected.  They are of the view that the amenity of Dún Laoghaire should be enhanced, facilities for sports people improved, and the opportunity for employment in the area increased.</P>
    <P>On 23 June 1988, the Minister announced the establishment of a planning review group for Dún Laoghaire. The task of the group was to ensure that the long term as well as the short term options for the development of the harbour were properly examined and planned. The report of the group was presented to the Minister by the Chairman, Professor Dermot McAleese on Friday last, 25 November.  EC Council activities prevented the Minister from examining the report in detail.  However, from a preliminary reading, it appears to be an excellent report and Professor McAleese is to be commended for it.</P>
    <P>I understand that about 70 submissions were made to the group.  These covered all aspects of harbour usage, development, and management, and considered such issues as the future of the ferry terminal in Dún Laoghaire, leisure facilities, such as marinas and sailing and developments involving the Carlisle Pier and the infill of the area west of the West Pier. Many of the submissions contained ideas for developments in the harbour.  A number were from organisations who might be prepared to invest in developments in the harbour area.  I consider it desirable that the report be published and I intend to have this done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The report contains a number of suggestions concerning the development of marina facilities in the harbour.  I do not think that individual sections of the report should be read in isolation but that it should be studied in its entirety.  I hope the report can be adopted as a blueprint for the future development of the harbour and I will have it examined in detail over the next few weeks, with this in mind.</P>
    <P>As regards the time to complete the report, Professor McAleese felt that the <Col N="2003" /> subject could not easily be broken into two parts as requested by the terms of reference.  I am sure that when the report is examined it will be obvious that the additional time was well spent.</P>

If I were to give such a commitment now, I feel it would have a knock on effect in that all those who made submissions as well as others would want a second opportunity.  I certainly do not want to give such a commitment but I will look at it.

      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister on 25 October asking for similar information and I was assured by him that the information would be made available in early November but to date we have not received it.  Is the Minister of State in a position to at least give us the figures for the number of licences <Col N="2006" /> purchased in some of the fishery board areas?  Perhaps he is not in a position to give the figures for all areas but he may be in the position to give the figures for some of them.  Would it be true to say at this stage that this information is being withheld because the figure for the number of licences purchased is not the number which the Minister expected when he introduced the legislation?  Is that not a more true reflection of the position rather than it being a case of the figures not being available?</P>

      <P>I detect that there is harmony in the House today but I feel that the Opposition spokesperson is being mischievous when she suggests that the figures are being withheld deliberately. We are here to make the facts available and if the figures had been made available to me the Deputy would have received them.  There is nothing mischievous about it but it is being mischievous, instead of falling in behind us and supporting legislation which was passed almost unanimously by this House, to advise people that they should continue with their campaigns.  Indeed when the bells rang in this House everyone responded at that time and no vote was taken.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to the Dáil on 8 November last, my Department have at present 660 applications for marine fish farms on hands for the whole State.  Many of these projects have been authorised by fish culture licences from the former Fisheries Department, draft foreshore licences by the former Communications Department as well as by the aquaculture licences issued by my Department.  I do not have a breakdown to hand.  Public inquiries have been held in respect of four additional areas but it has not been possible to designate any of these yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have drawn up a programme of new designations involving approximately 15 areas in Counties Cork, Wexford, Donegal, Waterford and Sligo. Nine of these areas have been formally notified by advertisement in national and local newspapers and I am considering at <Col N="2008" /> present whether the response in each case indicates a public inquiry.</P>

      <P>If the state of play at present is at such an infantile stage and if positive progress is not taking place in this area, how do the Minister and his Department envisage the creation of massive employment in this area between now and 1991, as was outlined by the Minister for the Marine at the launch of the BIM fisheries plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate that if we advance as rapidly during the next few years as we have done during the past few years we will achieve this.  Prior to this, licences for foreshore aquaculture had to be issued by the Department of Communications. This was a very cumbersome method of issuing the licences.  Even though it took some time, this method is now more streamlined and I can assure the Deputy that there will be no delay in issuing licences.  However, we must respect the fears of those people who object to the issuing of these licences.  We must take these into consideration and if the Minister thinks it necessary then a public inquiry will be held.  I can assure the Deputy that we will try to ensure that the applications are dealt with expeditiously and that decisions are taken as quickly as possible.  If there are objections after the Minister designates an area there will be <Col N="2010" /> a further 28 days during which objections can be raised and heard before the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I have stated on many occasions &mdash; and I am glad of the opportunity to restate it &mdash; that aquaculture should develop in harmony with other interests, including the wild fishery.  To this end, my Department regulates aquaculture development in accordance with the Fisheries Act, 1980, which provides for the licensing of projects within areas which have been formally designated for aquaculture.</P>
      <P>In relation to the disposal of dead fish, my Department requires fish farmers to notify it of suspected disease appearance or abnormal losses or mortalities within 48 hours; the dead fish must be disposed of in a lime pit or other manner advised by my Department.  Where local authority facilities are used, it must be by prior arrangement and with the approval of the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are investigating recent incidents in Counties Mayo and Galway.  I can assure the House that neither incident posed a threat to the wild fishery.  It is my intention, nevertheless, to ensure that conditions relating to the hygienic disposal of dead fish are adhered to; I am in contact with the industry in this connection and I am confident of <Col N="2011" /> their support.  Where malpractices can be proven, I will take severe action against offending parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that further incidents of the dumping of diseased fish have come to light since these questions were put down, may I ask the Minister what steps he is taking to ensure that the regulations to which he referred are being adhered to?  Is the Minister satisfied that the regulations are being adhered to because the instances of fish dumping are becoming more numerous? What steps are being taken to monitor the situation to ensure that this will not continue?  It is one thing to have regulations but it is another thing to ensure that they are being enforced. Would the Minister not agree that these regulations are not of much use if the wherewithal to enforce them is not being provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House that the necessary action will be taken to ensure that those disposing of dead fish will comply with the regulations.  Again, I would refer to the necessity for people to dispose of the fish in a lime pit, which I think is the most obvious way, or, where local authority facilities are used, to make prior arrangements with the approval of the local authority concerned.  Since the recent disposal of fish in County Galway, which Deputy Pattison referred to, I instructed senior officials of my Department to speak with the Chief Executive of the ISGA, the Irish Salmon Growers Association.  We wrote to him and received a reply from him yesterday.  We will have a meeting with him tomorrow and the Deputy can be assured that we shall do everything possible to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of what happened prior to the tabling of the parliamentary questions. Of course, the ultimate step which can be taken &mdash; and, if necessary, it will be done &mdash; is that licences can be withdrawn. However, I am convinced that the company responsible for the disposal which we read of and saw on television <Col N="2012" /> are a very reliable company.  We will have discussions with them in order to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the plans he has to encourage Irish shipowners to buy more vessels; and if he views an increase in the percentage of cargo carried to and from Ireland by Irish flag vessels as important in the light of the impending Single European Market in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the package of incentives for shipping introduced last year.  The Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987, provides for grant-aid of up to 25 per cent towards the purchase of new or secondhand vessels which are not more than seven years old.  To date, £1.546 million has been paid in respect of three new buildings and a fourth, already registered under the Irish flag, will be grant-aided next year.  In addition, commitments in respect of two refrigerated (reefer) ships have enabled their acquisition and registration in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to direct grant-aid, access has been provided for shipowners to the business expansion scheme.  To date, two vessels have been acquired with business expansion scheme funding and plans to <Col N="2013" /> purchase two more in this way are well advanced.  Corporation tax for shipping has been reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and there now exists the possibility of NADCORP assistance for viable shipping projects.  In all, eight additional ships totalling 17,000 deadweight tonnes have been added to our national fleet as a result of the incentives package and approximately 120 new jobs have been created.</P>
    <P>These measures show the real commitment of this Government to the Irish shipping industry and in the context of the impending single European market clearly reflects the high priority which the Government place on the expansion of our strategic shipping capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that shipping interests are not satisfied with the funding available at the moment for the purchase of vessels? Would he not agree that it is most important that shipowners be encouraged to buy more vessels in order to improve the invisible earnings gained from cross-trading and to provide more jobs for those at sea and ashore?  Have his Department any plans to introduce in the forthcoming Finance Bill a change in section 28 which defines the activities that would disqualify a ship, adjusting that to include offshore supply vessels, oceangoing tugs and lift-on lift-off vessels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that those in the industry are not fully satisfied. Who is fully satisfied if he is not getting 100 per cent?  We have taken steps and we have provided over the last two years £1.545 million towards this.  Eight additional ships have come on stream, totalling some 17,000 deadweight tonnes. To put the matter in perspective, our merchant fleet at present amounts 167,100 tonnes deadweight.  If we deduct from that 50,000 tonnes which is UK-owned, that gives a figure of approximately 118,000 tonnes.  Since assuming office we have increased that tonnage by 17 per cent.  We have no intention of changing the section of the Act to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2014" /> I would take this opportunity of making a plea to all those in industry where possible to use the services of Irish shipowners for the carriage of both imports and exports.  I am particularly pleased that we have coming on stream for the first time two reefer boats which will be able to transport frozen fish, an area in which I am particularly interested, from here to many parts of the world.</P>

    <P>To get this development strategy underway, the Government have allocated an additional £1.7 million to BIM in 1989 in respect of current and capital grant-in-aid.  The board will also be in a position to commit funds forward up to 1991 in accordance with their development strategy.</P>
    <P>The development strategy sets out the detailed policies to be applied for the development of the processing sector by the various State agencies concerned. <Col N="2016" /> Capital grants of up to 50 per cent are available from EC.  Structural Funds and up to 25 per cent from the relevant State agencies, for suitable projects.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to predict with any degree of certainty the precise outlay which will be required in this regard from Exchequer-financed sources.  This will depend on the capital intensity etc. of the specific projects involved.  Recent experience suggests that this outlay could be of the order of £6-£8 million which would be met as part of the total industrial promotions budgets of these State agencies.</P>
    <P>NADCORP are already involved in the processing sector and will have my full support in further developing that role.</P>

In aquaculture, where we have investment in vessels, we have stipulated in the programme that we are anxious to have 12 all-weather white fish vessels which can go to Rockall and the Porcupine Bank and bring back additional white fish which is necessary. We will also be concentrating very much on the non-quota species which are, blue whiting, horse mackerel, argentines.  We <Col N="2017" /> shall try to ensure that as many fish as possible are processed for human consumption. By doing so there is the knock-on effect on processing onshore.  I am quite confident that we can achieve this objective.</P>

My Department were requested to nominate a departmental representative or representatives for each working group and this has been done.

      <P>I propose to take the four Private Notice Questions together.  For obvious reasons it is not normal practice to disclose whether warrants of this kind exist in relation to a particular individual.</P>
      <P>However, given the exceptional circumstances of this case, I can confirm that warrants for the arrest of Father Patrick Ryan were received by the Garda Commissioner from the London Metropolitan Police at 3 a.m. on Saturday, 26 November.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Acts, 1965 and 1987, the warrants and associated documents furnished by the British authorities are being considered by the Attorney General.  I am advised by the Attorney General that it is not yet possible to say when that process will be completed but that it will, of necessity, take some time.</P>
      <P>The question of the execution of the warrants does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the Attorney General to decide what information he requires to discharge his functions under the legislation, which provides specifically for the Attorney General forming his opinion, &ldquo;having considered such information as he deems appropriate&rdquo;.  Any documentation or other information which the <Col N="2020" /> Attorney General might take into consideration are, therefore, matters which come solely within the realm of the statutory functions assigned to him under the recent legislation.  It would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I could not give any undertaking that the Attorney General's conclusions in the case and his reasons for reaching those conclusions would be made public.  Such an undertaking would create a precedent which would not be in the public interest and there is an obvious possibility that publication might also be prejudicial to the interests of the person who is the subject of the warrants.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with any supplementary questions that may arise, I would remind Deputies of the content of section 4 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  That section prohibits communications with the Attorney General and other specified persons for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision to give a direction under that Act &mdash; that is, of course, communication other than the proper communication of information relevant to the giving of a direction.  I am confident that Deputies will observe the spirit of that provision in the course of anything further that is said here today on this matter.</P>

I further wish to ask the Minister to inform the House if the warrants received by the Irish authorities for the extradition of this person are identical <Col N="2021" /> to those preferred to the Belgian authorities and whether any guarantees were given to the Belgian authorities, or to Father Ryan or his legal representatives.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the <Col N="2168" /> terms of the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom concerning the Delimitation of Areas of the Continental Shelf between the two countries, signed at Dublin on 7th November, 1988, as laid before the House on 25th November, 1988. </P>
    <P>The Continental Shelf is the natural prolongation of the land territory out under the sea until it plunges to the deep ocean floor.  The Continental Shelf doctrine is a relatively new feature of international law.  Up to the early nineteen hundreds, coastal states were still only entitled to a territorial sea of three nautical miles.</P>
    <P>In the 1920s however, technological advances enabled states to begin exploring and exploiting the seabed of the shallower waters around their coasts for mineral resources, particularly oil.  This development of offshore drilling needed regulation and, as a consequence, international lawyers began to give attention to the question of jurisdiction over the seabed.  A number of different proposals were formulated, including the suggestion that ownership of the seabed could only be established by exploration and occupation.  In the United States, however, different reasoning prevailed in the Truman Proclamation of 28 September 1945, which was the product of growing concern as to the future regulation of offshore drilling.  This document was cautious and tentative, but it asserted an intrinsic right to jurisdiction independently of occupation.  Having recited the need for regulation of the exploitation of the seabed, it went on to say that the United States regarded the natural resources of the shelf as appertaining to the United States and subject to its jurisdiction and control.  It reserved the waters above the shelf as high seas.</P>
    <P>Over the next decade the Truman Declaration came to be regarded as the current legal formulation on ownership of the Continental Shelf and its natural resources.  This viewpoint was consolidated by the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf 1958 and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982. <Col N="2169" /> The question of division of the common Continental Shelf, on which Ireland and Britain are situated, has been the subject of concern to successive Governments for a very long time.  The need to establish clearly the areas over which each side exercises jurisdiction became increasingly important as the search for oil and gas accelerated with the advancement of technology in this field.</P>
    <P>International law requires that delimitation of overlapping claims must be achieved by peaceful means and suggests various procedures in that regard including negotiation, conciliation or various forms of independent judicial adjudication.</P>
    <P>In addition international law provided a primary method for delimitation based on a median or equidistance line.  This method proved very satisfactory for many countries where the determining features on each coast were similar and many international agreements between neighbouring states were concluded on that basis.  However for other countries, including Ireland, this approach would have produced a result weighted heavily against us because of the nature of the Irish coastline, particularly along the east coast, when compared to the heavily indented west coast of Britain.  In the north-west the situation of many small British islands would also have produced a very prejudiced result.</P>
    <P>Because of the very varying geographical, geological and geomorphological differences around the world, it was recognised that such a simplistic rule as that of a median line would not always provide a satisfactory outcome and international law has developed in an effort to produce more universally applicable guidelines.</P>
    <P>The developments in the law began essentially with the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 1968 in a judgment relating to delimitation in the North Sea.  In its judgment the court rule that the median line rule, which is contained in the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and which had been widely applied <Col N="2170" /> up to that time, was not a rule of customary international law.  It could not, therefore, bind countries which were not parties to the Geneva Convention. Ireland is not a party to that convention.</P>
    <P>Subsequent decisions of the court and other judicial tribunals, as well as state practice, have developed that approach. During the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the difficulty in establishing a universally acceptable rule for delimitation became clear.  The median line approach did not find favour at the conference.  The discussion of rules which would govern delimitation proved among the most controversial. One group of states maintained strongly that the median line should be the primary method of delimitation although they conceded it could be adjusted to meet particular circumstances. The opposing group, for which Ireland was spokesman in the discussion, argued that equitable principles should apply and that an equitable solution could not be achieved if states for which a median line would not produce an equitable solution had the burden of proof in relation to such a line weighted against them.  No agreement on any one alternative method emerged from the negotiations.  In the event the median line was not included among the provisions and no particular method is laid down in the 1982 convention.  The convention does require, however, that any delimitation effected by agreement, on the basis of international law, must achieve an equitable solution.</P>
    <P>State practice shows that, although the convention is not yet in force, it is widely supported and the development contained in it regarding an equitable solution is now generally accepted.  It favours Ireland's position which would have been prejudiced by a division based on the median line.</P>
    <P>Another practical problem relating to delimitation arises from the numerous small islands and rocks to be found in the seas of the world.  This is particularly true in the Pacific where many states themselves consist of groups of islands of varying sizes.  There were therefore two <Col N="2171" /> schools of thought in relation to islands and their importance when the question of generation of maritime zones was discussed &mdash; that is those which wanted every piece of rock which is above water at high tide to have its own continental shelf and economic zone.  Other delegations argued that even small islands should not generate such zones.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the second important element which emerged from the UN Conference.  It is something between the two positions in so far as rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own can have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. This is laid down in Article 121 of the Convention.  This development again favours Ireland's position.  While Deputies will be aware that the Convention is not yet in force, a greater number of countries are looking to it to guide them on these issues.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments at the UN Conference, the rules and precedents established over recent years by state practice and by international tribunals are extraordinarily varied to meet the different conditions which arise in relation to overlapping claims to continental shelf zones around the world. There is, as a result, a great wealth of material on which lawyers can draw when seeking to achieve an equitable solution. No overriding criterion has been laid down and it is therefore open to negotiators to consider all the different criteria which could be applied in a given situation. The present agreement is a result of the application of different criteria appropriate to the many areas involved.</P>
    <P>The negotiations which led to the agreement before the House, which deals solely with the continental shelf, began in the early seventies.  It proved a complex matter because of the vastness of the area concerned and the difficult geographical features of the two coastlines.  During the early period of the negotiations, but particularly in the last decade, the international law governing delimitation evolved rapidly.</P>
    <P>In 1977, when it became apparent that <Col N="2172" /> negotiations did not seem likely to produce any acceptable solution it was agreed that the matter should be submitted to international arbitration.  Negotiations then began on the terms of an arbitration agreement which would lay down the terms of reference for an arbitration tribunal, its rules of procedure and composition.  These negotiations proved difficult and moved very slowly.</P>
    <P>In 1986, given this lack of progress, the then Government reconsidered the question and in particular whether recourse to arbitration was the best method to pursue if we were to reach a satisfactory outcome within a reasonable timescale.  Following that reassessment, and in agreement with the British as to the best method to pursue, both sides agreed to recommence discussions with a view to reaching a negotiated settlement. It was believed, and in the event it has proved correct, that the recent developments in the international law governing delimitation, which provided new and helpful guidelines, would help the negotiators to achieve the satisfactory outcome which had eluded them on previous occasions.  The area to be delimited concerned the continental shelf in the Irish Sea, south and south-west of Ireland, together with the area in the north-west off the Donegal coast.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have had an opportunity to study the text of the agreement which was circulated to them immediately after signature.  Since that time copies have, of course, been available in the Library.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the text of the agreement.  As you will have noted it is the intention of the two Governments that the agreement open up further seabed areas for the petroleum industry in each country to undertake activities which, until now, were in dispute between our two countries.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the agreement deals first with the line in the Irish Sea.  The line continues southwards and then south-west between the two coasts extending as far south as latitude 46º 34' north/longitude 12º 12' west.  It reflects the geographical configuration of the coasts but does not give full weight, as <Col N="2173" /> can be seen from the illustration on map A, to some of the features on the British side such as the Scilly Isles, where a clear precedent existed for giving no more than half effect to these small islands.</P>
    <P>The line in the north-west, in Article 2, is more than 100 miles longer than the line referred to in Article 1.  Deputies will also notice from the illustrative map attached to the agreement that this line does not, as one might expect, run directly westward from Ireland but, in fact, moves inexorably north/west and, having started at a latitude of 55º 28' north, it finishes 634 miles later, a full 2º further at latitude 57º 28' north.</P>
    <P>The extent of British designation in that area of the Rockall trough and plateau was considerable although it did not extend as far west as Ireland's even more extensive designated area.  An undesignated area lay between the two designations.</P>
    <P>The agreed line referred to in Article 2 enters the British designated area at a number of points along the length of the line so that Ireland's gain in that area includes, not only most of the long strip undesignated by either party, but also captures a considerable amount of the British designated area.</P>
    <P>Deputies should also be aware that in 1977, and before the recent developments in the law which now govern delimitation, the then Irish Government counter-designated a small area across the British designation line in the north-west already designated by Britain.  In other words both Britain and Ireland had designated the same small sector of seabed.  This is the only area where a double designation occurred.</P>
    <P>The de-designation which will be required of Ireland as a result of the agreement will relate to most of that double-designated area.  The extent of the area to be designated is not only considerably less than that required to be de-designated by the British, but also it only relates to a double-designated area, while the British de-designation requires a pulling back from areas which they alone had designated in the past.  No similar de-designation occurs in the Irish case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> I would like now to direct the attention of the House to the rock known as Rockall. Deputies will note that no mention of it is made in this agreement and from a quick glance at the map attached to the agreement showing the proposed dividing line across the Rockall plateau, it is clear that the rock played no part in determining the direction of the line.  In effect, the line would not follow any different direction if the rock did not exist.</P>
    <P>Before I pass to comment on the remainder of the Agreement, I would also like to clarify the Government's position on the Rockall rock because misunderstanding of this rock and its role has, I believe, distorted the view taken of the facts and of the law in relation to the equitable division of the Rockall trough and plateau.  In fact the matter has gone so far that delimination of the continental shelf as a whole has often been referred to in common parlance, but quite incorrectly, as the &ldquo;Rockall Case&rdquo;.  I would like to dispel some of the myths about the rock and set down the correct facts.  Rockall is a conical rock, only about 83 feet in diameter, rising at most to a height of 70 feet.  To land on it by boat is very difficult and has rarely been achieved.  In addition, the rock is well over 200 miles from either mainland, and it must also be recalled that it is in fact nearer to the Outer Hebrides than the Donegal Coast.  In other words it is a totally isolated piece of granite in the vast Atlantic Ocean.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as I have just explained the rock is not of any significance and cannot be a factor in the division of any maritime zone between Britain and Ireland.  It has nothing to do with this delimitation case.</P>
    <P>When the agreement is approved by both sides and enters into force, the totally separate question of the Rockall rock will be considered further by the Government. Successive Governments have rejected purported British sovereignty over the rock, and the present Government continue to reject this British claim and have further rejected, in common with other countries, British claims to a <Col N="2175" /> 200 nautical mile exclusive fishing zone measured from the rock.  Having said this, of course I again stress that fishing zones of any kind are separate from, and do not form any part of, this agreement.</P>
    <P>The water column above the continental shelf and the exclusive fishery zone are not dealt with.  These maritime zones are governed by different rules of international law as compared with the continental shelf.  Different issues may have to be taken into consideration if the waters above the shelf and the fisheries zone are to be divided.  Consequently this agreement deals solely with the continental shelf are neither the water column above it nor the exclusive fishery zone is affected by it.</P>
    <P>In this debate I hope that Deputies will address only the terms of the agreement before the House in the knowledge that what is properly called the Rockall Rock question and the other matters I just referred to can be taken up at a later date.</P>
    <P>Returning to the subject of today's motion and the text of the agreement, I should mention also the possibility that mineral deposits which straddle the boundary line may be found.  A special provision is therefore included in Article 3 whereby the parties to the agreement are requested to negotiate an acceptable method for the joint exploitation of such minerals.  There are numerous precedents for such agreements relating to the various minerals which are subject to joint exploitation because of their nature. Should either party be fortunate in discovering such a deposit then discussions will take place to ascertain all the relevant details in relation to the fields in question so that a satisfactory method for exploitation, which does not prejudice either side, can be negotiated.</P>
    <P>As I explained earlier, the continental shelf is the prolongation of the land mass under the sea.  This prolongation of a continental landmass is also a form of boundary zone between two fundamentally different types of material that make up the earth's crust &mdash; the lighter thicker continental crust and the <Col N="2176" /> oceanic crust of heavier material.  The mineral resources of the oceanic crust are on the deep ocean floor and, therefore, in what is known as the international seabed area.  Exploitation of these resources is governed by a new internationally-established régime, laid down in the 1982 UN Convention of The Law of The Sea.  On the other hand, coastal state jurisdiction &mdash; which is what we are talking about &mdash; extends to the exclusive exploration and exploitation of the continental crust material, or continental shelf.  In determining the extent of the jurisdiction of the coastal state it is therefore imperative to identify scientifically where the outer edge of that continental material lies.  To acquire the relevant data extensive marine scientific research work will be required.</P>
    <P>Rules to help coastal states to establish the outer limit of their continental shelf are contained in the UN Convention. That Convention also provides for an international boundary commission which would make recommendations to the coastal state and ultimately ensure international recognition of the limits of the shelf established by a coastal state on the basis of sound scientific data.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not yet acquired the appropriate data to establish definitively or specifically the outer limit of the Irish continental shelf where this meets the international area.  For this reason, therefore, Article 4 of the agreement provides that the delimitation of the shelf between Ireland and Britain is without prejudice to the location of the outer limit of the continental shelf of either party at a later date.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides, as is usual for international agreements, for a procedure to bring it into force.  Under the terms of Article 5, it will be for both Governments to exchange notifications to the effect that all internal procedures have been completed and that the agreement may then enter into force.  This will be done when the appropriate British legislation has been enacted and following the approval of the agreement by this House.  At that stage, designation orders will be made by the Governemnt <Col N="2177" /> and laid before both Houses in accordance with section 14 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate, as I have done previously, that this agreement does not deal with Northern Ireland or the maritime zones off its coast.  In other words, Northern Ireland and its status are not affected by this agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that any consideration of the maritime zones of Northern Ireland cannot be dealt with separately from the question of Northern Ireland as a whole.  Any delimitation in that area, which would have to be in accordance with the rules of international law, would be further complicated by the political factors which exist.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention not to isolate that issue from the overall resolution of the Northern Ireland question.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must reiterate to Deputies that this agreement does not deal with the waters above the continental shelf or the exclusive fishery zone and neither deals with, nor is affected by, Rockall. Further, Northern Ireland and its status are similarly unaffected by the agreement. The agreement concerns the overall division of the continental shelf, including the Irish Sea and stretching to the western approaches and, in the North-west, the Rockall trough and plateau without any reference to the Rock. The Rock and its status are unaffected and are issues to be considered separately at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The agreement, which provides an equitable solution &mdash; and this is important &mdash; removes altogether the need to summit this complex matter to any form of independent judicial adjudication.</P>
    <P>As I hope I have made clear during this statement, the Government are satisfied that the terms of this agreement are of considerable benefit to Ireland.  Therefore I urge the House to approve the motion.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy Barry I might remind the House that the time constraints stipulate 20 minutes for each speaker.</P>

    <Col N="2178" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ended his remarks today by saying:</P>
      <P>The agreement, which provides an equitable solution, removes altogether the need to submit this complex matter to any form of independent judicial adjudication. </P>
      <P>We all applaud the fact that this agreement has been reached without the need to have recourse to that adjudication. However, that does not mean we will rubber stamp the agreement, allowing the motion be passed in this House. Indeed an article entitled &ldquo;Continental Shelf Agreement to be Debated&rdquo; by Mr. Charles Lysaght in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning adds further fuel to my concern in that regard.  I have been concerned at the kind of pressure being exercised by the Government side to have this motion taken very quickly.  For example, the Government Whip said to our Whip a fortnight ago that this motion had to be taken within a short space of time to coincide with its passage through the British Parliament.  It struck me that that was an extraordinary amount of haste to attach to something that had hung around for 20 years.  I telephoned the British House of Commons to ascertain the reason for this haste.  I discovered that the House of Commons did not sit at all the week before last, which was the week the Fianna Fáil Whip said this had to be taken.  Indeed I established also that the House of Commons did not sit last week either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we note from the Minister's remarks today that the British require to pass legislation through the House of Commons.  It is possible that that legislation has been prepared already but seems unlikely given the complexity of the issues involved.  Since the agreement was reached some time in the last three weeks only it seems equally unlikely that legislation would be ready.  Furthermore, given the pace at which legislation goes through the House of Commons &mdash; remembering that the first sign of smoke <i>vis-à-vis</i> the fair employment legislation in the North of Ireland was seen in September 1986 and which will not be passed <Col N="2179" /> by the British Parliament until September 1989 &mdash; it is even more unlikely.</P>
    <P>I am glad, given doubts now being cast on this agreement by people a lot better qualified to study it than am I, that we did not accede to the Chief Whip's request to rush it through this House in unseemly haste within a week of its signature.</P>
    <P>That is all the more important because of the very scant information made available about this agreement.  For example, the Minister said in the course of his remarks:</P>
    <P>Deputies will have had an opportunity to study the text of the agreement which was circulated to them immediately after signature. </P>
    <P>The text of the agreement is comprised of one and a half pages and two totally inadequate maps with lines showing the line of the present agreement and four or five pages of figures pertaining to the longitudinal and latitudinal marks. Deputies have not had an opportunity of studying the text of the agreement circulated.  The agreement consists of one and a half pages on an extremely complex issue.  The least the Government might have supplied &mdash; primarily to this House, but not merely this House &mdash; was a map showing what had been the British claim originally, what had been the Irish claim originally and where the existing agreement now lies between those two.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should say there was a briefing arranged yesterday afternoon in the Department of Foreign Affairs of which I am not sure how many Deputies were informed.  I was informed when in Cork on Friday afternoon by our Whip's office that that briefing would take place on Monday afternoon.  That type of arrangement may be satisfactory to party spokespersons living in Dublin but is not for others who do not reside in Dublin.  Some effort should have been made before then to brief party spokespersons on this matter.  Having said that I should thank the Minister and his Department for having sent me this morning the notes of the briefing given.</P>
    <P>An explanation of the agreement <Col N="2180" /> between the Governments of Ireland and the UK has not been made available. This agreement sets out to create opportunities particularly with regard to off-shore petroleum and related industries. The Minister is extremely enthusiastic in his support for this agreement and has maintained that Ireland has made real gains with regard to the Continental Shelf, but he has not spelled out in detail what we got.  A lot of doubt has been cast on our so-called gains because the areas in which we got this huge increase are the areas that are of least value in oil exploration.  The British have gained in the Celtic Sea which is the most valuable in the area of oil and gas exploration.</P>
    <P>At one point in the article which I quoted from <i>The Irish Times</i> of today the author in explaining how the line was drawn between the islands and the mainlands of both islands said:</P>
    <P>If the Agreed Line gives full effect to these islands as measuring points, the British have achieved the best result they could possibly have anticipated in an arbitration. </P>
    <P>In other words, they have been saved the price of arbitration and have still got the best possible deal.  This agreement would not make one jump up and down with joy at some major national gain.  When replying, the Minister should take the opportunity to say what precisely is the gain to us as he seems to be suggesting that we have made a huge gain whereas the British have lost out.  The article I have referred to indicates a different scenario.</P>
    <P>An agreement such as this has many implications and raises questions about a number of issues such as the dumping of nuclear waste and the provision of adequate sea and air rescue services. Before approving this agreement the Dáil must be satisfied that on balance it is of positive benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that by negotiating the agreement bilaterally we have reached a satisfactory settlement.  This raises the question of gains and losses, as a compromise of some sort is inevitable in a negotiating process.  It appears that <Col N="2181" /> most of our gains are in the area of the north west of this country.  There is a very significant extent of water available to us up there but this is a far less favourable location for oil and gas exploration because of the difficulty with weather and because the technology is not available to explore in that area.  At the moment, however, the price of oil would not encourage anybody to explore.  The Celtic Sea which is thought to have reserves of oil and natural gas is the area where the British have gained.</P>
    <P>The only map I have seen relating to this is in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today and it shows the three lines I spoke about originally, the original Irish claim, the original British claim and the area that is now being agreed.  This map shows that the area the British have gained is possibly far more valuable to them than the huge area we have gained in the north west.  We need an explanation from the Minister about this before we can push this through the Dáil.  If the area in the north west showed signs of having gas, oil and other minerals, the cost of bringing them ashore from this depth of water and over those distances in the very unfriendly north west sea, would be prohibitive, and it is not foreseeable that we would reap the rewards during the lifetime of anybody in this House.  If, however, the price of oil rises in the next ten or 15 years and if OPEC manage to control output and push the price up, the Celtic Sea becomes a far more attractive proposition.</P>
    <P>The agreement does not deal with the complex problems of who owns Rockall. The Minister has said quite a lot about that and I will come back to it in a moment.  While we have not conceded our claim on Rockall, the fact that we have agreed to waive exploration rights to the seabed around it may indicate a less than convincing belief in our claim. I do not know if it is tactically wise to concede any territorial right before the issue of ownership is settled, and that may be what the Minister has done in this agreement.</P>
    <P>I note from the map that in drawing the line in the Celtic Sea between Wales <Col N="2182" /> and Ireland, islands called The Smalls are used.  These are rocks, the same as Rockall, and they are incapable of sustaining any form of life.  Yet, this is the starting line.  These rocks are 12 miles out from the Pembrokeshire coast and the Welsh coast.  If the distance between the Welsh and the Irish cost is 60 miles, then the meeting line would be at 30 miles down the centre of the sea but if we start at these rocks which are 12 miles from the west coast the agreed line is pushed over so that it is 24 miles from the Irish coast and 36 miles from the Welsh coast giving the British a further 12 miles in the Celtic Sea, which is a considerable amount of the Continental Shelf available to the British for exploration.  I will want a satisfactory explanation from the Minister about that when he replies and before I will be satisfied to allow this through the House.</P>
    <P>If these islands are now being used so as to decide where to place the line between the two claiming countries, then how does this affect our position on Rockall which is precisely the same as the islands known as The Smalls?  From my understanding, the law of the sea says that when one draws a line between countries claiming rights over seabed, uninhabited rocks incapable of supporing life cannot be used as a starting point.  The starting point must be inhabited islands.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the Scilly Islands as being half measures. I take that to mean that the distance between them and the mainland is halved and that is the starting point.  Will the Minister explain that?</P>
    <P>In relation to Rockall I am not sure if it is wise for the Minister to concede a territorial right before the issue of the ownership of the island is settled.  We must also consider the claim of Denmark to the area of the seabed which is included in this agreement.  The map shows the overlapping claims of Denmark, Britain and Ireland in the area which has now been designated.  The Danish claims are based on what is called a micro continent under the sea.  They maintain that a bilateral agreement between Ireland and <Col N="2183" /> Britain is not binding on a third party. In their view all of the parties including Iceland, Ireland, Britain and Denmark must negotiate in order to reach an acceptable agreement.  In that regard this agreement probably raises more issues than it has solved.  If the Danish and Icelandic claims come down through both the British and Irish areas, how will we disentangle all that mess, if we ever concede that the Danes and the Icelanders have the right to negotiate on the Rockall trough and the Rockall seabed?</P>
    <P>Also in relation to Rockall, it is my understanding that for some years now there has been a tendency for some species of fish that had been very plentiful off the Donegal coast to move up towards Rockall and Donegal fishermen have been hunting those fish up to Rockall and around the rock.  On a number of occasions in the past two or three years they have been warned off fishing in those areas by British warships.  What is their position now?  They have to pass through those waters to get to Rockall.  Have the British the right to hunt those fishermen away?  Under this agreement, will both countries have the right to fish around those rocks, and can we be sure that the British will not insist, as they have been doing for some years, that the fishing rights around Rockall are part of their exclusive zone?  That is something which the Minister could clear up in his reply.</P>
    <P>As I said, this agreement raises questions on a number of issues.  For instance, what negotiations and discussions have been held on the environment?  Did the Government use the negotiations to talk about the emissions from Sellafield?  Is there any undertaking from the British that, by getting this item off the agenda to be discussed between the two countries, we would be clearer about the position of emissions from Sellafield into the Irish Sea?  What are the implications for our fishing industry?  I am thinking particularly of the Donegal fishermen who are being chased from fishing around Rockall.</P>
    <P>What are the implications for the provision of rescue services?  Have we or the <Col N="2184" /> British undertaken any increased obligations in this area?  For instance, part of what we have accepted as the British area, water up the north-west coast, is nearer to the air-sea rescue services in Donegal than to the Shetlands and it is part of the policy of this party to station a helicopter for air-sea rescue on the west coast.  Will we be co-ordinating our air-sea rescue services?  Maybe this agreement would be a suitable vehicle for doing that.  Was there any discussion about that?</P>
    <P>What are the implications for fishing protection vessels?  Was nuclear waste discussed?  Was the question of submarines in the Irish Sea raised and resolved in the negotiations?  Over the last number of years this question has not been resolved by the two Governments. When in Government I raised this question in the IMO, which was a very unsatisfactory place to have it raised.  They did not come up with a solution but they indicated their goodwill towards the Government and expressed their concern that the Irish Sea was being used as the &ldquo;Patrick Street&rdquo; of the world.</P>
    <P>The importance of the channel between Scotland, Iceland and Greenland to the two Super Powers, NATO and Warsaw Pact countries, is enormous. Ships are visible but modern methods of war are moving more towards nuclear submarines.  There are more submarines in the Irish Sea than in any other area because the NATO submarines travel to their base in Scotland and the Warsaw Pact countries' submarines maintain surveillance on them.</P>
    <P>There have been accidents involving submarines in the Irish Sea.  Trawlers were sunk and men were killed.  We all remember when French sailors were killed.  In the last ten years submarines have caused a great deal of damage; the British Government admitted that one of their submarines sank a trawler, but other ships have been sunk and it was thought that submarines were responsible.</P>
    <P>Submarines are designed to travel below water and if possible to avoid surveillance. We should not underestimate the importance of large submarine fleets <Col N="2185" /> to NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries. Something must be done to address this problem before more lives are lost in the Irish Sea.  This could be a useful opportunity for the Government to discuss the possibility of banning all submarine traffic in the Irish Sea.  If the present level is maintained, more trawlers will be sunk and more lives will be lost.</P>
    <P>Are there any implications in this agreement for the technical side, such as weather forecasting?  There are many wider ranging implications involved and I am not satisfied that this House should rubber stamp this agreement and let it through.  There are many problems which might be solved through arbitration but I am not convinced the Irish Government have got, on balance, more than they would through arbitration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's speech.  He makes it very clear that this agreement relates only to the delimitation of the Continental Shelf and does not apply to any of the other factors involved, territoriality or an exclusive economic or fishing zone. In that context it is probably satisfactory enough that an agreement has been reached in regard to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My initial worry on the day this document was published was the position in regard to Rockall.  Having heard what has transpired in regard to Rockall and the fact that for this particular purpose its location is irrelevant, even though it certainly is not irrelevant for other purposes, I accept that the north-western division as set out in this agreement seems to be satisfactory.  One of the things I am afraid of is that this agreement will be accepted as a headline for all other fields, like fishing, territorial claims and so on, and will be seen in popular parlance on both sides of the Irish Sea to be the end of Ireland's claim to Rockall, and there is a very grave danger of that.  If Rockall were an inhabited island and it was Irish territory, obviously the line drawn would be very different &mdash; it would run half way between Rockall and the Hebrides or <Col N="2186" /> more accurately, half way between Rockall and the Scottish mainland.</P>
    <P>I noticed in his speech that the Minister, for some reason, does not give the respective distances between Rockall and the two mainlands.  He simply says it is over 200 nautical miles from both but that some islands on the Outer Hebrides are closer to it than the Donegal coast. We are well aware of that.  What we have always suggested is that our mainland is closer to Rockall and gives us rights.</P>
    <P>The map in relation to this agreement is very unsatisfactory.  The maps attached to the agreement are hopeless from several points of view.  The map relating to the Irish Sea and the Celtic Sea is far too vague and imprecise.  It would have been helpful for the purpose of this debate if we had had a map showing the Continental Shelf west of Scotland and, for example, the location of the Rockall trough, which is east of Rockall, between Rockall and Scotland.  I would have thought if I were a Dane, that that would have considerable bearing on the British claim west of Scotland.  If that map were prepared and showed the continuity of the Rockall plateau to the south, it would show a much greater connection with the Irish part of the Continental Shelf than with the British part.  Either way I am glad the British and the Irish have agreed on this point because I think the Danish claim is perhaps a little far-fetched and the Icelandic one, with the greatest of respect to them, is even more far-fetched.</P>
    <P>The part I find unsatisfactory in regard to division in the Irish Sea is that line A, as it is described in article 1º on map A, begins as far south as 53º 39' north.  I do not know why it begins that far south because looking at the map, which as I say is hopeless, that is just a relatively short distance north of Howth.  Why not go 25 miles further north to somewhere off Dundalk, because the difficulties with Northern Ireland waters start only there? When you go north of Anglesea, why does that line not move quickly to the east, or are the British allowed to draw a base line between the north westerly point of Anglesea Island and the south westerly point of the Isle of Man?  If they <Col N="2187" /> are not, the line we agreed to should move to the east north of point 1 on the line on map A.  Some explanation of that is called for because there is no dispute about the ownership of the Irish shoreline for a distance of about 25 miles to the north of what is shown as point 1 on that map.  Only when you get off Carlingford the problem arises with regard to Northern Ireland, and I wonder why this part of it was left undefined, particularly as it is shallow water and, we hope, may be of some benefit to us.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty arises further south in St. George's Channel and in the north-eastern part of the Celtic Sea.  Mr. Lysaght draws attention to that in the article which has been referred to by Deputy Barry, where he feels that in the part that can be described as Irish block 50 there is an overlap, as it were, in the two original claims and to the north-east of Irish block 50 the bulk of the disputed area seems to have gone to Britain, and he is fearful that that is one of the most valuable parts.  Certainly, judging by Irish block 49 it is, because the Irish block 49 has proved to be one of the more interesting, perhaps the most interesting blocks from an oil point of view on the Irish side of the line.  It is not terribly clear, and the maps are hopeless.  <i>The Irish Times</i> attempted to provide a map in connection with Mr. Lysaght's article and it is a great deal better than the map produced with this agreement.  An enlarged map of these areas should be made available.  If this agreed line in that area south east of Carnsore Point is agreed as a result of taking the Smalls of Pembrokeshire into account it should follow that the Tuskar Rock, for example, off Rosslare should be taken into account.  Was this done?  We are talking here about possibly three, four or fives miles of seabed that would be in dispute, but it could prove extremely valuable seabed.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is disappointing to have had a speech from the Minister for Foreign Affairs which is full of generalities and references to international <Col N="2188" /> law in general global terms, UN conventions and all the rest, while the really important part is the nitty-gritty about a few miles of seabed in that area.  This is not something remote and speculative 600 miles north west of Donegal where there might or might not be something. This is an area where both on our side of the lines and on the British side there have been finds of oil and it is really only a question of time it is hoped, until there are commercial finds on one side or the other.  The fact that the line is three miles to the east or west of where it might be could be of huge consequence to this country and of some consequence to Britain.  It is very important that we know exactly were we stand in relation to that. This should have been spelled out in much more detail.</P>
    <P>Follow that line down to the south-west towards point 94 as marked on map A where presumably the French have an interest.  Presumably point 94 is not the limit of the continental shelf at that point. I am not certain because, unfortunately, we are not given that information.  The French will have to agree with us as to where the division comes in the more extended part of that line.  Have the French been shown this agreement?  Has it been discussed with them in any way? Do they feel in any sense bound by it?  It is not entirely satisfactory in the way it has been put across.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant parts of this agreement is the part which has not been dealt with at all, that is the question of Northern Ireland waters.  The significance of that may not have been fully grasped here but it was grasped by Mr. John Taylor, the Unionist MEP, who, I notice, some weeks ago, devoted a fairly long speech to the fact that the Northern Ireland waters were agreed, as it were in practical terms to be waters in dispute and therefore were ignored in the same way as the Rock of Rockall was agreed by the parties to this agreement to be in dispute and ignored for various purposes and the line drawn as if it did not exist. It is useful that the British have agreed this sort of arrangement without insisting on the waters around Northern Ireland <Col N="2189" /> being delineated as belonging to A or B. Perhaps point 1 in the line on map A starts as far south as it does to avoid that difficulty, but we should be told the position in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I have no strong desire to oppose this agreement in principle.  I certainly support it.  It is a very good thing that matters of this kind that have been in dispute for a long time are finally agreed on a voluntary basis and do not have to go to arbitration.  However, not all the questions are answered and the House will have to bear in mind that if and when this agreement is approved here this afternoon we will never again get an opportunity to look at it.  It is never again going to be changed.  The British may take a year to two before they ratify it.  We are doing it with extraordinary rapidity in the very same month in which it was signed. The British may have time to have second thoughts about it but we are not going to have time.  For that reason what is said in the reply is of some importance on these points.  I wonder if, even before the end of this debate, we can get proper maps to a reasonable scale to enable the precise position to be ascertained.  The most useful piece I have seen is the map in Mr. Lysaght's article as opposed to anything that has been given out by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Looking at that map one sees the quite extensive areas that are in dispute and now divided up in a fairly arbitrary fashion.  It is interesting, for example, that at one point the proposed Irish and British lines clearly crossed one another and at another point they did not even meet.  That point needs to be taken into account.  It is noticeable that in the southern part of that division, nearly all the disputed area has gone to Britain, whereas in the more northern part of it which is very much narrower and where, under present knowledge at least, the existence of hydro-carbons is not proven, it has gone slightly more towards Ireland.  Of the disputed area there is no doubt, looking at the map, that Britain seems to have got the more extensive part of it, which is the point that Mr. Lysaght makes.</P>
    <P>I do not see there is any point in arguing <Col N="2190" /> in something of a vacuum.  It would be appropriate that we be given a more precise map and a full explanation of how that particular arrangement was come to. We are also entitled to be told what the Government propose to do in regard to the claims of Denmark, via the Faroes and Iceland, to areas in Rockall.  The line shown on map 4B is so far south of anything that either the Faroes or Iceland might possibly legitimately claim that we should claim that line as being a line that stands against all claims, because Iceland is about 800 miles to the north west of that line and, taken from any normal view, could not conceivably have a claim to it.  If they have a claim to it we have a claim to extensive areas off the French coast which I certainly think the French would not countenance, and perhaps off the Spanish coast also which, equally, the Spaniards would not countenance.  We are closer to the French and Spanish coasts than Iceland is to these areas that they are laying claim to.</P>

      <P>The House has at this stage heard quite a lot in relation to this matter. It might be useful to restate what exactly is being proposed here.  After 11 years, perhaps even longer, we now have, subject to our ratification, a draft agreement on an issue that has occupied an enormous amount of time and legal expertise and which makes reference to at least three other legal precedents in the form of the delineation and the definition of boundaries.  Having regard to that brief summary of part of the process that has taken place today, we should be wary about attempting to redraw in two hours what has taken 11 years to emerge.  I am not normally that modest, as you might on occasion grant; but a lot has been done in this area.  On the question of the line, I take the point that Deputy O'Malley made in contrasting the map prepared in conjunction with Mr. Lysaght's article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> with the map we were circulated with; it does show a degree of equalisation when one looks at the disputed area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement itself is quite concise. It confines itself exclusively to the Irish <Col N="2191" /> rights of exploration of the seabed and the surface below it on the Continental Shelf, therefore enabling the Government of the day, specifically the Department of Energy, to set the terms and the conditions attaching to any oil exploration in these areas.  There is very good reason to presume that there are more Kinsale-type fields and, while exploration has somewhat subsided in these waters because of the current price of oil, it is not unreasonable to presume that between now and the end of the century the price will fluctuate and the profitability of such deposits will be exploited with new and more environmentally sound methods of extraction.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the fact that this 11 year old dispute has been resolved, that a line has been agreed upon.  It is clearly a compromise. Such lines are, of necessity, a compromise. The zig-zag form that it has taken has been specifically designed to facilitate the allocation of prospecting blocks in the various sea areas to enable different prospecting consortia to obtain licences so that they can proceed with their own work.</P>
    <P>The whole question of Rockall that has been part and parcel of the debate on territoriality and whether we have a claim to it, should be put in the context of what this agreement between the British and Irish Governments means.  I will come later to the question of the Icelandic and Danish claims.  It was always presumed by those people who urged the Irish Government to either counterclaim Rockall or to have refuted internationally the British claim to Rockall that the motivation for claiming Rockall was substantially and exclusively the mineral rights Rockall will generate in its vicinity. This agreement effectively makes Rockall irrelevant for the purposes of that particular motivation.  We have, as the record shows and as the Minister repeated, simply refuted and refused to recognise the validity of the British Government's claim to the sovereignty of Rockall.  If such a claim were to be upheld by some international court, and <Col N="2192" /> this is now most unlikely having regard to the development of international legal thinking in this area, if at the very worst it was to be upheld and it was to be determined that Rockall was legally part of the territory of the United Kingdom, the rights that would be conferred upon Britain as a consequence of that would be a 12-mile territorial zone around the area of Rockall.  Since the line that we have determined falls 12 miles below that position anyway that makes the outcome of the claim for Rockall legally an irrelevancy in terms of Ireland's interests in extracting mineral resources from the continental seabed and below.  That is as I read it.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm that I am correct in my reading of it.</P>
    <P>If we argue that the motivation of Britain in claiming Rockall, and nearly killing some of their naval servicemen in trying to get on to it, was presumably to stake a claim for some stage in the future to the riches and the oil resources around Rockall, the definition of this boundary now which puts Rockall to the north of the median line is in fact one that makes that whole exercise by the British irrelevant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points that Deputy O'Malley made concerning the decision to ignore the area between Northern Ireland and Britain and, indeed, from Dundalk back down to the coast, that is a point that might be usefully addressed by the Minister, particularly in relation to the Irish seabed, going up to the point where the territorial boundaries clearly change.  The map starts south of that and it is possible, having regard to the intentions of some of the mineral prospecting companies, that there are mineral resources in the middle of the Irish Sea. It would be useful for that reason if that was defined between Britain and Ireland. I should like to ask the Minister to clarify the Government's thinking in relation to that.</P>
    <P>The Government have effected a significant advance in not allowing the territory around Northern Ireland become a factor.  I read that as a tacit admission by the British that this area is disputed. <Col N="2193" /> Therefore, were I John Taylor I would be rightly concerned.  This conclusion is a reasonable one.  Deputy Barry used the occasion of this debate to raise other matters related to the joint administration of seas around Ireland and it should be said that the initiative for the settlement of this apparent endless dispute was taken by the previous Administration. It reflects very much on the positive relations that existed between Iveagh House and their counterparts in Britain and between the Governments of the day.  Deputy Barry should take some credit for that.  Had that relationship between London and Dublin continued perhaps we would have seen a successful resolution of many of the other problems that still haunt us in regard to the administration of our seas.  The Government should take note of the fact that this is not a cause for celebration; they are harvesting the results of work initiated by the previous Administration.  It would be unwise of them to draw the conclusion that they have done a good day's work and that they do not need to do anything further.  Following the conclusion of this agreement the Government should pursue the other areas of conflict that have arisen in relation to the administration of the seas around these islands.</P>
    <P>The legal points have been addressed by other Members.  I take it that what we are debating is an agreement which we can accept or reject but that, even if we were in a position to suggest an alternative boundary, we are not in a position to request the Government to renegotiate with the other side.  Therefore, I am not proposing that we should do that.  I am prepared to accept, on the basis of the effort that has been put into these negotiations, that the line prepared for us is as good as we could hope to achieve. I say that notwithstanding the expertise of Mr. Lysaght who for a long time was intimately involved in the negotiations.  I am sure he would be the first to recognise that he has not been involved in the final process or been part of the final agreement. His article in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> alludes to the fact that he is <Col N="2194" /> giving an interpretation which is not based on all the available information.</P>
    <P>The line that has been agreed must be accepted as the best available compromise. I hope the removal of any doubt, particularly in the area of the Celtic Sea and in the south west, will encourage those companies who are contemplating prospecting in the Irish Sea, to proceed without delay.  Notwithstanding the enormous liberalisation and enticements offered by the former Minister for Energy, Deputy Burke, who also removed many of the constraints and safeguards in the original terms, notwithstanding that bargain basement offer to oil prospectors to drill in the Irish Sea where there was no dispute with regard to ownership or sovereignty, few companies have taken up the offer.  I am not sure that the confirmation of this line will mean a rush of new prospectors.  However, the Department of Foreign Affairs, who worked closely with the Department of Energy in defining the line, may be in a position to indicate if companies have expressed an interest in areas which were subject to some doubt as to ownership.  If the Minister of State has that information available I hope he will give it in the course of his reply.  The Labour Party will be supporting the ratification of the agreement and are anxious to express their appreciation of the satisfactory outcome of the negotiations.  The alternative would have been to contest the issue before an international tribunal which would have been costly.  The outcome is satisfactory particularly having regard to the fact that the agreement may be challenged by the Icelandic or Danish Governments.  However, that can only be in respect of areas that are more likely to concern the British authorities than ourselves.  The clear definition of the line in the Celtic Sea and the south eastern and western coasts will not be subject to a dispute with any third party and I welcome that.  I hope the agreement will provide the basis for confidence for oil exploration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The main value of this <Col N="2195" /> agreement is that it represents an agreement between Britain and Ireland on hitherto disputed jurisdiction over certain areas of the seabed surrounding this country.  The agreement may encourage further exploration of these waters for oil and gas fields, as the exploration companies were naturally reluctant to get involved in possibly expensive exploration work in disputed territories.  If it does that will be a welcome development, although it has to be said that the oil exploration companies have shown no great sense of urgency in trying to bring ashore the oil that has already been found in Irish territorial waters over which there is no dispute.</P>
      <P>The agreement is, of course, only a partial one.  It ducks a number of issues, such as the territorial waters around Northern Ireland, and has avoided the Rockall issue.  The agreement is strongly disputed by Denmark and Iceland, who claim part of the seas now divided between ourselves and Britain and it is likely that it will be challenged in the international court or some other international forum.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that by ignoring the question of Rockall, this agreement is in fact strengthening British claims to jurisdiction over it.  The importance of Rockall is not the rock itself, but the jurisdiction over the surrounding waters and the fishing rights that internationally recognised sovereignty would bring with it.  This question will have to be sorted out by negotiation and compromise at some stage, and it is important that this should be done as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, there will have to be negotiations with the Danish and Icelandic Governments at some stage over the claims on the waters covered by this agreement.  The Danes are claiming sovereignty over a substantial area of both the British and Irish sectors covered by the agreement.  The Danish claim, in fact, covers a far greater proportion of the Irish sector than the British area, and we would stand to lose a lot more if it was successful.  I would ask the Minister to say in replying to the debate, if any protest or <Col N="2196" /> representations have been received from the Danish Government on the agreement. As with Rockall, the dispute with Denmark over these waters will have to be resolved at some stage.  It is better that it should be resolved by negotiation, discussion and agreement rather than by litigation in the international court which could go on for years and which could prove enormously costly to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>While there obviously has to be a certain amount of give and take in agreements like this, there is some evidence to suggest that there has been too much give on the part of the Irish side and the British have been allowed to take too much. Certainly, in the area of the Celtic Sea to the south west of the country, which is generally considered to be the most promising in terms of possible oil and gas resources, the British seem to have done exceptionally well.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, if this agreement increases the potential for oil and gas exploration, then it will be a good thing. However, one can only be totally sceptical about the intentions of the exploration companies given their record in Irish waters so far.  Successive Governments have capitulated totally to the demands of the international oil companies and have made concession on top of concession; yet the oil remains under the sea.  The Coalition Government improved the terms for the oil companies on three occasions during their term of office and last September the Fianna Fáil Administration gave them even more generous terms; yet not a drop of oil has been brought ashore.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have been hopelessly outmanoeuvred by the oil companies, and the public have been subjected to a concerted campaign of disinformation by certain of the oil barons who have used their interests in newspapers to wage a campaign for a virtual surrender to their demands.  The entire approach adopted by successive Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments has been inept and has been far too dependent on the &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; of the international oil companies. We believe that the Government <Col N="2197" /> should have adopted an approach similar to that of the Norwegians who, when it was established that there was oil in their waters, involved themselves very directly in exploration, and hired the necessary technical expertise from abroad.</P>
    <P>The interests of the Irish people and the interests of the huge international oil companies are not the same.  The oil and gas resources in the Celtic Sea are, we know, likely to be in small reservoirs. Major oil companies are normally only interested in developing large fields, but these deposits, which are small by international standards are quite substantial in terms of the annual energy needs of this country.  We have enough evidence of oil and natural gases off our southern coast to say that investment in State exploration would be repaid by having complete control and use of the discovered resources.  This, rather than further concessions to international oil companies, should be the direction of our oil and gas exploration policy.</P>
    <P>The apparently never-ending concessions to the oil companies, more typical of a third world country than a member state of the EC, do not indicate any determination on the part of the Irish Government to ensure that the oil is brought ashore and used in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The agreement also focuses attention on our ability, or more accurately our lack of ability, to explore our own Continental Shelf area.  Under the terms of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea which Ireland has signed the definition of the national continental shelf must include a definition of the outer edge of the continental margin.  This is necessary to define a boundary between the national territory and the central oceanic area in which the United Nations claim sea-bed rights.</P>
    <P>This is not a procedure which can be carried out by diplomatic negotiation.  It will require a considerable amount of work of a practical nature at sea in distant parts of the Atlantic.  Failure to carry out this work and to make a claim for the relevant sea-bed territory may result in the loss to the nation of huge areas of <Col N="2198" /> sea bed with the possibility of mineral deposits.</P>
    <P>There is currently no indication of the Government's interest in this important area.  The only research vessel we have &mdash;<i>Lough Beltra</i>&mdash; is not capable of carrying out this work.  A recent research cruise by a German vessel with Irish cooperation, which got an amount of publicity, was a minor but only a minor contribution to this important process.</P>
    <P>The Marine Research Institute which was announced with great noise by the present Government has not been heard of since.  It might have been expected when created to take an interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>There is no Civil Service or semi-State body currently capable of carrying out this work at sea.  Expertise exists in some areas but facilities such as a ship, equipment and personnel are absent.  Such a gap must be filled quickly.  The Danish Province of the Faroe Islands and the State of Iceland have made claims on much of this territory.  Without physical information they may well obtain it to the detriment of our economic situation in spite of the fact that our claim would appear to be better.  If our claim is not documented with first hand information it will not be sustainable.</P>
    <P>The argument that technology is not available currently to work minerals in such waters is not sustainable.  When the need is demonstrated the technology will become available.  All of the principles involved have been applied in other areas of underwater work.  Another argument used is that the supply of minerals on land will be sufficient for many years. This is probably true.  However it is not an argument.  Since the area in question is seven times the size of Ireland it will take many years to carry out even a preliminary examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am very glad that this long running problem with the British has reached some finality not in every respect but so far at least as the areas covered by this agreement are concerned, I think the whole episode shows up a lack in our own administrative <Col N="2199" /> arrangements.  I had, for about two years, something to do with this matter when I was Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the legal section, as well as a few others, and subsequently during the brief time that I was Attorney General. I can remember very well that this was a period in which maritime matters were at the top of the Government's agenda and were frequently on the headlines. It was the era when the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; if it is not disobliging to strike a partisan note by saying so &mdash; then seated on those benches were willing virtually to die for the 50-mile exclusive fisheries zone, and when Senator Eoin Ryan, their leader in the Seanad, said that if we did not get an exclusive 50-mile zone we should reconsider our whole situation in the European Communities &mdash; they were that dedicated to it.  Where, I would like to ask, is it now?  It had however, despite its absurdity, the effect of souping up the general temperature surrounding maritime problems and put them very much up on the table in this House for several long months, or perhaps even a year or two.  I am beginning to forget just the length of time during which this endured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, of course, the fishery problem which was foremost then, but a long-term problem, of perhaps greater importance, was the one which the House is dealing with now, it struck me then, and I wrote to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, to that effect.  Afterwards I made representations in this House to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government and subsequently said the same thing again during the time of their successors that the legal resources of this State are dispersed among several Departments having necessarily to deal with maritime matters.  There are resources of that kind in the Attorney General's Office &mdash; which comes under the umbrella of the Taoiseach's Department &mdash; in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and I presume the Department of Defence have a legal adviser of their own.  I do not wish them to betray warlike secrets but I suppose somewhere in Parkgate Street there is a <Col N="2200" /> legal expert.  I am not sure whether the Department of Fisheries employ a legal officer but certainly they must frequently have to deal with legal problems both in regard to infractions of our fishery zones and in regard to their rights of pursuit and such things.</P>
    <P>The State's resources being necessarily very small it seemed to me then, and still seems to me, a pity that they could not be concentrated under one head.  I do not care whose empire is enlarged thereby, let it be the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Attorney General's Office but I think the expertise, fine though it is, is very thinly spread.  It should be concentrated in such a way that we do have a team of people who are familiar with the problems arising on and under the sea, military, fiscal, mineral, territorial and fishery problems.  It does not need to be an enormous team that grows with every Estimate.  A small team doing nothing else except remorselessly and relentlessly studying the law relating to maritime matters would be better able to serve the State than the very overtaxed, excellent teams we have which are now scattered among several Departments.</P>
    <P>By saying all of this I do not wish in any way to disparage the work which has been done because I can testify to the extremely high standard of the work done in this regard.  Perhaps the best official Government paper I ever read, although I know one should not make these comparisons, was one which was in the middle of an almost one foot thick file which was put on my desk when I was with this section in the Department of Foreign Affairs bearing on this very problem.</P>
    <P>In those days in the mid-seventies we had the problem that the British were designating all around them.  They were designating areas from which under this agreement they have now been forced to recede, perhaps I should not say forced, but negotiated into receding from.  My own view at that time was that there was no way of getting action from them because they appeared to be dragging their feet on the arbitration front.  As soon as we designated a few areas across <Col N="2201" /> their line the effect was instant and electric, they were at the negotiating table for arbitration within weeks.  I would not like to say that it was because I was discharged from my responsibility for that area shortly afterwards that the thing went into low gear.  It certainly went into low gear for about 12 years and not much action resulted.</P>
    <P>I used to inquire, sometimes privately and sometimes in the House, about what was happening to the arbitration to settle the dividing line of the Continental Shelf between our country and theirs and apparently there was always some good reason but this added up to a lot of good years being let go by.  I am very pleased that it has at last ended in an agreement but I feel had we been forced to go to arbitration it would have been an extremely costly business.  We would have been forced to retain the services of foreign experts who might have had more academic expertise than any native international lawyer but because they were foreign they would not have had the feel for the Irish exigencies that our own native officials would have had.  That is why I again say, in no sense to belittle the efforts of the officials who have taken part in this process, quite the contrary, that we ought to have a special legal department under whatever main Department concerned only with maritime legal problems.</P>
    <P>Had we been forced into arbitration I cannot imagine what it would have involved the State in, in terms of cost.  I can remember that during the short time I was Attorney General spending a disproportionate amount of that small period at meetings with the adviser, since unhappily deceased, who was of Irish blood but not of Irish citizenship and who was one of the most distinguished international lawyers in the world and who came over to Dublin on a number of occasions to discuss with us the best line we should adopt in trying to press on with arbitration.  That was only the very beginning of what might have been an immensely expensive process and the House, whatever reservations may be <Col N="2202" /> expressed about the terms of the agreement, should be grateful that the agreement has spared the State that expense.</P>
    <P>There are two things, arising more out of what the Minister has said than from the agreement itself, that I would like to refer to very briefly.  First, I would like to add my voice to that of the Minister in trying to dispel this fetish we have about Rockall.  Rockall is a tiny needle of rock which not even a gull could live on, let alone a human being.  It is not only not capable of supporting inhabitants but it is also not capable of supporting an offshore economy.  One cannot treat it in the way in which people still treat the Blasket Islands, one cannot keep anything on it. It is very hard to land on it.  The possession of Rockall is of no significance to anyone.  What we are worried about is any sort of claim, be it on the fishery front or on the Continental Shelf front, which might assume that that tiny uninhabitable and unexploitable pinpoint of rock, not as many feet across as this House is or barely, generates any kind of rights to territorial waters or rights in regard to fisheries, to the Continental Shelf or to mineral exploitation.  We certainly would have to dispute that not because of any Irish claim to actually owning this useless piece of rock but because we never could concede that this geological accident should in equity make any difference to the disposal for fishery, mineral and other purposes of the seas around it and the seabed underlying it.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, I only have to offer the House my warm support in regard to what the Minister said in his opening speech about Rockall.  The last thing I want to refer to, and I am not sure if any other speaker mentioned this, bears on something which the Minister also mentioned and that is the question of the right to the waters around Northern Ireland, around the coasts of Counties Derry, Antrim and Down.  I think it is a good principle &mdash; I do not know if other lawyers would agree &mdash; that if you have two points going into court, one of them a good point and the other a bad point, that one should not bring both in, that one should leave the bad one outside <Col N="2203" /> because the bum point is going to discredit the good one.  I see two other professional lawyers here and it may be that their technique is different and they are willing to try anything but I do not think it is a good idea to provoke impatience in a judge or in people who are in the position of a judge or in a public we are trying to impress by wasting bad points on them when one has a couple of really good points.</P>
    <P>I was a bit disturbed to find the Minister talking about settling once and for all the question in regard to the seas around the three maritime counties of Northern Ireland in the context of an all-Ireland settlement.  The Minister is much given to globalities and totalities. He likes to take the global view, a phrase which adapts itself very well to the motion of the hands which comes naturally to him.  The totality of global relationships is his element but while I would support him in trying to get the best possible totalities and globalities we can, I do not think we ought to drag this ancient red herring of the waters around these three northern counties into the picture.  I hope I will not be accused of doing down the national interest by saying this but I am trying to advance the national interest by advising us not to bring a bad point into the public view.</P>
    <P>This whole hare, herring or chestnut, whichever image one prefers, arose about 20 years ago when a resident magistrate in Northern Ireland got the idea that the Irish Free State or the area of Southern Ireland which turned into the Irish Free State had at all times and still has jurisdiction over the territorial waters, over a belt of sea, around the three maritime counties of Northern Ireland.  The reason for that argument, which is a perfectly good debating point, on the face of it seems quite stateable.  It was that Northern Ireland for constitutional purposes is defined by a system of exclusion, it is the whole of Ireland less a certain number of parliamentary counties and boroughs &mdash; less Counties <Col N="2204" /> Derry, Antrim, Down, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh and the county boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry.  No county or county borough generates a territorial sea.  <i>Ergo</i> this was the magistrate's argument.  The territorial seas were left behind by and were not caught by the legislation which created Northern Ireland and therefore perforce had to be regarded as still part of the rest of the island and under the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>I do admit that there is here a <i>casus omissus</i> and that if it had occurred to the draftsmen back in 1920 they would somehow have put this point beyond dispute, but so much water has gone under the bridge and so much legislation in particular has been enacted which is not consistent with that position and so many things have officially been done, including, let me mention, a statement by the then Taoiseach, the late Deputy Seán Lemass, in 1964, which is quite inconsistent with any claim on the part of this State to exercise jurisdiction over the territorial waters around Northern Ireland that for us to be raising this point at this stage will only cause impatience in people who are all too given to impatience anyway and will subtract from the force of the points which this State has all too good reason to make in the context of an all-Ireland settlement.  I ask the Minister &mdash; and I hope that in saying all of this I have not done any damage, overlooked some important point or misunderstood him &mdash; if I am right in what I say that this is the basis on which this idea rests, to consider whether his total overall global case would not be better served by leaving this herring out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that within a matter of days of this Agreement between the Irish and British Governments being announced the Danish Government lodged a counter claim to the effect &mdash; and apparently the Danish Government look after matters relating to foreign affairs for the Faroe Islands which are associated with Denmark &mdash; that the Agreement which was arrived at between Ireland and Britain was null and <Col N="2205" /> void because they had an interest in quite a bit of the Continental Shelf which was supposedly divided up by the Agreement. I believe it is extremely important that we are clear as to whether this third claim to this apparently disputed territory is in any way valid.  I have not heard any denial from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or for that matter from the British, as to the correctness or otherwise of this claim by the Danes on behalf of the Faroese.</P>
      <P>There may also be a fourth factor which has not yet been publicised &mdash; that is, the claim by Iceland to the regions which have been divided between Ireland and Britain.  I have tabled a question on this matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; to which I am awaiting an answer &mdash; which asks whether it would be logical to have a conference not just between Britain and Ireland but between the four countries, Ireland, Britain, Denmark and Iceland, in order to divide the Rockall trough area rather than take out a little bit and divide it: even when one takes a little bit out and divides it one can have a dispute with the third party.  If one looks closely at an atlas one can see that the three main participants involved, Ireland, Britain and the Faroe Islands, are virtually equidistant from what we call Rockall.  This issue, is being bypassed in this discussion because we are told it is not part of the Agreement but I do not believe we can bypass it.  It is part of the overall question and I do not believe one can resolve any part of that question, be it what was decided bilaterally three or four weeks ago or whatever, unless one takes the North Atlantic and Rockall area into consideration.  Rockall is described on maps not just as Rockall but as the Rockall Rise.  It is not referred to as the Rock of Rockall; it is referred to as the Rockall Rise because obviously it is awash in very wild weather so it could hardly be designated as being habitable or capable of being occupied for any significant length of time.</P>
      <P>This question involves four countries and not just two countries.  It is not good enough to say &ldquo;We will deal with this little area for the time being and we will deal with the overall issue in years to come&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> The Rockall issue has been going on for 32 or 33 years.  The first time it was claimed by the British was in 1955 and 1956 and it is a sad of affairs if we have not made an attempt with Britain to find a solution to the problem after 32 or 33 years.  We should be making some concrete moves at this stage to try to reach an overall agreement with regard to who owns what in the North Atlantic area.  The Minister's statement is helpful to us in some ways.  He said that the line of jurisdiction of the Scilly Isles only goes 100 miles out, or half way, because they are not part of the British mainland and are only islands.  That would seem to invalidate the British claim that because the Hebrides are slightly closer to Rockall than the Donegal coast they have a superior claim to it.  The very point they make in regard to the Scilly Isles defeats their case in regard to the Hebrides and certainly defeats the case the Danes are making in regard to the Faroe Isles.</P>
    <P>All of these matters should be examined extremely closely.  The precedent which is being created by the Scilly Isles undermines the case which has been made by both the British and the Danes. The sooner an around-the-table conference between the four countries involved in the North Atlantic area is held the better.  As I have said I have put down a question in relation to this matter and I should like to think that we would be the people responsible for initiating discussions on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I welcome the general support this Agreement has received.  I am particularly glad that the House appreciates the importance of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned that the present negotiations were initiated by the previous Government.  I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to that in his speech and I should like to acknowledge that fact here.  However, that is not to say, as Deputy Quinn seemed to imply, that this Government have not continued <Col N="2207" /> the very good work in relation to the negotiations.  The fact that the Agreement is before us today is proof that this Government have carried on very successfully the negotiations which were started &mdash; as Deputy Quinn said and which I acknowledge &mdash; by the previous Government.  Many matters were raised by Deputies and within my time span I hope to try to reply to the questions which were raised.</P>
    <P>It can be seen from the very full debate here today that the agreement deals with a long-standing disagreement, which is a very complex matter.  That long standing disagreement was mentioned in particular by Deputy Quinn and Deputy Kelly who referred to the length of time it has taken to bring this Agreement before the House.  While the agreement is no more than half a dozen pages long, no one should doubt its significance.  It may appear to be no more than a collection of geographical co-ordinates and maps but its importance for the State should never be under-estimated.  The Agreement which concerns the delimitation of the common Continental Shelf on which Ireland and Britain are situated delineates the respective areas of jurisdiction for each country in the Irish Sea &mdash; South, South-West and off the Donegal coast in the North-West.  The agreement is based on the international law concerning delimitation on which a wealth of material exists and from which the negotiators could draw.  The agreement clarifies and expands the areas within which exploration and exploitation may now take place hopefully it will encourage the petroleum industry to take advantage of this situation.  I will try to deal with the questions which many Deputies raised about the maps.  The maps have been described as inadequate, but let me point out that they merely illustrate and that the real lines are designated by the co-ordinates. Generally, it is not usual to disclose our different negotiating positions in negotiations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked where the line began in the Irish Sea and why it began at that point.  The reason is that it starts <Col N="2208" /> below a point where complicating factors, for instance where the Isle of Man's possible claim began.  The Deputy also referred to the outer edge at point 94 and why it did not extend beyond this point.  From my information, the reason it did not extend any further is that that is the outer edge of the Continental Shelf and after that point we come to deeper water.  As I have said earlier, the determining factors are the co-ordinates, rather than maps which are really only for illustration purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Malley and Barry raised the question of pollution and dumping at sea.  As they will be aware, all coastal states have the exclusive right to permit, regulate and control dumping on to its Continental Shelf.  However no dumping may take place without the coastal state's express prior approval.  Deputies can rest assured that no permission detrimental to this country will be given.  It is Government policy not to permit the dumping of any hazardous materials on to our Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry, in particular, spoke about the question of war ships and submarines, both nuclear and non-nuclear. Under international law the waters above the Continental Shelf are high seas for navigational purposes.  Consequently such waters are open to the ships, including submarines, of all states for the purposes of freedom of navigation.  I am sure the House will be pleased to know that as a result of an Irish initiative, the assembly of the International Maritime Organisation unanimously passed a resolution on 19 November 1987 recommending that in international waters, submerged submarines should as far as possible keep out of the way of fishing vessels and of fishing gear connected to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the newspaper article that stated that Ireland conceded in some significant areas in the Celtic Sea, particularly Block 50.  The House will agree with the point made by Deputy Quinn that where there are negotiations there has to be give and take.  However, the Government are satisfied that on the basis of information <Col N="2209" /> available the State has not lost out or ceded any areas which are particularly promising.  While the Block mentioned has some prospectivity, it is not among the most promising areas for future exploration and exploitation.</P>
    <P>All Deputies refer to the Continental Shelf off Northern Ireland.  May I again restate what the Minister said, that this agreement does not deal with the waters or the Continental Shelf off Northern Ireland.  The <i>de facto</i> position is that there are conflicting claims to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland and its offshore areas and the Government are firmly of the view that these matters are best dealt with in the overall framework of a political solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about the Rockall trough.  As Deputies are aware this is a deep valley between the Irish mainland and the Rockall plateau.  Despite its depth it does not form a break in the continuity or natural prolongation of Ireland's Continental Shelf which stretches through the trough and across the plateau.  The Government are satisfied that any argument challenging this fact could not succeed.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barry and Kelly referred to fishing.  May I again reiterate that the agreement only refers to the Continental Shelf, that is the seabed extending as a natural prolongation of the land territory out under the sea, which can extend further from the coast than the fixed 200 nautical miles exclusive fisheries zone.  It will make further undisputed areas available for oil and gas exploration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but the point I was making about fishing is that for some years the Donegal fishermen have not been allowed by British warships to fish around Rockall.  Will this now be allowed, as the matter has been taken out of contention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and consideration will need to be given as to how the line of delimitation for these waters should be established.  In any case, the Common Fisheries Policy will continue to apply to these waters.  Deputies Barry and Quinn asked what would happen next, and Deputy Barry also referred to the speed at which this legislation was brought in. May I inform Deputies that after the Dáil has had an opportunity to consider the matter, and if it approves the terms of the agreement, the Government will proceed to authorise acceptance of the agreement so that it can enter into force.  The British require legislation to enable them to implement the agreement and I understand this legislation is to have its Second Reading in the House of Commons tomorrow.  When both sides have completed their internal procedures there will be a formal acceptance of the agreement by both sides.  The Government will then make the necessary orders under section 14 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, so that the necessary designations can be effected and that Ireland's new designaters will then take account of the additional areas available for licensing as a result of the agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have not seen such statements, my information is that the Danish Government have not lodged an official protest with the Irish Government. The Continental Shelf Act, 1968, enables us to honour our obligations under this agreement.  The designation of the small area involved may be achieved by way of a Government Order which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas under section 14 of that Act.  As I have <Col N="2211" /> said the equivalent British legislation does not contain the same procedure.</P>
      <P>A matter that was raised by almost every Deputy who spoke and to which Deputy Deasy has just referred is the question of the Danish and Icelandic claims.  This agreement settles between ourselves and Britain exploration and exploitation rights in many areas including that part of the Continental Shelf known as the Rockall plateau.  Denmark and Iceland have made extensive claims, referred to by Deputies, to areas of the Rockall plateau and these include areas in the Irish Continental Shelf now undisputed by Britain.  In each case the Government immediately rejected the claims of both countries on the basis that such claims were contrary to international law and thus not acceptable to the Irish Government.  There is no change in the Government's position since that time.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the present agreement is a bilateral agreement &mdash; and Deputy Deasy referred to this &mdash; which can only bind the parties to it.  In relation to any other claims, the Government accept that any claim for Irish maritime zones must be settled in accordance with international law.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the Scilly Isles.  There is a clear precedent for giving half effect to the Scilly Isles when constructing a line of delimitation, and the line generally followed that and other existing precedents in regard to islands near the coast.  This resulted in such features getting less than full effect in establishing the position of the line.  The agreement will be very beneficial in those areas where jurisdiction was in dispute with the British since such areas will now be available for licensing.  The Government can now offer greater areas for licence than might otherwise have been available due to the overlapping British claim.  I believe there has been some interest in some of the disputed areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn suggested that this was a reasonable agreement. The Government are satisfied with the terms of the agreement.  We do not see it as a victory or a defeat for either party in that it is an equitable solution in accordance with the law which enables both parties to exercise undisputed jurisdiction over considerably larger areas of the continental shelf than has been possible hitherto.</P>
      <P>Deputies Barry, O'Malley and Quinn referred to a newspaper article which claims that Ireland may have lost out in the negotiation of this agreement and have given away more than it gained.  It was even suggested that a better solution could have been achieved in some areas by submitting the case to arbitration.  I believe all Deputies share the view that such would not have been the case.  Arbitration would have meant that this matter would have gone on for a considerable time.  The statements made were based on an interpretation of the law which is now outdated.  In negotiations neither side can achieve total victory.  This agreement is in effect a victory for both sides, as well as a victory for common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the question of the use of islands and certain off-shore rocks. The use of islands was of course among the determining factors which we used in the past to establish lines of division. <Col N="2213" /> However, both international tribunals and bi-lateral agreements in recent years have ceased to give prominence to this approach.  The present agreement was negotiated on the basis of existing law which favours Ireland in may areas.  It is in accordance with present international law and practice.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies were worried about the effect of this agreement on Rockall.  The situation regarding Rockall remains unchanged.  No account was taken of the rock in the calculation of the delimitation line and the rock played no role therein. Purported ownership of it, therefore, was and remains irrelevant in determining jurisdiction over the continental shelf in that area.  Successive Irish Governments have always rejected British sovereignty over the rock.  The present negotiations did not deal with Rockall, its ownership or its status, none of which was relevant to the subject of the agreement.  The agreement is, therefore, without prejudice to the Government's position in relation to it.  The position of this Government in relation to Rockall remains unchanged.  I can confirm Deputy Quinn's statement that Rockall is no longer relevant for mineral resources.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate part of the Minister's speech on the effects of this agreement. It delimits the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain, opening up further opportunities for petroleum and related industries.  It results in the solution of a longstanding and complex matter to the benefit of both parties.  The line as agreed in the north west was not affected by Rockall.  The line would go in the same general direction even if the rock was not there.  The agreement does not affect Rockall or its status or prejudice the Government's position in relation to it. Neither does the agreement affect or impinge on the exclusive fishery zone.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that in the north west area the line slopes towards the north west, enters the British de-designated area and captures most of the previously non-designated strip.  Ireland only has to redesignate an area double designated by both parties, unlike the British who must withdraw from an area <Col N="2214" /> where up to now their legislation alone applied.</P>
    <P>The agreement has no effect on Northern Ireland or the Continental Shelf off its coast.  In the Irish Sea south and south west areas the agreement results in a line that gives less than half effect to such areas as the Scilly Isles.  The line slopes steeply towards France.  It should also be noted that the line, as in the north west, captures the non-designated areas between the two parties, going right up to the edge of the British-designated areas. For all these reasons the agreement before the House is of great significance and importance for the State.  We are very hopeful about the potential effects. Consequently I recommend the agreement to the House and urge the House to approve its terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 9 November, the Danish Foreign Minister, Mr. Jensen, reasserted the Danish claim to large areas of the eastern Atlantic Continental Shelf which were included in this agreement?  He is reported as saying that the Danes reassert their claims already expressed in 1985 in this region and that the agreement between the British and Irish has no bearing on the delimitation of the continental shelf.  The same report goes on to say that Foreign Affairs officials stressed that any areas of seabed still claimed by Denmark and Iceland were included in those sectors allocated to the British under the new agreement.  Will the Minister of State confirm that that is the case and that, therefore, any other claims pursued by either Denmark or Iceland would leave us in the position of referring them to the British on the basis that their claim only arise, north of the agreed line and that we will keep what we have south of the line?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, as briefly as I can, to set in a comprehensive way on the record of the House the various attempts that have been made to alter the law in relation to the question of the value of land and the compensation that should be paid to people in the event of that land being acquired by a local authority.  I also want to refer to the various attempts, mostly by the Fianna Fáil Party, but on a number of occasions supported by Fine Gael, tacitly or implicitly, to hide behind the Constitution as the reason for not making any change and to use it as a reluctant but inevitable impediment to enabling the Oireachtas to alter the law in relation to, not just the grounds for compensation which is substantially what this Bill is about, but the basis of the valuation of the land to which the owner of the land, whether compulsorily acquired or otherwise, would be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was directly involved in introducing two Bills by the Labour Party.  When the first Bill was introduced in June 1980, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Barrett, spoke on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Labour Party Bill was essentially modelled on the <Col N="2216" /> Kenny report.  When I last spoke on this matter in the House I summarised its contents and, in deference to the House, I will not repeat my remarks.  To show how little has changed, I will quote from the 1980 Official Report, Volume 321, column 1494, when Minister Barrett said:</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the constitutional problems associated with any proposal to acquire land by compulsion in a manner such as proposed in this Bill.  As already mentioned, there has been a long history of attempts to find a satisfactory solution to the issues which arise because of, first, pressure on the supply of suitable land for housing and other public purposes and, second, speculation in land expected to become ripe for development as a result of the provision of water, sewerage and other services by local authorities.  Numerous proposals have been considered over the years but they were rejected, and a major factor in this was the constitutional problem. </P>
    <P>I wish to stress the Minister's remarks, as reported at column 1495:</P>
    <P>My Department had in the past given much thought to proposals for amending the compensation code so that local authorities could acquire land at existing use value.  However, the legal advice given to them was firmly against such a proposal being acceptable on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>On the question of constitutionality, there are problems even in regard to the Kenny Majority Report proposals. </P>
    <P>If people are interested, they should read the whole debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say, column 1497:</P>
    <P>There must be a reasonable prospect that any proposed solution will be an improvement on the existing position. It must be framed within our existing Constitution and laws. </P>
    <P>Throughout that debate, which lasted for six hours, the Fianna Fáil Government, assisted by Deputy Andrews, attempted <Col N="2217" /> to say that they basically but reluctantly agreed with what was being proposed but that, unfortunately, it could not be done because the Constitution prevented it.  I refute and challenge that thinking and I ask the Minister to admit that his party are hiding behind this matter.</P>
    <P>The late, lamented Deputy Seán Moore who was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, spoke on the same issue on 10 June.  He was in favour of the principles of the Bill but said he was reluctantly not prepared to support it because it was considered unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Deputy Niall Andrews spoke at considerable length on the Bill and tried to bring in all sorts of red herrings in relation to this, including the question of constitutionality. The Fianna Fáil position has not changed essentially except that they can no longer hide behind that excuse.</P>
    <P>In the debate in 1982 when, effectively, the same Bill was introduced again by the Labour Party, the Minister for the Environment was Deputy Ray Burke, now Minister for Industry and Commerce and for Communications.  He used the same arguments and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 344, column 881:</P>
    <P>We cannot, in this House, be selective in our approach to the personal rights enshrined in the Constitution and we cannot adopt an interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution which would conflict with that of the Supreme Court.  The Oireachtas is precluded by the Constitution from enacting any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution or any provision of it.  I believe that this Bill is not, in fact, consistent with the Constitution and I shall elaborate on this for the benefit of those Deputies who do not have closed minds on the subject. Such Deputies, I believe form the vast majority in the House. </P>
    <P>He went on to elaborate on that but the core of his argument was constitutionality. He elaborated further but <Col N="2218" /> I will not take up the time of the House by quoting it.</P>
    <P>In contributions from backbenchers similar arguments were made, obviously fuelled by the Department of the Environment. They all suggested that the Constitution prevented the Government and, by inference, the Oireachtas, whether by Private Members' Bill or otherwise, from bringing in this kind of legislation.  Is that the case because the same argument is being used here again?  The Kenny report was finally published on 26 January 1974 and not in March as has been stated on a number of occasions.  The Government issued a press statement dated Saturday, 26 January 1974, which makes very interesting reading.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Government have, however, accepted in principle the concept suggested in the Majority Report of designating areas in which land would be purchased by local authorities for development purposes on the basis of &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; values.  They recognise that cases of hardship may occur if existing use value only is paid and accordingly legislation will deal with such cases.  In the Government's view, land may be increased in value not only by works undertaken by local authorities but also by works undertaken by other public authorities &mdash; as well as by decisions taken by planning authorities. Accordingly, the scheme which the Government will introduce will ensure that designating authorities will take these facts into account.  Whilst the Majority Report recommended that a Judge of the High Court assisted by assessors should have authority to designate areas for the purpose of the scheme, the Government are aware that there may be advantages in using a differently constituted designating authority.  They will, therefore, take a decision on this aspect of the scheme later in the light of the views which they will receive. </P>
    <P>The statement also refers to what cannot be done by the Government of the day. It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> The Government have been advised that the principles on which they propose to introduce legislation will not infringe the Constitution.  The Government, however, concur with the view of the Majority Report and consider that, to avoid any possible doubts about the matter, the opinion of the Supreme Court on the legislation, pursuant to the provisions of Article 26 of the Constitution, should be obtained. </P>
    <P>It is my great regret that the Government which I supported did not proceed with enacting that legislation.  Deputy Tully, in 1980, gave a partial defence for the reasons as to why they did not proceed. One reason was the collapse in land prices at the time and the fact that a number of builders were selling back to local authorities lands for which they had bid against the local authorities and they were now offering it at a much lower price.  The heat, in speculative terms, had gone out of the land market and the matter was not as urgent as it had been before.  Another explanation given, and one that I have been reliably informed about, was that notwithstanding that press release issued by the Government, doubts about constitutionality arose and questions about constitutionality were voiced and voiced quite strongly.  At no stage was an effort made to try to test, as was suggested, the constitutionality in the courts.</P>
    <P>Two Local Government (Building Land) Bills were introduced, one in 1980 and one in 1982.  During discussion on the 1982 Bill a compromise was proposed. Arising from that compromise the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, undertook to establish a committee of the House to look into the problems of building land.  That was a concession extracted from a minority Government, a situation not dissimilar to what we have now.  The new Government came into office in November 1982 and the building Land Committee was established in the following year.  They published their report in July 1985.  A number of the recommendations which they <Col N="2220" /> made are referred to in the Minister's speech as being incorporated in the Bill that is before the House.  It is significant that a lot of the other recommendations made by the same committee have not been incorporated in this Bill.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he will indicate the reasons for this.  I will refer to those recommendations later.  After the Local Government (Building Land) Bills were defeated the Building Land Committee was established and the matter was considered at some length.</P>
    <P>The next process in this development was the publication by the Progressive Democrats of their Bill earlier this year. On Tuesday, 3 May, Deputy Michael Keating moved the Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  It was known as the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1988.  It had the same title, with a different number, as the Bill now before us.  In response to that Bill the present Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, on 3 May 1988, at column 210 of the Official Report stated in relation to this Bill and to the whole question of private property and compensation:</P>
    <P>Irish planning legislation has, necessarily, been framed with an eye to the qualified guarantee given by the Constitution to the rights of private ownership.  Given that the virtual <i>raison d'etre</i> of the planning system is to regulate and restrain development rights in the common interest, this means that some arrangements for compensation are inescapable in our planning code.  How exactly these arrangements should be drawn or delimited is a matter for legitimate debate.  But it would not be defensible, as a matter of principle, to exclude a compensation facility from Irish planning law. </P>
    <P>Nobody I know ever proposed that.  This is typical of the kind of illogical arguments the Minister has been putting forward in this entire debate.  At no stage did anybody propose that there would not be compensation.  What was at issue at all times was the basis upon which <Col N="2221" /> compensation values would be established.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to talk about the Bill which he was in the process of preparing as a justification for refusing to support, or even attempt to amend, the Progressive Democrats' Bill.  I want to refer to two points, one from Deputy McCartan who made a very interesting speech during the course of that debate and the other from Deputy John Boland, a former Minister for the Environment. On the Progressive Democrats' Private Members' Bill, Deputy Pat McCartan for The Workers' Party, on 10 May at column 900 of the Official Report stated in relation to the whole question of constitutionality and private property:</P>
    <P>Under Article 43 of the Constitution one of the most remarkable provisions in that document of 1937, the position of private property, is laid down in such trenchant terms as to be perhaps the most strongly stated right of all the various rights in the fundamental rights section.  Article 43.1 provides: </P>
    <P>1º The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods. </P>
    <P>Jurists in interpreting those words have established that the law that derives from a source antecedent to positive law is talking about God-given rights, and it is the only right in the Constitution that has the statement contained in it, that antecedent to positive law our right to private property emanates from the supernatural or from God.  No other right in the Constitution is so strongly worded. </P>
    <P>There are, however, interesting qualifications to that which are so often forgotten, not so much by our courts but by us as politicians when we try to address our understanding of what the right of property is and what it should consist of.  Too often arguments, discussions or deliberations in the area of planning are immediately discounted by reason of the strongly and trenchant <Col N="2222" /> words of the Constitution with regard to private property.  That view ran right throughout the Kenny report of 1974 which sought to address the question of building speculation and building land and the point was echoed in some of the contributions here over the last number of days in the acknowledgement or concession to Government that they must do nothing that would seem in any way to impinge radically on the right to private property because of the constitutional duty to do nothing by way of legislation that would be seen to impinge directly on the Constitution. </P>
    <P>At column 901 he continues to say:</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in some of the more recent Supreme Court decisions members of that Bench have sought to remind us as legislators that those qualifications are there and that we, as legislators, should have more regard to them. </P>
    <P>The qualifications to which he referred had already been mentioned by him as follows:</P>
    <P>As legislators we have failed to exploit the qualifications in Article 43 that allow us to tackle the whole question of property rights.  Those qualifications should be exercised as under Article 43.2.1.º in the context of civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice in Article 43.2 suggesting that laws can be enacted to delineate the rights reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. </P>
    <P>The last quotation I want to read into the record of the House is of Deputy John Boland, a former Minister in this area, who had some interesting things to say.  Clearly, preoccupation with his legal studies informed his considerable political and local authority experience.  He had this to say in reference to the Progressive Democrats' Bill at column 1175 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 11 May 1988:</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in their <Col N="2223" /> proposed alternative Constitution the party who are sponsoring this Bill repeated, some months ago, virtually word for word the provisions of the 1937 Constitution regarding the right of the individual to enjoy private property and the benefits therefrom.  I do not disagree with that in any way.  But we must try to protect, of course &mdash; and the general public would not thank us if we did not &mdash; the situation where the relatively small landowner, down to perhaps an exaggerated example of the person who owns no more land than that on which his house is built and his front and back gardens, is protected against that front or back garden being expropriated by the State without any right of hearing, or right of appeal on the part of the landowner and without any right to legitimate compensation if, after an independent hearing, it is decided that that land should be acquired by the State.  That small landowner would expect that the Oireachtas would defend his small but to him very important property rights and the right to enjoy that property in privacy. </P>
    <P>Taking that a stage further, the owner of, say, two, three or five acres of land which perhaps also has been in the family for generations, would feel particularly aggrieved if he were to have that property removed from him compulsorily, without any right to recompense or compensation.  He would feel that he had a right to seek to improve that property and to benefit from its enhancement.  That is what the Constitution initially and, subsequently the planning legislation, set out to try to do.  Equally, there devolves an onus on the Oireachtas to ensure that when misuses of statutory provisions come about, the Oireachtas moves to try to cure that situation. </P>
    <P>Deputy Boland went on to talk at some length about the differences of view between various members of the Judiciary in relation to private property <Col N="2224" /> rights and effectively, to say that there were divided opinions on these.</P>
    <P>Having put on the record of the House numerous references over an eight year period and even earlier to the publication of the Kenny report, it appears that we are all on the same side, basically we are all in favour of doing something about this problem; everybody concedes it to be a problem but, ochón agus ochón, we cannot do anything because the Constitution prevents us.  That is the theory put forward by opponents of any type of radical legislative change in this area.  It has become a very comfortable moral shelter for people who want to really obscure the main reason for their objections to any type of radical change here. They are not prepared to come out and say they are in favour of land speculation. They are not prepared to state that, all things being equal, they wish they could get a slice themselves.  They are not prepared to justify the distortions our orderly land development occasioned by the exorbitant land prices that have obtained over the past 20 years.  They are not prepared to say any of those things because it is not terribly popular to do so unless one happens to own some land oneself, unless one happens to be related to people who own land or one has some prospect of benefiting from such transactions. We should recognise that that sentiment exists.  The people who privately espouse it should feel sufficiently confident to proclaim it in this House and not pretend one thing when they mean another.</P>
    <P>There is a very understandable reason from an historical point of view for that attachment to land.  The untrammelled exercise of the full rights of that land should be contained in the body politic and cultural body of the Irish people. One could write a comprehensive history of this island over the last hundred years by confining oneself exclusively to the history of the land struggle, beginning with the campaign initiated in County Galway just over 100 years ago, the step-by-step legislative changes brought about, which parallelled the emergence of a mass political movement resulting in <Col N="2225" /> independence in 1992 and ensured that the 1937 Constitution strongly reflected that value system and ethos but the Constitution has not protected the children and grandchildren of those people who had such an attachment to the land.  The massive failure of our compensation system &mdash; not the planning system &mdash; has ensured that this country has been unable to build many of the facilities and urban infrastructural requirements it could have afforded because of the persistent internal transfer of large amounts of community-created wealth from the general body of taxpayers into the pockets of private individuals who, through good fortune or foresight, happened to be in the path of development who up to 1974 were able to reap, untaxed, the windfall benefits of that system.</P>
    <P>Whatever else one may say or think about that system, let nobody on the Government side say in relation to the legislation defeated in the past or to the ludicrous impositions now being spancelled in this Bill that we cannot do so because of the Constitution, that basically we are in favour of doing the right thing but, reluctantly, we find we cannot do so because of the Constitution.  That is an old refrain I do not accept.  Indeed, it is one that perhaps the Supreme Court does not accept.  The bluff of conservative politicians in this Parliament is being called by the third arm of the Oireachtas, the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I might now quote from an article entitled &ldquo;New Laws `possible' to Solve Planning Problems&rdquo; contained in a property supplement to <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 8 September 1988 by Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, a renowned Justice of the High Court.  He has specialised in planning law and will be no stranger to many Members of this House.  Indeed, I invite the Minister to respond to his article at some stage in the course of our deliberations because Mr. Justice Keane goes on to deal with other aspects of compensation.  However he had this to say in relation to the point I am making about the way in which the Constitution allegedly prevents us from doing the right or radical thing:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> The constitutional validity of amending legislation of this nature may well be challenged in the courts and I would naturally not wish to pre-judge in any way the outcome of such litigation. But it is clear from the previous decisions of the courts that legislation dealing with such problems will not be struck down unless it amounts to an &ldquo;unjust attack&rdquo; on the property rights of the citizen.  It should be perfectly possible for the Oireachtas to enact legislation which respects those rights and at the same time, ensures that the planning of our cities, towns and countryside proceeds in an orderly manner.  Nor is there any substance in the suggestion sometimes made that the courts will always lean in favour of the property owner.  They will, of course, respect the rights of the individual, as they are bound to do, but within those constraints, they have also made clear their concern that planning legislation enacted by the Oireachtas for the common good should be made to work.  As Mr. Justice Griffin remarked in one case: </P>
    <P>&ldquo;the purpose of the (Planning) Acts ... is to ensure proper planning and development, not in the interests of the developer, but in the interests of the common good&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I cannot anticipate how the Minister or the Minister of State will respond in relation to these matters and to this charge of hiding behind the Constitution but the Minister's staff will have the time to look at the debates to which I have referred.  There are 18 hours of debate with elaborate expositions of the problems relating to the Constitution in relation to the value of building land and the right to compensation.  Running through this debate is the basic agreement of successive Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers to the proposition but a reluctance to implement it because of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We now know that this argument is invalid not just from the quotation which I have given from Justice Ronan Keane but from the statements of two members <Col N="2227" /> of the Supreme Court, on public record at the seminar on the 50th anniversary of our Constitution in the Summer School in Glenties two years ago.  Mr. Justice Brian Walsh and Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy both clearly said, and are on public record because of the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on the Constitution and on the proceedings of part of the summer school, that a proper case has never been brought to the Supreme Court, that an effective case has never been presented to the Supreme Court and that people are presuming to second guess the Supreme Court.  What these people are doing in some cases subconsciously and in some cases deliberately, is putting into the mouths and the formal decision making process of the judges of the Supreme Court, judgments which perhaps they would like to see made without giving the Supreme Court the opportunity to make such decisions. Once again we have it in this Bill &mdash; a restriction on the coming into effect of the compensation claim, relating to the acquisition of property and the changing of the zonings dating from the publication of this Bill, which effectively negatives any possible benefit that might accrue to the community at large.</P>
    <P>The present Fianna Fáil Administration, realising that they can no longer hide behind the non-constitutionality argument are attempting to bring in something to give the appearance of activity when in reality, in relation to this aspect of existing use value and the cost of compensation and the method of compensation, they are doing nothing at all. This is a gross abuse of parliamentary time, time which the Department of the Environment could put to better use.</P>
    <P>In relation to the abuse of parliamentary time, we had the ludicrous nonsense of the Multi-Storey Dwellings Bill which is now operative and which was a total waste of time.  We now have this Bill which will achieve little or nothing if enacted.  For the last two years the framework Bill that underpins the legality of the building code for the entire building industry has been stuck on the <Col N="2228" /> Order Paper unpromoted by the Department because they want to introduce some amendments, although everybody knows that the framework legislation effectively covers the building regulations which are not being subject to any such amendment.  This is a bit of parliamentary bluffing.  Tragically the present Minister for the Environment has become renowned for bluff in recent times.  It may well be partly the cause of his non-promotion in the last week or so.</P>
    <P>In relation to this presumed restriction, this interpretation of constitutionality, why do not the Minister and his Department remove the time constraint proposed in the Bill and get a definitive decision from the Supreme Court in this matter?  I am not sure, because of the way in which the Bill is phrased, that if we were to remove the time constraint from the Bill a question posed to the Supreme Court on that point would give us the kind of definitive decision we should have on the whole question of full market value or existing use value which is really at the root of the problems confronting local authorities.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody think that the basis of our problems still lies in the unavailability of suburban land, that problem has largely been solved now because of the reduction in the demand and the substantial amount of service land available. That phase of urban development is substantially over as most commentators will concede.  What now confronts us and will confront us for the next ten years relates to the regeneration of our existing towns and cities and built up urban areas.  We will not be able to ensure that either the public sector or the private sector or combinations of both will be able to assemble derelict inner city land if the present method of compensation prevails, notwithstanding any consolidation that is being engaged in in this legislation.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted it will make life easier for some administrators, for some lawyers and for some property valuers because it codifies and consolidates the existing law in relation to the procedures for compulsory purchase and compensation but that is not what we should <Col N="2229" /> be doing here now.  This is not what should take up the time of this House. We should be talking about radically changing the basis on which compensation is given for land required for redevelopment for the community in such a manner that both the rights of private property and the exigencies of the common good can be protected.  This Bill will not move an inch in that direction in relation to the net issue of the Valuation Act 1919 and the basis for determining market value.  There are some good points in relation to excluding some aspects and I will deal with those on the appropriate stage.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations of the building and land committee have been incorporated in this legislation but others have not. Why has the Minister seen fit not to include some of the recommendations? The reality is that the Minister, seeking to get some political mileage, gave instructions when he saw that the Progressive Democrats had produced a Bill on compensation based on some fairly widely publicised cases, so as to come up with something himself.  If one reads closely the debate that took place in May of this year and the exchange between Deputy McDowell and Minister Flynn, it is quite clear that this is simply a publicist counter response to pressure that was put on the Department of the Environment in relation to the preservation of woods such as the Coolattin Woods in County Wicklow, where at that stage the Minister saw fit to vote down the Bill the Labour Party had brought in in that instance.  He also saw fit to have voted down the Progressive Democrats Bill on compensation. We were to hold our breath and wait for the radical response that was to come from Minister Flynn later in the year.</P>
    <P>If this is the sum total of the ingenuity and creativity that resides in the political cabinet of the Minister for the Environment, I do not think any of us should get too excited.</P>
    <P>We should perhaps apply to him the same logic he applied to the Progressive <Col N="2230" /> Democrats Bill.  When it was suggested any changes he wished to make could be made by way of amendment on Committee Stage, he declined that option. Yet, that option is one the Minister has offered to us in his Second Stage speech where he said he was open to constructive proposals and constructive changes and would consider amendments.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister can offer that process of parliamentary work to one side of the House when it suits him but refuses to accept that kind of parliamentary procedure from this side of the House if it does not suit him.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann pursuant to Standing Order 102 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business directs that the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987 in whole be recommitted to the former Special Committee on the Bill and the first meeting of the Special Committee following recommittal shall take place on Wednesday, 7th December, 1988 at 5 p.m. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill as published was designed to reflect the political consensus of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  Fine Gael <Col N="2231" /> intended to provide a modern legal framework to enable the courts to grant separation decrees without having to establish fault, to provide mechanisms to facilitate reconciliation and to provide greater protection for dependent spouses and children.</P>
    <P>Our only wish was to provide the best possible legislation in this area and at all times we have striven to avoid the usual adversarial approach to legislation that we see too frequently in the politically charged atmosphere of the Dáil Chamber. We welcomed the decision made by the Government to support the Bill on Second Stage.  During the lengthy Committee Stage we took on board amendments tabled by Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party which improved various provisions in the Bill.  We opposed amendments in Committee that we believed would fundamentally change the Bill and diminish the protections contained in it for dependent spouses and children and we were grateful for the support given to us in this by the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>Normally, amendments defeated at Committee Stage cannot be re-introduced. This, however, does not apply to a Private Member's Bill.  During Report Stage last week, Fianna Fáil re-tabled a series of amendments that had previously been rejected at Committee Stage.  A number of these are not only contrary to the Oireachtas joint committee's report which was endorsed by four Ministers &mdash; Deputy Woods, Deputy Flynn, Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn &mdash; but also fundamentally undermine the Bill to the extent that if it were enacted, with some of these amendments still contained in it, the law would be a good deal worse than it is at present.</P>
    <P>We believe there is no significant support outside this House for the amendments Fianna Fáil have introduced.  They are not based on any coherent philosophy.</P>
    <P>Criticising the Bill for being too liberal, Fianna Fáil removed irretrievable breakdown as the one overall ground for <Col N="2232" /> obtaining a separation decree and also removed a provision that would have enabled the majority of spouses to separate without the necessity for judicial condemnation of the behaviour of either spouse.  Criticising the Bill for being too conservative, Fianna Fáil deleted a provision designed to encourage a couple who experience difficulties during the first few weeks of marriage to reconcile rather than go to court.</P>
    <P>Criticising the Bill for not providing sufficient protection for deserted wives, Fianna Fáil amended it so as to automatically disinherit any deserted or battered wife who obtains a separation decree regardless of whether the courts make alternative provision for her future financial security.</P>
    <P>We believe we have a duty to attempt to put right the damage Fianna Fáil have done to this Bill.  We believe we have an obligation to the unfortunate casualties of broken marriages to ensure that a measure is not enacted by the Oireachtas which could greatly add to their marital misery and personal difficulties.</P>
    <P>At all times, we have been anxious that this legislation be speedily processed through this House.  We recognise the urgent need to reform a law that has remained unchanged for over 100 years. We do not believe, however, that any party in this House, or any individual Deputy, will receive any public thanks for the enactment of a piece of legislation that contains fundamental defects.  Putting this Bill back into Committee, in accordance with Order 102 of the Standing Orders of this House, will give the Government time to reflect on their actions.  It will provide an opportunity for all Members of this House to re-establish a consensus approach to enable necessary changes to be made to the Bill and provide what could best be described as a legislative cooling off period or a legislative moratorium on the Bill.  Fine Gael believe we have a duty to ensure that at the very least the Bill's enactment will genuinely result in a substantial improvement in the legal framework available to assist the victims of broken marriages to separate in a civilised way, and will <Col N="2233" /> enable battered or deserted wives seek separation decrees without fear of automatic disinheritance and possible future destitution.</P>
    <P>We believe the mechanism of Standing Order 102 provides a new opportunity to get this Bill back on the rails.  We would hope to have the support of all parties and all Deputies, be they Members of parties or Independents, in recommitting this Bill for reconsideration of the damage that has been done to it so that we can reassess the provisions in the Bill with a view to turning it again into a compassionate and humane piece of legislation properly designed to confront the reality of broken marriages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have always favoured the principle of updating the law on marital breakdown, particularly widening the grounds on which judicial separation could be granted.  We have stood by this principle since we were founded, and we are in favour of progressive social legislation which remedies the ills in our society.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced by Fine Gael we supported it, we suported the principle behind it and many of the major provisions in it, and on Second Stage we spoke to that effect.  The Second Stage was carried by a majority of the House.</P>
      <P>In the Special Committee the House voted once more to keep the principles contained in the Bill as initiated, and they voted in opposition to the amendments tabled by the Minister for Justice, and which were retabled on Report Stage. Those amendments were an anathema to the principle of the Bill, particularly the amendments relating to irretrievable breakdown, the move away from a fault based approach to the granting of judicial separations and the general approach to the necessity to prove if one spouse has been at fault.  As I said, the Special Committee voted to maintain the Bill as presented on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report Stage of the Bill was taken in the House as a whole and the Minister reintroduced his amendments.  I believe the result of the votes taken here in the last week or two have been at variance <Col N="2234" /> with the expressed wishes of the House on Second and Committee Stages and do not reflect the wishes of the House nor, as Deputy Shatter said, the wishes of the public at large, many of whom are waiting for this Bill to be passed so that they may avail of its provisions because those people are not able to obtain decrees of judicial separation as the law now stands. Bearing that in mind, I still feel that our duty as legislators would remain unfulfilled if we allowed the Bill as it now stands, following the amendments that have been passed on Report Stage, to be enacted into law and forced spouses who are in real difficulties and need amending legislation to comply with this legislation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the concept of irretrievable breakdown was in the initial Bill passed on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is in keeping with the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It moves away from the fault-based application for a decree.  It does not move entirely away from it; that is a necessary part of this type of legislation, but it allows couples to apply on the basis that they are not imputing the fault on either side.</P>
    <P>The other major difficulty and the major flaw with the Bill as it now stands is that succession rights must be extinguished if a decree of judicial separation is granted.  There is no doubt about the immediate effect of such a provision, that is it will deter hundreds if not thousands of people from applying for judicial separation decrees on the basis that they may not obtain a property or financial settlement, and if they do not and they get a decree they will have no succession rights.  No discretion is left to the court in that matter.  That is a major flaw and if it is enacted in this form it will be wholly at variance with the attempt being made to improve the legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Those who are practising in family law daily have pointed out to me and to other Deputies in this House that the way this Bill is now framed will be very impractical as regards working with spouses and with the difficulties they face.  They indicate they feel the Minister and his advisers <Col N="2235" /> have not been fully advised on the implications of the amendments they have put down.  In that case it is quite in keeping with our duty as legislators to ensure that this legislation is passed in the most correct form possible.  Therefore, we are supporting the recommital to the Special Committee.  It is not unusual to recommit a Bill to Committee Stage at some stage before Fifth Stage.  It is unusual for the whole Bill to be committed but Standing Orders provide for it and I see no reason why in this case where the situation warrants it the whole Bill be not recommitted.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that we stand by the principles enunciated in the Bill as initiated.  I believe we would be failing in our duty if we did not use the methods at our disposal to ensure that the ideas and principles behind that are enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution I intend to make will be brief.  Unless the House makes the correct decision tonight we will be doing a grave disservice to those people who are suffering now in the throes of marriages which are causing a great deal of pain and hardship.  The Bill before us as amended in the last couple of weeks, while it is a major advance on the <i>status quo,</i> is still unacceptable.  There can be no doubt about that.  In particular the provision inserted on Report Stage which has the effect of depriving one partner to a marriage of succession rights in all cases even though the marriage is still a full marriage in the eyes of our Constitution and our law, in the view of the Labour Party is a disastrously mistaken provision.  If we enacted legislation which contained that provision it would be seen, rightly, as anti-woman.  What we sought was that the court should be left with the discretion whether succession rights should be maintained or deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, legislation is needed urgently in this area.  Every one of us know of people who are suffering and who would find relief from the passage of this Bill with all its faults.  I have heard it said by pressure groups and, indeed, by Deputies that it would be <Col N="2236" /> better to have no legislation at all than to have this Bill as amended.  I regard that statement as nonsense and the height of irresponsibility.  If the decision is taken to recommit this Bill to the Special Committee it is almost inevitable that it will not see the light of day again this side of a general election.  It would take some months at least in Committee, if amended there it would have to come back to the House on Report Stage again and then go to the Seanad, and we know what might befall it there.  Was it not Deputy Dukes himself who told us quite recently that he expected a general election to take place within months rather than later?  It would be irresponsible of us to allow that to happen without at least making every effort to prevent it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if this motion is lost and the Bill goes forward in its amended form we will be left with a measure that falls far short of what is reasonably required in modern day Ireland.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I want to put this proposal to all the contesting parties in the House tonight.  From various conversations I have heard I am satisfied that there is the beginning of a will to solve this problem and a desire to end the political footballing that has taken place over this issue in the last couple of weeks.  If all parties in the House agreed to a short moratorium there might well be a chance of reaching an agreement that would enable the passage of the Bill to be completed quickly with no major deviation from the important principle we all seek to establish.  Therefore, I am suggesting to Fine Gael that this motion not be put to a vote tonight and that further discussion of the Bill be suspended for one week.  I am asking Fianna Fáil to agree to this suggestion.  In the course of the next week there would be time for all the parties to sit down and endeavour to reach common ground about the issues that devide us.  In the event that agreement can be reached in a week we would all be doing a major service to the people we represent.  If it cannot, the Labour Party are prepared to make sufficient time available from their allocation of Private Members' time next week to <Col N="2237" /> enable Fine Gael to have this motion moved and decided upon.  Nothing would be lost by either party in agreeing to this suggestion and we would all have an opportunity to use such a cooling off period to the best possible effect.  Therefore, even at this late stage I am appealing to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to defer this matter for one week to see if that service we must contribute to so many of the people of Ireland who need a good Bill could be achieved without this adversarial contest on this issue in the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the debate in regard to this very important legislation one of the jobs that taxed all of us on the Opposition side was an effort in some way to find a common cord of consistency in the position of the Government in response to various provisions in the legislation.  It started out, we understand here, when the Bill was moved for a Second Reading with the indication from the Taoiseach that it was legislation that could be easily accommodated by all parties on all sides of the House.  For that reason we moved, we understood, in common agreement to Special Committee. There some of us were somewhat surprised at the scale of the amendment sought to be pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Their position was firm at the outset but it was clear as debates developed that the firmness with which the initial amendments were pursued was wilting on the Fianna Fáil side.  We understood, or perhaps naively thought, that might have been in the face of reasoned debate and argument.  Many of us were concerned at what might well happen to the legislation when it moved from this House to the Upper House, but it was always a position that, should it be amended substantially there, as many of us thought it might because of the overwhelming odds of Government in any issue in that House, at least we could address those matters again and put them right on reversion to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has taken us utterly by surprise and has brought havoc to this legislation is the position taken by Fianna Fáil on <Col N="2238" /> Report Stage over the last two weeks. The scale of the amendment has totally emasculated the legislation.  The position of the Government leaves us with no option but to pursue the motion here tonight and put this matter back to Special Committee in the hope that we can address these matters intellingently on second run.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have shifted ground in trying to pursue some of these amendments and for that reason must be roundly condemned in the House tonight.  By way of example, when they sought to do down the most important provision to ensure that litigation in this area would be on the least controversial basis possible, they argued that the notion of irretrievable breakdown was not appropriate to this legislation but was more appropriate to divorce legislation. When we were discussing succession rights later in the Bill they insisted on an amendment that was totally inappropriate for this type of legislation and which was, as we all recognise clearly, much more appropriate to divorce legislation, an argument which they again sought to turn on its head.  Their amendments have effectively transformed this legislation and emasculated it.  They reintroduced controversy into the issues. They have done away with the right to succession.  This will make the legislation unworkable as far as the vast majority of disadvantaged spouses, mainly women, are concerned.  They have done down entirely any recognition of non-working spouses, that is, women in terms of their contribution to family income and family property.</P>
    <P>We say that this motion must be supported. There can be no other way out of this.  It must go back to Special Committee. It is hoped that the visit to that Special Committee will be a brief one and that Fianna Fáil will recognise that there is a majority view in this House that there is need for legislation, that it must be workable legislation and that all parties should be working towards a common end, trying to redress the unsatisfactory situation that has existed in this State since its foundation and since we failed <Col N="2239" /> to face up to the issue of divorce in the referendum in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Divorce Action Group, the AIM group and the Family Lawyers Association, which includes practitioners employed by the Minister in the law centres, have pleaded that this matter be put back in committee, that we come to our senses and come back with a piece of workable legislation.  It is not a big job that is being asked of us.  Arguments have been well ventilated.  It is time for Fianna Fáil to come to heel on this matter.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, arising from Deputy Taylor's remarks, my understanding &mdash; and I would like you to confirm this &mdash; is that in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order No. 102, once a motion to the effect of the present motion is made, it must be put to the House.  I would like briefly to make the point that I have indeed this afternoon taken steps to establish whether there might be agreement on this.  So far, the response from the Government has been negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Separation includes the case where the spouses though living separate lives still live under the one roof. Under Deputy Shatter's proposals proof is required similarly of one or more of the following: adultery, desertion, unreasonable behaviour, family circumstances such that it would be reasonable for one spouse to live separate and apart, separation for one year (with consent) or three years (without consent). In addition, proof is required that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. It is clear from this that proof of fault is as much a part of Deputy Shatter's proposals as of mine.  I did not, as has been claimed, introduce fault into the process.  It is clear also that obtaining a decree under my proposals will be a less complicated procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> The grounds for a decree put forward by the previous Government when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Justice were the existing grounds of adultery, cruelty and unnatural practices and new grounds of desertion and separation. That Government rejected the need to prove irretrievable breakdown and also specifically rejected Deputy Shatter's grounds relating to family circumstances. It ill becomes the Leader of the main Opposition Party to contend that in bringing forward a proposal broadly similar to those sponsored by Deputy Dukes himself and in rejecting others which were also rejected on a previous occasion, by the Government of which he was a member.  I am sabotaging the Bill or introducing fault into the process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Deputy Shatter's proposals the court was not required to inquire into the provision made for children unless the parties so desired. Because of my concern for the protection of children, I proposed that the court should be required to satisfy itself that adequate provision had been made for the children whether the parties wished so or not.</P>
      <P>My proposal that inheritance rights no longer apply when a decree is granted must be judged in the context of my other proposals.  These enable the court to transfer property between the spouses as well as to order that the wife may occupy the family home for life.  They also provide for lump sum payments, maintenance and secured maintenance, which could continue after the death of the payer.  The court is specifically empowered to compensate by suitable order for any loss of succession rights and, contrary to what Deputy Dukes says, to take account of any contribution by the wife to the family or any family business.  The court is not limited to making these orders, only to the time the decree is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposals are in line with the <Col N="2243" /> common practice under which separation agreements contain a clause providing for mutual renunciation of succession rights in return for other benefits.  There is no question of a deserted spouse being left destitute, and there is no ground whatsoever for the outrageous suggestion, which was made in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, that my proposals involve the disinheritance of children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's proposals on succession and financial provision orders were ill considered and would not have given the protection to dependent spouses that was claimed for them.  In addition they would have produced the bizarre situation whereby a wife on benefiting from a property or lump sum order would normally lose her succession rights but her husband would normally retain his.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am aware that there is genuine concern about the automatic loss of succession rights that would result from my amendments.  I doubt that there is any real basis for that concern in view of the powers that are being given to the court.  However, I am prepared to consider proposing a further amendment, if necessary in the Seanad, whereby a spouse &mdash; it would usually be the wife &mdash; in a case of hardship, if the court had not up to the time of the death of her husband <Col N="2244" /> succeeded in making adequate and reasonable provision for her in all the circumstances, could make an application to court for provision out of the estate of her husband.  Such provision would not exceed what her statutory succession rights might otherwise have been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, and subject to further consideration, such a provision should allay any fears in this area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter has, since publication of the Bill, promoted the Bill in an irresponsible manner.  I am glad to say that the House has succeeded in stripping the Bill of its pretence and inadequacy.  Many of its provisions are unworkable because their consequences were, obviously, not thought through in the way that is necessary with all legislation.  In other words, we found either that the Bill was inadequate or that what Deputy Shatter claimed in respect of it was unsustainable. The House has now considered and voted on the main features and it should not be asked to do so again.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion made by Deputy Taylor, that a decision should not be made for a period of a week or so, I am quite prepared to go along with it if the Fine Gael Party decide to withdraw their motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The crescendo of press criticism which has descended upon the Minister for the Environment for his handling of the smog problem is not undeserved.  The Flynn flurry of the past two weeks was a blatant attempt to have a public relations solution to a very acute problem but he has been caught out.  The smog problem has smothered the Minister, Deputy Flynn, just as the snow froze former Deputy, Michael O'Leary, in January 1982.  However, unlike the former Tánaiste and Deputy Michael O'Leary, the Minister, Deputy Flynn, has had plenty of notice.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall my persistent attempts last spring and summer in this House, and indeed before when there was no press interest, to urge on the Minister decisions then under the Air Pollution Act.  Week in, week out, I warned the Minister because of the six months notice required under the Air Pollution Act that if he did not act then this winter would bring with it an unrelieved smog problem.  The Minister delayed and the winter's smog has returned probably worse than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grossly irritating effects are not confined to those with chronic chest problems and heart disease but it is those categories who have first call on our sympathy. It is those categories who have the right to be most angered by the Minister's complacency.  However, complacency <Col N="2249" /> has not been confined to the Minister. The city administration also deserve to be roundly condemned for inertia and for hostility to initiatives of public representatives. When my Fine Gael constituency colleague, Councillor Charlie McManus, moved a motion to declare all of Ballyfermot a smoke control zone late last year the city manager deliberately scuttled it and proposed instead a small part of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>When I strongly criticised that proposal as ludicrous in a public statement, the corporation press officer, Mr. Noel Carroll, was sent on radio to attack me for daring to criticise the inadequacy and lethargy of the city manager's proposals. Now we must revert to the Minister who has not denied that it was he who prompted the city manager to be very restrictive in his attitude to the Fine Gael motion in the city council.  Now the same Minister and the same manager are running for cover and proposing that an additional section of Ballyfermot be declared smoke free in January and that the rest of Ballyfermot be declared smoke free during the course of next year.  As will be seen from the smog counts of the past week, even this scurried response is wholly inadequate.</P>
    <P>First, the problem is an extensive one throughout Dublin and, to a lesser extent, in other urban areas.  Secondly, in the light of experience of people in the Ballyfermot zone who converted their fireplaces in anticipation of the Minister's order and who are now refused the expected grant there is a strong reason why people should not convert their fireplaces until their areas are declared smoke control zones.  It is right to emphasise that because of the delay in the Minister determining the order made by the city council &mdash; he took several months to do so, not making a decision until 8 November of this year when the smog problem had returned in style &mdash; many people throughout the summer decided because the order was made by the city council to go ahead with the conversion to gas appliances and so on.  Up until today at any rate the Minister has said <Col N="2250" /> that they will not receive grants.  Therefore, people in other areas of the city should be warned that if they take the initiative, as the people in the Ballyfermot zone did, in an effort to help reduce the smog problem they are going to be penalised by the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and the Government.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the way to solve the problem of smog is to declare all of Dublin a smoke control zone but that may not be a practical proposition immediately.  In particular, the amount of Exchequer funds that would be necessary immediately to meet grant applications from all over Dublin is unlikely to be available and, more importantly, unlikely to be justified.  Moreover, and this is vitally important in the present context, Dublin Gas and their contractors are already overloaded with orders for the installation of domestic gas systems and there are delays of months as a result.  It is a very happy development that there are so many people throughout this city converting to gas and this is the optimum result from an environmental and national interest point of view but because there are so many people wishing to convert to gas the Gas Company simply cannot cope.  I have been approached by a number of my constituents and a number of people from outside my constituency to see if I could use my influence with Dublin Gas in order to get their conversions completed before Christmas.  The Gas Company are doing their best but, I suppose happily for the Gas Company, they have to say they are overloaded.  That is a problem at present.</P>
    <P>Good management, therefore, requires a phased approach but the phasing must have more alacrity than the Minister's original tepid approach.  Many suggestions have been made as to the further steps that should be taken, including the reduction of VAT on smokeless coal.  This could be costly and insufficiently well targeted.  Moreover, presumably the reduction would have to apply to other solid fuels which meet the European Community low smoke <Col N="2251" /> requirements.  Irish made peat briquettes are in this category.  Many of the suggestions made are well meaning but I believe a more comprehensive and thoughtful approach is necessary.  What can we do to immediately relieve this situation?  We are not yet half way through winter but there have already been several breaches of EC limits in the past number of weeks. What is realistic to expect in this area? In the light of all the circumstances, I should like to make what I believe to be a considered proposal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister announce his intention &mdash; and I am conscious that the provisions of the Air Pollution Act give a certain initiating role to local authorities &mdash; of declaring at least ten areas of Dublin as smoke-control zones so that there will be at least 30,000 houses in smoke-control zone areas.  This would be over 30 times the number of houses already declared and at the same time would be a manageable number.  Secondly, the local authorities should be invited to declare the intended zones as smoke-control zone areas as quickly as possible and oral hearings should be expeditiously arranged as soon as possible so that objections can be heard, as required under the Air Pollution Act.  It is right that people in proposed smoke-control zone areas should have a right of objection and a right to have their views known but that should not delay the Minister from forthwith declaring smoke-control zones.  This can be dealt with by way of my third proposal &mdash; residents of intended smoke-control zones announced by the Minister should forthwith qualify for conversion grants, even if the process through the city council and the oral hearing take some time and even if at the end of it the Minister cannot go ahead with any smoke-control zone.</P>
    <P>My fourth point is that the capacity of Dublin Gas to meet new connections and new conversions should be greatly and urgently increased.  It is a happy fact that so many people are converting to gas but I should like to know from the Minister what he or the Minister for Energy has done to increase the capacity of Dublin <Col N="2252" /> Gas to supply additional houses with gas and to make conversions to gas heating systems.  For instance, I would highlight the biggest single area of my constituency, Blakestown, where there are many thousands of houses &mdash; I know more about the votes than about the houses, and there are 10,000 votes &mdash; but no gas supply whatever.  That area is very severely affected by smog.  Therefore, there is an urgent need for an increase in the capacity of Dublin Gas and its contractors to make new connections and conversions.  My fifth point &mdash; and the Minister may have already done something about this &mdash; is that all new houses should be required to have a heating system which meets the air environmental standards.  Sixthly, the Dublin local authorities should be directed to draw up a five year plan which would require all houses to undergo the necessary conversions in that time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was to adopt a plan along the lines I have suggested 30,000 houses would be immediately eligible for grants.  No doubt that would have some Exchequer implications but at least the expense would be within limits and would contribute to a very early easing of the air pollution problem we have from smog, although smog is not the only air pollutant, and it would greatly reduce the health costs about which we have not heard sufficiently in this debate and to which I will revert later.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought much criticism on himself.  Some of the critics in this House have merely jumped on the bandwagon and some of them scoffed at me on the 27 occasions I raised this issue during the past 18 months.  Others without responsibility have lashed out at the Minister and have made sweeping and frequently ill-considered proposals.  The Minister has been criticised for permitting peat briquettes to be used and he has been more severely criticised for not banning bituminous coal outright.  Indeed the coal industry have been severely savaged by some critics for looking after their own interests.  I believe that these positions and these criticisms deserve analysis and consideration to see how <Col N="2253" /> they measure up to the test of reasonableness.</P>
    <P>In the first place, not alone do peat briquettes have a low smoke content but they also provide many Irish jobs.  Later on in my speech I will give some statistical facts which will help people to understand that if everybody who is presently burning solid fuels for heat used peat briquettes there would be no smog problem. Therefore, from a national interest point of view, a jobs point of view and an environmental point of view there is a large argument for the use of peat briquettes.  With regard to bituminous coal, the case on either environmental or job grounds is less convincing.  Nonetheless the coal industry have its rights, too, and the Minister would look silly if orders made by him were struck down in the courts on grounds of unreasonableness or selectivity.</P>
    <P>However, we have to ask the question: can bituminous coal be allowed to be used on as widespread a basis as ever?  It should be said that the Irish coal industry have not ignored the problem of smog. They deserve more credit than their critics are prepared to concede.  The development by the Irish coal industry of the full burning fire, though not yet proven beyond doubt, is a very worthy development.  It is right that the full burning fire should be allowed in smoke-control zones on a test basis.  If it works it will be a significant contributor to clean air and it could also become a very exportable and job creating patent.  On the other hand if it does not stand up to practical testing the days of bituminous coal as an acceptable fuel will be clearly numbered.  I would be in the vanguard of saying let us stop it but if there is a reasonable chance that the full burning fire, an Irish invention, can work it is reasonable to give it and the coal industry that chance, and certainly the evidence so far is encouraging.</P>
    <P>One factor which must be borne in mind by decision-makers in the midst of the onslaught on air pollution is that many less well off people cannot cope with two-monthly or quarterly bills.  For many buying fuel as and when required <Col N="2254" /> and as and when they have the money is the preferred choice rather than running up bills which they cannot pay.  This is an important factor because it will be understood that the most acute problems of smog arise in areas of dense housing, especially those built prior to 1975.  Most of the areas concerned are local authority areas because they are the areas which have the greatest density of housing, as is clear from the report of the environmental health officer to Dublin Corporation, from which I will quote later. These are the very areas where there is high unemployment or a high number of old age pensioners and these people do not have the money to pay the bills as they come in because there is such pressure on them to spend whatever money they have in their pockets.  They would prefer to buy their fuel &mdash; coal, briquettes or a bottle of gas &mdash; when they have the money and many choose to do without it when they do not have money.  They find the idea of a monthly bill difficult to cope with because the money is already spent. This is a factor which the Minister and other decision-makers must take into account.  It is also, of course, an argument in favour of the solid fuels I have mentioned and of bottled gas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the ESB, although electricity is not largely used for heating, and Dublin Gas should give greater consideration to restoring the 10p or 50p meters which they had taken out of the houses progressively over the years.  I can understand some of the reasons this was done, but it should be possible for Dublin Gas to supply secure meters so that people can pay for their gas as they use it, as they did in the old days.</P>
    <P>Dublin Gas will have to reverse its policy on this matter.  The big snag is that gas meters can be raided or broken into and the money stolen; indeed the tenants themselves who may frequently be under financial pressure may raid the meter. However, Telecom Éireann have had to devise more secure telephone coin boxes to deal with a similar problem.  Dublin Gas should be made bring back meters so that people can pay for gas as they use it because the present billing method is <Col N="2255" /> an acute problem for those least well off in our society, who just happen to be those most directly affected by the smog, although it affects everybody.</P>
    <P>Research shows, and the Minister will be aware of this, that there is a huge preference for an open fire; people like mar a déarfaí, their tinteán féin which gives a focal point, a hearth and heart to houses.  The propensity to buy such fuels is reinforced by that desire.  Luckily enough the desire for an open fire is not only met by solid fuels, but to the credit of the gas industry they have produced very authentic coal effect open fires. Regrettably, the calorific or heat value of these fires is not yet sufficient to serve as a primary source of heat but the gas industry should press ahead and rectify this shortcoming.</P>
    <P>Of course the primary concern in all of this has to be health.  I was laughed at when I originally raised this issue on the Order of Business and repeated on other days when it was being debated that people in Ballyfermot were being advised by their doctors to winter out of Ballyfermot with sons, daughters, in-laws or relations.  Now everybody knows that is true.  The problem is that this winter people all over Dublin are being asked to stay with relations in the country.  This is happening all over Dublin and elderly people with heart problems, asthma, bronchitis or other respiratory or cardiovascular problems are being advised to winter out of the city.  These conditions are greatly exacerbated by smog and perhaps smog is the very thing that triggers off these problems.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of evidence, although it is not proved conclusively that smog is also a contributing factor to lung cancer, so health is the first and foremost fact to be considered.  Air pollution whether by smog, sulphur dioxide or lead emissions into the air is causing health problems.  Tonight we are dealing with the issue of smog but we must not ignore the emissions of sulphur dioxide into the air, some of which comes from coal and the emissions of lead about which a campaign has already begun, to the Minister's <Col N="2256" /> credit.  This is causing health problems, which cost money.  Every time there is an incident of high level smog the surgeries in Ballyfermot and elsewhere in the city have larger queues of people, many of them medical card holders going to the surgeries at State expense.  They get prescriptions at State expense for cough bottles, inhalers and many people are hospitalised.  This all cost money. Although a grant scheme to aid conversion to low smoke heating methods would cost the Exchequer money, there is also a saving, which is very hard to quantify directly.  In addition, there will be an improvement in public health. Many people who suffer ill-health, and those luckily not affected by ill-health, will be saved a great deal of irritation.</P>
    <P>Who ever saw, as we saw in the past seven days in the city, thousands of people going around with scarves around their mouth and with masks over their nose and mouth?  I never saw people having to use these masks before and it can be taken as a true indicator that the smog problem was worse than it had ever been before.  Unless a much more comprehensive and urgent approach is taken to tackle this problem, no significant relief for next winter will be given to the people who suffer from smog.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the glow of media attention on him, must be seen to act now.  It would be a terrible mistake, when the press tires of the subject, if the Minister is allowed to slink back into old habits.  It was Fine Gael who introduced the Air Pollution Bill.  We introduced the city council motion and we pursued this matter by way of parliamentary questions and on the Order of Business on umpteen occasions over the past 18 months.  We sought and got an Adjournment debate on the subject and tonight again on our initiative we are having this debate.  We welcome the public representatives who have joined our campaign in the past few weeks.  We promise to continue our campaign until this problem is resolved.</P>
    <P>Smog is primarily a media event when it is affecting people directly.  It is only an event for the people themselves when it is there; when it goes away the press <Col N="2257" /> have other matters to cover and they forget about it.  People also forget.  That is what happened last winter when we had severe smog problems &mdash; not as bad as this year &mdash; and I raised the matter in this House on 18 November last year.  I asked the Taoiseach if he was aware of the urgency of the problem and he said he was.  I asked if the Minister would make any regulations in regard to grants. I did not get a direct answer to that question. I raised this again in December and again in February when the House resumed after the Christmas recess.  On 2 March I again asked the Taoiseach if he was aware that if the Minister did not take action it would be too late for the winter of 1988-89.  I raised this issue again on 3 March.  We sought an Adjournment debate on the issue.  We raised it again the following week, again in April after the Easter break and again in May but it was not of such great interest in May as it is not the season for smog.  The Minister could lie back and he did so.</P>
    <P>The Minister will argue that the order from the city council was 824 pages long, that it was very detailed and that he had to take his time over it.  As the Minister and the House know, before a smoke control zone can be declared six months notice must be given under the Air Pollution Act.  The Minister confirmed this in his announcement on November 8. Therefore the ministerial order of 8 November which declared the halfpenny stamp area in Ballyfermot, a smoke control zone will not come into effect until next May.  That effectively means the winter of 1989-90.  If the Minister is to wait for the results of the pilot scheme it will be too late to declare any further areas smoke control zones until the winter of 1991-92.  The Minister said he would not consider making any other smoke control zone orders until he had the results of this scheme.  Now the Minister has consultations with the city manager who derided Councillor MacManus's motion last October.  He wants all of Ballyfermot declared a smoke free zone.  He wants it done in stages &mdash; one part in January and the <Col N="2258" /> other in May.  This is a complete reversal of the position they took up last year.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister appears to have changed his mind and I hope he will say tonight that he is prepared to accept my proposal that up to 30,000 houses should be declared to be in smoke control zones. The areas are easy to identify.  In the environmental health inspector's report to Dublin Corporation it is stated that the problem is most acute in those areas where there is a high density of housing. There are 16.6 houses per acre in the area of Ballyfermot which is the subject of the smoke control order.  This would be fairly typical of Ballyfermot.  The health officer said that this must be the area with the greatest density of housing in the city but Drimnagh is not a million miles away from Ballyfermot and it has a high density of housing with less open space.  The same is true of Crumlin, Cabra and Finglas, which is the biggest of them all although it has more open space.  I asked the Minister to request the corporation to declare specific areas smoke control zones.  The number of houses involved would be 30,000 and it should be done in groups of 2,000 houses and not 800 houses.  It should be indicated that grants would be payable forthwith in those areas for conversion to acceptable heating appliances.  I appeal to the Minister to take that initiative because people will be very reluctant to transfer from one form of heating to another when they know that if they do so in advance of the order being made they will not receive a grant.</P>
    <P>As regards the density of housing in Dublin, the report states that there are 16.6 houses per acre in the relevant part of Ballyfermot.  That contrasts with areas like Foxrock where there is one house per acre, luxury indeed.  That would not be a priority area.  An area of 45 acres in Clontarf which has 362 houses gives a density of eight houses per acre.  In Ballyfermot the density is almost twice that and I am sure that is true of other less salubrious parts of the city.</P>
    <P>The report makes interesting reading. It highlights the extent to which people are dependent on bituminous coal.  In the survey area 90 per cent of the people who <Col N="2259" /> use solid fuel use bituminous coal, 5.6 per cent use timber, 1.7 per cent use turf and 2.6 per cent use smokeless solid fuel. The report shows that in that small area covering 800 houses 78,527 kilograms of coal are used every week.  One bag of coal contains 50 kilograms which gives a figure of 1,500 bags of bituminous coal being used in that small area every week. One of the advantages of using coal for many people is that it is delivered to the door.  Bord na Móna have been somewhat slack in this respect although I am delighted with the initiative they have taken in recent times of having milkmen deliver bales of briquettes with their milk. Some of the bellmen who deliver coal also offer briquettes for sale.  Up to recently the only fuel that was delivered to the door was coal and we could not expect old age pensioners to lug turf or briquettes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I also hope that there will be a continuous attack on this and all forms of air pollution and that we will never again have the problems we experienced this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis of my argument in relation to this legislation is that Fianna Fáil in the past have hidden behind the constitutional position &mdash; or their perception of it &mdash; when dealing with the problems of compensation.  Having been forced to come out from that cover by virtue of the continuing difficulties, the Minister is now introducing a Bill which, on the surface, appears to deal with the problem. However, because of the phrase that relates to people buying land or inheriting after a certain date, the real effect is of no consequence in substantial terms. There are some merits in the Bill in terms of consolidation of existing legislation <Col N="2261" /> and in relation to connections to sewers, other aspects of development plans and woodlands but the central core of the Bill purports to do something which, in reality, it does not.  I am glad the Minister is here because I like to say things directly to people.  We wasted our time debating the Act in relation to multi-story dwellings because the regulations to give effect to it have not been brought in.  We would be much better off discussing Committee Stage of the Building Control Bill which, I understand, we might be doing in two weeks' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I now want to turn to how well the market for land functions and the general perception in relation to access to land for development or redevelopment purposes.  Before Private Members' time, I said that after the two land Acts were passed, a committee on building land were established.  After a long time &mdash; approximately one year &mdash; they issued a report with a series of recommendations, <Col N="2262" /> some of which are incorporated in the legislation but others which have not been fully taken into account, notwithstanding the fact that we very seldom get a chance in the House to make major, radical changes in legislation governing this area.  The basic 1963 Planning Act and the 1976 amendment to it are the core areas but we have still done nothing significant about the question of administration or the legislative framework within which urban land is dealt with.</P>
      <P>The recession has lasted now for eight or nine years and has taken the heat out of speculative scandals in suburban land which has, in turn, taken the heat out of the speculative scandals which were the driving force behind the establishment of the Kenny Committee in the late sixties. You and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were once proud members of the same local authority and, no matter what Minister for the Environment is in power, we will be faced with a new type of development challenge.  I refer to the inner city areas, not exclusively in Dublin but in Limerick, Cork, Waterford, and a host of other towns which will increasingly be faced with problems in acquiring and putting together parcels of land which are capable of regeneration.  We do not have a system of legislation in place which strikes the correct balance between the exigencies of the common good and the legitimate rights of private property.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation in principle, however defective, because it is an opportunity to enable successive generations to deal with this problem.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might concede, I am speaking not just as a politician but with an interest that has animated a lot of my political involvement over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in the Minister's absence that basically Fianna Fáil believe in the right of the speculator to scoop the pool.  There is a touch of the lottery about the whole attitude to land speculation and if your number comes up because a compulsory purchase order was put on your stretch of land, disused coal-yard or your granny's old factory, it is right and proper to avail of it.  Indeed, the Taoiseach is a major beneficiary of a windfall in relation <Col N="2263" /> to a previous property which he owned in Grangemore.  In an edition of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in the late seventies there was a three-part profile of the Taoiseach by Mr. Vincent Browne, now the editor of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, who is a great admirer of the Government and regards it as the best in 20 years.  In relation to the undoubted and professed wealth of the Taoiseach, Mr. Browne said it was acquired by buying and selling well.  I am not casting any aspersions on the individual involved, I am simply challenging the position which Fianna Fáil consistently had in relation to defending the exigencies of the common good against the individual speculator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to personalise it and I draw your attention to the fact that the press gallery is empty. I am simply making a serious political observation because I do not believe in cheapening politics.  Now is the time for Fianna Fáil to clearly state that they are in favour of getting the balance right. They should not hide behind this constitutional defence.  In the Minister's opening speech he said he was advised that he cannot make this provision effective irrespective of the date of acquisition, because of a presumed unconstitutionality.  At this stage I might be open to the admonition that I am repeating myself but as the Minister for the Environment is here I am availing of the opportunity to say directly to him that he should seriously consider removing the time clause.  If the question of constitutionality arises, we should let the courts decide.  Earlier I cited two previous Fianna Fáil Ministers and various other speakers.  For some reason the Government have hidden behind, taken refuge behind or been obliged to take account of the constitutionality argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a different case in the Department of the Environment, who are charged <Col N="2264" /> with responsibility for introducing legislation with respect to voting rights for UK citizens, a similar argument was adduced from the point of view of legislation and the mechanism was found.  Likewise, the Minister's predecessor and Cabinet colleague, Deputy Burke, when Minister for the Environment, introduced two Bills in relation to rent restrictions, following the successful constitutional challenge made by a Fianna Fáil councillor, Councillor Madigan, who at that time was a private solicitor.  The Kenny report cites the rent control legislation as being evidence of the presumed constitutionality of the recommendations in the majority report.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point but this is something about which I feel very strongly.  Ministers of the day should take account of what the Oireachtas is saying as distinct from what the advisers to members of the Oireachtas are writing in relation to not moving outside the framework of what you can and cannot do under Article 13 of the Constitution with the presumption of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I know of two pieces of legislation that were brought in by the Government of which I was proud to be a member, which had a question mark over their constitutionality. There was no legal advice to the effect that they were not constitutional but there was a considered legal view to the effect that there would be a respectable body of legal opinion that would challenge the constitutionality of this provision, but notwithstanding that, it should be brought in and, if needs be, the time-honoured convention of recognising that debate about its constitutionality should be addressed by the Minister.  The signal, in conventional terms, should be given by the Minister so that the President of the day can, in his wisdom and having taken the advice of the Council of State, refer the matter to the Supreme Court for a speedy adjudication and a definitive ruling.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest disrespect for the assembled body of legal opinion that comes out of the impregnated walls of the Custom House on the one hand and the Attorney General's office on the other in relation to the constitutionality of any measure that attempts to strike a new balance in the perceived relationship between private property rights on the one hand and the exigencies of the common good on the other.  It is my great regret that, while I was honoured, through the democratic system in this country, to hold power I was never able to exercise it to full effect in relation to this area.  The legal view is mistaken.  I referred to this earlier when I quoted Justice Ronan Keane, a member of the High Court, who is not a stranger to many Members of this House and also Justice Griffin, both of whom said that the Supreme Court has never been properly tested in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>There are a series of civil servants &mdash; lawyers who have practised most of their lives as legal advisers and who are preempting the prerogative of the Supreme Court in relation to determining the constitutionality of the balance between private property rights on the one hand and the exigencies of the common good on the other.  I paraphrased the comments made by Justice Walsh and Justice Neil McCarthy on the same issue.  If the Minister wants support from the Labour Party on Second Stage of this Bill &mdash; I would have to tell him at this stage that the Labour Party will be voting against it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister in his reply <Col N="2266" /> should indicate that he is prepared to remove the time clause in relation to the compensation issue.  The provision I am referring to states that people who acquire land after a particular date &mdash; I think it is 28 October 1988, the date on which the Bill was published &mdash; people who would otherwise inherit land by virtue of the laws of succession or people who have owned land before that date, will be exempt from this provision.  The Minister in his introductory speech on Second Stage said that he put in that time clause on legal advice to the effect that such a retrospective type of measure without the time clause could be deemed &mdash; I am interpreting what the Minister said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from memory.  I have listened to the Minister's speech and I also read it.  There is a time clause, starting from the publication of the Bill or alternatively, according to Yvonne Scannell who writes for the property section of <i>The Irish Times,</i> from the enactment of the Bill.  The measures in relation to one aspect of compensation for land owners would only apply if they had bought or acquired land after a particular date.  The people who would inherit land would be excluded from the provision as would people who owned land prior to the publication of the Bill or its enactment.  The reason that qualification was put in was that the Minister was given advice to comply with the constitutionality requirements.</P>

      <P>That was the way I interpreted it.  I have a major reservation in terms of the effectiveness of the Bill.  It does not go half far enough.  I have to be, as I always try to be intellectually open, frank and honest.  There are many good provisions in the Bill such as the extension of the non-compensatable grounds as was recommended by the Building Land Committee.  From a consolidation point of view the Bill also has some merit. I am opposed in principle to the Bill at this stage for the following reason.  It does not deal with two problems.  I regret to say that for the last two years we have had no substantial indication from the Minister or from other Fianna Fáil Ministers of a willingness to significantly trade on Committee Stage and to accept substantial as distinct from technocratic amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would wait a moment.  I conceded amendments last year here on a major Bill.  That is not to say I would do so this time.  What I said was that I am open to suggestions to improve this Bill and those sentiments were genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's remarks in that spirit.  I am merely saying to the Minister that the provisions of this Bill will not enable local authorities or indeed the private sector to assemble parcels of land or acquire land on the periphery or in centres of towns and cities unless the constitutionality question is dealt with.  The constitutional question has imposed itself by way of the time clause inserted in this Bill.  That is the way I read the provisions.  The Minister's advisers will be much more skilled than I on these aspects, will be able to guide him and the Minister will have time to reply to the Second Stage debate.  In summary, that is the basis of my argument. <Col N="2268" /> I should like to put on record some of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land with regard to the operation of the land market.  That committee was comprised of what might be described as senior Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputies representation was comprised of: Michael Begley, Hugh Coveney, Avril Doyle, Jim Fitzsimons, Michael Keating, Ray MacSharry, Robert Molloy &mdash; a former Minister for Local Government &mdash; Albert Reynolds, Alan Shatter, Liam Skelly, Seán Walsh, Pearse Wyse and myself.  The Senators were: Senators Bulbulia, Cregan, Durcan, Fallon, Ferris, Jack Fitzsimons and Brendan Ryan who spent much time deliberating on the issues generated by the debate on Second Stage, of the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill in Private Members' time, in May 1982.</P>
      <P>I am simply maintaining that the market mechanism here does not operate well because we are being forced to pay exorbitant prices which do not relate to real market value and, as a consequence, the delivery of an urban infrastructure is being distorted, twisted and people disadvantaged. The report of that Oireachtas Joint Committee was published in July 1985 and I quote from pages ix and x:</P>
      <P>The Committee concluded that the market in privately-serviced land works well.  In general there is a fairly ready supply of sites available; the price paid for private single house sites reflects the value of the site to the final user and is generally a good indicator of land values. </P>
      <P>The committee went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market for publicly-serviced land operates reasonably well, but there are a number of imperfections arising from its interaction with the planning system, land availability and price distortions.  Land prices in this sector of the market do not adjust smoothly, and are distorted by influences unrelated to building use.  This means that the market price cannot <Col N="2269" /> ensure, in some cases, that land becomes available in an orderly fashion.  Also, from time to time, prices do not reflect the development potential of publicly-serviced land. </P>
    <P>On page x of their report the committee had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Committee concluded that there is a partial failure in the remaining sub-sector, the market for urban land.  The holding of land by public bodies, landholding by the private sector for asset purposes, and other reasons arising from the operation of the planning system, combine to restrict the supply and encourage the overpricing of urban land.  The price of urban land is consequently too high in relation to the risks and high costs of redevelopment and does not in general reflect its development potential. These factors are major causes of urban decay. </P>
    <P>That last phase &ldquo;urban decay&rdquo; might jog the Minister's memory in relation to previous contributions of mine in this House.  That is why I am endeavouring to make a serious, constructive contribution to this debate without engaging in parliamentary games.  Not alone has the Minister the unique honour of holding his portfolio but he is also afforded an opportunity now to do something that would provide the basis of an extraordinary framework within which positive work could take place between now and the end of this century.  The provisions of the Bill before the House go nowhere near meeting those objectives. From what I know of the Minister, both privately and publicly, I do not think he has any antipathy toward achieving that objective.  I am endeavouring to advance a series of arguments and reasons for the Minister to overcome the enormous body of legalistic advice in regard to what he can or cannot do <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about the question of compensation and its inherent problems identified by the Irish Planning Institute. <Col N="2270" /> I might quote from their report entitled <i>Planning and Compensation</i> published in October 1988.  I might list the members of that sub-committee &mdash; which included myself, though not a very active member and, therefore, played no part in the production of this document &mdash; who were: James I.  Brogan, Berna Grist, Nicholas Mansergh, Philip O'Sullivan, Keith Simpson, Michael Walsh and Henk van der Kamp, the last-mentioned now working here but hailing from another jurisdiction and with another training.  They are people of diverse academic training and qualification.  In the summary of their report, at paragraph 2.0 they had this to say:</P>
    <P>In this report it is proposed to redefine the balance by limiting the eligibility of landowners for compensation and revising the way in which compensation is measured. </P>
    <P>&mdash;which is one of the Minister's objections in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 3.0 of their summary the sub-committee had this to say:</P>
    <P>Our recommendation on eligibility is based on the principle that a landowner is entitled to compensation if he suffers a loss as a consequence of being unable to carry out reasonable development of his land i.e. development which would not be in conflict with the specific provisions of the democratically adopted development plan.  (Zoning; preservation objectives; the regulation and control of structures and the layout of areas).  We recommend that Section 56 (1) be amended to take account of this principle and that no compensation should be paid where a development proposal is in conflict with the specific provisions of the democratically adopted development plan. </P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any difficulty with that recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister was so keen to accept the recommendation I just referred to perhaps he might consider the following one which the Minister has not already taken on board in the Bill:</P>
      <P>6.0 We also consider it expedient at this point in time in light of the above recommendation and recent case law and developments in planning that a number of other anmendments should be made to the Planning Acts and the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878. These would provide for, inter alia:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) Zoning to be mandatory in rural areas.</P>
      <P>That has an enormous bearing on the Minister's plan and that is why I am reading it out now, and I am not being facetious.</P>
      <P>(ii) The refusal of permission on the basis of the non-availability of public sanitary facilities to be non-compensatable. </P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for taking this on board.</P>
      <P>(iii) Compensation claims to be limited to decisions on appeal. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That relates to protection for the local <Col N="2272" /> authorities with which the Minister would not have much difficulty.</P>
    <P>(iv) In the event of development being permitted at any time in the future on a site where compensation has been paid, the compensation to be repaid to the planning authority. </P>
    <P>This should not cause any problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(v) Undertakings to be statutorily defined and clear procedures to be set out for granting them which would allow for public participation. </P>
      <P>I am being intellectually generous.  The Minister is very close to getting this right but I cannot understand why he cannot go the full distance.  The last point is:</P>
      <P>(vi) Permission to refuse under the 1878 Health Act to permit a connection to a sewer where its capacity is intended to serve land designated for development elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in that except the rural mandatory element which I have to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my whole point. You have gone three quarters of the way down the road.  The Department have gone close to accepting these things and in some respects have displayed an openness to accepting the conclusions of some of these people who have no political axe to grind.  Since you could accept virtually 90 per cent of what was there, why not the rural zoning, because in the context of what is happening at the moment in terms of dealing with the problems of compensation and claims and the change in zoning, you will close off an enormous loophole by having rural zoning included in the grounds for non-compensation.  If you require a local authority to zone all the land, the non-zoning of land would be addressed and the ambiguity would be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of what would be <Col N="2273" /> required for integrated programmes in the community, for which the Minister now has responsibility, I wish the Minister luck if he can get anything out of the Department of Finance.  The Minister did not get the job in Finance but I hope he gets the responsibility for running those programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not go far enough but it could go a little bit further if you were to require local authorities in their development plans to zone all land within their adminstrative areas, including rural land.  That would remove the potential loophole that could emerge in relation to compensation.  More importantly it would deal with other problems for which the Department have partial responsibility, relating to coming to terms with agri-business and the requirements that agri-business and intensive agricultural use should be subject to planning permissions, and the whole Lough Sheelin problem and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us do it right.  We are not talking about a country the size of the US.  I have always regarded the 1963 Act introduced by Neil Blaney as one of the most radical pieces of legislation ever put through this House.  After its 25 years in operation, we surely can bite the bullet in relation to extending a framework of planning control to the entire country, and part of that surely includes the provision for zoning of agricultural land held by the local authorities.  The reason I quoted that report is because you are able to accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This should really be non-contentious if we were getting it right.  As far as I am concerned planning legislation should have the support of everybody in <Col N="2274" /> the House.  Local authorities can zone all the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They can but they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They can.  It is not mandatory on them but they have the capacity to zone all their land for residential, agricultural or other use.  They have this capacity under the 1963 Act, so why are you making such an issue out of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you have seen fit to take on board many of the other recommendations these people have made.  These people are professionals in the area and have no political axe to grind.  It should be mandatory on local authorities to zone all the land.  It could be done by different means, for instance by changing the guidelines for planning authorities.  I want the political embracing of the idea that we will clearly define and put within the framework of our planning legislation a designated use for every square metre of land in the country.  That does not mean that a farmer will need to get planning permission to do every little thing like moving a cow shed or a piggery. The zoning can be stated in such a way that there will not be undue constraint on the individual.  In the broader sense this legislation specifically deals with the question of compensation and there is a big gap in the area where land is not zoned for any particular purpose.  To close that gap mandatory zoning is required right across the board.  The Minister should consider that argument. There would also be a knock-on beneficial effect in that if there was such zoning which will close a potential loophole in relation to compensation &mdash; because the vast majority of rural land will never be subject to speculative bids by property developers &mdash; you will give to a local authority and to yourself a framework within which other kinds of planning provisions can come into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the latitude given to both of us.  I will now return to a subsequent recommendation made by the Irish Planning Institute in relation to the Bill published.  They have a number of criticisms of the Bill.  Deputy Keating referred to some of those.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the amount of time I have taken up and I do not want to take up much more, so I will summarise their point.  Perhaps we can deal with this on Committee Stage where an exchange of comment would be more appropriate. Their interpretation of what I referred to in the vernacular as the time clause &mdash; the exclusions in relation to compensation for those people who bought land &mdash; if properly invoked by an inheritor of land or by somebody who owned the land before the operative date of this legislation, whatever that might be, will be by far the dominant number of people currently owning land in the vicinity of urban areas where suburbanisation and suburban growth could be anticipated. Therefore, what the Minister is proposing is not a solution.  That is a summary argument and the Minister and his colleagues are aware of it because it is already in print and no doubt they have the summary of the IPI's response, but in deference to the House, I will not put it on the record.  I am simply requesting that the Minister address that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2276" /> It has been suggested to me by legal people with knowledge of the property area that it is not clear from reading the Bill whether there is a loophole &mdash; after the Bill comes into effect a person who wants to buy land from the current owner of land in an area that would be subject to a compensation loss, can avoid that loss by obtaining effective control and ownership of that land by means of a company mechanism.  In other words, if I owned land, alone or with others, on the periphery of a large city or town, and I am aware that when this provision is introduced we will not get planning permission and that if we do not apply for compensation now we will not qualify because of the time clause in the Bill, I could convert my ownership into the legal ownership of a company rather than the legal ownership of an individual &mdash; a lot of this land is in the legal ownership of a company rather than an individual for tax reasons and for public and legal liability reasons &mdash; and a person could sell the company without necessarily selling the land.  I am referring to a possible loophole and I am asking the Minister and his people to take advice on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is there it will be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister notice.  This is a complex Bill in one respect and I am simply putting on record that it appears to some people that this loophole exists.  If the land is owned by a company any time prior to the publication of the Bill, or the coming into effect of the Bill, and the Bill goes through in its present form, and if they sell the company but not the land, they will escape the sanctions and the provisions of the Bill.  In other words, my understanding of the Bill is that it is proposed to ensure that after a certain date property would lose certain compensatable rights which are currently enjoyed, and the Minister is attempting to reduce the area of compensatable claims, and in that respect he has my support.  This loophole has been identified and I would like the Minister's legal people to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2277" /> If we take this Bill through Second Stage, Committee and Final Stages, then into the Seanad and then send it on to the President, knowingly or unwittingly creating such an enormous loophole, many people could legitimately ask what was the purpose of the whole exercise.  I felt obliged to draw the Minister's attention to that very substantial point.</P>
    <P>While there are positive elements of this legislation which deal with aspects I do not think anybody could argue with &mdash; the protection of woods, access to sewers etc., I want to challenge what I think is part of the inferred logic in the Minister's speech.  He produced some very interesting statistics in relation to planning compensation claims.  He said:</P>
    <P>Statistics on planning compensation claims have been systematically compiled only since 1982.  In the period to 1987 these indicate that, nationally, an average of some 25 claims were made each year with payments being made on average in two cases per year.  There is a striking contrast between the aggregate amount of compensation claims over the past six years which amounts to £79 million and the actual payments of £90,000. </P>
    <P>On the debate on the Progressive Democrats' Bill, the Minister said that in the same period there were 182,000 planning applications and something like 130 claims for compensation, of which a very small number, nine &mdash; from memory &mdash; were paid out for a figure of less than £90,000, because this is an updated statistic.</P>
    <P>I would not like the Minister or his Department to think that the apparent gap between the claims and the reality of the payments made would be a cause for comfort or would I like them to deduce that we do not have to worry about compensation or claims for compensation because of the actual amount paid.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, I was a member of a local authority from 1974 to 1977.  I know from my experience in the Dublin city area &mdash; which is mostly built up and not subject to the sort of difficulties that exist in suburban areas &mdash; that at least <Col N="2278" /> two planning permissions were reluctantly given by the planning authority because of the possibility of compensation payments.  I suspect the same would be true if we were to put side by side with statistics given by the Minister the number of planning permissions reluctantly made, in many cases against the advice of planners and the will of administrators but faced with the probability, and the legal advice, that if they did not do it they would be faced with a compensation claim, as well as the bureaucratic scrutiny of the Department of the Environment to see why they had incurred this massive expenditure.</P>
    <P>To that extent, the absence of this legislation has distorted the way in which development plans were supposed to be implemented, the way planners thought they should be implemented, or the way local councils, which have the reserved function to ratify and formalise development plans, thought they should be implemented.  The Minister between now and the conclusion of Second Stage might, through the resources the Department of the Environment have, set side by side with those statistics, the number of decision in the key planning areas.  We are talking about the key urban aras, probably no more than about half a dozen throughout the country, where permissions have been granted because of the danger of a compensation claim and the reality of compensation claims, but we are not going to be able to get the order of magnitude of the problem at present.  If this is the official departmental response to the problem of compensation one could infer from it that there is a great deal of noise but very little substance to the problem of compensation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to intervene again but I would remind the House and the Deputy in possession that it would be inappropriate to debate the Bill in great detail now.  That is a matter which should be left for Committee Stage and I seek to dissuade Deputy Quinn from going into much details at this stage. It simply is inappropriate.  We shall have ample time to go into all the matters <Col N="2280" /> referred to in great details when we reach Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me then proceed to conclude on the following basis.  Since I came into this House and before I came to this House this Oireachtas has been attempting to deal with this problem of urbanisation and the balance between the exigencies of the common good and the legitimate rights of private property which I totally defend and make no apology for doing so.  There have been a number of attempts to address this problem which have not been successful.  In my view this Bill, which purports to be an attempt to address this problem, will not be successful because it fails to deal with the compensation question in its essence.  Deputy Boland concurs with me in his comments on the PD Bill which is not dissimilar in many respects to this Bill.  There are good proposals in this Bill.  I would not take that away from the Minister, but unless we deal with the basis of the 1919 Valuation Act and the presumption of interpretation by the Supreme Court we will not get to the root of the problem.  I am contesting that the Minister has avoided this issue for whatever reason.  I have speculated to the reasons.  I may be wrong in my speculation, and if the Minister wishes to come in at the end of Second Stage and correct me I will be glad to accept the corrections but I want to restate succinctly what I think are the reasons for the avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Fianna Fáil Party are not committed, and I have put on the record over a number of hours various citations of the Constitution being the impediment to doing what they would otherwise like to do because they perceived they were doing the right thing, when in reality the Constitution is not a barrier because the judges have invited us to submit a suitably stated case.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair when I made this point previously and I do not want in any way to be personal about it, but I want to say that since approximately 45 per cent of the population vote for Fianna Fáil I am not necessarily castigating the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2281" /> party.  Perhaps they are reflecting accurately a sentiment in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am summarising now and I am saying that perhaps they reflect this public view, but they are not putting the balance right and the exigencies of the common good are not being respected. Accordingly, I have to say that, while there are some individual merits in the Bill in relation to its consolidation and some of the new non-compensatable reasons, we are not going to get another opportunity in the foreseeable future to deal with this problem.  This Bill will do nothing in real terms for the urban crisis we face, and it will do something far worse.  The promoters of the Bill will present it as purporting to do something for the crisis.  It will be paraded as another Irish solution to an Irish problem, and the last time we had that we did not get the solution to the problem; we got a kind of cosmetic overlay.  I say that regrettfully because I bear the Minister no ill regard. He is evading an opportunity.  I advise him that as the Bill stands now we are opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister for producing wide and comprehensive legislation here in relation to the very vexed question of planning compensation and other related issues.  As one who has had considerable experience of serving on a local authority, the very large Dublin County Council, for the past ten years I can say this is an issue that has arisen frequently at council meetings and occasions when we were considering development plans and drafting them.  I have been somewhat surprised that the sort of legislation the Minister is now bringing forward has not reached the floor of this House in the <Col N="2282" /> past, particularly because the compilation of the statistical information available to us on this issue of compensation claims began in 1982.  There have been several public debates on this issue arising largely out of some celebrated court cases on the issue of compensation which have been widely reported and debated.  Therefore, we have been very slow, certainly in the past ten years, in bringing forward legislation and it has fallen on this Minister to produce the sort of legislation which all of us, particularly those who have the experience of serving on local authorities, were calling for, since the late seventies in my case when I became a member of Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution to this debate has pointed out that the main purpose of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the law on planning compensation. I will show later that the Bill seeks to amend certain provisions of the sanitary services code so as to regulate connection of premises to public sewers and water supplies in a manner which would be more consistent with the modern planning process of today.</P>
      <P>Planning compensation and the threat of planning compensation claims have been discussed widely and commented upon for a number of years.  It is interesting to note that the statistics on planning compensation claims have been systematically compiled since 1982 and are an indication that even since then the problem has been growing.  Even prior to that, going back to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 when the whole issue of compensation was fairly widely installed and spread throughout the Act rather than confined to one section of it, we have had this issue before us and we have not really addressed ourselves to it properly until now in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it the statistics I have referred to show that since 1982 approximately 25 compensation claims have been made on an annual basis.  Payment has been made in two cases per year since then.  Over the past six years we have had claims totalling £79 million but only a <Col N="2283" /> very small proportion of that has ever been paid, something in the order of £90,000 which is a small figure compared with the total amount claimed.  The real issue here is not what has been paid nor, to some extent, what has been claimed because it is my opinion that many of the claims are purely speculative and are put forward for a whole variety of reasons. With the exception of one or two very recent cases, all or most of them have failed.  This shows the speculative nature of some of the claims.</P>
    <P>The real issue has to be whether the threat of a compensation claim flavours the approach of local authorities in terms of making planning decisions.  That is the area that many of us who work on local authorities come to understand in a particular way.  We have been confronted from time to time with the issue of whether to grant a planning permission or refuse to do so knowing that the word is out that there will be a compensation claim lodged.  Often the manager finds himself forced to make a recommendation to members that they should support the granting of a planning permission in certain circumstances to try to avoid the possibility that a compensation claim may arise.  In this area local authorities felt threatened financially by the possibility of such claims and that led to planning decisions being taken which, to some extent, gave rise to concern on the part of officials, of elected members and the public at large.</P>
    <P>All the local authorities have now adopted their development plans and many are under review at this time.  So local authorities, through the adoption of development plans, have laid down their particular development strategies in their administrative areas.  That plan remains in position for five years and is reviewed at the end of each five year spell; but it is an outline of the local authority's strategy on how its area will develop, hopefully in an orderly manner.  Within its own administrative area it can have a measure of control relating to planning decisions and planning permissions.  The <Col N="2284" /> objective of the development plan strategy can often be thwarted and frustrated to some extent when the local authority finds itself facing a compensation claim or the threat of a compensation claim. This is unfortunate because local authorities are, after all, charged with the responsibility for the orderly development of their particular administrative area and they have always found that this issue has been contentious and has increasingly manifested itself in relation to the correct planning process.  Nowhere was this more evident than in some of the rapidly growing areas of the country, particularly on the outskirts of Dublin which I would have some knowledge of. Over the last 20 years there have been between 4,000 and 6,000 acres of land developed on an annual basis.  We have built about 500,000 new homes during those 20 years.  We have the major urbanisation programme that took place on the outskirts of our larger cities and towns and, in Dublin, the creation of major towns like Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  This was major development all done in a reasonably orderly way, all achieved in an orderly manner, contributed to by local authorities in terms of their own development plan strategies with the input of officials, of elected representatives and of the community at large in the making and adopting of those plans.</P>
    <P>Between the years 1982 and 1986 about 182,000 planning applications were dealt with by local authorities and out of all of those about 130 compensation claims arose.  This was a very small number of compensation claims arising out of a huge number of planning applications.  The real problem in these areas has arisen not necessarily from a disorderly approach to development but as a result of a delay in the completion of these developments by some of the major developers, for example, the completion of housing estates, and the delay in the arrival of the infrastructure required to support those new areas that I have referred to.  Some times confusion arises as to what the role of the local authority is in relation to the provision of those services. <Col N="2285" /> The present law in relation to planning compensation is principally contained in the Local Government Planning and Development Act 1963, particularly Part VI of that Act.  Since then there has been a considerable number of court cases which have built up a substantial volume of case law around this issue of planning compensation.  Because of the extreme importance of the issue it would be much better if the legislation was made more clear than it is at present.  That is what the Minister is also trying to do in the legislation we are now discussing.  The 1963 Act is not as clear as it could be particularly in the light of the case law which has developed since 1963.  The legislation we are now discussing repeals all the existing provisions on planning compensation and restates them subject to a number of amendments in what I consider to be a simpler and more rational format which will perhaps be more easily understood by those involved in planning and development, by local authorities and elected members so that when we are called upon as local authorities to make decisions that have implications relating to compensation claims or the possibility of compensation claims we will better understand the legislation that is available to us.  I have to say that the 1963 Planning and Development Act is by no means clear in relation to the issue of compensation.  Cases that have arisen since then have further complicated the issue and made it extremely difficult for elected members of local authorities to have a serious input when discussions take place regarding developments that might or might not give rise to compensation claims.  Anything this House can do to make the legislation more easily understood would be welcomed by all local authorities, both management staff and elected members throughout the country.  The Minister made this point in his contribution.  Apart from updating the legislation and bringing in this extensive new legislation he is also setting out to make it more easily understood particularly in relation to compensation issues.  That is a good day's work as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> The Minister said also he feels there is a need for community bias in the area of planning compensation.  This is a very important point.  For a long time it has been felt that planning legislation as it is enshrined in the various Acts tends to benefit the developer.  That may or may not be true.  At the same time there is a general perception that too frequently the common good has not been served by planning decisions that have been made and that is a disappointment in so far as the present legislation is concerned. Any strengthening of the legislation is to be welcomed.  There is no doubt that the provisions contain a bias in favour of the community good.  The needs of communities will be taken into consideration when decisions are being taken.  They will not be ignored as happened all too frequently in the past.</P>
    <P>The right to connect to water and sewerage facilities is extremely important. That vexed issue, which has been raised very frequently in the past, did not merit much comment from previous contributors to the debate.  Local authorities have been unable to preserve capacity within those services in the past because of the right and entitlement of developers to tap into the facilities.  There have been many cases in the Dublin area where the courts have found in favour of landowners seeking to connect to those services.  The Minister has included a provision under which planning permission can be refused where water and sewerage facilities are deficient, without the threat of compensation, or where the capacity is required for future development.  Indiscriminate tapping into those services can frustrate future development plans of local authorities.  I am pleased the Minister is conferring powers on local authorities to act to preserve capacity for future development without a threat of compensation should they refuse to grant planning permission.  Those of us familiar with the problems caused by indiscriminate tapping into the services will welcome the Minister's move.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in relation to pollution.  A local authority will be able to refuse to grant planning permission, <Col N="2287" /> without the threat of compensation, if they consider that a project will cause serious air pollution, water pollution or pollution connected with the disposal of waste.  That important feature of the Bill has not been referred to by other speakers. It is important that we should be conscious of the need to protect our environment.  We are all aware of industries or development projects that have caused pollution.  The Minister has recognised the difficulties faced by local authorities in regard to certain applications and has given them power to refuse planning permission if they feel there is a threat to the environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that conditions may be attached to a planning permission, without the threat of compensation, in relation to the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  That is an important provision. In recent years with our cities and towns extending into the countryside old buildings and structures of historical importance have come under threat.  There is a great need to preserve them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that in regard to the preservation orders local authorities may attach conditions, without compensation, requiring a proportion of woodlands to be preserved or the felling of trees to be phased.  This issue has been raised in recent years and there have been a number of debates in the House concerning the felling of trees.  Local authority representatives have been pressing for the inclusion of many of the provisions in the Bill.  I was interested to hear Deputy Quinn say in his long and often times interesting contribution that the Minister had gone three-quarters of the way by the provisions of the Bill.  That is a great compliment by Deputy Quinn.  It is worth noting that the Minister in his opening remarks said that he was prepared to take any reasonable suggestion on board if it merited inclusion in the Bill. The Minister's interjection this evening indicated that his sole concern is to produce a sound piece of legislation that will give powers to local authorities to help them correctly organise their affairs <Col N="2288" /> without having to look over their shoulders and take account of a threat of compensation.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to stymie development; we are setting down the parameters for developers, large and small, and making it clear what they are entitled to do.  Once they are clear of these matters they can get on with their particular brief which is orderly planning and development supported by the local authority. For that reason we should make the legislation, so far as we can, as simple and straightforward as possible and in my understanding of the Bill the Minister has set out to do that.</P>
    <P>I have seen the kind of issues I have covered arise from time to time in Dublin County Council.  With this legislation in place I am convinced that the hand of local authorities in terms of planning and development will be considerably strengthened.  I know that the members of those bodies will welcome the legislation we are now discussing.  I am confident that once it is enacted it will ensure that the next phase of development, particularly in urban areas, will be done on a more orderly basis than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to compliment the Minister for the straightforward way in which he has introduced this legislation, for the simplicity of the legislation so far as it is easy to understand and, from the point of view of local authorities, the powers that it now confers on them to be able at least to deal with the issue of compensation, and the threat of compensation, which has bedevilled local authorities in their approach to the orderly planning and development of their areas.  The Minister has said he is willing to listen to any suggestions.  I suppose another occasion will allow us to speak of those and, perhaps, to introduce them.  I commend the Bill to the House and I applaud the Minister, and the Minister of State who is present tonight, for their work on this legislation and for bringing it forward at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Planning and <Col N="2289" /> Development Bill.  I thought this evening, Deputy Quinn having got three bites of the cherry, that he was going to see us burning the midnight oil and having to wait another day or two before getting our opportunity to make our comments. There are several design flaws in this Bill.  It is flawed in three major aspects.</P>
      <P>Firstly, planning is a constitutional problem just as much as a legislative problem.  The Bill does not address the constitutional aspect of the problem.  Secondly, as legislation it has several major flaws and weaknesses which may, in the long run, do more to add to the planning problems than they try to resolve. Thirdly, because of its omissions and its lack of comprehensiveness it constitutes a litany of missed opportunities to resolve some of the recurring problems in the planning area.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal first with the constitutional aspect of the legislation.  It is common knowledge that many of the uncertainties and much of the confusion in the planning area stems directly from our Constitution and the interpretation and misinterpretation of Article 43 which relates to private property.  This confusion exists both within and outside the law courts.  There are always constitutional implications whenever we tamper with our planning laws.  The provisions in the Constitution relating to private properties can be seen either as a strait-jacket or a bulwark depending on one's point of view.  There is no evidence before us that the Minister has given any serious attention to this most fundamental aspect of planning.  Has the Minister given any thought to any possible amendments to the Constitution which would remove much of the confusion and uncertainty once and for all so far as this legislation is concerned?  It would appear from all the evidence to date that the Minister would like the present confusion and uncertainty to continue and to be compounded further with this Bill if it completes its course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one extremely interesting reference to the Constitution in the Minister's speech which serves to illustrate <Col N="2290" /> just how shaky this proposed legislation is and how, in the long run, it may be rendered redundant.  I refer to the paragraph in the Minister's speech dealing with section 15 (3) of the Bill.  This gives exceptional powers to the Minister for the Environment to order the payment of compensation when all the other stated measures would have failed.  The Minister says this power is desirable so that the constitutionality of the Bill will not necessarily be threatened by hard cases arising in the operation of its normal provisions. When Deputy Quinn was speaking I think the Minister asked if the word &ldquo;constitutionality&rdquo; was in his speech.  It is evident that he had forgotten it was.  I take it that if it is there, it is there for a reason.  I am taking to task that particular reason.  What the Minister is saying here is that he wants the power at the end of the day to make a settlement on the steps of the High Court when all the other remedies have been exhausted because he is not happy that his legislation would stand up to a constitutional challenge in the courts.  That is evident on the basis of the to-ing and fro-ing that has taken place here this evening.  It must be unique for a Minister (a) to have so little confidence in the constitutionality of his own Bill and (b) to send such a blatant signal to the more ruthless speculators that if they stay in there the Minister will look after them in the end.  In relation to the particular aspect of the proposal we are speaking about I would be worried, in so far as compensation is concerned, that when people have gone through all the avenues, if the Minister is not happy he will end up sorting the problem out.  I do not believe that should be the case.  It is for that reason, perhaps unknowingly the Minister invites such a possibility, that I would wish the President under Article 26.1.1º of the Constitution to refer this legislation to the Supreme Court so that we will all know, sooner rather than later, if the whole exercise has been a waste of time in the House because it could be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>My second area of concern relates to the terms of the legislation itself.  The <Col N="2291" /> 1963 Act, which this Bill attempts to consolidate, was introduced to this House by Fianna Fáil and was rightly regarded down through the years as a speculators' charter.  This Bill is a gesture towards public opinion in pretending to reform the 1963 Act when in fact it does nothing of the kind.  For instance, the Bill will retain intact speculators' right for all those who have acquired land before 20 October 1988.  Furthermore, future generations of speculators who require such land, (a) by inheritance or (b) by family settlements, after 20 October 1988 will continue to enjoy the same speculators' rights as their forefathers enjoyed.  That is the reason there has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing in regard to this matter and it is evident that it has not covered the area I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that an abnormal amount of land acquisition took place before 20 October 1988.  Not only will such speculators be entitled to a reward but the sons and daughters of speculators can look forward to rich pickings of their shares of the spoils in the future.  One expert in the field estimated that a staggering 90 per cent of planning applications to local authorities in the foreseeable future will come from within this category.  These people will have high expectations of compensation should everything not go the right way.  The Minister has told us that there have been claims for about £79 million in compensation even though very little has been paid.  This results from the fact that it was well known that a date was going to be set.  Many properties and a lot of land has been acquired.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule lists the potential pollution grounds which will be non-compensatable. These include air, water and waste pollution.  There is no reference, however, to noise or odour pollution. Furthermore, there is no reference to airwave pollution, a possible radioactive type of pollution such as emanates from locations such as the Radio Tara broadcasting station in my own constituency. Under what heading would the Minister place developments such as these?  This <Col N="2292" /> is another area which has been excluded and it is quite evident from all the to-ing and fro-ing in connection with planning applications and appeals to an Bord Pleanála that there can be this type of pollution.  There is no reference in the Bill to blast pollution or the damage that can be caused to property in areas adjacent to mining developments.  Again, I can say from experience, in respect of Tara Mines in my own constitutency, that the effects of blasting can have a devastating impact on the environment and can affect every home in the locality of a mining development.</P>
    <P>Many of these provisions appear to be cosmetic exercises which are riddled with loopholes.  They appear to be a public relations exercise for speculators' interests with inbuilt design flaws which will ensure that at the end of the day the traditional sweetheart relationship between Fianna Fáil and the property speculators will continue to flourish.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the third main area of concern &mdash; the sins of omission, the missed opportunities, the nettles not grasped which are conspicuous by their absence from the terms of this legislation. The Minister claimed that his Bill is a coherent and comprehensive response to the problem of planning compensation. The Bill, however, does not include a comprehensive satisfactory approach to the enormous problem of unfinished housing estates and the ongoing problems local authorities face in this area.  Those of us who operate advice centres, and I am sure the majority of Members in this House, know of many people who purchased their homes in good faith and subsequently faced serious problems with roads, footpaths and lighting, etc. and so on which remained unfinished.  I would have thought that in a Bill such as this which relates to planning &mdash; we have not had a Bill such as this since 1963 &mdash; that we should have tackled this issue given our experience and that of local authorities in respect of unfinished estates and given the problems experienced by those who bought their homes in good faith and <Col N="2293" /> who paid for these services and amenities.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not allow for inspection of standards by local authority officials of estates on an early or regular basis during the lifetime of their construction.  I believe that if such a measure was introduced in the Bill substantial amounts of money and time would be saved by local authorities in the long term.  Local authorities grant planning permission for houses and other developments.  If any particular development happens to obstruct the view or overlook the back garden of a third party that party has no redress in these circumstances and this issue should have been addressed in any new legislation introduced.  We all know of cases where permission has been granted for developments which blocked off the light to the backs of homes of third parties.  I believe that if we earnestly wish to solve all of the problems in regard to compensation we should also try to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>This legislation will lead to a high demand on the financial resources of local authorities over the next few years because it fails to deal satisfactorily with the global issue of compensation.  For instance, An Bord Pleanála occasionally overturn decisions made by local authorities. They may impose conditions or give grounds which appear initially to be non-compensatable but if, ultimately, compensation has to be made because of their decisions I believe that An Bord Pleanála should be held responsible for an element of such compensation.  Again, we are all aware of decisions which county councils have made and which were appealed to An Bord Pleanála who in their view made a right decision.  The effect of those decisions may be that local authorities have to pay compensation and I believe that An Bord Pleanála, where compensation is to be paid, should pay part of that compensation.</P>
    <P>The question in regard to natural scenic areas and beauty spots has not been satisfactorily addressed in this Bill.  These areas are of enormous benefit to our tourism industry and the sterilisation of such <Col N="2294" /> areas in planning terms should be compatible under a specific charter of compensation. I have not seen any evidence of ministerial thought being applied to this issue.  What I would like to see done, and I believe this should have been addressed in this Bill, is that if any tourist amenity is purchased by a local authority the going rate will be paid along with a certain percentage in compensation and this to be included in the legislation.  In other words, people would not be able to hold out for enormous amounts of money and, again, this would save considerable time and money.  I honestly believe that this issue should have been addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to make it clear that I do not agree with the Minister's view that this Bill is a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems of planning compensation.  I believe that the Bill, if enacted, will be open to constitutional challenge.  Indeed, although he may not wish to declare it publicly I believe deep down the Minister holds the same view.  As the Minister seems to think the Bill does not consolidate all the laws of planning into one text.  Instead the Minister is running like a ship in full sail, without an anchor, before the huffing and puffing of the speculator lobby.  Unfortunately, that appears to be the case.  He has offered us a Bill which is constitutionally suspect, flawed in its legislative provisions and wasteful in that it fails to bring about the radical reforms in planning which are required as we face the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for the reasons I have given and because of the party he represents I do not trust the Minister when it comes to planning matters.  It is like having cats in charge of creameries.  That is the way it looks at this stage because all of the areas I have referred to have been left open.  What I am saying is that if the Minister has any worries he should ask the President to refer this Bill under Article 26.1.1º to the Supreme Court so that once and for all we will know whether it will stand up to constitutional challenge.</P>

      <P>After I had been appointed as junior spokesman on the environment recently a constituent of mine said to me that as a taxpayer you always know where you stand with a Fianna Fáil Government when it comes to the environment &mdash; you stand to lose out.  That was not said lightly by the person involved who has a big interest in local affairs.  Taking into account it is now almost 30 years since a similar Bill was introduced in this House, I believe we have only gone a portion of the way in solving the large problems which exist. The local authority of which I am a member yesterday spent between six and seven hours dealing with the development plan.  Various points of view were expressed as to why we did not further develop particular portions of land long before we had the money to provide services and long before we drew up a comprehensive plan.</P>
      <P>A particular point of view was pushed by some members of the Government party and this led me to believe that we should zone it and accept the consequences. We spent a lot of time in trying to ensure that before we rezoned land we would see if we had a substantial amount of land available, already zoned, for the building of houses and other property. We did not zone any more because we did not want to end up in the question that in addition to the applications which had been around for the last number of years we would have a considerable numbers of extra applications for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the areas with which all of us have problems.  It is a planning and development Bill and in fairness it should have covered all the aspects and areas I have mentioned.  If we were doing our job properly, and even though it may have taken us a number of months to put the Bill through the House, as a member of a local authority for the past 14 years I believe we should have spent a lot more time debating the Bill <Col N="2296" /> and that it should have included the wider areas I have mentioned.  Because it does not include those wider areas we may not get a chance for quite some time to introduce the types of safeguards in the other areas of planning which have caused problems for every local authority that we should have introduced.  The Bill has failed in this regard and it does not deal with the problems in the compensation area.  The Minister said tonight that he did not mention the word &ldquo;constitutionality&rdquo; in his speech but he mentioned it on page 17 of his script.  It is evident that he does not believe in this aspect of the Bill and I suggest that this is one of the aspects that should be dealt with in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I suppose I am showing my inexperience in this House by rising to the bait and departing from what I wanted to say but the previous speaker, Deputy Farrelly, has pushed me into this situation.  Towards the end of what was a fairly positive contribution he came out with the same snide remarks about the taxpayers and the Fianna Fáil Government and he went on to tell us about the continuation of the collusion between land speculators and the Fianna Fáil Government.  If such a horrible threat exists to the community &mdash; and it is there &mdash; all I can do is ask why did Deputy Farrelly, Deputy Quinn and all the other highly articulate people we have heard so far not take care of it during the past four years?  If it is such a great threat and so obvious why was legislation not brought forward to deal with it?  There is a fairly obvious answer to that question but as I said, maybe I am rising to the bait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened on the monitor to some of Deputy Quinn's contribution earlier on tonight and I want to refer to some of his remarks.  He made a highly personalised attack on the Taoiseach and then tried to suggest immediately that he would never personalise politics.  I know there are some who like a contradition but he went on further to claim that he was not playing to the gallery because the gallery was empty.  I believe that added stupidity to insult and I am very glad I have heard <Col N="2297" /> only very few examples of such gross bad manners in this House since I came here. I am amazed at the behaviour of such an experienced Deputy.  That kind of conduct and behaviour does nothing whatsoever either for him or for the name of this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an issue which was mentioned earlier in the week. Deputy Shatter made the case for regional planning and he pointed to the fact that Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation are working in isolation in preparing their development plans.  I think this is a weakness in their approach and I would have to advocate the desirability of having a more co-ordinated approach in that part of the country.  I do not know if this is one of the factors which has led to the situation whereby practically all of the claims for compensation are in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>What upset me is that the Deputy went on to instance the Cork situation as being the same.  I must say to the Deputy that normally I am reluctant to be parochial but I think I can speak with a fair degree of knowledge of the Cork situation, having been a member of Cork City Council for the past 14 years and being the present chairman of the planning committee.  There is a joint city-county committee in the Cork area who look at overlapping features with regard to planning, major infrastructural plans, etc.  This is a practical and sensible approach and is one that should be followed by all councils.  This has led to the situation whereby a section 4 proposal under the Planning Act has never been put forward during my 14 years on the city council.  I believe this is partly because of the systematic approach taken and the co-ordination of the effort between management and members of the city council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly said that they were preparing their development plan yesterday but I would point out that this process goes on for a lengthy period in the Cork area.  For instance, the process whereby the plan which must be reviewed next year will shortly start and daylong <Col N="2298" /> seminars will be held on Saturdays.  That has been the practice over the years and has allowed us to tease out in a very minute fashion the implications of planning in the neighbouring local authority, Cork County Council, to get the views of planning officials, the city manager and his staff and also to put forward the arguments and views of the city councillors. One of their chief functions is to review the five-year development plan, an exercise which I believe is not taken seriously enough in many areas of the country. In many cases there may be degrees of conflict between what the management want and what the local councillors want and this friction can be shown by section 4 proposals being put forward or in compensation cases where there is some degree of ambiguity between the approaches of the two groups.</P>
    <P>Speaking with my local government hat on, I believe we need to look very carefully at this process and to exercise more care with it.  While there are weaknesses in it &mdash; and very often we have questioned the powers of An Bord Pleanála, for instance, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the statutory five-year development plan &mdash; we can bring these points forward during the debate and ask the Minister to take note of them.  In some areas more work should go into the preparation of the five-year plan and while I have never had the big stick waved at me by the management side of the threat of claims for compensation &mdash; I certainly cannot remember any specific cases &mdash; I know that this exists in many areas.  This should not exist because local government members should be free to make a plan and implement it during the five-year life of that plan without such a threat hanging over them.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been described by the Minister and various contributors as a complex one and I believe this is correct. One has only to re-read the 1963 Act &mdash; and every time one reads it one can get a different interpretation from it &mdash; to understand just how complex the whole area is.  The interpretation by the court in at least one case under the 1963 Act would be totally contrary to what most <Col N="2299" /> of us would have taken from the Act on our first reading of it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister will welcome all constructive suggestions for improving the Bill on Committee Stage. There probably will be many issues raised that he will not deal with in connection with this Bill, but we would like them discussed at some length.  Some of these matters have been mentioned, such as delays and failures in regard to the completion of estates and the fact that failure to complete one estate in an area cannot disqualify the developer from getting permission under another application.  Many have argued over the years that this should be a factor in deciding on a planning application.  At present it cannot be taken into consideration but it should be. Will the Minister of State take note of that point and consider it in future legislation? In unfinished estates the ordinary citizen is very often left to walk through mud, if not something else.  The public cannot understand it, nor can the local representatives.  We could put a hold on the developer to prevent any further developments until completion of the initial estate.</P>
    <P>The important question with which we are dealing here is that of compensation. The public perception is that in most cases compensation should not be paid, and that goes for many cited cases.  There is pressure on planners in particular because of the threat of having to pay such compensation.  Figures have been given comparing the claims with the amounts actually paid, but the underlying threat exists.  The Minister is dealing with it in this Bill.  There is no doubt whatsoever in the mind of anybody who is in any way involved that there is need for greater weight to be given to the common interest and greater protection to be given to planning authorities in the face of compensation claims or threats.  All these matters will have to be addressed and it is hoped that eventually there will be a Bill which will help to improve the situation generally in the context of local planning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said at the end of his <Col N="2300" /> contribution that the Minister has gone three-quarters of the way to meeting what needed to be done.  I am assuming that the other quarter refers to the question of testing the constitutionality of the section to which we referred earlier.  The Constitution will be a difficulty with almost all legislation.  Several times in the House I have questioned the reason for lengthy delays in preparing and bringing forward legislation like this, but having studied recent decisions of the Judiciary in relation to cases brought under the existing Planning Acts and similar legislation, I can now see why such great care must be taken in preparing and publishing such legislation.  A serious difficulty is that in their interpretation of the wording of an Act the Judiciary do not seem to make any allowance for the actual objectives of the legislation.  This was very obvious in a range of cases relating to local government and other areas.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what is or is not contained in this Bill when completed, it will be only a matter of days before these High Court legal teams will be gnawing away at it and trying to find loopholes in the wording of the Bill in an attempt to find a reason why individuals should be able to circumvent the wishes of the Oireachtas.  I made a point during a special debate that there should be some mechanism for conveying the wishes of the Oireachtas to the Judiciary and more liaison to allow for those wishes to be reflected in decisions.  I accept totally that we have an independent Judiciary but we are here to legislate for the common good of the people and there is need for our views to be reflected in decisions.  Some decisions that I have studied over the past eight or nine years in the context of the debate that I have mentioned shocked me &mdash; the cost to the State, the interpretation which seemed to be totally contradictory to the wishes of the Oireachtas, and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look for a balance between control of the land and the environment and at the same time allow for normal commercial activities which would require planning permission from local authorities.  It is also necessary to <Col N="2301" /> take account of the Constitution regardless of the arguments of the two Members in the House who would happily ignore that Constitution.  The Constitution is our guide book and must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made in the past few months about not interfering with normal commercial activities in the industrial field, about PRSI, extra cost to developers and so on, and that we should be encouraging these people.  Members should show some consistency throughout their arguments and that being the case, many will welcome the Bill for the balance achieved by the Minister.  I hope that when the Bill is completed more people will be satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the stance taken at this early stage by some contributors who say that they will vote against the Bill regardless of any changes which might be incorporated in it.  That signals a very negative attitude, to put it very mildly. The Minister has his job and his advisers. He is looking for a balance.  Many of us have received copies of the IPI submission and one factor argued in this is the basis for compensation.  I hope that the Minister has taken this into consideration in his preparation of the Bill. It seemed crazy that the original decisions of the court, rather than interpreting the original Act, took into account that somebody could be at a loss, because of investment or various other matters, because of being refused planning permission. The decision maximised the loss of potential profit for development of the site.  That decision led to an award of £2 million to Grange Development.  That land has been zoned as partly industrial and partly agricultural/amenity, in other words, it was a green belt development. I would be very much against the idea of doing away with compensation <i>in toto.</i>  In normal commercial activities there is a need for compensation in certain areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on the Insurance Bill, 1987, was interrupted last week, I was dealing with Deputy Durkan's concerns about the manner in which some life assurance policies are sold because of the &ldquo;hard-sell&rdquo; attitude of certain unscrupulous insurance salesmen.  I would point out that the introduction, earlier this year, by the Irish Insurance Federation of a code of practice regarding the acceptance of certain regular premium life assurance policies, is a most welcome development and improves matters considerably in this area.  The code of practice was drawn up following consultation with the Director of Consumer Affairs and provides for a 15 day cooling-off period for consumers who have taken out new life assurance policies.  Now, each life assurance policy contains a notice informing policyholders that they have the right to withdraw from the policy within 15 days.  The notice also draws particular attention to the terms and conditions of the policy and its surrender value.</P>
      <P>Under section 54 of the Bill, the Minister can by order, lay down codes of conduct for brokers and agents for observance in their dealings with the public or with insurance companies. It is expected that these powers will be exercised to underpin and extend present good practice.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to section 35 which deals with the duties of auditors. He raised the question of its enforcement and I can clarify that any auditor who fails to comply with the provisions of this section is guilty of an offence under the general offences and penalties outlined in section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy O'Malley's point on the subjective nature of the phrase &ldquo;has reason to believe&rdquo;, I should point out that this phrase should not be considered <Col N="2303" /> in isolation.  Account should also be taken of its context within any subsection in which it appears.  There has to be an element of subjectivity in a provision such as this, simply because the auditor is the person on whom such responsibility will fall.  The overall aim, however, is to ensure that he reports only in circumstances where there is a real danger that a company will not be able to fulfil its financial requirements under the insurance Acts.  By confining the provision to apply only in circumstances which will materially affect an insurer's ability to do so I feel we have achieved the right balance between subjectivity and objectivity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asserted that the relative burdens in Part IV of the Bill on insurance brokers and insurance agents meant that the requirements imposed on insurance agents would be much less onerous.  While that may indeed have been the position when the insurance Bill was originally published by the previous Government, it is certainly no longer the case now following the amendments adopted by Seanad Éireann earlier this year.  Other Deputies considered that the Bill did not draw sufficient distinction between agents and brokers and also raised points regarding the law of agency and client protection in relation to agents and brokers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the regulation of insurance intermediaries is to raise standards, to provide for full disclosure of status on the part of intermediaries, and to lay down desirable financial protections for the public in their dealings with all types of insurance intermediaries, be they tied agents, multiple agents or brokers.</P>
    <P>Financial protection for the consumer is achieved by making insurers, that is insurance companies, fully responsible for all actions of tied agents; and by laying down identical rules for insurance brokers and insurance agents in the areas of bonding and separate bank accounts for client moneys handled by them.</P>
    <P>The only difference in treatment between insurance brokers and insurance <Col N="2304" /> agents, in terms of compliance costs imposed by the Bill, arises in the area of professional indemnity insurance.  Brokers offer themselves as fully independent advisers acting for a client, and it follows therefore that they must have independent sources of protection.  For this reason, the Bill gives the Minister power to make compulsory professional indemnity insurance regulations which will apply to brokers.  Most bona fide brokers carry such insurance already on grounds of commercial prudence.</P>
    <P>Agents on the other hand act for specific insurance companies and so the companies concerned must accept a measure of responsibility for them.  Accordingly, the Bill proposes to make insurers responsible in certain circumstances for the errors and omissions of agents.  This is in effect a form of professional indemnity cover provided by insurance companies in relation to agents.</P>
    <P>On consumer information grounds, the Bill provides for full disclosure of precise status on the part of tied agents and independent agents in their dealings with clients.</P>
    <P>If an insurance premium is paid by a client to an agent or broker in respect of a renewal of a policy or in respect of an accepted proposal, the premium will be treated as having been paid to the insurer when in fact it is paid to the insurance intermediary.  In other words, the insurance company concerned stands behind the agent or broker and the client is not at risk in relation to the premium paid.</P>
    <P>In addition any intermediary failing to meet financial or legal obligations in relation to any sum of money received by him from or on behalf of a client will be automatically disqualified from further acting as an intermediary.  This is an eminently desirable provision to protect consumers from those who have shown by their past actions that they are not to be trusted.  Some Deputies have stated that the number of agencies which an agent can hold is too high and that we should limit agents to one life and one non-life agency and polarise the intermediary market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> The first thing I want to make clear is that under the Bill originally published in 1986, there was no proposal to limit the number of agencies which an agent could hold.  So this amended Bill is a quantum leap forward in as much as it proposes to limit agents to four life and four non-life agencies.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation, which represents all strands of opinion within the insurance industry on the underwriting side, feel that the Bill, as presently drafted, represents an acceptable compromise which will allow the market to operate in an orderly fashion without any particular bias in favour of any one distribution system; in their opinion, any move to force polarisation on the market will create instability in the market place and ultimately reduce the choice available to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of agencies which may be held by an agent is directly related to the minimum number of agencies which a broker must hold, that is five life if he wishes to act as a life broker and five non-life agencies if he wishes to act as a non-life broker.  We picked five agencies for brokers because that was the minimum necessary if brokers were to be able to offer a genuine choice of insurance companies to their clients.  I think it is agreed by all concerned that a broker represents himself as being in the position of giving top quality advice based on products on offer from a range of insurance companies &mdash; he could hardly do that with a limited number of agencies and for that reason we have selected the figure of five agencies.</P>
    <P>I said in the Seanad and I will repeat it again in this House that I am quite prepared to listen to any reasonable alternatives &mdash; if there are any &mdash; to what I am proposing but I have yet to hear such alternatives.  I am aware that there are many agents out there at present with two, three and four agencies in life and non-life insurance.  It is no good simplistically saying that agents should be statutorily confined to one or two agencies if you do not have the solutions to the problem that such a proposal creates. However, I am prepared to listen to any <Col N="2306" /> alternative proposals and to consider the matter again betwen now and Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey inquired about the system of ministerial recognition of broker bodies.  Following enactment the Minister will be empowered to formally recognise broker representative bodies which require compliance by their members with the provisions of the Act. This allows an insurance company to appoint a member of a recognised representative body of brokers as an intermediary, to pay him commission and to rely on such membership as evidence that the broker complies in all respects with the statutory requirements of the legislation. The onus for compliance in such circumstances will rest with the recognised broker body concerned.</P>
    <P>There will be no ministerial recognition of brokers on an individual basis; insurance companies, whether individually or collectively, will ensure compliance by such non-affiliated individuals with the legal requirements before granting agency appointments or paying commission.</P>
    <P>In all other cases the insurance company will have to make reasonable inquiries on an ongoing basis or cause reasonable inquiry to be made on behalf of the company &mdash; that a person complies with the statutory requirements before appointing him as an intermediary or paying him or her commission.</P>
    <P>The benefit of the proposed self regulatory scheme is that it places the primary responsibility for regulation where it properly belongs and can more effectively be carried out, that is in the market place itself between the intermediaries and insurance companies concerned.  The compliance costs on the market will therefore be less while affording adequate levels of protection to the public at the same time.</P>
    <P>This new approach will put the onus on insurance companies &mdash; whether individually or collectively &mdash; to make reasonable inquiries regarding the people to whom they pay commission.  This to me seems a prudent requirement.  The insurance companies and the broker <Col N="2307" /> bodies may if they wish act together to set up a centralised clearing house arrangement for members of broker bodies that is to check on number and types of agencies held, professional indemnity insurance cover, bonding, separate bank accounts etc.  A similar structure can also be put in place by the insurance companies for their insurance agents thereby eliminating any duplication of checking procedures at the level of the individual company.  The market will be free to introduce whatever procedures it deems most cost-effective and practical to verify compliance with the level of requirements.  In my view the new arrangements represent the best of both worlds, that is self regulation underpinned by statute.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy expressed concern whether persons other than brokers and agents complying with the provisions of the Bill, but nevertheless acting in an introductory capacity for the purpose of insurance business would be debarred from any commission payment or commission sharing agreement with an agent or broker under the Bill.  The answer is that under section 45 (3) a commission payment can be made by an insurance broker or insurance agent to another person in relation to an insurance policy which the insurance broker or insurance agent has placed with an insurance company. In other words, the Bill specifically caters for normal commission sharing arrangements with introductory sources of business provided the contract is placed <i>via</i> an insurance broker or insurance agent who complies with the Bill.  This latter proviso is an obvious necessity from the point of view of consumer protection and to prevent unscrupulous persons from carrying on full-time activity in the insurance area as intermediaries while not complying with the provisions of the law.  However, we are not in the business of putting unnecessary restraints on normal commercial relationships in the market place, and insurance companies and intermediaries both have welcomed the <Col N="2308" /> manner in which this section has been framed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley expressed concern about the cost of product liability insurance.  The most recent Confederation of Irish Industry survey carried out in August of this year found that the cost of this cover for industry was on average 0.52 per cent of payroll and that to date there had been no explosion in the premiums charged resulting from the product liability directive.  This is an area which the industrial costs monitoring group of my Department will continue to keep under review given its importance to our exporting sectors in particular.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla made the point that certain types of insurance particularly employers' and public liability should be compulsory in this country on grounds of social policy.  Of course, I recognise that any sensible businessman will carry employers' liability and public liability insurance on grounds of commercial prudence alone, as otherwise the risk of a very large award for personal injury, if not capable of being met out of the company's free capital, may well force closure of his business.  However, I would point out that making employers' liability and public liability insurance compulsory will not solve the problems of cost and availability which will inevitably arise in certain cases from time to time.  Some small industries providing much needed employment could, therefore, be closed for the lack of such cover.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry alleged that insurance companies are not passing on savings arising from the Courts Act, 1988.  In this connection, I would point out that the Act only came into force from August this year, and it is far too early to expect savings to have materialised.  However, I have already stated in the course of this debate that recent trends in motor and liability premium rates are encouraging. It is clear that competition and Government action have already created the momentum to bring about actual reductions in insurance premium levels for both industry and the motoring public.  Deputies will appreciate that the cost of insurance is directly related to the <Col N="2309" /> number and cost of claims.  Only when the number of accidents, settlement and award levels and other associated costs are reduced will the problem of high insurance premiums be resolved.  Let no-one be in any doubt that insurance costs are beginning to moderate and fall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla alleged that certain insurance companies discriminate against certain areas of the city for insurance purposes.  Following discussions in February 1987 between the inner city development steering group of Dublin Corporation and the Irish Insurance Federation, the federation emphasised that: insurers do not regard any area in Dublin city as a &ldquo;no-go area&rdquo; for the purposes of providing cover; each case is assessed on its own merits, but a very few risks are genuinely uninsurable; social problems which give rise to high claims and premium costs are neither within the control of insurers nor unique to Dublin; such problems and their consequences are, if anything, more acute in Britain and elsewhere; and claims and premiums are directly and closely linked; premiums cannot be reduced unless and until claims fall.</P>
    <P>In cases where property cover cannot be obtained despite reasonable efforts to place the risk in the Irish market, the insurance section of my Department should be contacted with the details.  The Irish Insurance Federation's Property Standing Committee is prepared to reexamine such cases on the strict understanding that it cannot guarantee to provide cover.  Third party motor insurance is ultimately available through the mechanism of the declined cases agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry referred to the relationship between the Bank of Ireland and its life assurance subsidiary Lifetime.  I can confirm that the Irish Insurance Federation have written to my Department outlining a number of complaints on this matter.  These complaints are still under investigation and Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; if he is not in such a position I would regard it as a peculiar decision by Fianna Fáil to dispatch the Minister of State to deliver the death knell of the Swansea-Cork ferry. I want to focus on the future of the ferry in the light of the imminent danger of the company ceasing operations in the absence of a commitment from the Government to invest a sum which has been estimated by the company to be <Col N="2311" /> £1.6 million.  I understand a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Minister and the chairman and chief executive of the ferry company.  It is absolutely essential that a plan be agreed tomorrow to ensure the continued operation of the ferry.  The disastrous consequences for tourism in the south-west region if the ferry ceased to operate should be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>The Swansea-Cork ferry is the lifeline of the south-west in tourism terms.  I am glad to see some of the Cork Government backbenchers here as well as representation from Kerry.</P>

      <P>In response to that interjection it is appropriate to recall that out of the west Cork package I allocated capital to get the operation under way.  I do not want to see the operation collapse now.  I am sure that the fears I voice and the hope I express for the continued operation of the service are shared by the Minister of State and his backbenchers. The importance of that lifeline was fully appreciated by my Government.  When I allocated the sum of £250,000 from the west Cork package to provide the seed capital, the ferry operation got under way because of the additional resources provided by the then Government, the input of Kerry County Council, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and the county council on the other side of the water.  I stress that the information available indicates there is a real danger that this ferry may cease operations.  I am further advised that this decision can hardly be avoided unless there is a satisfactory outcome to the meeting tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Swansea-Cork ferry service in its <Col N="2312" /> short life has already made an enormous contribution to the south west.  The excellent Fanning-McCarthy Report highlights the fact that the contribution in 1987 &mdash; its first year of operation &mdash; amounted to upwards of £20 million in its total spending contribution to the economy of the area.  That includes tourist spending and operation expenditure. I do not have the figures for 1988 &mdash; the year is not over &mdash; but from the evidence in my own area and the reports I received, it is quite clear that the figure will be substantially exceeded by perhaps something in the order of £25 million.</P>
    <P>Two things are needed for the ferry to survive and to enable it to realise its full potential in the development of tourism in the south west.  Its capital base must be restored and developed and &mdash; equally important &mdash; its efforts must not be deliberately undermined and sabotaged by cartel or other arrangements.  I will deal with the latter point first.  It is no coincidence that in January 1987 the B &amp; I and Sealink advertised their high season fare as 39 per cent higher than their corresponding low season fare.  However, two months later, following the entry of the Swansea-Cork ferry on the market, their fares were some 12 per cent to 34 per cent lower than their corresponding low season fares.  This indicates that the cartel arrangement was to strangle the Cork-Swansea ferry service at birth and enable B &amp; I and Sealink to retain the monopoly of the Irish Sea.  I wish to give some time to Deputy Quill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the importance of competition in regard to fares and the effort made to strangle the company at birth.  B &amp; I, who were part of that cartel, are State owned and were in receipt of an enormous State subsidy, thus enabling them to join in the effort of stopping the new company from having any chance of survival.  That, thankfully, was not achieved but, as a consequence of that approach, a large part of the capital base was eroded in trying to match the <Col N="2313" /> subsidised fares.  The subsidies to B &amp; I have totalled £150 million since their nationalisation including £44 million over the past two years.  Put in that context, the effort to provide a proper capital base for Swansea-Cork Ferries can be seen objectively.  We are talking of total funding of something over £1.5 million.  It is important to have fair competition and there should not be predatory pricing or abuse of a dominant marketing position. The Minister must insist on a certain approach.  Of course the subsidy of £1.5 million is buttons in the context of the enormous investment and subsidy to B &amp; I but it is essential to secure the future of the Cork-Swansea ferry service.  The kind of money I am talking about has already been earned by the Exchequer.  I referred to a figure of £20 million for the first year of operation which would probably be around £25 million in the second year. However, approximately £45 million has come back to the Exchequer by way of tax.</P>
      <P>It is essential that a commitment is given to provide that capital injection. Without such a commitment there is a serious danger that the company will announce that their operations will cease for 1989.  A few points need to be made. I am talking about the ferry principally in the context of tourism.  I often wonder whether our commitment &mdash; I am not speaking politically &mdash; to tourism is really solidly based.  The commitment of the Government will be put to the test in regard to this issue.  We know the figures quoted in the Price-Waterhouse report and the prospects for tourism over the next few years.  A figure of £217 billion was mentioned in regard to international tourism revenues by 1995.  We also know that this country has not achieved its full potential for many years.  In many instances we have lost a market share although world tourism was buoyant.  In other areas our market share remained static and we also know that in some years more money was spent on travel abroad than was generated in international tourism.  That is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach at the tourism forum last January said that tourism figures <Col N="2314" /> were unacceptable.  He outlined the commitment of the Government to doubling tourism income and he talked about it as the top national priority.  I want to put that to the test now because tourism in the south-west without the Cork-Swansea ferry will not prosper and develop to its full potential.  We know the importance of tourism in the south-west from the number of hotels and guesthouses there.  Perhaps the figure for guesthouses is more important than hotels because the numbers in hotels can be distorted by figure in relation to business.  One third of the guesthouses are in the south-west, an indication of the importance of tourism to that area.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this ferry brought hope to the south-west based on the restoration by the last Government of the Swansea-Cork link.  Those hopes will be dashed unless there is a positive response from the Government to the request of the ferry company.  The words of the Taoiseach and his Ministers will sound very hollow if the premier tourist region is left without this lifeline.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that there will be the necessary capital input to allow the company to continue.  I am also asking him to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure fair and free competition on the sea routes.  An investment made now will repay itself handsomely in regional and national terms in the future. Unless that investment is made, the whole south-west region will suffer disastrously in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy O'Keeffe for allowing me some time.  He put the case very well and there is no need for me to remind the Minister that we have in Cork city, in Kerry and in the south-west region generally a gold mine in terms of potential for the tourist industry. It is a gold mine also in terms of potential for generating jobs but the Government need to provide access to that region.  There are three different access routes, the airport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The most satisfactory access vehicle to Cork city and to the whole region is the Cork-Swansea ferry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a service that has proven its worth and its viability.  It is, by any standards, the key to growth in the tourist industry in that region.  It is our major asset, an asset that is crying out for investment.  We are asking the Minister to make sure that the investment is made.  We are asking for a very minor contribution of State funds in line with that given to other shipping lines in recent years.  What is being sought is a minor investment that will yield a massive return over the years in terms of buoyancy in that region.  We are saying to the Minister that that investment must be made now.  If it is not made now tour operators and people in the tourist industry in the region will not be able to plan and promote their region for the next tourist season.  Unless a guarantee is given that this service will be properly funded and provided, there will be no hope of proper planning and development and the extension of tourist facilities in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That region has everything to offer. The brand names are there already, names such as Blarney, Kinsale and Killarney. All that is needed is access to the region.  It is the duty and the obligation <Col N="2316" /> of the Government to provide the funds to ensure that that access is available. A great local effort has been made to provide the cargo ship but the obligation is on the Minister's shoulders to ensure that capital funding is provided now.  If that is done, there will be a considerable return to the Exchequer, not alone in the next tourist season but in the years to come.  In conclusion, I add my voice in support of the very fine argument put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ta súil agam go mbeidh an t-am agam chun ceisteanna atá curtha a fhreagairt.  At the outset, I wish to make a few basic but very important points about my own and the Government's involvement with Swansea-Cork Ferries.  Firstly, the company in 1987, got a start-up grant of £500,000.  This was intended, and it was specifically stated at the time, to be a once-off grant to assist the company in the start-up of the ferry link between the Cork-Kerry region and the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe was allowed to make his speech without interruption.  I must insist on the same courtesy for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I could use that kind of smart jibe too but that will get us nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in recognition of the benefits for tourism in the south-west which this service brings, I successfully encouraged the allocation of a further £300,000 earlier this year to Swansea-Cork Ferries out of a special fund for tourism agreed by <Col N="2317" /> the Government in the context of this year's budget.  Thirdly, I have again encouraged my colleague, Deputy John Wilson, Minister for Tourism and Transport, to take up the helpful position which he has outlined to the Dáil in recent weeks, namely that the Government would be prepared to consider a further grant of £500,000 to assist Swansea-Cork Ferries in marketing and promoting a service for the 1989 summer season.  This, however, is subject to a reasonable condition that the company would submit to the Minister proposals for a viable operation in 1989.</P>
    <P>The value of the Cork-Swansea Ferry to the south-west is well known by me and to everybody else.  I fully accept what the Deputy opposite had to say about its value to tourism in Cork and in the south-west region in general.  The success of the company is indicated by their above-target performance in terms of numbers carried and bookings throughout the year.  I, as a local Deputy, fully realise the regional impact that this service has made.  Indeed, we have given practical expression to our appreciation of the service, as I outlined in my opening remarks. This is, of course, fully consistent with the Government's policy objective of maximising tourism revenue and jobs. However, Government action alone will not be enough to achieve our tourism objectives.  We need an ongoing partnership of Government and tourism interests.  I would acknowledge the cooperation we are receiving from the tourism interests to the initiatives and promptings given by the Government.</P>
    <P>Swansea-Cork Ferries cannot expect to rely on the Government to meet shortfall in their working capital.  It is, therefore, now a matter for them to respond to the possibility held out by my colleagues of a further £500,000 grant by putting together proposals for a service in 1989. Such proposals would have to include, for example, the sources of the necessary working capital in addition to what the Government may be prepared to provide. That is what I meant when I said at the outset that I will continue to assist the company in exploring every possibility &mdash;<Col N="2318" /> I emphasise &ldquo;every possibility&rdquo;&mdash; including the possibility of raising finance from the private or other sectors.</P>
    <P>It is time I referred to statements made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in the House this evening about the B &amp; I.  I should pre-empt my remarks by saying that, when in Opposition, I was as critical as was anybody else of the B &amp; I.  I am on record as having made the longest contribution in a debate on the reports available to us at the time on the matter of the B &amp; I pulling out of Cork.  I do not change too easily.  I was strong in my determination then and I am as committed now as I was then.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allegations being made about the level of subsidy for the B &amp; I and its use to support uneconomic pricing I might say that the B &amp; I do not receive Exchequer subsidies to support any fares policy or for any other reason. The B &amp; I have received equity support from the Government, in respect of which I might remind Deputy O'Keeffe of a few facts.  In 1985 the B &amp; I received £5 million in equity, in 1986, £20 million but, and here is the difference, in 1987, £11 million.  In 1988 the B &amp; I will need approximately £7 million in equity, bringing the total for those two years not to £44 million &mdash; as I have heard quoted and read &mdash; but to a maximum of £18 million in order to implement a radical plan of action aimed at restoring the company to viability, a plan the company have successfully pursued this year.  In any event I do not accept that B &amp; I pricing policies have caused financial problems for Swansea-Cork Ferries.  The low fares which all ferry operators have marketed in recent years constitute an inevitable and necessary response to the low air fare competition the ferry companies are experiencing.  These low air and sea fares &mdash; which the Minister and I have encouraged &mdash; have greatly assisted our efforts to stimulate the tourism industry.  I might put on the record that the 500,000th passenger this year passed through Cork Airport today.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the Government are closing the company by offering a maximum of £500,000 when <Col N="2319" /> the company say they need much more, let me say that the Government most certainly are not forcing the company to close.  On the contrary, we are concerned that as many commercial access transport links as possible be supplied by air or sea in the interests of our national tourism efforts.  However, it is a matter for Swansea-Cork Ferries to satisfy themselves that sufficient finance will be available to support whatever services the company wish to provide.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House that that company received a start-up grant of £500,000 from the Exchequr in 1987 and, earlier this year, received £300,000 from the special tourism promotion fund. Indeed they have been told that a further £500,000 may be made available to them this year.  In that equation we must also include the contributions of Cork and Kerry local authorities amounting to £300,000 to initiate the service.</P>
    <P>The Rosslare impact was mentioned in the House here last week.  This debate affords me an opportunity to reflect briefly on that aspect.  Comments were made about an alleged adverse impact <Col N="2320" /> of Government assistance for Swansea-Cork Ferries on other ferry operators, particularly those using the port of Rosslare.  I do not accept that a viable Cork-Swansea service necessarily has adverse implications for other port or ferry operators.  It is a matter for all ferry operators to respond vigorously to challenges in the market place and increase the total number of tourists utilising their ferries.</P>
    <P>Finally I might add that, as a Cork Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport I will continue, as I have done with my Government colleagues, to assist Swansea-Cork Ferries to explore every possibility of ensuring the continuity of the service.  The Minister himself and I will be meeting with Swansea-Cork Ferries tomorrow when I assure the House that our attitude on that occasion will be as helpful and as constructive as it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 30 November 1988.</P>

      <P>Freshwater aquaculture is very tightly controlled by my Department under the Fisheries Acts and by local authorities under the Planning Acts.  My Department's policy is to encourage the production of the salmon smolts required by the expanding aquaculture industry from purpose built land based units whose design has been approved by my Department. These units maximise the control available in relation to the key factors of effluent dilution, settlement of solids and escape.  No unit would be permitted, either by my Department or by a planning <Col N="2032" /> authority which would endanger drinking water supplies.</P>
      <P>In relation to cage systems on lakes, these are now being phased out.  The one such unit authorised for the Corrib-Mask system is at Lettercraffoe &mdash; the subject of another parliamentary question today &mdash; and will be closed, at the latest, by September 1989.  It is being monitored very closely at present and will be terminated earlier if environmental factors so indicate.  I do not expect this to arise, however.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity, in addition, to remind Deputies of my recent commitment given in Cavan earlier this month to establish a separate review whereby the concerns expressed with existing developments in aquaculture and processes for regulating aquaculture can be fully and professionally examined, with independent advice if necessary and with the involvement of fishing and aquaculture interests.</P>

      <P>I wish to commend the federation for their financial assistance to the board in 1987.  Their support was most useful to the board in attending to its functions in the protection, conservation and development of fisheries and was much appreciated.  I wish to emphasise that this arrangement took place between the board and the federation and as such I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>The St. George Oyster Fishery Co. Ltd., was purchased by An Bord lascaigh Mhara in 1981.  The company has an oyster fishery in Clarenbridge, County Galway.  A development plan for the oyster beds is being drawn up by BIM. To date, approximately £20,000 has been spent on biological and hydrographic surveys, and the development of a greenhouse nursery system for growing <Col N="2039" /> oysters.  The development of the oyster beds is not yet operating on a commercial scale.</P>
      <P>In 1987 Údaras na Gaeltachta purchased the title to oyster beds in Kil-kiernan and Bertraghboy Bays, County Galway.  Questions in this regard should be addressed to Aire na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>I will not permit the development of aquaculture to put at risk the development of the wild fishery; there is no disease problem at present on western lakes, and it is my intention that careful regulation of the aquaculture industry will ensure that no risks are posed.</P>
      <P>The salmon farming industry has experienced problems this year with a disease known as pancrease disease syndrome which is associated only with farmed fish.  There are no known instances anywhere of wild fish stocks being affected by the condition, and I believe the Deputy's fears in that respect are groundless.</P>
      <P>Escape of diseased fish is not a problem in my Department's experience and it stays in close touch with the industry on this issue.  It is highly unlikely that a diseased fish would in any event be able to inter-breed with wild stocks.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, a marine surveyor of my Department carried out a preliminary inquiry into the loss of the <i>Boy Shaun,</i> which occurred on 20 September 1987.</P>
      <P>The statutory purpose of such an inquiry is to enable the circumstances of a shipping casualty to be established and to determine whether the circumstances are such as to warrant the holding of a formal investigation under section 466 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The marine surveyor who carried out the inquiry interviewed and took sworn statements from a survivor of the casualty and the skipper of another fishing vessel which was in the area at the time of the casualty.  He also had reports from the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, the Meteorological Office, Malin Head Radio Station and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  Having considered the inspector's report and the available evidence, it has been decided that the holding of a formal investigation would not elicit any further information with regard to this casualty.</P>
      <P>The report of the preliminary inquiry is confidential to the Minister and it is long established practice not to publish such reports.  I might also add that although the Deputy's states that publishing such reports meets the wishes of bereaved families it is my understanding that in many cases the contrary is true.</P>

The Central Development Committee was set up in 1962 to co-ordinate the activities of County Development Teams which were established to promote economic development in Western Counties as a result of recommendations in the 1962 report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms.

    <P>There are no maximum rates of interest specified by statute in relation to the other bodies referred to in the question.

This maximum rate varies from time to time with the trend in money market rates.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind the VAT and excise duty repayment schemes, administered by the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of vehicles specially adapted for use by disabled drivers, and the remission of road tax in respect of such vehicles administered by the vehicle licensing authorities.</P>
      <P>VAT repayments in respect of such vehicles are governed by the provisions of the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 13) Order, 1980 (S.I. No. 263 of 1980).  The conditions to be fulfilled are set out in that order.</P>
      <P>Repayments of motor vehicle excise duty are made under paragraph 12 of the Imposition of Duties (No. 236) (Excise Duties on Motor Vehicles, Televisions and Gramophone Records) Order, 1979 (S.I. No. 57 of 1979).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> Repayments of excise duty on petrol are made under paragraph 11 (9) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975).</P>
    <P>Remission of road tax is provided for in section 43 (1) of the Finance Act 1968, in which is set out the medical criterion for eligibility common to all these reliefs: that a disabled driver be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Applications for remission of road tax must be made to the relevant vehicle licensing authority.  Applications for excise duty refunds in respect of motor vehicles or petrol must be made to the Revenue Commissioners, who may seek satisfactory evidence from a medical practitioner that an applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his or her legs.  Evidence must also be produced that the vehicle is adapted for use by the disabled person as driver. Motor vehicle excise duty may be reclaimed not more than once every two years. Repayment of excise duty on petrol used by disabled drivers is conditional on the submission of quarterly claims, supported by receipts.  Records of petrol purchased/used must also be kept by the disabled driver.</P>

It is proposed to continue this practice and accordingly it is not necessary to amend existing regulations.</P>
      <P>Under the EC Suckler Cow Scheme payment is made on animals which are present at the date of application but which are removed subsequently under the disease eradication schemes.  A similar position applies to the calf premium scheme provided the calf is six months of age at the time of slaughter.  Under EC Regulations calf premium cannot be paid on calves which are less than six months at the time of slaughter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the special beef premium scheme payment on reactor animals will be considered provided the herdowners notify their local livestock office of the Department of Agriculture and Food that they have reactor animals in their herds, as soon as they become aware of the fact, so that special inspections can be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he will indicate the nature of changes to be introduced this year in respect of cattle and sheep headage payments; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a great many farmers may lose substantial income as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no further changes to be introduced under the cattle and sheep headage schemes beyond those already published.</P>
      <P>Most of the changes introduced for the 1988 headage schemes will be of considerable benefit to many farmers. Before this year the position was that in the more severely handicapped areas beef cows in herds which contained dairy cows could only qualify for up to ten grants at the rate of £32 on the first eight and £28 on the next two while in the less severely handicapped areas beef cows in herds which contained dairy cows could not qualify for any grants.  As a result of changes which I introduced in 1988 beef cows suckling calves in herds which contain dairy cows can now qualify for grants of £70 on the first eight and £66 on the remainder &mdash; subject to an overall limit of 30 beef cows in the more severely handicapped areas and 28 in the less severely handicapped areas.  This measure will be of considerable benefit to farmers affected by the milk superlevy and will help to increase the national cow herd.  Another change which I introduced in 1988 provides for the payment in the more severely handicapped areas of headage grants on breeding mares registered in the Irish Horse Register in addition to breeding mares registered with the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One change however in these schemes this year which will lead to reduced payments to some farmers is the new forage area limits system which was introduced at the insistence of the EC because the farmers concerned have stocking rates which were very high for disadvantaged land and which were far in excess of EC <Col N="2072" /> criteria for designating handicapped areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of ERAD has informed me that a number of research projects on the role of badgers in the spread of bovine TB are at present being carried out.  In individual situations, where veterinary officers are unable to pinpoint other possible explanations for an outbreak of the disease, the possible role of wildlife, including that of badgers, is considered and appropriate investigations are undertaken.</P>
      <P>Apart from the routine investigation into the role of wildlife in particular cases, the general research projects being conducted by ERAD include research into the ecology and population dynamics of badgers, and the possible development of a blood test to help diagnose tuberculosis in badgers.  Trials are also being conducted on the use of a vaccine that could make badgers immune to TB infection or could, at least, reduce the infection phase in badgers.  By their nature, these projects will take time to complete but the results will be evaluated on an ongoing basis as they become available.</P>

    <P>By reason of the backlog of payments, there was a huge volume of inquiries either from or on behalf of applicants.

      <P>The tables which follow show contributions by employers and employees to the Social Insurance Fund broken down by class of contribution for each of the years from 1980 to 1987. Deriving these figures involved making assumptions which mean that the breakdown between classes is to an extent estimated. Figures for 1988 will not be available until late in 1989.</P>

    <P>(b)  Figures are estimated.  They represent the 1988 published estimates plus the cost of the Christmas bonus payments announced in October.  There are indications of savings on some of the services, mainly unemployment payments because of reductions in the Live Register, but the precise amounts will not be known until March or April 1989.</P>

      <P>The person concerned reached age 65 on 8 October 1988.  He does not qualify for a standard rate retirement pension based on his Irish social insurance contributions.  His entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension under EC Regulations, based on the proportion of his Irish contributions to the combined total of his Irish and British contributions, is accordingly being assessed. However, owing to an oversight, the British Social Insurance record which is required for this purpose was not sought straight away when he made his claim and the consequent delay is regretted. The record is now expected to arrive within the next few days.  Entitlement to pension when established will be from 13 October 1988, the Thursday after he reached age 65.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is, however, at present in receipt of unemployment benefit and it is understood that the rate of Irish <i>pro rata</i> pension to which he is likely to be entitled under EC.  Regulations will be such that it will be more favourable for him to continue to receive unemployment benefit instead, until his 66th birthday.  He will be informed of the detailed position shortly as soon as the British contribution details are to hand.</P>
      <P>The papers in connection with his entitlement to a pension under British legislation have been forwarded to the Department of Health and Social Security. That Department will be in touch with him separately regarding that entitlement.</P>

    <P>An adult dependant allowance is only payable to a person where the dependant is not on social welfare payments or does not have earnings in excess of £50 a week. On information supplied in connection with the claim for disability benefit from the person concerned it appeared that his wife's weekly earnings were in excess of this figure.  As a result he was entitled to £43.60 personal rate plus half rate child dependant allowance giving a total weekly rate of £54.20.  The person concerned had previously been in receipt of unemployment assistance and he continued to claim assistance after his disability benefit claim ended.  His entitlement to an adult dependant <Col N="2096" /> increase is being reviewed at present in connection with that claim.

      <P>As indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 126 of 2 November 1988 on this case, the person concerned is not a claimant of the Department of Social Welfare.  He had been in receipt of sickness benefit from the United Kingdom while resident in this country.</P>
      <P>The UK social security authorities requested my Department, under reciprocal arrangements provided for by EC Social Security Regulations for Migrant Workers, for a medical opinion on the person concerned.  The person was referred to a medical referee of the Department who having medically examined him, expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He was then referred to a different medical referee of the Department who also expressed the same opinion.  The relevant papers in the case were then returned to the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the UK social security authorities disallowed the claim for sickness benefit and that the person concerned has lodged an appeal.</P>
      <P>Medical referees are fully qualified and experienced doctors who form their professional opinion in an independent manner.  Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded.  Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  Any such reports are taken into account by the examining medical referee.  In addition it is open to a certifier to attend the examination if he or she so wishes.  In arriving at his opinion the medical referee carries out a clinical examination and all medical referee reports are reviewed by the medical adviser.</P>

Social welfare regulations provide that, where no contributions have been paid or credited for two consecutive years, a claimant does not qualify for payment of benefit or for the award of credited contributions.  In order to requalify for credited contributions, a claimant would require to have at least 26 contributions paid at the appropriate rate since the last blank year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned had no contributions paid or credited from the 1978-79 contribution year to the 1986-87 contribution year.  Contributions paid since the 1986-87 contribution year have been at a modified rate and are not reckonable for disability benefit.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my reply to parliamentary questions on 4 May 1988 (Nos 49, 80 and 81), a grants scheme could only operate where a special control area order is confirmed following the completion of statutory procedures.  Only after confirmation of the order would householders in the special control area be obliged to make appropriate adaptations to their heating systems.  A press release on 26 June 1988, which outlined the scheme of grants which would be available if the Order made by Dublin Corporation was confirmed, reiterated that final details of the grants scheme could not be settled nor would any grants scheme operate until a decision had been made on whether to confirm the Order, with or without modifications, or to refuse to confirm it.  Details of the grants scheme as finalised were announced on 8 November 1988.  The grants scheme under section 45 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 is intended to assist in meeting the costs of heating adaptations necessary to comply with the requirements of the Special Control Area (Ballyfermot) Order, 1988 as confirmed by me on 8 November 1988 and adaptations made prior to this cannot legally be grant aided under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I understand that emissions of sulphur dioxide from the Moneypoint plant are estimated to amount to 53,000 tonnes in 1987 compared to estimated emissions nationally of 160,000 tonnes. For nitrogen oxides, emissions from Moneypoint are estimated at 24,000 tonnes in 1987 out of total national emissions of 83,000 tonnes from all sources. Monitoring at Moneypoint indicates that there are no direct adverse effects at national level and it is clear that any transboundary implications would be insignificant.  Compliance with the Protocol concerning emissions of nitrogen oxides, which was agreed recently in Sofia, will involve retrofitting of NOx control technology at Moneypoint and the ESB are committed to this.</P>

    <P>The placement rates from training programmes vary across programmes and locations.  On mainline programmes, such as specific employable skills, the adult placement rate, upon completion <Col N="2129" /> of the course, varied between 65% and 70% over the period in question.  Other programmes, such as community training and travellers' workshops, contain a high social content and there is, accordingly, a lower placement rate.  Data on job placements are not disaggregated by full-time and part-time employment.</P>
    <P>Placement rates, however, are not always the most appropriate measure of training courses' effectiveness.  For example, they are influenced by the educational standards of the participants. Programmes, therefore, whose participants have high educational standards would be expected to achieve higher placement rates than programmes with less qualified participants such as Youthreach.</P>

      <P>An application has been received from the Tallaght Senior Citizens Club, Tallaght, Dublin 24, for assistance from the health allocation of the national lottery proceeds.  Indeed, I have received a very considerable number of requests for assistance from the national lottery proceeds available for health projects. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it has been possible to accede to only a relatively small number of these requests due to the limited funds available.  This year's health allocation has now been distributed or committed in full.  Consequently I am afraid I am not in a position to make funds available for the Tallaght Senior Citizens Club in the current year.</P>

      <P>My Department has had a number of discussions with Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Faculty of Anaesthetists concerning this matter.  Comhairle is the body with statutory responsibility for the regulation of the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs.  Comhairle has examined this problem in some detail and has made considerable efforts to restructure consultant anaesthetist posts in smaller units in order to make them more viable and attractive to prospective candidates.  The matter is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>The provisions of appropriate psychiatric facilities in County Meath, is primarily a matter for the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>At present services for the County Meath area are provided from St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth. These were formerly provided from St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar.

Following a proposal from the association a scientific sub-committee held a discussion thereon and arrangements were made in July within my Department and within the Central Statistics Office so that certificates relating to all infant deaths occurring during the first and second year of life would be released to that committee subject to strict conditions of confidentiality.  These agreed arrangements will enable the register to be established under the auspices of the association's scientific committee without delay.</P>

      <P>My Department has approved in principle the replacement of the existing national school building at Tooreen, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, by a new building, but the preparation of plans has not proceeded beyond the sketch scheme stage.  Because of the continuing pressure on the capital available to my Department for its national schools building programme, it is unlikely that sufficient priority can be given to this project in 1989 for the preparation of detail drawings, or that it will be possible to authorise the invitation of tenders.</P>

      <P>My Department has approved in principle the grant-aiding of a new national school for Clifden, County Galway, but, because of the pressure on the capital available for its national schools building programme, has been unable to proceed with the invitation of tenders for work along the lines planned. The question of providing in 1989 an allocation of capital whereby essential classroom accommodation can be provided to replace such of the present accommodation as is substandard is at present being considered, and the school authorities will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that St. Michael's parish youth project has applied for a grant from national lottery funds for an alternative education and training project (details supplied); whether a grant will be payable; if so, the amount of the grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the application made by St. Michael's parish youth project for an alternative education and training project.  The position is that all applications for assistance from the special fund of £4 million for disadvantaged youth, established in my Department from the proceeds of the national lottery, were considered by an interdepartmental committee on disadvantaged youth.  This committee drew up a programme of support from the very many individual applications received, the value of which far exceeded the amount available for grant-aid.  It was simply not possible to assist all the proposals submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Michael's parish youth project was one of the applications in respect of which it was not possible to allocate a grant this year.  However, this group has recently been informed that it may now submit <Col N="2163" /> (through Comhairle le Leas Óige) an update of its proposal for consideration in the context of whatever funds may be made available in 1989 for disadvantaged youth projects.  The project will also have to be considered in the context of the recently launched joint Departments of Education and Labour initiative for early school leavers.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that St. Michael's parish youth project already received a grant of some £40,000 in 1988 from my Department from the proceeds of the national lottery.  This grant is administered through Comhairle le Leas Óige.</P>
