    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill, the purpose of which is to abolish the ancient action for restitution of conjugal rights.  That action is available at common law to a spouse who has been deserted by the other spouse, in order to enforce the matrimonial duty to cohabit.  Jurisdiction to hear petitions is vested in the High Court. Failure to comply with the order of the court renders the offender liable to committal for contempt.  The action has fallen into disuse in this country and, in a report published in 1983, the Law Reform Commission recommended that it be abolished.</P>
      <P>It appears that the action, when it was being used, was seldom taken with a view to the enforcement of the decree sought, or even in the hope that the proceedings themselves would bring about a change of attitude by the spouse against whom they were directed.  Usually it was applied for as a means of establishing desertion in order, for instance, to assist or resist, as the case might be, an application for maintenance.  In other words, the action was little more than a legal ploy.  In a 1922 Irish case, the judge is recorded as saying that such decrees were sought in the expectation that they would not be obeyed, so as to lay the foundation for other proceedings.  He said that penalties for failure to comply with an order were rarely if ever sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> As far as maintenance is concerned, there is no longer any need for a spouse to prove desertion on the part of the other spouse in order to obtain a maintenance order; the 1976 maintenance legislation saw to that.  In my view, there is no other possible justification either for continuing to have this remedy available.  The very notion that a court should order, or even be asked to order, that a person should live with his or her spouse against that person's will is one that I feel is an affront to present day concepts of personal liberty. This action is clearly an anachronism.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the action is widely perceived as being particularly offensive to women, and as representing a continuation of the concept of the wife as chattel.  It is interesting &mdash; and indeed ironic &mdash; to note, however, that the limited statistics available indicate that this action was taken by wives and husbands in more or less equal measures.</P>
    <P>This short Bill represents a further measure of progress in the development of this society's attitude towards relationships between spouses.  The Oireachtas has in the last few years made considerable progress in the area of family law reform.  We have enacted such significant measures as the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, and the Status of Children Act, 1987.  Each of these statutes has, in its own way, contributed towards a change in the climate of Irish law in its treatment of relationships between men and women.  These changes reflect the evolution of our society, which now places more emphasis on respect for individual rights, and the equality of those rights, as between the sexes.</P>
    <P>These statutes are measures in which the Oireachtas as a whole can take pride. They were all given support from every side of this House, and indeed some of them, although originating with one party, were brought to fruition under the aegis of another.  This consensus approach to the reform of the law in this important area is one which I welcome, <Col N="955" /> and I am confident that this House will take that approach to the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to proceed with this rather simple matter to abolish proceedings for the restitution of conjugal rights.  All parties, and I would expect all Members of the House to agree that this is a pretty straightforward Bill which will not give rise to any serious argument or matters of serious contention.  The remedy under the old common law action for restitution of conjugal rights has not been used for quite some time and must now be regarded as being obsolete in the extreme.</P>
      <P>On 7 November 1983 the president of the Law Reform Commission, the Honourable Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, published Law Reform Commission Report No. 6, which advocated change maintaining that it was hardly relevant to have a law on the Statute Book compelling two people to live together if they are not on good terms.  The Law Reform Commission weighed up the pros and cons and the report is there for all to see. I do not intend going into the contents of that report in detail, but I believe the ideal of bringing a married couple who are experiencing difficulty in their marriage before a court and requesting a court decree that they live together, must surely have had a result of advocating the existence and fostering of unhappy marriages.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat ludicrous by today's standards to reflect on sections 1 and 3 of the Ecclesiastical Courts Act, 1813, which stated that where a spouse failed to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights he or she may be committed to prison for a period not exceeding six months.</P>
      <P>By enacting the Family Law Bill, 1987, we are following the abolition of similar actions in other jurisdictions.  It was submitted in 1969 in the English Law Commission Working Paper on the subject that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> It is intolerable interference with the freedom of individuals for the court to order adults to live together and it is hardly an appropriate method of attempting to effect a reconciliation.</P>
    <P>That commission concluded that the law was being brought into disrepute by the existence of such an action for the restitution of conjugal rights.  The Irish Law Commission in their wisdom decided similarly that it is inappropriate and ineffective in the latter part of the 20th century to have such a law on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>A point underlying the difficulties inherent in such an action as it presently stands was touched on by the Law Reform Commission in so far as there was a feeling that there may have been an infringement of rights of the citizen under Bunreacht na h…ireann.  These rights included the liberty of the person, freedom of association, the right to travel and earn a livelihood and the right to privacy.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report, however, goes one step further than the Minister is going now, and I quote from that report:</P>
    <P>We consider that more support for reconciliation procedures should be made available by the State through financial subsidy of existing marriage guidance and conciliation agencies, as well as through the creation of new conciliation services, by way of pilot projects if necessary.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there has been very little in terms of progress in this area since the publication of the report in 1983 and I would again urge the Minister and the Government to act in a positive manner on the question of mediation and support services available to people who are in difficulty in their married lives.  We must have a system wherein there is a support structure available to deal with existing problems in society.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of State institutions not having a compassionate attitude towards people who may be in difficulties with their marriages.  Not long <Col N="957" /> ago, in my own constituency, unhappy differences arose between a couple and the wife sought &mdash; and was granted &mdash; an order for maintenance in the District Court notwithstanding the fact that she did not seek to have her husband barred from the family home.  In December 1987 she was granted the sum of £20 per week out of her husband's salary to look after her eight children.  In May of this year, not having paid one penny in maintenance, the wife discovered that the husband had emigrated to Britain.  An application for deserted wife's benefit was made, but three months later, the unfortunate spouse in question received a fancy worded circular from the Department of Social Welfare which I understand is policy in such cases, saying that her application would not be further considered until she was able to produce a report on the whereabouts of her husband and to give reasons for not getting maintenance from him even though he had left the jurisdiction and had refused an order of the court to pay maintenance some six months previously.  That is one of thousands of examples throughout the country at present showing the heartless attitude of State institutions when it comes to dealing with matters of a family law nature.</P>
    <P>It is timely, when dealing with the abolition of actions as outlined in the Bill, to advocate a structure of mediation services designed to allow the parties to resolve their difficulties, where possible, by themselves.  This can be a very slow and traumatic process and I draw the attention of the House to a recommendation of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown that consideration be given to three basic means by which mediation can be offered &mdash; an independent mediation service, mediation through court welfare systems and mediation by a judge or somebody in a quasi-judicial capacity.  Having considered these three possible structures, the committee formed the view that an independent mediation service was by far the most attractive.  Obviously &mdash; I am sure the Minister will agree &mdash; the question of finance is paramount and I would <Col N="958" /> be the first to accept that the setting up of such a mediation scheme could prove an expensive undertaking.  However, we must look at the fact that there may be considerable and significant savings in the legal aid area brought about by the resultant fact that there would be fewer court applications if we had the proper mediation services and structures available.</P>
    <P>We should give careful consideration to early reorganisation of the family court structure.  I have spoken on this several times in the past, having had firsthand knowledge in District Court family law proceedings throughout rural areas.  We should address the present objectionable scenario at the earliest opportunity.  We are dealing daily with family law cases which are held on the same day and at the same time as criminal matters, road traffic cases, civil suits and debt collection proceedings.  By having these cases under an umbrella of formality in the District Court we are losing sight of the primary aim when dealing with marital problems, which should be one of offering assistance to the parties to reach a resolution of their difficulties, if possible by agreement.  The approach of a court in the family law area must, at all times, aim to minimise the damaging effects of such court proceedings on the husband, the wife and, more importantly, on the children.</P>
    <P>I know it is not in the Minister's area but the Department of Justice should consider taking responsibility for courthouses throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Courthouses dealing with family law cases have inadequate consultation rooms, inadequate rooms for hearing cases and inadequate toilet facilities, which all add to the adversarial nature of a family law case.  The ultimate insensitivity towards the couple can be seen by the fact that outside many family law courtrooms both the applicants and the respondents have to stand side by side, literally within feet of one another, with their legal advisers, twiddling their respective thumbs and waiting to be brought before a judge.  There should be a consultation room where parties could perhaps have a cigarette in <Col N="959" /> privacy prior to the hearing of this most traumatic matter.</P>
    <P>The family law court structure must be segregated from other courts.  Family courts should sit at different locations throughout the country hearing family matters.  Court hearings must be far less formal than at present.  Indeed, some district justices have provided an informal court system, off the Bench, where the parties have an opportunity of relaxing without recourse to the legal jargon of a public court.  District Court and Circuit Court judges should adopt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I must point out that this is a rather short and restrictive Bill, the subject matter of which is the restitution of conjugal rights.  I ask the Deputy not to stray too far from that subject.  We cannot allow a widening of the debate into the whole realm of family law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  While dealing with the abolition of the restitution of conjugal rights, I am also dealing with matters which are pertinent to those rights and which we do not have an opportunity of addressing in the House at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is welcomed by Fine Gael but it goes a very short way down the road towards solving the many difficulties in family law matters.  The Bill should pass all Stages quickly as there are no amendments from this side of the House and I do not believe that other parties have significant amendments.  We must then move on to more important areas of family law.  The recent decision of Mr. Justice Barr should be welcomed; it is now under appeal to the Supreme Court and I eagerly await the result.  I hope we will have a further opportunity of discussing the entire family law court structure and the many problems existing in that area.  While I welcome this legislation, it does little to solve the many traumatic and difficult problems facing <Col N="960" /> the family as we approach the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the measure proposed in the Bill but I do not approve of the Bill.  It is an anachronism to have a Bill containing one very small provision brought before the House and using up the time which could be more constructively used.  This provision could have been brought in with the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill which is at Report Stage.  I cannot understand why this provision should not be incorporated into that Bill and debated alongside it.  Perhaps it is simply my suspicious mind but I wonder at the reason for that.  Perhaps it has to do with the reluctance of the Minister and the Government to allow the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill an easy passage or a passage that will be reasonably speedy.  I know we are due to debate Report Stage of that Bill next week, with the agreement of the Whips. It is unfortunate that we have to come in here this week and debate a Bill which we all seem to be agreed on.  It seems there is no necessity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I whole heartedly agree that the 1983 report of the Law Reform Commission should have been implemented before now.  The action for restitution of conjugal rights is quite at odds with reality today.  It has been unused in the last 20 years.  As the Minister has rightly said, in the many years it was availed of it was used for purposes other than the apparent one for which it was provided.  I see from the Law Reform Commission report that in the English report on this law before it was abolished in 1970 there were some statistics about the numbers of petitions that had been filed in the years 1965-67. It is quite interesting to see that the number of petitions was 105, from 60 husbands and 45 wives.  Out of that number only 31 decrees were granted.  Of the 60 husbands who had applied only 11 were granted decrees and of the 45 wives, 20 were granted decrees.  It seems that re-enforces the case that very often the wife used this legal means in order to <Col N="961" /> enforce maintenance, to require her husband to take proper care of herself and her family or as a prelude to applying for a separation order or, in the case of Britain, for a divorce.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this law was abolished in England in 1970.  My constituency colleague, Deputy John Kelly, very often refers in this House to the fact that we take England's left overs about 15 years later.  He is about three years out in this case because it has taken us 18 years to realise that we do not need this remedy either.  As the Minister has said, there has been some development in family law.  Nowadays other remedies are available to spouses who have difficulties in their marriages, whether they relate to maintenance, barring orders, protection orders or even separation.  There is simply no reasonable way one can force a spouse to return to the petitioning spouse's home in order to restore harmony in that marriage.  It is a misnomer to look at the restitution of conjugal rights in that light.  Even the history of the action proves that that was not the object of it in the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>A very interesting point is that it is an action that was treated in the same way as contempt of court.  If the order was granted and one did not comply with it the penalties were the same as those for contempt of court.  I would ask what good would it do to a marriage if the respondent chose to go to prison as opposed to going home to his or her spouse.  That would only re-enforce the damage that the marriage had already suffered.  Even the penalties imposed for this action were quite at odds with the institution that was being dealt with, that of marriage.</P>
    <P>In the last 15 or 20 years we have moved forward in Ireland in our thinking about marriage and what constitutes marriage. It is seen not simply as a contract relating to property but as incorporating a relationship between two people.  That has to be recognised.  This action is quite at odds with such a reading of this institution. Nevertheless, even though the Minister congratulates the Oireachtas on all the good work it has done, the basic work of placing on the Statute Book the <Col N="962" /> proper means of obtaining separation orders has still not been done.  The corner-stone of dealing with marriages that have broken down is still absent from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>It is quite disgraceful that we have left so many people in Ireland without the legal remedies they deserve.  Thousands of people in Ireland find themselves in a legal limbo &mdash; I know that is something of a catch phrase.  Those thousands of men and women are separated, cannot reach agreement with their spouses on the basis of separating amicably and simply cannot afford to go to court. Therefore the legal limbo in which they find themselves spreads beyond that relationship.  It extends to the relationships that they set up with other partners. There are a maze of relationships in Ireland that are not catered for by the law and that are going to create more and more problems over the years in relation to probate and succession rights generally. It behoves this House to stop congratulating itself on the good work it has done and get down to doing the work that is absolutely necessary in order to give a cornerstone to family law.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of family law in this country, as Deputy Flanagan has just said, is the lack of facilities and the way family law is looked on as the poor relation, almost, of the legal system, whether it be in relation to this remedy that we are abolishing today or whether it be in relation to maintenance or barring orders.  The distinct impression given to any person who goes to court on any of these matters is that the system does not care for them.  It regards family law as being on the same level as criminal law, property law or probate.  That is not the case.  We should not just have family courts but family tribunals.  We should call them something different because otherwise the public will feel that they are the same as the other courts.  They should be taken out of the adversarial system.  There should be proper professional help such as mediation and conciliation, available to those who are experiencing difficulties so that they can avoid going to court.</P>

      <P>I must again remind the House as to the purpose of this Bill which is to abolish the old action for the restitution of conjugal rights.  As and from the enactment of the Bill it will be impossible to institute proceedings for the restitution of conjugal rights.  That is the main substance of this short Bill.  I am concerned that there would be a widening of the debate into the whole area of family law.  It simply is not appropriate on this measure and I am sure Deputies will keep that very much in mind.  I am allowing some latitude but we must not stray too far from the purpose of this Bill and its subject matter.  It is confined.</P>

      <P>You can rest assured my remarks are drawing to a close.  I reiterate that part of the family law problems we suffer from emanate from the way they are portrayed within the court system.  I believe we are on the point of restoring some of the respect we should have for family law if in the near future we pass the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill.  At present family law is in shambles despite some moves that have been made on the periphery, and I regard this Bill before us today as one of those, but it is simply tinkering with some of the real problems.  I impress on the Minister the need to examine seriously the question of the difficulties facing thousands of people, difficulties that are going to be magnified in the next 15 or 20 years unless legal and realistic remedies are laid down properly.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to assure the House that I am not tabling amendments to this Bill and that we will be agreeing to its passing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I wish to indicate briefly that we support the proposal before the D·il today to abolish action for restitution of conjugal rights.  However, a number of points must be raised in respect of this Bill.  The first is to deal with the suggestion that this is &ldquo;by the way&rdquo; legislation, that we are just tidying up and getting out of the way an action <Col N="964" /> that really has no relevance to modern conditions.  I think something is being lost here.  The action is an action that compels one spouse to live with the other so long as a valid marriage subsists.  In the context of our law where it is still legally right and possible for the male to rape the woman in marriage this action has a degree of sinister proportion to it. Because of its existence a husband aggrieved could have insisted or sought to get the courts' and our laws assistance in forcing a woman to live at home.  In turn then, because of the antiquated nature of our law in the area of rape, forced sexual acts could be imposed on her and nothing in law could be done to prevent that.  This Bill certainly has a sinister context in current matrimonial law and it is only right and proper that such action be abolished forthwith this morning.</P>
      <P>The unforgiveable thing in all this is the delay that has surrounded the introduction of this legislation.  Under the action I have mentioned the law requires a spouse to cohabit and it follows that there is an entitlement to apply to court to commit the defaulting spouse to prison for failing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth looking at the history of the legislation elsewhere.  In 1884 under the Matrimonial Causes Act in Britain they managed to abolish the right of commital there and it is interesting to read and consider the parliamentary debates of the day as to why that legislation was not extended to cover this jurisdiction by a legislature that had responsibility for both jurisdictions at the time.  It is interesting to realise the role that even then the Catholic Church and Church interests sought to impose on debate and ensure there would be no interference with their ecclesiastical control of the development of marriage law in this country so far back.  That is the main, indeed, the single reason the parliament of Westminster of the day did not extend the legislation even in that small way.  I think that helps us to understand why it has taken us so long to bring forward this legislation.  The report was published in 1983.  It is well worth asking the previous Government <Col N="965" /> in particular, with their constitutionally crusading commitments, how they ignored the report of the Law Reform Commission in 1983 and why it was only in July of 1987 that this two line piece of legislation could find its way onto the table of the Oireachtas business.  All of this was fully examined and ventilated in the very comprehensive report of the English Law Commission under the title <i>Family Law: Restitution of Conjugal Rights</i> as unequivocally they called for the abolition of the action, and that was done within the following year, 1970, under the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act.  The point made by Deputy Colley is reflected even in the title of that legislation because they linked the abolition of these proceedings to other areas of law particularly with regard to matrimonial property and updating of the law there.  At that stage in Britain, even though some actions were being taken, it was clear that the action was being used as a lever in wider actions relating to maintenance, alimony and other property issues.  Therefore, we have nothing to congratulate ourselves on today.  Perhaps we should take a bow and solidly kick one another in the backside as we do it.  There is nothing to be applauded in the fact that we find ourselves here this morning so long afterwards in the context of such potentially pernicious laws, moving to take them off the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;The Oireachtas has in the last few years made considerable progress in the area of family law reform.&rdquo;  He instanced in the course of his speech three separate pieces of legislation.  One recognises foreign divorces, or more particularly, got rid of an equally antiquated and ridiculous legal principle, that of the domicile of dependency. The wife's domicile was dictated by that of the husband irrespective of where he lived.  What an achievement.  In 1986 we managed to confront and dispose of a fuedal concept.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act dealt, for the first time, with the ridiculous inequality that existed where if a foreign national married an Irish woman she had no rights <Col N="966" /> accruing whereas if a foreign woman married a male citizen she was automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.  That has been addressed in part, very unsatisfactorily, and in any event the whole area of nationality and citizenship entitlement is a morass of greyness that does no credit to the legislators or to the Minister in the House today.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Status of Children Act, 1987 under which we managed to address the thorny question of calling children born outside wedlock illegitimate.  This is the litany the Minister presents to us as making considerable progress.  We managed, in three small ways, to drag oursleves out of the feudal ages with regard to matrimonial law and address what was screaming out to this Oireachtas for decades on end for reform.  We did it, but is it not too little too late?</P>
    <P>It is in the context of progress in the area of family law that I come to the disgraceful behaviour of Fianna F·il in the deliberations with regard to the judicial separation legislation that has been so begrudgingly and tortuously dealt with over the last number of months in special committee and which will be dealt with on Report Stage here in the very near future.</P>

Why was that not added as another section in this massive legislation on family law reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone a little beyond himself in heralding this legislation as a significant advance.  It is certainly welcome but it is a very small gesture much too late.  It does not tell the full story when one considers the role of Fianna F·il in family law over the last number of years.  They are the party that succeeded in ensuring that we do not have divorce <Col N="968" /> and who, when we came to deal with the absence of that right, obstructed the progress of the current judicial legislation before the House.</P>

      <P>The passing of this Bill through the Oireachtas is the closing of one more chapter in the long fight for equality of the sexes.  Although the Bill is short and I cannot see any opposition so far to its introduction from Opposition Members, I feel it is worth while to comment and reflect on its passing.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the fact that a great number of marriages here simply do not work.  We have all come across sad situations among our relations and friends and seen the pain and anguish they suffer when, for one reason or another, their marriage disintegrates.  In this day and age people are quite open about marriage break-up, but in the last generation people felt it was something to be ashamed of.  So, in many instances they covered up the fact that their marriage was in trouble, resulting in miserable situations without love or suitability and, in many cases, violence and storminess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of Irish society to separated people led to this.  Women especially were looked upon as social pariahs and their standing in society diminished. This is still true to a certain extent today.  Separated or deserted women were simply not wanted at any social gathering, even family affairs.  The fact that they had not got their man or provider around seemed to make them a forgotten species.  After all, a woman was perceived in law as a man's chattel, part of his property, unable to provide for or defend herself.  This is an attitude which <Col N="969" /> has not altogether disappeared.  It can still be found here and there.</P>
    <P>Under the current legislation, which this Bill will abolish, a partner in marriage can apply to the courts for restitution of conjugal rights and the court can grant it.  This means the court could allow a husband to force his wife to have sexual intercourse with him against her will, even though they may have been estranged from each other for some time. In other words, the court condoned the rape of this woman by her husband and if he did not achieve what he wanted, then she would forfeit her right to financial maintenance from him or succession to his property.  This was another way in which a woman was expected to prostitute herself in order to gain financial support.  No wonder the practice of applying for restitution of conjugal rights has disappeared.  In this day and age there would be much hue and cry if such an application were made in the court, and rightly so.  Imagine the lack of understanding on the part of legislators and the Judiciary to allow such a law to be passed and acted upon.  What a terrible act of dominance our predecessors allowed one person to carry out on another, and worse still if they thought that such an act could bring about a reconciliation and patch up a marriage which had already floundered: true reconciliation can only be brought about by genuine effort on the part of both partners.</P>
    <P>I understand that sometimes women made application for restitution of conjugal rights, but I feel that the Bill was put into law in order to accommodate men. This further depicts the manner in which women were regarded both by their husbands and by the law of the land.  They had no right of choice or independence. They were as much a part of the property of the husband as the land, the home, the bank account or the cattle.  Indeed the cattle might have been treated better and with more respect.</P>
    <P>Society is slow in addressing these wrongs against women and these attitudes can still be found in Ireland.  Large institutions in particular are steeped in <Col N="970" /> these attitudes &mdash; banks, financial institutions, employers etc.  No matter how hard women try to succeed or how much they have to offer, the odds are always piled high against them.</P>
    <P>The Church at the moment are providing a great service to married people whose marriages are in trouble, by way of counselling, and there are many successes as a result; but there is a role for the State to play in providing similar and complementary services.  We have a very sympathetic and progressive Minister here, no matter what has been said here today.  The passing into law of this Bill is an indication that the attitudes that I have talked about here today are also passing and will be finally laid to rest.  I look forward to more good news from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity of allowing Deputy Mooney to speak before me.  She has, in her short speech, put into words the experience and the treatment of women and how it was endorsed by a male law. It is important to remember that changing the legislation is the first step to changing attitudes.  We will not change attitudes towards women until our legislation forces people to become aware and removes the discriminations and prejudices that exist.</P>
      <P>I am pleased Deputy McCartan is in the Chamber because I should like to refer to his speech.  He was pleased that at long last we were removing some of the most discriminatory and unjust aspects of the legislation as it relates to women but I should like to point out to him that it was not just a happy coincidence that we got the legal reforms.  Changes in the laws relating to women and children came about following extensive lobbying by women and the women's movement. That should be recognised.  Until women organised themselves to reject discriminations and put pressure on the legislators to remove them there had not been any attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the passage of the Bill which represents a small step forward in the area of family law reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> Support services must be part and parcel of the legislation so as to ensure that the provisions of the Bill will be implemented.  I should like to congratulate the Law Reform Commission on the work they have done over the years.  It is lamentable that the reforms suggested by that group in 1970 are being introduced in 1988.  Legislation in that area is so outdated that it merits the description of being mediaeval.  It is unfortunate that more changes have not been made particularly in view of the fact that they would not be opposed in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the action for restitution of conjugal rights usually was applied for as a means of establishing desertion in order, for instance, to assist or resist, as the case might be, an application for maintenance.  Many ploys were used in regard to maintenance, including the use of discriminatory legislation.  That highlights the need to look at the difficulties women experience when applying for maintenance.  Women and their children run the risk of not obtaining maintenance and may be left in dire circumstances. In a report on social welfare the Joint Committee on Women's Rights some years ago recommended that once a deserted wife established her need for maintenance the State should pursue the husband for maintenance.  That report recommended that it should not be left to the deserted spouse, who would have enough problems to cope with, to track down a husband who deserted her.  The Bill before us is about humanising our law and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome any legislation that deals with the question of individual rights, human rights within marriage and other legal contracts.  As legislators we should look at the unnecessary, humiliating and delaying tactics that deserted spouses are put through when attempting to get maintenance. The fact that such ploys are used is an indication of what remains to be done in that area.  The Minister was correct when he said that the old legislation was particularly offensive to women because it continued the concept of the <Col N="972" /> wife as chattel.  It took many years of lobbying to remove another extraordinary and unacceptable piece of legislation from the Statute Book, the tort of criminal conversation.  Up to 1981 a husband could sue another man for enticing his wife away and obtain compensation for the loss of her services, including her sexual services.  That was a particularly humiliating provision and women were surprised that it took so long to remove it from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Minister's presence gives us the opportunity to stress the urgency of bringing forward legislation dealing with rape.  As other Members pointed out, the restitution of conjugal rights could lead to forced sexual abuse of a wife.  Until legislation in the area of rape is reformed wives will run the risk of being raped with impunity by a husband.  Deputy McCartan stated that as long as the old provision remained on the Statute Book that could happen but I am sure, and other Members are aware, that even in a case of separation, because the State recognises the woman as the wife of the husband that separated husband can use that violence against his wife.  Those who work at the Rape Crisis Centre and Women's Aid have told me that a separated husband can use that violence against his wife without the fear of prosecution.  If he beats her up he can be prosecuted but if he rapes her he cannot.  All fair-minded people will reject that type of horrid and heinous violence against women.  We must ensure that that law is reformed. On the Order of Business this morning we were told that amending legislation would be introduced in the next session but, because of the amount of violence perpetrated against women within marriage and against those who are separated, I urge the Minister to put that item at the top of the agenda for the next session.</P>
    <P>I wait with great impatience the introduction of the Bill dealing with the property of married couples.  I hope it will deal with the protection of the spouse in the home.  I am referring to the property of couples who are not separated.  If we support the institution of marriage we <Col N="973" /> must not leave those who elect to stay married in a vulnerable position in regard to judgment mortgages and debt collection. The possessions of a wife may be taken by a sheriff enforcing a court judgment and we should deal with that as a matter of urgency.  The Minister concluded his speech by saying:</P>
    <P>This consensus approach to the reform of the law in this important area is one which I welcome, and I am confident that this House will take that approach to the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and to Fianna F·il, to extend that consensus approach to the legislation that is listed for debate next week, that dealing with judicial separation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid you did, in fact I am certain you did but the record will show.  Deputy Flanagan, during the course of the contribution, referred to the role of the family mediation services in dealing with the aftermath of marriage breakdown.  Such a service is operating on a pilot basis in Dublin, funded through my Department.  It commenced in June 1986 and will operate for a three year period.  The steering committee who oversee the running of the scheme are to report to me in due course of the operation of the pilot scheme.  I will take the comments of Deputy Flanagan into account when estimating that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> Deputy Flanagan, and others, too, spoke about the need to improve the setting for family law cases.  I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions that it is clear that any developed system of family courts or tribunals could be very costly in terms of buildings and staff and that, therefore, it is out of the question in the present financial circumstances.  The best that can be hoped for is minimal provision to bring about more informality in family law procedures, I have welcomed the provisions on those lines and on counselling and mediation in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987, which is at present before the House.</P>
    <P>The question of the institution of family courts has not been considered in any great depth.  The Law Reform Commission have yet to make any detailed proposals on family type structures but their president has indicated that they intend to take up this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also raised a point about the entitlement of a deserted wife to benefit where her husband had emigrated. I will certainly convey the Deputy's viewpoint to my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In relation to courthouses generally &mdash; and I know this is outside the scope of the Bill, as the Ceann Comhairle reminded us when Deputy Flanagan was making this point &mdash; of course none of us can be happy with the conditions of the courthouses.  This is a major problem throughout the length and breadth of the country and I do not think anybody denies that fact.  In some instances but in very few, major improvements have been carried out at great cost.  The matter is one of concern to all of us in this House, not just to the Government, but to anyone who knows anything about this area.  I am trying to find ways and means of coming to grips with the problems.  If I had unlimited amounts of money I would be in a position to try to get some scheme up and running straightaway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Col N="975" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  This is a personal opinion.  It is probably politically unwise to give a personal opinion but I am giving it because I believe it to be true.  We could do with far fewer courthouses; a major rationalisation of courthouse locations is long overdue.  If I succeed in putting together proposals in this area I will test the House for its sincerity in backing me to get those proposals through even though we may have protest groups coming to Leinster House from different communities hoping that I will change my mind when something they regard as a status symbol in their community is being taken from them. Even in my own county I would like to see the number of courthouses reduced by half and then whatever moneys are there being spent on the courthouses that would be best located to service the needs of the community.  This is something we must look at very seriously.  In fact, I am involved in that question and am nearing the end of my examination of it.  I would like to think that people would accept the fact that when courthouses were located in the earlier days we did not have a great deal by way of communications, that we did not have transport on anything like today's scale.  To travel five or six miles to a courthouse then was a major effort but that is no longer the case.  I will be looking for consensus on this effort but I expect not to have an easy task.</P>

    <P>When the rationalisation of schools and of post offices &mdash; for which I had responsibility many years ago &mdash; was discussed I remember only too well the experiences I had at that particular time when I turned up certain little stones and found that people who had told me that they agreed in principle with what I was doing, but were the first to give me a tap on the ankle and throw me aside when it came to specifics.  In this day and age we must get value for money if we are to provide the facilities which are urgently required.  I should like to think that, if I am in a court and want to consult with my legal adviser at least I am entitled to privacy.  If during the course of a long session, I needed bathroom or toilet <Col N="976" /> facilities I should like to think they would be available.  Often women, especially pregnant women, and children need privacy but not even the basics are available. This is a problem we must tackle from every angle.  A sum of £1 million or £2 million could be spent doing up a courthouse in Tralee or Waterford where large sums have been spent but that would provide only for a few.  This is a problem we are tackling.  Deputy Flanagan asked whether this area should be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Justice.  I do not want that responsibility.  I can help in redefining the geographical location of the courts as that is my responsibility and I can help the Minister for the Environment in making the case for funding through local authorities or whatever other way it can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley objected to the limited nature of the Bill and suggested it should be included in another measure.  I fail to see her difficulty because this is not a contentious measure.  She suggested incorrectly &mdash; and this is where her suspicious mind was working overtime unnecessarily &mdash; that I could have it as part of the Judicial Separation Bill. Deputy Colley should know and I am sure she will accept that this Bill was on the Order Paper before the Private Members' Bill came onstream.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights is straightforward and not contentious and can be implemented in one section of a Bill.  In reply to a point made by Deputy McCartan the remaining recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report dealing with jactitation of marriage and related matters, raise complex issues and these are being examined in my Department along with other proposals in this area of family law. Rather than hold up this proposal until another, more suitable, legislative vehicle came before the House I decided to ask the Government for permission to introduce this Bill in its own right.  That is the only reason for it.  I could have sat back and done nothing about it, but I <Col N="977" /> would certainly deserve to have been taken to task in that event.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley raised many questions pertaining to family law reform generally and to the particular matters covered by the Private Members' Bill on judicial separation. Deputy McCartan raised political points about the Bill but I will leave that for another day when we will have plenty of opportunity to deal with those points.  I do not think the Deputy really wants that and I forgive him.  We will have ample opportunity next week in Government time and in Private Members' time to discuss these matters in the context of Report Stage of the other Bill so I will reserve my comments until then.</P>
    <P>There never has been a Bill where there were not basic differences on important issues.  There never has been and never should be hope or expectation that Bills would be given easy passage. They must be properly debated.  If we cannot have consensus &mdash; and as we would like to have on practically every legislative measure here &mdash; then we tease them out as carefully as we can, we try to amend and to convince the others that ours is better than theirs and they try to convince us that theirs is better than ours. At the end of day we go through the voting system.  There will not be any undue delay but there will have to be full discussion on issues where there are basic differences between different parties and different groups.  When these matters are finally debated, when it is decided in whatever way, that one votes T· and another NÌl so be it.</P>

      <P>Yes, and getting people to understand my way.  Deputies McCartan and Colley queried why it took so long to implement the legislation.  I should like to remind the House that the Law Reform Commission Report in question was produced during the term of office of the previous Government, in 1983.  I am not making any point about that; it was there from 1983 to 1987.  When I saw it in 1987 when I went into the Department of Justice, I felt it had been there long enough.  My reaction was: let us get it up front and do something about it; that is all; there is no other reason.  I understand the reasoning of my predecessors trying to get the whole thing together.  I can accept that.  I too had that choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was advice given to that effect &mdash; why not try and get the whole thing up &mdash; and there was no particular reason.  I am not here making any political point.  It was suggested by Deputy McCartan that this Government are lacking in commitment to progress in the family law area.  I want to say to him that I refute that suggestion.  The truth is that no one party in the House can claim an exclusive monopoly on progressive family law measures or indeed social concern generally.  That is generally accepted by the greater majority of members of most parties.  Our record in this area goes back as far as the Succession Act of 1965 that was prepared by the present Taoiseach as Minister for Justice.  That Act was hailed from the time of its passage as a revolutionary measure, and is still recognised internationally as a model of succession legislation.  Its provisions, protecting the interests of a surviving spouse and children, and the clarity and fairness of the intestacy provisions which diminish the danger of an estate being frittered away on legal costs, rightly, are something of which we in this House, as a whole, can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that, more recently &mdash; at the beginning of 1981 &mdash; at least four significant Acts affecting the <Col N="979" /> family unit were passed under a Fianna F·il Government.  For example, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act made significant improvements in the position of mothers in the workplace. The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act made the barring order remedy &mdash; so valuable in protecting the victims of family violence &mdash; more readily enforceable.  The Courts Act of that year &mdash; by reorganising the jurisdiction of the lower courts &mdash; made a wide range of family law remedies more accessible and affordable.  The Family Law Act, 1981, abolished anachronistic actions for criminal conversation, seduction and harbouring of a spouse and breach of promise of marriage.  Those are Acts with which I was intimately concerned.</P>
    <P>Coming to the very recent past I might remind Deputies of the Status of Children Act, 1987, whose provisions constituted a major advance across the full range of family law.  That Act was brought to fruition under this Government.  To the limit of the powers available to me I have ensured that the necessary subsidiary legislation is in place to facilitate the fullest operation of the provisions of that Act.  Deputies may contend that all I did <i>vis-·-vis</i> the Status of Children Act was take a Bill already prepared and introduced by the previous Administration and bring it to fruition with a few improvements here and there.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the nub of my argument, that no individual in the Oireachtas, no party in this House, has a monopoly on social concern.  It would be divisive and unhelpful to further progress in the important area of family law reform were such a claim given general credence.  I am happy to stand over the record of this administration, and of my party in office in the past, in the family law area.  I am sure other members of other parties would do likewise with regard to their terms of office, and good luck to them.  Progress generally in this area has been by way of genuine co-operation between Members of this House across party lines.  Our collective <Col N="980" /> commitment to finding the best possible solutions to family law problems must, where possible, be based on the consensus approach.</P>
    <P>On the question of restitution of conjugal rights and marital rape, I should say that, in recent weeks, there have been a number of press reports which have mistakenly drawn a connection between this Bill and the question of making sexual intercourse between a husband and wife, against her will, a criminal offence &mdash;&ldquo;marital rape&rdquo;, as it has been called.  Indeed Deputy McCartan and others saw a sinister connection between the two.  There is no such connection. The provisions of this Bill abolish an old civil action &mdash; which, as Deputy Barnes correctly said, has fallen into disuse &mdash; which entitles a deserted spouse to sue for restitution of conjugal rights.  A restitution of conjugal rights order can be complied with merely by the deserting spouse resuming cohabitation.  However, such an order cannot requre a spouse to resume sexual relations.  Neither this nor any other legal recourse can require a spouse to engage unwillingly in sexual intercourse with the other spouse.  The abolition of this action is not contrary to what some have suggested, a necessary preliminary to the criminalising of sexual intercourse by a husband with his wife against her will.  Even if this legislation were not passed it would still be possible to deal with the marital rape issue.  I should stress they are not related.</P>
    <P>The question of making marital rape an offence is one of which the Law Reform Commission made recommendations in a recent report.  A Bill arising out of that report &mdash; as the T·naiste said on the Order of Business this morning &mdash; will be published.  I want to say to Deputy Barnes that I am as anxious as is she and every other Member of this House to have this Bill before us and discussed thoroughly and properly as quickly as possible.  It is my intention to ensure that that will be the case.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The concern of this House and of the Government to have a proper business environment prevail here, with the necessary safeguards in place guaranteeing the interests of creditors, taxpayers, those of the Revenue Commissioners and all other persons involved in the affairs of companies, is most welcome.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the sensitive way in which he has introduced these proposals and on his overall quest for balance in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  However, I have some concern in relation to the anxiety expressed in the House to have on the Statute Book provisions which, on face value, appear to give relief and provide sanctions against the worst abuse in regard to the running of companies and the defrauding of creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can say in relation to the new provisions of the Bill &mdash; which come into force after a liquidation, after a long time spent in court and much resources having been spent on bringing fraudulent directors to heel, and there are many provisions of a criminal and civil nature &mdash; is that we must ascertain what was the practice and rate of success in relation to that type of activity that obtained under the provisions of the 1963 Act which, after all, constituted the state of the art until a few years ago.  One finds in those provisions that, in the practice of liquidations, ultimately the courts have not found it possible to impose criminal sanctions against the worst offenders.  There have been occasions when the courts, <Col N="982" /> during the course of liquidations or examinations of the affairs of directors of companies who have been guilty of fraudulent behaviour, have referred behaviourial instances and papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries and asked questions in certain quarters as to whether any prosecutions emanated from such referrals.  My information indicates that no great number of prosecutions has resulted from these referrals as it appears that in various ways the law itself does not have the resources to deal with that type of prosecution.  For example, it appears there are difficulties encountered in relation to proof.  The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions do not seem to have the resources or the expertise to proceed with these cases.  If we are serious about putting criminal sanctions in place in regard to fraudulent activities and insider dealing, then we will have to look at the question of how we go about proving an offence.  We are going to have to look at computer transactions, electronic transfers and the many complicated accounts, including those subject to the Official Secrets Act and those held in confidence by the Revenue Commissioners, before we consider including any criminal sanctions in this Bill.  The recent report of the Law Reform Commission on heresay evidence should be considered when we come to consider how various offences can be proved without the necessity of tracking down the persons who made the original entries on a computer.</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties which have resulted in a slowing down of the implementation of the existing legislation and they are the kind of difficulties which will slow down the application of criminal sanctions against directors when this welcome legislation is enacted.  In referring to possible difficulties in the prosecution of offenders and to the failure to bring offenders to justice, I do not want to give the impression that I want to join with those who seek to criminalise and stigmatise the business community and who fail to realise that we rely on the business <Col N="983" /> community for growth in the economy. The objective of any future amending legislation based on how this legislation has worked should be to avoid crises, the appointment of receivers and liquidators and court disputes as much as possible. We should look at the provisions contained in this legislation and in the Principal Act of 1963 to see where difficulties may arise for those involved in partnerships and for creditors.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on directors to disclose the affairs of a company.  We are not making a demand for disclosure but people should be able to find out what is contained on the register, and they should be able to find out who the directors are, what the extent of their shareholding is and how much capital is available to the company.  Therefore at a glance it would be possible for them to see who might be sued as a result of some wrongdoing.  I know of creditors and members of a company who have found it difficult to obtain basic information.  A company need to keep the register up to date and make the accounts of the company available to both directors with a minority shareholding and members of the company.  If this legislation were to be amended it should provide for the making of applications to examine the books of a company, as directors with minority shareholdings are entitled to do under the 1963 Act, in the Circuit Court without there being the necessity as is the case at present to make the application in the High Court.</P>
    <P>We also have to look at the question of how people are able to set up businesses and receive unsecured credit.  The profile of the classic phoenix company goes something like this: a person goes to the bank to inform them that they wish to buy a hotel or a pub of considerable value and set up a limited company.  The bank will then lend a considerable amount of money and have the loan secured with a mortgagor or a debenture which would give the bank first call on that major asset.  The company then start to trade, perhaps in a provincial town, with some creditworthiness.  The shelves <Col N="984" /> are stocked with goods which are very often subject to a retention of title clause and with the plant and equipment subject to a hire purchase agreement.  Anything moveable in the building will more than likely not be the property of the company. We will find that when the company begin trading the cash coming in will primarily be used to pay the most urgent bills with a steady slowing down of payment to the Revenue and suppliers until we reach the stage when the secured creditor, the bank, begins to feel the pinch and something happens.  Very often both the Revenue and the creditors do not move in time and the only people outside the company who know what is going on are the bank, a secured creditor.  Of course, the bank are happy to allow things to continue as they are and as a result both the Revenue and other creditors are denied their lawful payments.</P>
    <P>In cases where the Revenue and suppliers do move for a liquidation the banks will subsequently go through the same procedure all over again and allow the principals of a firm buy another major asset such as a hotel or a pub and go through the same procedure of securing that asset.  In some cases they will allow this to happen four or five times over a period of time.  It is not always a case of a company rising, falling and rising again, as very often one finds that some people will set up a series of these so-called phoenix companies with many people finding themselves caught as a result of supplying these companies.  Many people ask how on earth we allow this to happen but the problem is that the banks, innocently or otherwise, fund these companies. They rely solely on their very favoured position as secured creditors without assessing the reality of the business they are funding with their money and in doing so, they might be acting against the interests of their customers and potential customers.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to say anything which would stop the flow of credit to bona fide companies, in order to ensure regular and moderate control of the activities, of those who might become involved in phoenix-type operations I <Col N="985" /> believe that it might not be such a bad thing if the provisions of this Bill were widened to place the onus on a bank which provided secured credit to a company to ensure that on a yearly or six-monthly basis the private company submit accounts to the bank such as would indicate to the bank whether the company were trading recklessly.</P>
    <P>Further sanction should be provided in the legislation whereby a bank which acted negligently, having regard to the interests of the other creditors, be they the Revenue Commissioners or ordinary supplier creditors, would lose its benefit of preferential status.  Various speakers have already suggested that suppliers should be given preferential status above other existing preferential creditors such as the Revenue Commissioners and secured creditors but I do not think this is a reasonable proposal.  It is a very popular proposal but I do not think it is realistic. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the banks should somehow be made partners in reckless trading.  If circumstances arose where the banks should reasonably have had knowledge of the type of reckless trading that was going on, they should lose not their creditor status but their preferential status, or at least some proportion of that preferential status, because the court investigating the matter deemed it to be their fault.</P>
    <P>My thinking behind this suggestion is not that I wish to penalise the banks or start a witchhunt against them but I think the banks are in a position to have enormous influence on the general conduct of corporate affairs, especially on the affairs of small private companies which tend to get into difficulty, where reckless trading arises in the first instance through ignorance on the part of the principals of the company rather than any criminal intent to defraud anyone.  Very often a business person's first experience of a phoenix company happens by accident.  They allow their companies to slide into difficulties but by experiencing corporate difficulties very often they learn the skills of the classic phoenix merchant and they then set up companies to deliberately defraud creditors.  If the banks took a <Col N="986" /> more active interest in the affairs of companies in which they have secured credit they could possibly prevent inexperienced business people allowing their companies to get into a position where they would have to be liquidated and thereby cause suppliers in particular and others to be denied payment of what was owing to them.</P>
    <P>Consistent with this line of thinking, that a stitch in time saves nine, I suggest that we should now be looking at the need to educate potential directors and shareholders in small trading companies of the responsibilities that shareholding and directorship will carry.  There is nothing new in this suggestion in the present context because I can think of certain areas of activity which require training and have a prerequisite for skill before people are allowed into certain businesses.  One thinks of the requirements needed for a person to take out a transport plate.  One is required to have a transport manager who is suitably and professionally qualified or to have certain professional and academic skills acquired from doing a course in transport.  One thinks of the requirements of the construction section of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the qualifications of persons who take out C.2 certificates. Where one is allowing, under the law, a person to become a director of a company one has to realise that that person is becoming a trustee not only of shareholders' interests but also of the interests of the creditors, suppliers, the Revenue Commissioners and the employees who might be owed redundancy and wages.  If one has to appoint a trustee out of court in respect of a family settlement or as a legal representative of an estate, one has to provide evidence of character.  Very often in relation to the appointment of a person as a legal representative of the estate of a deceased person, bonds and other documents have to be provided for the secure administration of the estate, even in circumstances where the size of the estate would be minuscule when compared with the size of operation carried on by even a small company.  One must not be shy in putting forward suggestions <Col N="987" /> about the tests of eligibility one should undergo to become a director, or which would show the qualities and dependability of a trustee, without going overboard and without imposing a restriction on business.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Deenihan suggested that this legislation, the 1963 Act and amending Acts should be presented to the business community in palatable and readable form.  That is a good suggestion and is consistent with my idea that there should be a general preparation for business people who enter the corporate life and who undertake corporate responsibilities. They should have regard to the great onus on them to safeguard the interests of the many people who depend on the proper running of limited liability companies for which they have responsibility.</P>
    <P>Another area of corporate activity which never ceases to amaze me is how innocent people get caught.  This area relates to people who have had no previous experience of this type of business, who enter limited liability company partnerships. Very often people who have significant sums of capital will put their money into an enterprise through a limited liability company.  They will see an accountant once or twice when the company has been formed and they will be told they will get a certain number of shares and that they will be directors. However, these people are never advised to check out whether they are directors of the company, what shareholding they are entitled to and, if further shares are issued, what will happen to their shareholdings.</P>
    <P>Very often, directors and shareholders allow their partners to ride roughshod over them for years.  It is only when the company get into difficulties and it is suddenly realised that the dividends expected to accumulate within the company have vanished, or the shares expected to be owned are not formally attributed in the books of the company to those concerned, that the rush to the safety of a solicitor's office will take place, for things to be sorted out.  There <Col N="988" /> are many people in that position and for them it would be very necessary to have some basic grounding in the setting up and running of a company and being in a position to formally establish their right through the implementation of the basic tenets of company law.</P>
    <P>Many disputes which arise between the partners do so through simple ignorance, a lack of ability, or perhaps an unwillingness to come to terms with the need to formalise relationships from the outset. The same comment can be made with regard to unincorporated partnerships. Far too many business relationships set up in this country are not sufficiently formalised. We are far too willing to commit our affairs to a handshake, as happened to a quite notorious recent case in relation to a public company.  We will have to depart from that behaviour in our business culture.  One of the tasks of corporate legislation should be to ensure that this unfortunate national trait be discouraged as much as possible.  I would like to think that reasonable, bona fide business people would not be unduly prevented from setting up corporate businesses by any instruction procedure or tests of ability which would be set up by any further amendment of this legislation. Such testing procedure would be quite consistent with the provisions of the Bill, which require certain directors who have had a scrape with insolvency to provide sufficient capital in the event of their setting up a further company.  There are provisions which specify minimum capital requirements for companies set up under circumstances where there have previously been difficulties.  That type of provision is positive and welcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to provisions in the legislation for the appointment of an examiner, if the Bill is to be recognised by any chief characteristic, that would be the one picked out by the general public. Very often in liquidations one finds that the whole thing happens so quickly that the entire charisma, character and goodwill of a business can vanish overnight, very often not to be replaced, just because there was no halfway house between trading and liquidation.  I have <Col N="989" /> great hopes for the future of companies which will experience the procedure of the appointment of the examiner and be rescued by gradual adjustment, whether it be increased capitalisation or an arrangement between all the creditors, or whatever.  The setting up of a business, of contacts and of management structure to deal with the production of any item and its marketing is now much too complicated for us here to say that the savage procedure of liquidation is to apply mechanically in the event of these companies becoming insolvent.  It is very important to state this fact, having regard to our sad history of businesses being grossly under-capitalised. The use of the examiner, in general will be to ensure that under-capitalised companies will have more capital and will be held aloft by the examiner from collapse until enough interested people, enough investors in the economy, can say that it is a good business, that there are plenty of orders, that there is a good staff of workers and good management, that is has been under-capitalised from the very start, possibly because of starting off in a small way, and that this company will be given a second chance without scattering their goodwill, abilities and undoubted business acumen to the four winds.</P>
    <P>A feature of the last ten years throughout the depression has been the saddening spectacle of company after company going into the High Court on liquidation.  The procedure for liquidations which one reads in the Companies Acts and the regulations made thereunder and the procedure of courts described in the case law amount to quite an integrated, neat and clean looking system.  However, the practical experience of people on the ground in relation to liquidations has been that it is a tragedy, not only for the company and the personnel who own and work in it but also for the creditors.  As soon as the liquidator or receiver is appointed, the experience has been that not only do items disappear out of the premises of the company but also claims arrive here, <Col N="990" /> there and everywhere, either from retention of title clauses, or hire purchase contracts, or claims for damages to limbs or fingers, or in respect of bills not paid by the company.  One invariably finds that in the statements of the assets of the company drawn up by the directors or the liquidator at the start of the liquidation, the figures for these assets are hardly ever met by the disposal of the assets because they disappear into thin air from the mentioned sources and from very inadequate selling and disposal procedures during the liquidation.</P>
    <P>My view has always been that a liquidation is and always will be a tragedy.  By bringing the intermediate procedure of the appointment of an examiner into this proposed legislation, the Minister has taken a major step towards ensuring a continuous business environment here which will not involve the stop-go of liquidation. We will go back to a situation which perhaps prevailed in economies before limited liability companies were ever heard of, where people went on a stock joint basis into a large partnership and each and everyone concerned took a share of the risks of the business.  They faced up to the risks and did not hide behind any legalities to avoid the inevitable tragedies of some business.</P>
    <P>The business atmosphere which this legislation will provide will ensure that there will be a growth in the economy of persons who understand that there are ethics relating to business.  Even the debate in this House will highlight the desirability of having honest and responsible business people leading firms.  In the past many young people have been discouraged from going into business on their own or in partnership with others because company legislation allowed the fast and loose merchants very often to predominate in business life at the expense of honest to goodness traders and suppliers.  Young people were reluctant to go into business because it did not have the ethical standing of other activities.  The results of the debate on the legislation will encourage more ethical dealings.  I hope it will encourage people <Col N="991" /> to set up organisations similar to the professional associations such as the medical and the accountants associations and the Law Society, which have as their objects the control and self-regulation of business ethics.</P>
    <P>There is great status attached to successful business, and to persons who can go out there and conduct their business and pay their way.  If we were to have national heroes, it would be the people who go out and produce the exports and jobs, to satisfy the great national need we have for exports, jobs and wealth creation.  People who go out and toil every day &mdash; very often they and their families sacrifice income for many years before they have their business built up &mdash; deserve great credit.  They should join together to establish great partnerships or organisations which would have the hallmark of integrity, dependability and, above all credit worthiness.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the growth in commercial activity across the water in England right from the Elizabethan times when the joint stock companies started off.  People would join together without limited liability and send ships off to the furthest ends of the earth to bring back merchandise.  This could result in great profit but equally it often resulted in severe losses.  Given that this new legislation provides for setting up separate companies with the minimum capital qualifications, I think that private companies could join together in certain instances and set up criteria of creditworthiness and capitalisation which they as a group could hold themselves out as having.  They could regulate their membership to ensure that anyone seeking to enter into contracts with them would guarantee that they would not supply a company who were not creditworthy, or did not operate to a certain set of ethical standards.  This could not be legislated for or forced on the business community, but we are reaching a stage where not only are we required to have skills and resources in the European economy, but where we also need to prove to the rest <Col N="992" /> of Europe that we have the requisite business integrity required to carry out transactions from here to Greece or from Spain to here.  All countries should be able to deal on the Irish business scene without the fear of being let down, either through corporate manipulation, defrauding creditors or in ordinary contractual relationships.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will go a long way to inducing a sense of confidence among the business community and among trade unions and employees of companies that the Government are intent on ensuring a proper business environment in which people can operate honestly in the knowledge that they will be reasonably secure in their employment and, in the case of suppliers, that what is due to them will be paid.</P>
    <P>Many of the developments in the legislation were forewarned by developments in the courts.  Over the past ten years, with the increasing number of liquidations, the courts have become much more active in protecting the interests of creditors.  They have become much more active in ensuring that in instances where directors act fraudulently they are made personally liable.  The Bill reflects the courts' concern in this regard.  I am confident, given the attitude displayed by the courts over the past ten years, that whatever provisions are provided in the legislation will be actively pursued in the courts both by the legal profession and by the judges who deal with company law cases.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that however the legislation may be refined at present, it will be a success and will be of positive benefit to the business community.  In the fullness of time when we see how the legislation is working, I hope the Government will not be reluctant to come back to the House to provide whatever further slight refinements or amendments are necessary to ensure there are no technical anomalies which prevent the spirit of the legislation working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I believe that this Bill is good in substance and is long overdue.  I feel confident that it will mark <Col N="993" /> a significant improvement in the general area of company law.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Abbott about its implications and the consequences of its passage.</P>
      <P>It is worth while asking, when we look at company law in a general sense, why we have so organised our affairs that individual persons can be turned by law into what amount to companies or corporations. As Deputy Abbott pointed out, these limited liability companies are of comparatively recent origin and corporations and companies prior to the institution of limited liability were on a statutory basis.  Things which were effectively similar unless they were created by statute or by ordinance of the king or queen of the day were effectively akin to large partnerships in which all the participants were liable for all the debts. Two basic reasons emerged for the institution of the modern limited liability company: first, it is to provide for continuity, that a business may come into existence and not cease to exist or go into a legal crisis because one of the proprietors dies or becomes insolvent or whatever; the second factor, is the limitation of liability itself.  These are the two major factors in company law which justify the existence of limited liability companies in their modern form.</P>
      <P>With regard to the continuity of a business, it is desirable that an artificial person should be created as distinct from the actual human beings and bodies which constitute the ownership of any company from time to time.  This allows the shares of the company to be transferred. Effectively, it allows the business to move in terms of its ownership from A to B, and to allow for the participation of unit trust funds as much as private individuals without disruption to the business. But in relation to the question of risk-taking and liability, totally different considerations apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the view that this House should approach limited liability with a degree of seriousness &mdash; almost reverence &mdash; because of the implications of the limitation on liability.  It is all very well to talk about an enterprise culture, in which <Col N="994" /> I personally believe, and to talk about institutionalising the merits of risk-taking, creating a society in which people can take risks in as favourable an ambience as possible.  When a person takes risks with his own money, that is his own business.  Perhaps, as Deputy Abbott says, those who take risks by setting up businesses and offering employment to others are the heroes of our modern western market liberal society.  People who take risks with other people's money are in a very different category.  It is all right to take risks with one's own money but there must be slightly more responsibility when one takes risks with investors' money.  Much more important is the taking of risks with the assets, services and credit of third parties who are entirely strangers to the substance of the company's business.  That is a completely different thing.</P>
    <P>Risk-taking is not a virtue of an unqualified kind.  Risk-taking falls into three basic categories, the first of which is risk with one's own enterprise, efforts and property.  Then there is risk with the enterprise, efforts and property of those who are in some sense with you in the running of the company &mdash; the shareholders who are the joint owners of the company.  With regard to the interests of third parties, strangers to the company's affairs, risk-taking is not a virtue.  It may be necessary but in many cases it is a vice. To use the credit of third parties and strangers for the purpose of enriching oneself and to take risks with their money with the protection of law is a very serious matter.  It is that feature of Irish company law which has given rise to so much dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the phoenix syndrome where persons set up in business, inflate it, deflate it like a burst balloon, take the profits and set up another business in its place, without regard to the interests of the creditors, many of whose lives are ruined by such behaviour.  The phoenix syndrome is something which the man in the street can understand and dislike.  It has to be looked at very carefully and not just in broad populist terms. It is easy to come into this House and <Col N="995" /> suggest making life much more difficult for businessmen by hammering the business community and making criminal liability for directors stick.  Those are populist sentiments which in many cases are justified, but they cannot be trotted out on a simplistic basis without regard to the commercial realities of life.</P>
    <P>The commercial realities of life involve for many people a totally ridiculous situation in which small traders trying to establish small businesses come face to face with a companies code which is very hard for the ordinary person without third level education to comprehend and appreciate fully.  Company law is a very complex area.  That the average Joe Soap who wants to run a business of a small kind employing himself and one or two others must, if he wants to limit his liability, establish a company, is a proposition which I do not readily accept.  The limited liability company such as we have established with company secretaries, directors' meetings, annual general meetings, annual accounting requirements, qualified shareholders' rights, debentures and charges, are propositions which are appropriate to a company which is genuinely an association of strangers with a view to a common purpose.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for the proposition that we should establish a simpler form of limited liability for small and sole traders.  There are plenty of models in continental Europe for such a form of simple limited liability, so that an ordinary person who is a plumber does not have to pretend that he has an annual general meeting between him and his wife every year to decide how his business is being conducted.  I hate legal fiction.  I find it an abomination that courts seriously have to pretent that a plumber and his wife, who is also deputising as secretary of the company, have for some purpose to go through this legal charade in order to avail of limited liability. Would it not be far better to allow businesses to apply for limited liability up to a small amount and let people trade with them in the knowledge of that limited liability?  It is not a company; it is just <Col N="996" /> a person who is carrying on a limited business.  Its assets are of a certain amount and the only obligation in relation to creditors of that business is for the participants to give full and fair accounts annually or biannually and for persons in those circumstances not to trade to an extent which is inconsistent with the accounting base of the company. That would be much more honest and sensible than pretending that Article A applies to a sweetshop in any street in this city.  People do not behave as if they are directors of a large company.  It is absurd to try to warp a model based on this loose association of strangers on to a business which is a million miles away from it.</P>
    <P>If we want to look at limited liability as an incentive to risk-taking, we might look at the American example.  The great majority of jobs in their great job boom have arisen in very small businesses which have become established.  If we want to learn from their experience, we should take the sole trader or the person with one or two employees out of the maze of company law and find within Europe a structure of limited liability which is honest, realistic and reflects the real situation. It must be workable and should not depend on legal fiction.  There are 1,000 good reasons for such a change in the manner in which we afford limited liability to small businesses and there are very few rational reasons for requiring small businesses to conform to the substance of company law.  All the arguments about continuity which I mentioned earlier do not apply to such an extent to small businesses of this kind. All the arguments about shareholders' rights are entirely fictional and inappropriate in that context.  Simple limitation of liability should be available in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is a model already in existence. I refer to the limited liability partnership which pre-dates the companies code as we have it.  It allows a general partner to take on partners who do not take on unlimited liability but only limited liability. The general partner must remain <Col N="997" /> liable in total for the debts of the company, but his limited partners are entitled to avail of limited liability, provided they do not take an active part in the management of the company.  There is one model &mdash; and I am not saying it is apposite to every trader because it would not be of much assistance to many of them &mdash; where the Legislature has left in being a different form of liability which does not depend on the structure and the fiction of a company's existence.</P>
    <P>I say all that to put in place my view that company law and the enhancement of the enterprise culture does not mean that the only way one can make risk taking more attractive is to do it by the vehicle we know as a table A off-the-shelf company with directors, shareholders and so on.  There are a thousand different ways of achieving the same result outside the companies code.  Now is the time to set up a working group in the Department of Industry and Commerce to see if there are not simpler forms of limited liability which could easily be established for small traders with a view to making life easier for them and to making the law more honest as it applies to them.</P>
    <P>Much this Bill is concerned with remedial matters &mdash; investigation of the company's affairs, undoing transactions involving directors, preventing abuses arising out of directors interest and insider dealings, winding up of the company, providing protection for the company in the case of temporary insolvency under which the company's affairs can be reconstituted, receivers and new regulations in relation to the accounts and accounting standards of the company. That is the substance of this Bill and it is fundamentally a remedial step designed to afford greater safeguards and substance to those who deal with companies and to impose, as Deputy Abbott put it, a different standard of behaviour than perhaps has been the norm in the past on those who use companies.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about company insolvencies and whatever remedy we provide must work in practice.  There is no point in having remedies which only <Col N="998" /> work in theory, or on paper, or having volumes the size of the 1963 Companies Act, which seems to provide a series of remedies, duties, liabilities and so on, but does not work.  The yardstick this House brings to company legislation must always be simple &mdash; is it effective?  We can impose liabilities on a host of people, but at the moment the law, say, relating to the recovery of small debts, or even large debts, is non-effective.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the appointment of sheriffs to reconstitute what used to be there &mdash; a system of enforcing court orders &mdash; is a signal lesson to this House. We have hugely complex civil and commerical laws but more and more people going to law find that when they have litigated the matter and have been told they are entitled to X amount, there is no way to recover that money.  The same applies to our company code.  It is all very well to tell small creditors we are providing a new system whereby companies can go into protection rather than liquidation, but to an ordinary Joe Soap who is in debt and finds himself to be a creditor of an insolvent, whether temporarily or permanently, company he cannot just go to the sheriff and take legal remedies as if they cost nothing and were always effective.  A person in those circumstances needs real protection, not paper protection.</P>
    <P>When the British Parliament instituted their second last great codification of company law in 1948 which our 1963 Act is largely a mirror &mdash; they took one measure which we in our wisdom, or lack of wisdom, decided not to take, that was to provide a State liquidation of companies in the interest of creditors.  An official receiver was provided who could, at the instance of a creditor take over the function of liquidating a company.  We left it effectively to a creditor to go to court and apply for a private enterprise liquidator to be appointed.  The difference between those two sets of circumstances has been very telling in terms of how company law has been used and abused in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>In Britain the official receiver chased <Col N="999" /> directors and rogue directors, pinned their liabilities on them and used the law to corner them wherever they went.  In Ireland and I know this as does Deputy Abbott from ordinary contact with litigation &mdash; we frequently have to tell somebody who is owed £8,000 that by the time he has appointed a liquidator and has provided security to wind up the company, and by the time he has sorted out the jumbled mess that appears to be the affairs of that company, he will be out of pocket further because he must bear the cost of finding an accountant who will take on the affairs of the company.  The dreadful thing is that to date, the worse the condition of the company the less likely was anybody to appoint a liquidator, because in many cases the liquidator looked at the affairs of the company &mdash; I do not say this in an incriminatory way against those who have acted as liquidators because they do a good job &mdash; and found there were no assets out of which even an hour of his time could be paid for.  In other words, there is no prospect of the receiver being remunerated, and unless the creditors were willing to bank roll the liquidation, nothing could be done.  That frequently led to creditors being advised by lawyers &mdash; good and fair minded lawyers &mdash; not to throw good money after bad but to abandon their debt and let the man get away with it because it was not worth their while chasing him.  That is the reality of company law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The official receiver is a person whose duty it is in certain circumstances to say he would do the liquidation, chase the directors and do something about getting the assets of the company into some form so that there is something left for the creditors.  But that provision did not exist in Ireland, and the absence of the official receiver made company law in Ireland a preserve for those who wanted to abuse it.  In fact, it is a miracle there was not twice as much abuse.  If there had been a state officer whose duty it was to take over a liquidation in certain circumstances and to wind up the affairs of <Col N="1000" /> a company, I believe there would have been far less abuse.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that even in the structure of the Companies Act, 1963, there was a total failure to come to grips with the real motives of the fraudulent abusers of limited liability.  Fraudulent trading was provided for in the Act but nothing was ever done &mdash; it is a pity that the Minister for Justice is no longer in the House &mdash; to make the laws of criminal evidence such that any of these offences could ever be proved.  A person could go into a company's office and find records, invoices and books of account but as the law stands, none of these could be produced in evidence.  It is all very well to say in a civil case that you found these books and that they tend to show X, Y and Z and the court, probably bending the rules of evidence, would start to draw inferences from them, but in a criminal case &mdash; and like myself Deputy Abbott has prosecuted at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions on many occasions &mdash; it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by admissible evidence.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that Irish criminal law does not permit prosecutions of complex fraud.  It is impossible, unless the defendant makes widespread confessions of guilt, effectively puts his own head in the noose and kicks the lever as he goes down, to secure convictions.  Computer records are not provable in an Irish court. Records of indefinite origin are not provable and in many cases the rule of hearsay prevents documents which are obviously authentic being used to establish the facts set out in those documents. The right of silence, about which we hear so much, allows the accused person to say, &ldquo;Prove it.  I do not want to make any comment on it.  I do not want to say anything about the records of this company nor about its condition of trading history.  You prove the case against me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many times it has transpired that people who are obviously civilly liable &mdash; and should be criminally liable &mdash; cannot be prosecuted because there is not even a presumption of any kind to assist the prosecution in relation to the records <Col N="1001" /> of the company and all the records available are inadmissible.  That is the day-to-day experience of company law.  We live in a slightly unreal world in this House. We are now passing a law to make certain forms of behaviour by directors a criminal offence; we are providing for penalties on summary conviction and penalties on indictment but, in relation to trials on indictment, nobody in this House seems to have any notion of what form those trials will take, what form the Book of Evidence will take, who will give evidence about the company's affairs or who will pinpoint the fraudulent transactions. How will they do it?  Will they wave invoices at the jury from five yards away across a courtroom and hope that the judge will say it is admissible evidence, even when it is not?  Things do not happen that way.</P>
    <P>We have reached the sad state that commercial fraud and commercial crime are, effectively unprovable.  Therefore, all the criminal sanctions provided for in the Bill are, in a large measure, ineffective and incapable of operation.  I am not being critical or anyone in this House because the legal profession have failed to face up to this and they have the most experience in this field.  The man in the street does not know what the hearsay rule is and still less has he any idea of how it can be improved upon.  The legal profession know precisely how unfair that rule is and how much a vehicle of fraud it frequently is.  They have not done their bit in goading this House into reforming the law relating to commercial fraud and commercial crime.</P>
    <P>If a jury of 12 people drawn from all walks of life are to be empanelled and asked to consider the affairs of a company and to decide, beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt or innocence of a director of the offence we are creating in this statute, they would need to have considerable accounting skills or be able to have the advice of accounting experts as to the significance of the figures brought before them.  At the moment the opinion of an accountant in a criminal trial as to the significance of figures and whether something was a reasonably likely transaction <Col N="1002" /> undertaken in the context of the solvency of the company, is not evidence available to a jury.  It just shows that, on virtually every front, the dice still remains loaded against enforcement of the law.  We are doing right things in the Bill but we are not delivering on our fundamental duty to make these provisions effective.  In this connection, I summarise by saying that unless these measures are made effective and made to stick, they are pointless window dressing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill but a whole raft of legislation is needed in addition to it to make the legislation stick.  The legal procedures necessary to make the legislation work are not there.  I instance the absence of an official receiver and the absence of fair rules of procedure and reasonable rules of evidence as things which will make this legislation ineffective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Abbott alluded to a fairly obvious point, that it is easy to come in here and say that small traders should be preferential creditors of a company.  It is an easy proposition to conjure up and it would cause a headline here and there if it was said often enough or loudly enough. However, translating it into practice is a very different thing.  In terms of preferential creditors, you will never get a fair system unless an entirely radically different view is taken of the assets and the mode of their distribution on an insolvency. This Minister should think in terms of dividing the cake on an insolvency in statutory slices, much as in the case of inheritance under the succession Act.  A certain portion of the assets of any company, determined by percentage &mdash; I do not know what it should be, 10 per cent, 25 per cent or 35 per cent &mdash; should always be available for different classes of creditor.  No creditor, by lending to an institution which has limited liability, on the basis of an absolutely exclusive charge gives him priority over all other creditors, should be able to say that he will take the interest on his loan which is charged on the assets of the company and avail of the limited liability and, that if there is any insolvency, he will be the first to get his money and will <Col N="1003" /> take it without any consideration for the implications for the other creditors of the company.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to devise a system of insolvency law which would separate the assets of an insolvent company into proportions which would be available for different purposes.  One purpose is the cost of the liquidation itself, so that maybe 5 per cent of the assets of a company were always available if necessary.  I am not suggesting that they should always be applied to this purpose but that they should be available, if necessary, for a liquidator so that a liquidator coming to grips with an insolvent company would always have some proportion of the assets of the company for distribution and available to fund the liquidation.</P>
    <P>Another proportion should always be available for ordinary, unsecured creditors, and the rights of secured creditors should, therefore, it follows logically, be confined to a different proportion of the company's assets.  A model along those lines could be instituted and would be fairer.  There should be no situation in which bona fides, ordinary creditors ended up utterly penniless while secured creditors recovered all that was due to them.  Secured creditors &mdash; let us be clear about this &mdash; are in general terms institutions which have lent to the company and they look to the company for an interest income, whereas that is not the case with an unsecured creditor who is normally somebody who has given a service or goods to the company in good faith and with the expectation that the debt will be paid.  I do not see why we should in our laws, provide for an unlimited capacity for institutional lenders to immunise themselves from the effects of insolvency when ordinary Joe Soaps cannot.  While I agree with Deputy Abbott &mdash; I do not want to be populist and simplistic &mdash; on the subject of protecting ordinary trade creditors, this House should address itself to the possibility of providing definite proportions which were always available for unsecured creditors so as to protect them, <Col N="1004" /> at least in part, from the consequences of insolvency.</P>
    <P>While I am on the issue of insolvency I would like to say that my party have, in their two or three years of existence, always championed the proposition that the Revenue Commissioners should not be secured creditors of any company.  The Revenue Commissioners are given power after power in Finance Acts to secure the debts due to them in relation to taxation arrears.  That kind of power is not available to the ordinary unsecured creditor of a company with a small amount of money.  The Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I make no criticism of them &mdash; very frequently, in the management of revenue, make commercial decisions to go easy on a company they believe will be in a position in six or nine months' time to pay their tax debts.  I am not criticising them for that.  That is a sensible discretion which is given to them.  In making their decision they know that in the last analysis they are secured.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people who deal with the company in the intervening period, who lend to the company, supply to the company and work for the company in various ways, do so continually at a risk that the Revenue Commissioners can at any stage pull the plug and say that that company is no longer considered to be a solvent or a saveable commodity.  Those are the circumstances in which it is wrong for the Revenue Commissioners to be able to claim their preferential creditor status. They have been, in many cases, entitled to something which the ordinary trade creditor is not entitled to.  Their Inspector of Taxes sits down with the directors and the accountants of the company and he knows the position of the company.  Very frequently the Revenue Commissioners have much better knowledge than any trade creditor can possibly have and they make a decision to extend credit.  In the meantime ordinary, innocent people deal with that company but if there is an insolvency the Revenue Commissioners' position is secured at any given time because they have the rank of preferential creditor. We should as a House acknowledge that that is unfair.  It brings about a false <Col N="1005" /> sense of security among the Revenue Commissioners and it inculcates a willingness on the part of the Revenue to forego revenue in certain circumstances or to forego adherence to strict time limits for payment of revenue due on the basis that this safety net is always available to them.  That is unjust and does not even work in the interests of the Revenue Commissioners in the long run. It would be far better if, when they sat down with the directors of a company, they were in a position to say to them: &ldquo;We are just ordinary unsecured creditors; we are not going to give you any particular favours; we want an arrangement which will stick and we will not deal with you on the basis that we are all right but everybody else can suffer if the company becomes insolvent&rdquo;.  In the context of preferential creditors there is a need for a review of the law.  Unfortunately, this Bill, while it deals very well with many other matters, fails to deal with that issue and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of infractions of the law.  The penalties provided for in this Bill are not severe enough.  When somebody has been knowingly and fraudulently trading it is not very different from when somebody pilfers money on a massive scale from his employer.  The penalties imposed should be the same as those for embezzlement under the Larceny Act, 1916.  We cannot have a two-tiered system of justice where white collar crime of embezzlement is dealt with more severely than directors' conscious acts of fraud.</P>
    <P>I note that it is proposed to amend section 297 of the Companies Act in relation to fraudulent or reckless trading. Now the definition of officer is to include an auditor, liquidator, receiver or shadow director.  I hope that is sufficient to cover people who substantially derive profit from a company.  I hope the title of shadow director is sufficient to cover not simply people who are proxy directors but also bank rollers of a company who are aware of its affairs.  I wonder if that is the case.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters in the Companies Act, 1963, which need <Col N="1006" /> amendment or small running repairs. One of them which strikes me &mdash; I have written to the Minister about this and I hope that on Committee Stage he will accede to an amendment or even put down one himself &mdash; is in relation to the banking world.  Provision should be made so that securities issued by banks by way of promissory notes or other money notes for trading on international markets would be excluded from the definition of debentures.  At present they are included as securities of a company.  Therefore documentation in relation to the floatation of such note issues should be dealt with other than on the basis that it amounts to a prospectus and that liability arises accordingly.  It is unnecessary for us to trammel Irish banks.  Other companies trading in the banking business are not trammelled by such an unduly restrictive law.  I will be putting down an amendment on Committee Stage on that and on a number of other small but important issues.  I want to try to avail of this opportunity, in amending company law, to make a few running repairs.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps unfortunate &mdash; I can see why it has come about &mdash; that now when Britain has consolidated its company law in a new Act, Ireland should be still adding to a patchwork of individual Companies Acts.  It is a pity that the 1963, the 1983, the 1986 Act and this Bill would not have been consolidated into one Act. Perhaps that will be done under the rules of this House, without huge debate or massive disturbance to the procedures of the House.  It should be possible to produce one consolidated Companies Act which would make the law accessible in one document as it was in 1963.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government for getting on with this Act.  My major misgiving is in terms of effectiveness.  On Committee Stage our contribution will be directed towards increasing the effectiveness of this legislation rather than disagreeing with its principles in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  It is certainly lengthy with 11 Parts and 207 sections.  If one was to go into such a Bill in detail on every <Col N="1007" /> section one would need to be here for days.  I know many other Deputies will wish to speak on it and I intend to be as brief as possible.  In a debate in this House a number of lawyers, accountants and such people have spoken on the Bill generally.  They are very well briefed and very well aware of the pitfalls and difficulties faced by companies and people involved over many years.</P>
      <P>During the past eight or ten years I have been involved with the liquidation and receivership of many companies in my county &mdash; indeed, at one stage we were creating records down there in that regard &mdash; usually to make sure that jobs were saved or the people losing their jobs got a fair crack of the whip.  I have been appalled at some of the things I have seen happening in that time.  I have seen companies closing down one day and the directors opening other companies or similar type companies the next day.  I have seen asset stripping, rogue directors redirecting moneys and equipment out of a company that went into receivership of liquidation just weeks previously and using them to set up new companies.  In practically every case the real losers both in financial terms and job wise have been the suppliers and workers of such companies. Nobody seems to care about this sector.  This Bill, I hope, will go a long way towards correcting the problems that have existed in this regard up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest example of rogue companies I have come across is one called Hospital Transport Services Scheme of Scalty, County Carlow who recently canvassed house to house in my county and other counties of the region offering old people and the less well off transport services at a yearly rate of £36 each.  They collected thousands of pounds, but after a couple of months they disappeared and no one seems to be able to make any contact with them or bring them to justice.  I have numerous letters from people in my own county who paid money to this operation. I have passed these letters to the Minister for Health and I hope he can have the matter investigated.  I feel this company collected moneys under false pretences <Col N="1008" /> by promising a hospital transport service, maybe because some health boards withdrew the service of bringing people to hospitals because of the cutbacks, and these rogue directors saw an opportunity to get easy money.  Certainly they got easy money at the expense of the poor, the less well off and the old people and they have caused consternation among this group of people who feel cheated and let down by such action.  I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health to involve themselves in trying to have this company investigated by the Garda SÌoch·na and to see that justice is done and is seen to be done.  The company have run with thousands of pounds of poor people's money and no company or group of people involved in such a company should be allowed to get off scot free with such deeds.  Immediate action should be taken here.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions that I welcome, particularly the proposed new arrangements providing that companies in financial difficulties can avail of a legally enforceable rehabilitation period when they can seek court protection under which the rights of all creditors are temporarily frozen and the court appoints an examiner to examine the affairs of the company and keep a supervisory role on their affairs while they are under protection.  The examiner reports to the court on the viability of the company and if they are viable prepares a rescue plan which in turn is submitted to interested parties, for example, creditors, for acceptance.  This is a welcome initiative.  If it had been there heretofore maybe some of the companies who have gone to ground because of bad management or financial difficulties could have been saved.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this provision.</P>
    <P>The highlights of the Bill generally are that directors may more often become personally liable for a company's debts in a winding up and that directors of insolvent companies will be restricted in future directorships.  Directors of holding <Col N="1009" /> companies may have the same responsiblity as directors of an insolvent subsidiary for the latter's affairs.  Greater powers are given to the Minister and other parties, such as creditors, to have inspectors investigate a company's affairs.  Companies experiencing financial difficulties can be placed under protection of the court for a period of months, and insider dealing is prohibited. Substantial penalties are provided for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>These are the principle features of the Bill.  In many ways they are welcome, particularly by people who suffer severe losses because of companies who have gone into receivership or liquidation.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with investigations into the affairs of a company. The courts are empowered to appoint inspectors to investigate a company's affairs when this is deemed necessary.  It can be on the application of an interested party or the Minister himself can initiate proceedings.  This legislation deals with matters such as entry and search of premises and the inspector's report which is to be made available to various interested parties as the court sees fit.</P>
    <P>Part III is in regard to directors and various connected persons, for example the spouse or other members of the immediate family.  It deals with situations where a company director might be tempted to put his personal interests before those of the company.  This has been known to happen on a wide scale; company directors have used company assets and moneys for their personal benefit. People who supply such companies or who are involved in such companies will welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with insider dealing.  It is difficult to come by evidence of insider dealing in Ireland but it is highly likely that it exists here.  Initially it was proposed in the Bill that the practice should be dealt with as a civil offence only. However, after much discussion and debate the Minister has now decided to make it a criminal offence in line with practice in most other countries.  Insider dealing or even the impression that others <Col N="1010" /> have of the inside track is a great hindrance to public confidence particularly in the Stock Exchange.  Investment in industry through the Stock Exchange is the lifeline for economic activity and growth, and confidence in it must be maintained.</P>
    <P>Part IV, which many see as the most significant Part of the Bill, addresses the problem of fraudulent and reckless trading. Provisions have been available in company law since 1963 under which company directors could be made liable for their company's debts where fraudulent trading had taken place.  This Part will strengthen and improve the law in this regard.  The problem to some extent with existing legislation was that as things stood it was very difficult to prove fraudulent trading, consequently liquidators tended to avoid it.  Under this Bill offences of fraudulent trading have been divided into civil and criminal sections and the standard of proof required in a civil case brought by a liquidator or creditor is thus lowered.  I welcome the provision that the concept of reckless trading is to apply to liability for debts of a company being wound up and that this will apply to a director who knowingly contracts debts which he does not honestly believe on reasonable grounds can be paid.  In many cases over the past few years we have seen companies trading right up to the day they have gone out of existence.  I refer particularly to the farmers in the south eastern region who had cause to become very militant recently because they were selling cattle and other products to companies who purchased them right up to the day prior to going into receivership.  As a result there were severe financial losses.  Such losses, in many cases, put people in the farming community and other business people out of existence as well as the company that went into receivership.  It is fraud of the highest order to become involved in purchasing goods, knowing that the financial resources are not here to pay for such goods.  It is time action was taken in that area.</P>
    <P>It has been a bone of contention with <Col N="1011" /> me for a long time that preferential creditors are not rated in order of merit.  The banks and the Revenue Commissioners always get the largest slice of whatever is going when a company goes into receivership and I am not sure that this should be allowed to happen.  I do not see why the banks should be allowed to be preferential creditors because, in many cases the banks are aware for some time that a company is in a bad financial situation because they have the resources and the expertise and have the company's accounts in their office.  They know the position the company is in and if it can survive.  Yet they do not inform the company that they feel it cannot survive or warn it that it cannot continue down the road it is on.  The banks must play a greater role in this whole area.  In many cases banks have pulled the plug, knowing that when the assets are sold off they will get a reasonable slice of the cake, and that people down the line such as suppliers and employees will get very little.  That is not right.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are the same.  They allow companies to get away with paying VHI, VAT and tax returns for up to four years.  Such companies are then trading under false pretences because they are using money collected from the workers and moneys due in VAT receipts to survive.  If the money has not come through after six or nine months, or certainly within one year and if the Revenue Commissioners find that the company is not in a proper trading position, they should advise the company of what action may or may not be taken. The Revenue Commissioners have a role to play.  Because the Revenue Commissioners and the banks shy away from playing any role in the survival of a company and can, at the end of the day, pull the plug and allow the company to go out of existence, they should not be high on the list of preferential creditors.  This is an area the Minister should look at on further Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Small suppliers up and down the country have gone out of business because a <Col N="1012" /> company they supplied went into receivership. The Department, the banks and the Revenue Commissioners are not concerned about those small suppliers and they are just allowed to go to the wall. They suffer huge losses and they have no protection from anyone.  The Minister should ensure in the Bill that suppliers are given a higher preferential credit rating because they are not able to carry significant losses whereas the banks and even the Revenue Commissioners may be able to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of liquidation and receivership, the amount of money being paid to liquidators and receivers is exorbitant. They charge massive fees that are not justified and the responsibilities of a receiver are not well defined.  A receiver is appointed to look into the affairs of a company, wind up a company and sell off the assets.  I have seen companies that had vast amounts of assets such as materials, equipment and buildings, and yet by the time the company appointed to act as receiver carried out an inventory much of the equipment etc. had gone missing, and such materials and equipment would have a value and would ensure that creditors would get more when they were sold or disposed of.</P>
    <P>Some receivers or liquidators do not act quickly enough or in a responsible enough manner.  It seems they are not responsible to anyone at the end of the day.  That is something that should be looked at in far greater detail because in some cases companies can be sold off for, say, £90,000 with the receiver getting £50,000, leaving very little money for creditors, preferential or otherwise.  I have seen workers get as little as 5p or 6p in the £ after anything from 14 to 20 years service.  That should not be allowed to continue.  There should be some sort of fixed payment to receivers and people involved in this arena.  It should not be open-ended regardless of whether they spend 80 hours, 90 hours, 100 hours or one year winding up a company.  No one seems to have any great interest in how long they spend.  It is not right that the receivers and the liquidators should cream off most of the <Col N="1013" /> money that accrues from the selling off of assets.  The Minister should look at this area also.</P>
    <P>Finally, I compliment the Minister on taking action.  We have been promised this Companies Bill on a number of occasions and the public have been crying out for action to be taken, particularly in circumstances where companies were closing down today and starting up tomorrow with no lack of money to set up the new company, and suppliers losing substantially as a result of closedowns. This whole area needed to be tackled, and I compliment the Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for taking the initiative by introducing this Bill.  I hope that following the passing of this Bill swift action will be taken to implement its proposals so that we will not have the type of roguery, skulduggery and underhandedness that has gone on for a long number of years in relation to company closures and asset stripping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is most welcome, having been required for a long time.  It has been proven over the last number of years that it is absolutely essential to restrict and control the phoenix-type companies that we have read about in the newspapers.  It is quite a while since this Bill was first thought about.  The Leader of the Progressive Democrats was involved in the earlier stages.  Deputy Frank Cluskey was later involved, and Deputy John Bruton produced a Bill that was more or less the same as this Bill when it was introduced in the Seanad.  The sooner it is passed into law the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole concept of limited liability goes back over a number of years.  It is absolutely essential and operates in nearly all democratic countries.  Limited liability status places the directors of a company in a position of trust.  They are in a fiduciary position and, as a result, there is an obligation on them to be honest in their transactions.  There is no doubt that limited liability status has been seriously abused by a minority of people, some of whom have been reckless in their business dealings and whose actions on occasions have been fraudulent.  It is <Col N="1014" /> unfortunate that there has been little success in the efforts to combat such fraudulent transactions.  The Department of Industry and Commerce and the Companies Office have had limited success on that score.  In fact, I am not aware of any success they have had in proving fraudulent transactions by companies.  I see the Bill, which deals with mushroom companies and phoenix companies, as an effort to remedy the glaring defects in business life and commercial law.</P>
    <P>The problem with limited liability status was that the person who ran a business in a competent manner was placed at a disadvantage on many occasions.  We are all aware of the companies that have amassed huge sums of money which were siphoned off by the directors for their own personal gain, for the purchase of houses, property, lands and even race horses.  While those assets were being siphoned off, the company was getting deeper and deeper into debt. It is not hard to picture what happened to those companies.  When they went into voluntary liquidation many respectable family businesses, their suppliers, farmers and local traders were often left penniless. That has occurred in livestock dealing and in all aspects of business.  I welcome the Bill as an effort to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a complex measure and I do not intend to go into its provisions in detail on Second Stage.  However, I give notice to the Minister of my intention to produce, with the agreement of my party, a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  I compliment the Minister of State on his approach to the amendments and suggestions put forward when the Bill was being debated in the Seanad.  The Bill was changed drastically in the Upper House arising out of amendments put forward by Senators from all parties and submissions made by the business community. Under section 7 (1) a court may appoint an inspector from the Department to investigate a company.  Such application will be made to the court by the shareholders.  I do not intend to dwell on that provision on Second Stage but I should like to refer to subsection (3) <Col N="1015" /> which provides that the individual who wishes to have a company investigated may be ordered by the court to give security in the sum of £200,000.  I have no doubt that that will deter people from applying to a court to appoint an inspector to investigate a company.  Very few companies can afford to put up that type of security.  I accept that some companies for frivolous or even malicious reasons may apply to the courts to appoint an inspector to carry out an investigation but a security of £5,000 would be sufficient to deter people from making applications for frivolous reasons.  If the court decides to adopt the measure of requiring a sum of £200,000 to be lodged as security, this section regarding investigations made by the company shareholders will be rarely, if ever, utilised and it is a very important section.  The measure is onerous and much too restrictive and is entirely counter productive as regards its benefit to a company.</P>
    <P>The Minister may appoint his own inspectors after he applies to the court; I welcome that.  The position in regard to the report is accurately outlined in the Bill and I am happy with the measures in so far as they deal with the proceedings on the inspectors' report but the item I mentioned will certainly have to be changed.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to section 16 in relation to where an inquiry or an investigation is being carried out.  The situation here is serious in that if persons purchase shares in good faith and for valuable consideration and pay over their money, they can find that the sale was null and void. It is stated in section 16 that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by notice in writing direct that the shares shall until further notice be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section.</P>
    <P>It is stated also that the sale will be null and void.  I would ask the Minister to have this situation clarified.  I can understand why he has included this regulation. Shares are often sold on by people at the last moment.  Directors, for their own reasons, see a means of obtaining cash <Col N="1016" /> rapidly, sell shares to an innocent third party who pays his money.  If that person has not received notice then it would be wrong that he should be made a scapegoat and should be at the loss of his money.  Where an investigation is going on or where there is an inquiry of any sort I am anxious that proper notices be published.  I do not think that the matter of notices is adequately set out in the Bill. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the person who, in good faith, purchases shares will be safeguarded in some way.  Whether the investigation is registered in the companies office or is published in <i>Iris Oifigi˙il</i> or in newspapers is a matter that will have to be clarified.  As it exists I can foresee innocent people being at the loss of their money regarding the purchase of shares or debentures.  I would like to have this area investigated further.</P>
    <P>In company matters one of the areas where there must be a certain amount of privilege is in regard to a solicitor or barrister who is acting on behalf of a director of a company, where confidential discussions take place and where documents are produced to a solicitor who reads them and, perhaps keeps copies of them.  In any normal democracy such conversations between a solicitor and client are regarded as privileged.  In section 23 the Minister has made some effort to allow privilege to a solicitor dealing with a director or member of a company. While the Minister has gone some of the way to meet this problem of privilege, the Bill as presently drafted, is too limited in its scope and needs to be extended further.  In normal business transactions and to allow for confidence between solicitor and client I ask the Minister to extend that section further. Section 23 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in section 14 to 16 or 19 to 21 shall compel the disclosure by any person of any information which he would, in the opinion of the court, be entitled to refuse to produce on the grounds of legal professional privilege or authorise the taking of possession of <Col N="1017" /> any document containing such information which is in his possession.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that in so far as it relates to the particular sections it should cover all aspects of this Bill.  It is too limited in its scope.  In western democracy, as we know it, the discussions of a solicitor and client are privileged.  In my view this section has all the hallmarks of leading to a situation where that privilege may be interfered with.  I do not believe that to be the intention of the Minister or his departmental officials nor of anybody in this House to have any breach of that privilege.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this area that he will be able to meet his own wishes which I am sure are on the same lines as mine.</P>
    <P>The next section I should like to deal with concerns transactions involving directors.  There will have to be restrictions on the manner in which directors conduct and carry out their businesses. However, that being said, some of the restrictions imposed under the provisions of Part III of the Bill in regard to transactions involving directors are too restrictive. I note that the limit imposed on loans to be given to a director of a company, as specified in the Bill, is £2,500.  I contend that in this day and age such a figure is unrealistic.  I know there will be exceptions such as the circumstances obtaining in the case of a dwellinghouse and so on.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we are endeavouring to encourage people into business, industry and to invest here, including foreign business people.  After 1992 there will be free trade generally within Europe.  I predict that there will be cynical comment in many countries at the undue restrictions imposed here on the amount of loans a company can make to a director.  Again, I contend that the figure of £2,500 is unrealistic at present and will appear even more so as time goes on.  I contend that that type of nit-picking interference in the affairs of companies will deter many from coming here.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that there are heavy penalties provided for breach of the provisions of these sections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> These provisions involve too much interference in the affairs, directorships and management of companies and of businesses. This is something that should be examined at the earliest possible opportunity, particularly as we are endeavouring to stimulate industrial development here.  For example, anybody knowingly in breach of the provisions of section 31 will have been deemed to have committed a criminal offence.  The Minister might confirm that but that is my interpretation from a reading of the Bill as it stands.  These provisions will lead to prospective investors here questioning our attitude to entrepreneurs &mdash; bearing in mind the restrictions and penalties to be imposed with a director liable to be deemed to have committed a criminal offence if knowingly in breach of those provisions. Therefore, it is in everybody's interest that these provisions be amended.</P>
    <P>Any company conducting its business properly and efficiently should be allowed the freedom to continue to do so. Equally they should be allowed advance loans to the directors with the provisio that, in the event of the company getting into difficulties &mdash; it being seen that any given loan was advanced with the intention of siphoning-off money from the company &mdash; the directors, personally and individually, can be followed by a creditor to obtain reimbursement.  However, I reiterate that I do not think a limit of £2,500 is a realistic figure for insertion at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is good that there be provision for sufficient disclosure of interests in shares by directors or secretaries of companies. There must be a proper register maintained of shareholdings and interests.  I note that under the provisions of section 47 in the register of directors and secretaries, the present forename and surname and any former forename and surname of a director or secretary must be given, his date of birth, usual residential address, nationality, business occupation and so on.  I fail to see the relevance of a person's date of birth being included because that should not be of public interest so long as he or she will <Col N="1019" /> have reached the legal age limit within which they can conduct such business.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have had much contact with the Companies Registration Office. There was one gentleman in that office, an institution in himself, having been there so long.  Probably he was better versed in company law than many leading lawyers.  I refer to Mr. McCormack, one of the most knowledgeable persons of company law I have met.  I can say that the staff of that office have been consistently courteous and helpful.  With the greater number of companies forecast, the difficulties to be encountered in maintaining registers up-to-date, bearing in mind the various information on companies sought by the public generally, it is essential that there be a serious examination carried out of its staffing structure.</P>
    <P>I know there was a great shortage of staff in that office, just as in many other Government Departments.  However, the services of that office will be of such importance henceforth the Government will need to devote particular attention to the matter.  I know that the office is at present being computerised.  With the inception of the single market we shall have to have an extremely efficient, vigilant staff in the Companies Registration Office.  It must be borne in mind that we shall be dealing with foreign companies coming here who will have subsidiaries located elsewhere in Europe and around the world.  If a person wishes to inquire into a particular company or about an individual they should be able to do so and information should be made available with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to inside dealing. The Stock Exchange in Ireland has been properly managed and run and those associated with the exchange are held in high esteem both in Europe and around the world.  It is of tremendous importance that they be held in such high esteem. It is because of this that many citizens around the country have invested their life savings in publicly quoted companies on the Stock Exchange.  For this reason every effort should be made to safeguard <Col N="1020" /> the excellent reputation of the Stock Exchange.  We can do this under the section dealing with insider dealing.  I am glad the Minister took note of the submissions made and the demands for change in the Seanad.  It was the Minister's intention only to make insider dealing a civil offence, but after listening attentively in the Seanad he agreed to amend the section and make insider dealing a criminal offence.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me refer to the section which relates to the putting of a company under the protection of the court.  Again, this is to be welcomed.  There are companies who if given the opportunity would have been able to trade their way out of their difficulties but they were not given the chance because either the Revenue Commissioners or the banks pulled the plug and put them into liquidation despite the pleas of the owners.  This is a Bill which has received the support of everybody in this House and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the remaining Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other speakers I welcome the opportunity of being able to contribute to this debate.  Having read the excellent contributions which were made and seen the work which was done by Senators it is difficult to come up with original ideas on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I would like to acknowledge the work which was done in the Seanad, where many technical amendments were tabled.  I would not be aware of such problems if those technical amendments had not been tabled.  What I have to say is of a general nature but let me say that the law in relation to companies up until now has been very murky.  Many things which should not have happened and many things which were not covered in law are now going to be covered under this Bill.  Some of these activities have picked up tags along the way, such as insider dealing.  However there was fraud in relation to certain types of loans and many people got away with a lot, with many businesses folding up in the process. In the extreme cases a director <Col N="1021" /> would drive off to his mansion in a Mercedes with perhaps a yacht in tow with some small unfortunate businessman going bankrupt as a result without having any recourse to the law.</P>
      <P>This document is more like a bible than a Bill, covering 207 sections.  It is a very difficult Bill to understand and because of this I have no doubt that the debate on this Bill will be very lengthy and a new record will be set for a Committee Stage debate.  Likewise a record was set in the length of time it took to get this Bill into the House.  There were many delays as Deputy Bruton indicated.  Even though he was a member of a Government, in the inner sanctum, for a number of years he did not manage to get much done in this area.  I have taken every opportunity to point out that it takes a long time to get legislation into this House and I believe that people like Deputy Bruton should have taken action.  We should be looking at the reason for the delay.  The delay in this case may have been to our benefit because so many changes have taken place in communications and new scams have been devised, such as insider dealing.  Also in the interim period three Bills have been introduced so as to enable us to comply with EC regulations. We should remember that the original Bill was published in 1963 and that earlier we spoke about child care when it was pointed out that it has taken 80 years to introduce major legislation in that area. We need to be able to react to changing circumstances and be able to react more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see more rules being introduced by way of ministerial directive. The public have seen fraud perpetrated by what have been described as cowboy operators and they cannot understand why there is no legislation in place. There is a need to strike a balance in the legislation because for each bad business person there are hundreds of good honest capable business people.  We have to recognise that fact and the legislation should set guidelines and regulations which will not allow cowboy operators to operate but will help the legitimate honest business person.  I believe that is <Col N="1022" /> what is being aimed at in this Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, has shown an aptitude to react to situations.  With regard to below cost selling, petrol prices, etc, he was willing to go into the market place and tell people what they should be doing.  I believe he has been successful in that area and I wish him well in taking that kind of action.</P>
    <P>Balancing trade and the bringing in of regulations is a difficult question.  There is a risk which has to be carried in business and while on the one hand there is a need to protect the legitimate business person as far as possible and not make regulations too complicated, so complicated that a person, particularly in the smaller arena, will be afraid to get involved, at the same time there is a need to outlaw the cowboy operators.</P>
    <P>In the business environment the old attitude was that a handshake was sufficient to seal a deal in many cases and the rules which were there were understood by most of the people in business. However, that seems to have changed. One recent case I want to refer to showed the technical difficulties involved and how the scene has changed.  With regard to the take-over of Irish Distillers Limited, obviously those of us in the Cork area kept a very close eye on the situation. We were briefed by the principals and others who were involved but we knew that it was not just our Minister for Industry and Commerce or Minister for Finance who were involved.  A British based take-over panel seemed to have a major role to play in the whole affair. The EC panel had a major role to play and we also had our national legislation. The company law area has become so complicated that there has been a court hearing and an appeal in this case but the deal has still not been sealed.  This shows how difficult the company law area has become.  It will be difficult to simplify it but if the regulations are set down in a workmanlike way at the outset I believe we can create the proper climate in this area.</P>
    <P>We have said that we need to create a climate for investment in industry and I <Col N="1023" /> believe this has been done on the economic front.  Interest rates and inflation rates are at their lowest level for 20 or 25 years.  We now need to regulate the legal side of business, which I believe is being done.  I am aware that there are lobbies on both sides in this regard.  On the one hand there are business people who are afraid of being caught by competitors, suppliers etc., and the public who do not understand the situation and who are worried and, on the other hand, there are the professionals in the field who are represented on the CII, etc., who have made representations in this regard.  They believe we have to look at both sides and try to get the best balance possible.</P>
    <P>I suppose my major role in this House is to present the problems which I see on the outside, to this House and the Minister, to have them looked at and try to come up with solutions to these problems.  I have spoken with about two groups but up to now I have only been able to generalise in a very broad way on this Bill.  I have said it is an attempt to deal with corrupt directors, to eliminate insider trading and confine the bad individual. On the positive side &mdash; and we should try to emphasise the positive side &mdash; I have been able to say that the legislation is an attempt to protect and help companies which could have been solvent if they were given a fair measure of time to work their way out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Cork area got a bad hammering during the period 1985-86 when an unprecedented number of companies went to the wall.  From discussions I have had with people involved in these companies I believe many of them could have been saved if this type of legislation had been in force.  They had cash flow problems and they needed protection for a period of time but this was not available.  I congratulate the Minister for putting a provision for that protection into the Bill because it is only fair to these people.  On the other hand, provision is being made for the examination of a company and I believe &mdash; as was said in relation to the Insurance Bill &mdash; that it should be a subtle type of operation and the confidence of <Col N="1024" /> a company should not be undermined by the fact that an investigator is put into the company.</P>
    <P>With regard to preferential creditors, I support totally the case made by the CII that for tax purposes and other State revenue the period of time during which they are preferential creditors should be very limited.  It is scandalous that a unit of an organisation should have precedence, in regard to bills going back over four or five years, over people who are trading with the company on a daily basis and who have to keep their affairs up to date.  In this regard the highlight has to be that enlightened provision, the tax amnesty, which brought so many companies up to date.  It would have been impossible to implement a provision whereby the Revenue Commissioners, as preferential creditors, would have had a shorter call last year.  Because of the action taken by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, this year I believe it is possible to bring such a provision into the Bill.  I should like the Minister to look carefully at this area.  If there are inefficiencies in the State sector we should address them so as to bring people up to date in their workings.  They should not be cushioned from the realities of commerce but should be in there trading like everybody else.</P>
    <P>Some of the other sections in the Bill deal with related companies being protected when they are in difficulties.  While protection is provided on one side I believe it is correct that there should be some repercussions for parent companies which liquidate smaller units.  We are aware that asset stripping has occurred in many cases.  When a small company is bought the assets can be siphoned into the parent company and the smaller company can be liquidated, with a knock-on effect for small traders.  It is important that at times smaller companies should be looked upon as separate units but it would be for the parent company to do that.  Obviously there should also be a balance in this regard and the Construction Federation of Ireland have made the case that this should not be enforced if the debt has been run up as <Col N="1025" /> a result of honest trading practices but enforced only where fraudulent or improper dealings are concerned.  This area is so fine that it would be impossible to decide which is which and there has to be legislation to cover this.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of people walking away with funds and setting up other companies has been touched on in this debate by every second speaker.  We have seen the great scandal of companies being closed down in cities and towns and the principals involved opening up, in many cases a few hundred yards away.</P>

    <P>Financial assistance towards the establishment of research and development facilities is also available to individual firms in the food industry from the Industrial Development Authority.

Furthermore, EC and national aid is available for food <Col N="1026" /> processing projects many of which contain an R and D element.  In the past year £20 million in EC grants have been approved for such projects.  Related national grants amounted to a further £12 million.</P>
    <P>The integration of the food-related R and D facilities of the Institiute for Industrial Research and Standards and An Foras Tal˙ntais earlier this year in the National Food Centre in Dunsinea has resulted in closer technological co-operation with the industry in the improvement of quality standards and development of new products.</P>
    <P>The legislation establishing Teagasc lists food research as a priority in its functions and provides for the setting up of subsidiaries, if necessary, in joint ventures with the private sector.  These provisions reflect the importance which the Government attach to the development of the food industry and the commercial orientation which they expect Teagasc to have in undertaking their research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that research has practically come to a standstill because of under-funding and further, that many of the technical and professional staff who are required either have left the service altogether or have been relocated in unsuitable paper-pushing jobs?  Would he agree that the morale in Teagasc is now at an all-time low, particularly in the research area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Stagg.  I am not wishing to evade the question, but there are a number of questions down specifically in relation to Teagasc and there are very comprehensive replies coming up on these. In the food research area, I do not think that morale was ever higher.  In the streamlining about which I talked, the IIRS and An Foras people are together carrying out a co-ordinated programme of R and D for the food industry.  Also, I mentioned that £20 million of FEOGA funding and a further £12 million of IDA funding have gone into the modernisation of the food industry.  That modernisation includes, of course, research and <Col N="1027" /> development.  There is a new era of development in the food industry about which I am very happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the director of ERAD that the total expenditure committed to TV, radio and newspaper advertising to include both TB and brucellosis schemes in connection with the new ERAD structures is £298,000 plus VAT.</P>
      <P>As regards progress on the new campaign, the director has informed me that although the present indications are that improved results are being achieved during the round of testing now in progress, the overall position is that the campaign is only in the initial stages of a four year programme and that it is, therefore, premature as yet to assess the results achieved.  I have, however, asked the director to let me have a full report on the programme when the first full year of the campaign has been completed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I want to express my thanks to all the interests concerned who have accepted my invitation to serve on the board of ERAD which I established in April 1988.  I am confident that with guaranteed Exchequer funding of £31.6 million per annum over the four year programme and the co-operation of all the interests involved the board can reach the target of reducing the existing levels of TB by half during that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the enormous amount of money committed to this area over the years which prompted me to ensure that we would tackle this differently, first to provide constant and guaranteed funding over a four-year programme which has not been available in the past and which everybody will tell you was the cause of the breakdown from time to time.  Secondly, I want to get all the interests involved responsible themselves for the eradication of these diseases so as to relieve the burden &mdash; and the Deputy is quite right &mdash; on the taxpayer, and indeed, to achieve effective results.  Even after last year and before this programme was set up, when we did commit adequate resources the results were already encouraging.  I am very confident that with the co-operation which is there now and the determined programme for heavy penalties if necessary, but also of control, we will get a positive response to this.</P>

Did I understand from the Minister that he was giving an assurance that there will be no docking of the £4 million, as happened on the last occasion?  I shall be very pleased if that is the case.  Did he give an assurance that the full funding will continue, to ensure that the total scheme will be carried out and elimination of the diseases achieved by these methods?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an essential element of this programme, unlike what happened in previous years.  Everybody recognised that there were cutbacks a few years ago which undermined the whole programme.  An essential element of what we are doing now is providing a guarantee.  Uniquely, because of its importance it is the only area in the whole public expenditure programme with precisely the same funding for four years. The farmers, who are the contributors by way of levies are also guaranteeing the same amount.  Finally, if we succeed in working within the funds we are now guaranteeing, that the actual reimbursement to be made to the taxpayers and to the farmers will be in proportion to the amount that is saved.</P>

    <P>In view of the fact that the said named gentleman and his solicitor, both orally and in writing were refused access to his own file in the district veterinary office in County Tipperary I would like an explanation, if the Minister is in a position to give me one why the file was not forwarded to him even if the request was a couple of years later?  We had a High Court and a Supreme Court case on this matter and the parties were refused access to information on themselves in <Col N="1036" /> the DVO file, yet that information was liberally supplied to another party &mdash; other than Mr. Hanrahan's team.</P>

      <P>I have indicated that at the time of the High Court proceedings, on the basis of legal advice given to the then Minister, access to the relevant papers were offered to both the plaintiff and the defendant.  In the event only the defendants availed of the opportunity at that time but two years later the plaintiffs requested the information.  It is not for me to engage in matters relating to legal procedures but, as the Deputy will be aware, the Supreme Court hearing is merely on evidence given in the written transcripts of the High Court therefore there was no new evidence to add at that point.  The legal advice to us at that point was that there was no reason for giving access two years later.  In the event of the matter now coming to be determined by compensation, I will of course be quite disposed to letting them have access to the files.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 100 million ECU (about £80 million) was allocated to the 1988 EC scheme for the supply of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community. Some member states pressed for a distribution of the allocation based on population, but I insisted on a distribution which took account of the relative economic position of member states.  The Commission accepted my reasoning and, consequently, despite our having only 1 per cent of the Community's population, Ireland was initially awarded almost 2.5 per cent of the overall allocation, i.e. 2.35 million ECU &mdash; about £1.8 million.  In addition, I am pleased to announce that I have recently succeeded in obtaining an extra 1.338 million ECU &mdash; over £1.0 million &mdash; for this year's scheme, as I announced yesterday.</P>
      <P>Due to the limited nature of the scheme it was essential that eligibility criteria be drawn up in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and other interested parties.  The Irish scheme, as approved by the Commission, covers:</P>
      <P>(1)  Homeless persons accommodated in hostels and shelters run by voluntary organisations.  These hostels and shelters have been receiving supplies of beef and butter based on their stated needs to the end of December next.  Over 55 tonnes of beef and 13 tonnes of butter will have been allocated by the year's end.</P>
      <P>(2)  Certain social welfare recipients (approximately 50,000) i.e. &mdash; recipients of long term unemployment assistance who qualify for the fuel allowance; recipients of long term supplementary welfare allowance; F¡S trainees who qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul have agreed to operate the scheme in so far as the eligible social welfare recipients are concerned.  Accordingly, some 460 tonnes of beef will be distributed by the <Col N="1039" /> society to these categories.  Vouchers, which can be redeemed at the local St. Vincent de Paul depot, will be issued automatically to eligible beneficiaries through the employment exchanges and community welfare officers.  Distribution under this scheme will commence in the week beginning Monday, 21 November.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be making continued efforts to ensure that Ireland receives a sizeable allocation under the 1989 scheme.  I would also like to take the opportunity to thank once again the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for agreeing to carry out this difficult operation, and also the meat plants for agreeing to process the beef free of charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain how it happens that at a time when the number of families living below the poverty line goes up and up the amount of our allocation under the scheme goes down and down?  In 1987 we got in excess of £6 million, while in 1988 we are to get slightly in excess of £2 million.  Nobody is effectively arguing the case of the poor in Brussels.  I would ask the Minister to recognise that there are large numbers of families for whom the bite of beef they get under this scheme is the only bite of beef they get from one end of the year to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount agreed by the Community for allocation this year was 50 per cent lower than allocated last year.  I regret that as much as does Deputy Quill.  Some countries have had a further reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our proportionate share of the amount allocated was higher than last year.  I insisted as part of my agreement that if some countries who had no enthusiasm for the scheme did not take up their proportionate share we should have priority in the amount being re-distributed.  That is why I was able to announce an extra £1 million yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> I hope next year it will be a lot more, but it will have to be a proportion of the overall available in the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is clearly not looking for information.  The implication in her questions that no concern was expressed by this Government is not correct.  The European Community's global amount was reduced and the case for the poor in Ireland was so strenuously argued that we got a much higher percentage than previously, together with an extra £1 million only a few weeks ago.  If that is not effective arguing I do not know what is.  I tried to get 11 other member states to see it as clearly as we do.</P>

      <P>The decision has been made in regard to this year's allocation and, regrettable as it is, there is not much point in arguing about it.  I wish to ask about the 1989 allocation.  In view of the fact that poverty conferences have highlighted the situation here &mdash; a poverty conference was held in Brussels at which unfortunately no Irish MEP turned up &mdash; will the Minister emphasise to the Commission that every pound of butter and beef taken from them represents a reduction in their expenditure?  It is a saving for them and there is a need for it here where well over one million people, many of them children, are living in poverty. Will the Minister begin now arguing for earlier and more frequent allocations in 1989?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the essence of what he is saying is that the crumbs from the rich man's table in Europe are getting scarcer for the poor?  Would he further agree that the <Col N="1041" /> system of distributing this charity &mdash; and I say that with coldness in my voice &mdash; is hit and miss?  I am not criticising the St. Vincent de Paul Society, but they are simply not organised to distribute nationally.  Would the Minister not agree that the more appropriate authority to distribute any benefits or assistance would be the statutory authorities of the health boards whose officers are fully aware of all the criteria he has mentioned?  Would he inform the House if it has been found necessary to give instructions to the poor on how to cook the meat they get because normally they do not need to have this knowledge.</P>

      <P>Teagasc are responsible for the provision of advisory, training and research services in agriculture.  Teagasc have intimated to me that they estimate that the likely deficit at the end of this year will be about £11 million.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering what extra provision it may be possible to make during the present financial year in order to reduce the deficit and I expect to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in this House very shortly to cover the appropriate provision.</P>
      <P>Teagasc are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of all their activities and the chairman has informed me that he expects to have this completed as a matter of urgency and to submit plans for the future of the organisation and their financing to me by 14 December.

Secondly, what plans does the Minister have to ensure that the 1989 figure for Teagasc, £27.5 million which is £10 million short of pay roll costs alone, will be met and that the organisation will be able to live within that budget?

They have already got an extra £3.4 million for the very early retirement scheme, and that comes to £8.4 million, and there is a deficit of £11 million, if I understand the Minister's answer, or does the Minister's £11 million include these two sums and the Supplementary Estimate coming to the House will be of the order of £11 million or £11Ω million?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 21, 29 and Priority Question No. 46 together.</P>
      <P>The package of proposals submitted by the EC Commission, in order to comply with the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Mulder case, was examined by the Council of Agricultural Ministers at their meeting on 14-15 November 1988.  However, no decision was made in the matter.</P>
      <P>In these negotiations I have been seeking to achieve the best possible result for those Irish producers who participated in the non-marketing schemes and who satisfy the criteria to be laid down by the Council.  As the outcome of the negotiations will not be known until next month at the earliest, it is not possible to say at this stage whether the extra milk quota to be allocated will be sufficient to meet in full claims from eligible Irish producers.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate the number of farmers who participated in the non-marketing schemes because of animal disease problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister, at the Council of Ministers, will be doing his best to represent the farmers in this terrible predicament.  Will he give an indication to the House of the amount of additional projected quotas necessary for the farmers involved in this country?  As I understand it, the balance, other than the increase in reserves by the Commission to 500,000 tonnes, must be found within the overall guaranteed quantities. Will the Minister give any indication to those farmers whom he met from my own county in recent weeks that he will be <Col N="1050" /> able to bring about a resolution of their nightmare, because most of them do not have an income at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope so.  I will not say that I will be able to bring it about but I hope the Council of Ministers will be able to decide this matter at the next meeting in December because it is extremely urgent.  I am glad that the Vice-President of the Commission shares that view.  It will not be possible to indicate exactly how much will be available for each qualified applicant until we know how many there are.  To illustrate the point, 3,000 people in Ireland alone retired in the relevant period under the milk cessation scheme and, to date, 1,500 have applied.  If that is the pattern elsewhere it would not be possible to define the number of eligible people until we have the applications in full.  There has been one positive development; the original Commission proposal which I rejected, that only those who applied before the end of July this year would be eligible, will not now be proceeded with. I hope there will be an opportunity for those people to apply within a reasonable period of the regulations being adopted.</P>

I want to ensure that the scheme adopted will mean that the producer in each country will get either the full amount or the proportionate share of the full amount because, if you were to have a breakdown by country it would probably mean that each producer here would get a smaller proportion than his counterpart in some other countries.

      <P>That was not the case and there were no quotas floating around.  I wish there were.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to ask the Minister, in relation to the 3,000 people who would have qualified under the legal ruling and his assertion that approximately 1,500 have applied, is it not true to say that the Department of Agriculture and Food have records of the names and addresses of those 3,000 people and that it should be the duty of that Department to notify these people of their rights?  After all an increase in the quota is a national asset.  I would also like to ask the Minister, in the event of a decision being arrived at next month, if the extra quota allocated would be added on to the entire Irish quota for the milk year 1 April 1988 to 1 April 1989?  It would be very important in the context of the super-levy problem which many people are facing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too complex or lengthy in regard to this matter.  First, in relation to the Department notifying the other 1,500 people, there is no guarantee that each of those people would qualify.  The figure of 3,000 represents the number of people who availed of the cessation schemes at the time.  That is not to say that all the 3,000 here or equivalent numbers elsewhere will qualify under the terms of the regulation which will now pursue because some will have got out of milk production and will have no intention of getting back into it.</P>

In response to Deputy Doyle's fifth or sixth supplementary question, he said he was making the case on the basis that all of those who went out of milk production and who are qualified applicants would get back their full quotas.  Will it now be in order for us as public representatives to instruct the many people who have been contacting us to recommence supplying to their local dairies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is that they would be compensated on the basis of levies they paid which otherwise would not have been paid.  There are a whole series of eligibility criteria that we are arguing at present and I hope the ones I am putting forward will be adopted.  If you would like to see everybody throughout the European Community who availed of milk cessation schemes become automatically entitled to a quota then you had better accept that there will be much less available for those who are really interested in getting back into milk production. That is the reason I have said all <Col N="1054" /> along the line that there will be no windfall profits in this because if there is it will be at the expense of genuine bona fide suppliers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has satisfied himself with the drop of a quarter of a million in cattle numbers slaughtered in our meat plants this year as opposed to two years ago; and if he proposes any initiative to reverse this trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher cattle disposals in 1986 resulted in some depletion of stocks but that trend has now ceased. The June 1988 livestock enumeration showed an increase in the female breeding herd of some 12,000 head compared with the 1987 level, the first increase since 1984.  The beef breeding herd increased by 42,000 head.  Deputies will be aware, but they sometimes seem to forget, that it takes two to three years for an increase in the breeding herd to be translated into increased cattle ready for slaughter.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I obtained European Commission agreement to the payment of the suckler cow premium on beef cows in dairy herds and the extension of the deadline for applications for the suckler cow premium from 30 November to 31 January.  This latter extension should facilitate farmers, who wish to operate the once-calved heifer system, in qualifying for grants under the suckler cow premium scheme.  I expect these measures to translate into additional cattle for slaughter in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further increase in the breeding herd is a priority and the most effective way of bringing this about is through increased profitability in suckler cows.  The success of the Government's policy in achieving major reductions in inflation and interest rates have been instrumental in this regard.  These developments, together with the attractive package for grants and greatly improved prices for calves and young cattle, should ensure a climate for further expansion in the cattle breeding herd and correct the declining trend of <Col N="1055" /> recent years.  It is, of course, self-evident that any drop in cattle numbers available for slaughter now is directly and exclusively a consequence of decision taken in 1985 and 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant thing at this point is that slaughtering capacity is not now the only criterion of activity in the industry.  It is more and more the added value in the plants after the slaughtering stage that has become a feature of the Irish meat industry.  Product development and packaging of all kinds is much more significant.  I acknowledge that there is a surplus slaughtering capacity now because of the inadequate numbers. I cannot press buttons, nor can this Government, which would suddenly produce a three year old bullock.  It takes three years for a bullock to mature.  What we are doing now will ensure that three years down the line there will be increased supplies.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being slightly mischievous when he says that the decisions taken in 1985 and 1986 result in the numbers being less than we would like, or words to that effect.  Surely the greatest factor in relation to the lower than ideal numbers in the beef herd was the introduction of the super-levy in 1984 and the subsequent efforts of farmers to live within their quotas and cull their cows as a result of that.  Could the Minister indicate what his views are in relation to the importation of calves as a method of overcoming this problem and the direct importation of beef for killing in our factories, both of which matters have raised their heads recently and there are increasing inquiries about them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 44 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In fixing the 1988 departmental Estimates CBF were allocated a grant-in-aid of £515,000.  This amount was subsequently increased to take account of the transfer of responsibility for pigmeat promotion from CTT to CBF.</P>
      <P>CBF derive the major share of their income from statutory levies which were increased in August 1988.  As a result CBF's total income for 1989 inclusive of the £0.5 million grant-in-aid from the Exchequer will reach an estimated £3.9 million compared with some £3.4 million for 1988.  The question of cost reductions, increases in other sources of income and the provision of services to the meat industry are, of course, matters for consideration by CBF but I am confident that, having regard to the overall resources available to them, the organisation will be able to continue and expand the very valuable services they provide for the meat industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister give assurances to CBF this year, while negotiations to increase this year's Estimates were going on, that the costs of the overheads and administration of their building would be borne by the Estimates, and all levies collected on animals would be directly used for marketing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is understanding that the Minister did so during the negotiations that arrived at the increase in the virtual doubling of this year's Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Estimate provided <Col N="1060" /> for this year, which is a 45 per cent decrease on the outturn of last year, is inadequate to do one of the most vital export marketing jobs this country has, can we expect that extra moneys will be forthcoming next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, CBF have done a remarkable job and I find we are both very much in tune in our line of policy. Secondly, it is a choice between whether the people who benefit most directly, namely the farmers and processors, should pay appropriately for what CBF are doing, or the taxpayers generally who do not get the same direct benefit but who benefit indirectly.  I am glad to say that the focus of our policy has been that those who benefit directly, as distinct from the general taxpayer, are the people best qualified and best able to pay, and with farm incomes as they are now I think that is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the general policy as enunciated by the Minister, but the big difficulty with CBF and all the marketing and export bodies in this country is that being an island we have an added handicap, an added disadvantage against our continental competitors.  I am asking the Minister to reconsider the enormous cut, virtually 50 per cent, in the Estimate next year to CBF.  Looking towards 1992 and the importance of establishing our livestock and meat products on supermarket shelves in Europe, now is not the time to cut back and put CBF at any handicap relative to our continental competitors.  In the long term I accept the Minister's philosophy but right now I think we are doing irrevocable damage with 1992 and the opportunities it presents on the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Deputy called it an enormous cut.  This is out of a total transfer of funds through my <Col N="1061" /> Department of £1.2 billion.  We should get this thing in focus.  It is not an enormous cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Relatively, in CBF's situation, it is enormous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>CBF's total budget now will be increased by £0.5 million over last year as I have said.  I have also said, in relation to what the Deputy regards as a disadvantage of being an island, that I am very glad that, with my colleagues here, I have focused so much on the advantages that has for us in the market penetration, that our farmers with the support of CBF and others are now getting top prices in Europe and in the world for their products.  That is the way we intend it to stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are added distribution and marketing costs.  Being an island environmentally clear, we have advantages, but we should not confuse the two issues.  The Minister should insist that the money is forthcoming to restore to CBF next year sufficient moneys to do the job we all want them to do and that they are capable of doing particularly with 1992 around the corner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he will justify the increased co-responsibility levy when the Agricultural Commisioner, Mr. Andriessen, announced a saving of one billion ECUs on EAGGF expenditure largely due to the higher world market prices for cereals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional co-responsibility levy is one of a number of measures decided by the EC Council, namely the heads of Governments which are aimed primarily at discouraging surplus production in the Community and in the process to create budget savings.  The indications are that cereals production in the Community has continued to increase this year, so that the problem of surpluses <Col N="1062" /> has still not been fully resolved.  Any current savings may, therefore, be of a temporary nature.  The Community regulation contains provisions for a refund, in whole or in part, of the additional levy in the event of Community cereals production not exceeding 164.8 million tonnes in a market year. The level of production for the current year has not yet been determined by the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>I would expect that the arrangements regarding the additional levy in future market years will be the subject of discussions when the Council of Ministers undertake the annual price-fixing negotiations in the early part of 1989.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that in order to offset the effects of the levies on the incomes of small producers a scheme of aid is in place whereby they can apply for refunds of part of both the basic and additional levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about an additional tax of £30 per acre. I understand the purpose of the extra levy was to compensate the budget for overproduction.  I do not understand what the Council of Ministers is doing to curtail the importation of cereal substitutes into the EC which is on the increase.  I believe now it is 27 million tonnes.  Those cereal substitutes have no co-responsibility levy and are subject to no quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very separate matter.  Although it is linked, it is not part of the question asked of me.  To get into that is a major issue.  I support and sympathise very much with the views expressed by the Deputy, I have expressed those views very strongly outside. I hope they will be reflected in policy changes in the next few years.  Every cereal producer in Ireland, by virtue of the exemption for small producers &mdash; we got the Council to define a small producer as those under 247 acres &mdash; has aid available by way of repayment of the portion of the co-responsibility levy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an enthusiast for this and I have argued vigorously against it but I must say that we have diminished what would otherwise have been the penal impact of it, first in reference to the ceiling that was proposed which we had increased and, secondly, in reference to aid for small producers.  If the ceiling is not breached &mdash; we have requested that this be determined early in the year rather than later, as the Commission originally proposed, &mdash; then those who have paid will be repaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of this month the ESB Officers Association, which represents clerical, administrative, counting, technical, sales and supervisory staff in the ESB commenced industrial action in protest at the reduction of staff numbers. Basically the action resulted in affecting the billing and accounts functions in the ESB as well as telephone switchboards. Pickets have not been placed as yet and there is no immediate threat to electricity supply.  The chief executive of the board has had a series of meetings with representatives of the other unions in the board over the past week.  This resulted in a document settling out a framework for relations between the ESBOA and the board and it was transmitted to the ESB group of unions and to the ATGWU.  The ESBOA yesterday rejected the terms of this document and indicated that the union's intention was to escalate the dispute further.  The ESBOA executive are meeting, and other unions in the board, today to review the situation. The ESB have their own domestic dispute-settling machinery which has proved effective over the years and I would ask the parties to use that machinery at once.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  Notwithstanding the fact that the ESB have a very elaborate industrial relations machinery and set of procedures, will the Minister share with me the concern of most of the country, particularly those in the productive sector, that those processes do not appear <Col N="1065" /> to be working effectively?  Will the Minister agree that the main participant in the dispute, the ESBOA have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the existing procedures and their desire to have an external intervention in order to resolve the matter?  Having regard to that public statement will the Minister consider asking the Labour Court to intervene or make some other process of external intervention available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are always very helpful when the House is considering industrial disputes and they will appreciate that I do not wish to say anything that may prove unhelpful.  I have kept in touch with the strike in the last three weeks.  Certain processes that were being followed failed.  That is the end of them, as far as I see it.  The joint industrial council, as the House will be aware, effectively have the same role or powers as the Labour Court normally would have in any other area and they have not been used in this dispute.  Unfortunately, it is not open to me to instruct the chairman of the council to convene both sides; the request must come from both sides.  All I can do is appeal to both sides &mdash; there may be some difficulties in doing that &mdash; to use those procedures.  The last thing the country needs is any type of power strike.  It would be disastrous.  It seems to me that there are some grounds for discussing the dispute in the joint industrial council.  It might be easier for me to do something else but the fact is that the dispute has not escalated and there are no pickets.  The parties, in their own interests and because they have an elaborate mechanism for dealing with industrial disputes and a strong body with considerable powers, should, in the interests of good industrial relations, use the joint industrial council to try to resolve the issue.  I appeal to them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If management and the unions indicate to me that there is no role for their joint industrial council in the efforts to resolve the dispute which is entering its fourth week, I will ask the Labour Court to intervene.

There is a grave danger of a major escalation of the dispute because there is a principle involved on both sides, the right to negotiate changes in staffing and so on on the workers' side, and management's principle of the right to manage their staff.  I am sure the Minister appreciates such issues have been raised in other sectors. I should like to ask the Minister if it is possible for him to speak to each side with a view to trying to get them to go before the joint industrial council, or getting them to meet.  If that is possible will the Minister consider doing it?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say too much about that other than that I am aware of the views of both sides. However, it would be useful for the groups to use what is their own industrial mechanism, the joint industrial council. Members will agree that an organisation that has a very good structure for resolving industrial difficulties should use that procedure.  If that does not prove successful I will be happy to ask the Labour Court to intervene.  I am allowing time to elapse to allow the group of unions to use their own industrial mechanism, as I would have thought they would prefer. If they do not respond to that, or are not able to for some reason I will ask the Labour Court to intervene.  I will not do so until I get a response from the JIC.  I should like to add that nobody wishes to see another power strike, whether it <Col N="1067" /> affects the industrial or the domestic sector.  I do not think it helps the issue if people are talking about that.</P>
      <P>While there are agencies and mechanisms there they should be used.  I do not wish to take any side or to express any view about the arguments but there is an obligation on both sides to use that machinery.  I thank the Deputies for putting down the questions and I call on them to use their own mechanism, if they cannot use their own mechanism in the joint industrial council, I will then use the powers I have and ask the Labour Court to get involved tomorrow morning.</P>

Would he not agree that the failure of the existing, and indeed expensive, machinery to resolve this dispute is a matter of long term concern? Would he also not agree because of the nature of the dispute in question, which will affect literally every house, factory and productive premises in the country, that it cannot be treated as any other industrial dispute, and will he therefore have the content of this Private Notice Question and the debate that has taken place here today and his own formal public appeal to both sides made directly known to the participants without delay so that we can see some action on this matter?</P>

    <Title>Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned I was dealing with the scandal of the so-called phoenix companies and I should like to say a few more words on that topic.  I hope the situation will change and that the old headlines of companies closing down owing the employees and the State huge sums of money will no longer be common.  I hope the days when somebody could wind up a company owing money and open up in a nearby <Col N="1105" /> location in the following week or following months are ended.  I hope, too, that the days when people could wind up their companies and buy their own equipment at a knockdown price will disappear. That is covered in the section dealing with the selling off of assets.  In any of these cases the smaller trader is put out of business by such activities.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the question of income tax and the preferential credit status for the Revenue Commissioners.  I had a notice to remind myself that in relation to income tax payments this is one that is always dealt with in a hot and cold fashion by all public representatives. On one occasion we will complain about the Revenue Commissioners closing down a company and complain about the loss of jobs and in many cases individually we will make representations on behalf of companies but in the colder climate we tend to criticise the Revenue Commissioners for being owed so much money from such companies.  The real answer is for the Revenue Commissioners to be more up-to-date in dealing with such people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which enable bank accounts to be examined. This is an extension of the new type of regulations we are getting under the Department of Finance and it is welcome. It prevents people from salting away money and the State being unable to investigate it.  A key point raised during the debate was the suggestion that the Bill does not address employees interests.  I would like to point out that this is totally incorrect because it is the prime interest of every employee that the company should stay in business.  By controlling the situation and assisting a company to stay in business the employees automatically assist it.  I welcome the concern for employees but there is separate legislation in other areas which is directly employee-related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case the basic requirement is that a company stays soundly in business. To do that it needs to be profitable and it needs to be protected from the knock-on effects which result from the collapse of related or customer companies.  At the <Col N="1106" /> end of the day the best protection any employee will have is to have regulations which will prohibit the directors, owners or, indeed any others from behaving in the cavalier fashion we have seen in the past.  This will be achieved in large measure by the present Bill.  For that reason I welcome it.  It is incorrect to say there is no interest for the employee in it.  I am sure that the trade unions, and trade unionists generally, will welcome it for the same reason.</P>
    <P>Insider trading and related matters have taken on almost a soap opera-type attraction for many members of the public and they enjoy following the sequence of events.  It is a fairly new phenomenon so far as the public are concerned. What is of more relevance to us and more down to earth is the whole question of the winding up of a company which is covered in the Bill.  It is then we become aware of the knock-on effects for customers, fellow traders and, indeed, for the State where massive sums in VAT, PRSI and income tax are owed. Obviously, many of these factors are of a criminal nature, particularly where PRSI and VAT payments have been retained for trading purposes.  This is money that was collected on behalf of the State and should have been returned to the State, which is the general public.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect being covered for the first time is the use of clients money which is being disallowed. That is similar to what is contained in the Insurance Bill and it is of vital importance. In the past wheeler-dealing took place and even though people were caught doing it all they suffered was public notoriety as there was no law to deal firmly with it.</P>
    <P>The issue of shares was dealt with at length by a number of Deputies.  I would like to add my voice in asking the Minister to have a look at the law which prohibited the purchase of shares by a company from its shareholders.  This caused severe difficulties in many cases and the logical thing would be to examine it and to relax the restrictions in the interests of companies generally.  Any danger of malpractice could be covered.  I ask the <Col N="1107" /> Minister to look at it before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In summing up I could not do better than say that the Minister's final sentence, when he presented the Bill to the House, covers very accurately his thinking and his approach to business people, and that is if they trade honestly and responsibly they will have nothing to fear. On the other hand, if they abuse their position of trust there are many sanctions in the Bill which can and will be used against them.  Finally, if a company gets into difficulties, despite their own best efforts, there is a new rescue mechanism in the Bill to help them get over problems. Like all my colleagues I welcome the Bill and I hope it will improve the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Deputy in this House I heartily welcome this Bill.  I am glad to note that it got very thorough debate in the Seanad and appears to have been improved as a result because there were a great many amendments made to it and a great many views taken into account.</P>
      <P>Much of what one might like to say about the Bill might be said more appropriately on Committee Stage because it is very technical indeed.  Unfortunately the Bill is very long.  Notwithstanding that I hope it can be so arranged that, without guillotining it or anything else, it will become law within the next few months because the urgent need for many of its provisions is obvious and has been for quite some time past.  It constitutes the biggest change in purely domestic, as opposed to European-imposed company law since 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1963 Companies Act was a major one which has not altogether withstood the test of time, not through the fault of its drafters, promoters or anything else, but simply because commercial circumstances have changed enormously in the last quarter century, indeed have changed more rapidly perhaps that at any other comparable period in history.  Since his retirement comes up within the next <Col N="1108" /> week or two, I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the man who was a major instigator in producing the 1963 Companies Act, who worked on it as secretary of the committee that dealt with it for a number of years.  I refer to Mr. Joseph Holloway, now retiring as Secretary of the Department of Energy, and who has quite a monument to himself in that Act.  The then Minister whom he greatly assisted was Deputy Jack Lynch, who has been in retirement a little longer, and who would regard that Act certainly as one of the more important legislative actions of his lengthy period in this House.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will be equally important.  Indeed, as commercial circumstances are likely to change even more rapidly in the future, I hope that its amendment, once enacted, will be quicker, that perhaps in future we will not have to wait for such an enormous tome; that in the future it will be possible to amend specific aspects of company law more rapidly than has proved to be the case in more recent times.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with some aspects of the Bill only.  At the outset I should like to make a few references to Part II and to the question of investigations into companies. I note that the provisions of Part II propose to remove the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to appoint inspectors, instead to give that power to the High Court and to clarify the manner in which that power can be exercised.  That is a good thing.  I do not mean necessarily giving that power to the High Court &mdash; because I do not know that an awful lot necessarily is achieved by taking it away from the Minister &mdash; but whether an appointment be instigated by the Minister or the High Court, it is important that those inspectors appointed have adequate powers.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce I recall twice appointing inspectors to examine the affairs of companies.  I recall one was a public but not quoted company and the other a private company.  I remember that the advice given to me in the Department on each occasion was not to bother <Col N="1109" /> because it was not thought the inspectors would achieve anything.  Unfortunately, I found that that departmental advice was correct because, two or three years later when I was leaving that Department, nothing had been achieved that I could see.  The reason nothing had been achieved was that the inspectors did not appear to have had adequate powers.  For example, they could not compel certain people to attend before them to give evidence, nor could they compel the production of certain papers.  As a result they could not get to the bottom of the apparently fraudulent activities carried on by at least some of the directors of those two companies.  I thought that was very regrettable.  I felt I must have been about the only Minister for Industry and Commerce in Europe who did not have power to have a proper investigation carried out into what appeared to me and to the Department to be fraudulent activity on the part of directors.  Indeed, in one case, while I was asking the inspectors to endeavour to expedite their inquiries and so on I saw the promoter or principal of the company under investigation trading again, with limited liability, in this city as though nothing had ever happened.  I thought that very regrettable.  In the case of the other company, the principals decamped to England and further abroad with a substantial amount of the company's assets which should have gone to its creditors who, unfortunately, were left high and dry.</P>
    <P>These kinds of examples underline the difficulties encountered.  I am talking about two cases only within four years or so when a Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed inspectors.  Since the enactment of the 1963 Act I think any inspectors who were appointed have been unsuccessful in concluding their investigations in each case.  Therefore it is quite appropriate that the system be changed and, if it is necessary to give appropriate powers to such inspectors by way of the High Court, so be it.  However, I contend that the Minister should retain for himself some power of instigation of these types of inquiries or inspections because it will be important that he be <Col N="1110" /> able to react quickly to some undesirable or fraudulent practices being carried on. If you like, that is one specific part only of a general intention in this Bill to endeavour to deal with fraudulent or less than honest activities in regard to companies and, in particular, what has been described here by the Minister and others as the phoenix syndrome &mdash; of people who, not necessarily fraudulently, carry on their businesses but allow them to run down, who do not pay creditors and start up again with limited liability, often as the Minister said, in the same premises.</P>
    <P>There has been a number of such instances particularly in the case of a small minority of speculative builders.  I found it very hard to stomach, as did many unfortunate people who were caught by such activities.  I understand that there is one site in Dublin where the same builder, using a succession of three different private limited companies, built a block of houses via one company, did not pay his creditors, did not finish the estate, as he had contracted to do with the purchasers of the houses, decamped next door, built another block of 100 houses as a different company which, in legal terms, was a separate entity from the first but in fact was exactly the same person; did the same again a second time and went on to do the same for yet a third time.  Yet each time he was within the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>It is only proper that that law should be changed and I am glad that that is now being done.  However, I must say it is not easy to strike a balance.  One is outraged by cases of that kind.  Therefore, one's instinct is to push out the law fairly hard or far in order to ensure that it will not happen again.  But, if one does that without any great sensitivity, one may catch those types of people but one will also catch a whole raft of perfectly honest and honourable people who simply get into commercial difficulty through the problems of the marketplace and not through any form of dishonesty or unwillingness to meet their obligations.  Therefore, one must temper the law in a way that will strongly discourage people who act dishonestly but will not unduly penalise <Col N="1111" /> those who simply have misfortune. People who have commercial misfortune here, seem to me &mdash; apart from the law at all &mdash; to be very heavily penalised anyway by the social attitudes taken to them by contrast with commercial misfortune in other places which is not regarded as the sort of black sin often attributed to such people here through no fault of theirs.</P>
    <P>While one might have many comments to make on that aspect of the Bill on Committee Stage it has to be said that the provisions of the Bill do endeavour to fairly hold that delicate balance.  I am sure there will be refinements suggested on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will maintain an open mind in regard to them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is so long one cannot really deal with it section by section.  It is more convenient to deal with it in general terms by referring to the parts.  Part V, which deals with the whole question of insider dealing and the Stock Exchange-related aspects of company law, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The amendments made in the Seanad are also welcome in that the original proposal was to make it a civil offence where a civil debt would be recoverable, but on reflection the Minister accepted the overwhelming advice he received in the Seanad which was to the effect that it should be made a criminal offence.  It is only right that it should be made a criminal offence and that various duties be placed on various people and the stock exchange in regard to how it deals with these matters.</P>
    <P>There is one problem which the Minister will have to look at between now and Committee Stage, in the context of Part V, and that is the problem which has arisen over the past number of months, well after the introduction of this Bill, as a result of the prolonged Irish Distillers take-over saga which took a further step this morning.  It is a problem which cannot be ignored.  The 1978 Monopolies and Mergers Act which I introduced in this House deals with some aspects of that problem but that Act is now out of <Col N="1112" /> date, it is ten years old, and it was brought in in what I might call another era.  It was brought in at a time when the degree of economic cohesion in the EC was much less than it is now.  It never envisaged that what is going to happen in 1992 would happen and it regarded this country as being entirely the master of its own affairs in these matters.  Whether we like it or not that is not the case today.  In conjunction with looking at this Bill the Minister should also look at the 1978 Act to see whether separately or together they might be amended to take account of the circumstances in which we now find ourselves in so far as the dealings of quoted companies are concerned and in so far as there is a possibility of further take-overs, particularly heavily contested ones.</P>
    <P>The Irish Distillers take-over bid is only the first of, what some would say, many, but at the least several, such take-over bids we are likely to witness both before and after 1992.  There probably will be an increasing tendency to take actions of that kind.  Therefore it is necessary for us to look at any law we may make in this regard in an international and in an EC context.  Neither this Bill nor the 1978 Act enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to act in the way he might wish to.  I do not envy the Minister the position he finds himself in today in trying to decide on that particular take-over bid because to a great extent many of his functions have been pre-empted.</P>
    <P>I have no objection nor could I have to the courts exercising jurisdiction over corporate activities and affairs within Ireland.  Equally, I have no objection nor could I have to the European Community, acting through whichever institution is appropriate, exercising jurisdiction over these matters, because we as a country have ceded sovereignty in matters of this kind to it by way of public decision in a referendum.  Therefore, we have to accept that we will be bound by decisions which it will make on the basis of Community law, be it under Article 85 or Article 86 of the Rome Treaty but, and I think this is a very <Col N="1113" /> big but, the people of this country never ceded any sovereignty or jurisdiction to 30 stockbrokers sitting in the city of London to make decisions in regard to Irish industry.  We never ceded any such sovereignty and when I put through the 1978 Act in this House there was no take-over panel in Dublin, which at that time had a semi or quasi autonomous stock exchange, and to the best of my recollection there was no such panel in London either, or at least if there was such a panel it did not have the powers it now has.  As a result of whatever internal arrangements were made as between the London and Dublin stock exchanges in regard to their own business practices which is really a matter for them, we suddenly find ourselves subjected to the jurisdiction of a self-appointed body of institutional investors established in London to look after their own interests and the interests of their class.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I would imagine there would have been a major outcry in this country today, which has been averted, if the decision of that panel had been to seek to set aside the decision of the High Court of Ireland, upheld by the Supreme Court of Ireland and the roughly corresponding decision of the European Commission.  There would have been an outcry.  The fact that it has been avoided, perhaps for political reasons, should not blind us to the possibility that it could still happen in three or six months time.  I have ceded no jurisdiction and this House and no Irish Government have ceded jurisdiction or any sovereignty to them.  They have not been elected by anybody.  They were appointed, not to represent industry but simply to represent the interests of the financial institutions and financial professionals, nobody else.  They do not have the interests of small shareholders or the employees of a company at heart.  They are only secondary matters.</P>
    <P>The existence of this panel with the powers that they have has created significant uncertainty for companies wishing to continue trading and manufacturing goods.  Its existence has created great uncertainty for the <Col N="1114" /> employees of companies, small shareholders and management and it destabilises companies.  Great credit is due to Irish Distillers for not becoming destabilised during the traumatic events to which they were subjected during the past six months.  Above all else, this panel which claims jurisdiction over our commercial activities ignores the national economic importance of any particular industry.  It is not interested in the Irish whiskey industry or in what it means and how important it is to this country.  It is only interested in seeing whether the rules used in this take-over game were observed by the financial institutions and nothing else.  I do not think that this is good enough where so much is at stake.</P>
    <P>An example of what is at stake is set out in the Schedule to the 1978 Act.  All the considerations which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to take into account are listed there.  All of these can be ignored by a body which has now apparently acquired, through fortuitous means over which we seem to have had no control, the ultimate power of deciding yes or no on these commercial activities. I do not think this is acceptable. When I introduced the 1978 Act it was readily accepted on the basis that in the last resort the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have the final say in these matters.  If the decision of the panel this morning had been otherwise he would have had no say.  I do not think it would have arisen.  Even now, when he formally has the decision, is his power of discretion not enormously fettered by all that has happened?  Has he the same freedom of choice he would have had if this whole episode had not gone through so many different channels up to now?  That is something which will have to be looked at in the context of this Bill.  It is not easy to do and either this Bill, or another one that hopefully, would be introduced quickly, might update the 1978 Act to take account of what has happened.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange here have some responsibility towards this country because of what they did a year or two ago in becoming part of London without any apparent autonomy of their own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> They have an obligation to try to rectify a situation which is not tenable in this country.  I do not think I am being chauvinistic or nationalistic about it.  I think that if it were the other way round it would not be acceptable.  It would be laughed out of court if, let us say, Pernod Ricard, a French company, were trying to take over a German company in the same line of business and it was a contested take-over and they had to go to Madrid or Lisbon in order to get the permission of some group of stockbrokers and financial people there.  They would regard that as laughable but, in fact, that is what they have had to do in this country.  They have had to go with their cap in hand to London and say: &ldquo;I hope, gentlemen, we did not infringe your rules which you laid down for your benefit in your country in what we did in a totally different country that is sovereign and independent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will yield sovereignty &mdash; and I will be among the first in this House to yield it &mdash; but I yield it by decision of the Irish people.  I will not yield it because of the strange circumstances which gave rise to this unsatisfactory panel having jurisdiction over all publicly quoted Irish companies. I understand the make-up of the panel consists of 30 people and that none of them is Irish.  If an Irish case comes up, I understand that the local branch of the Stock Exchange here has negotiated some arrangement whereby one Irish person can attend the meeting of the panel having what is called &ldquo;observer status&rdquo;, whatever that is.  It certainly is not an awful lot by all accounts and I think it is quite unsatisfactory.  I do not think that situation would be tolerated anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is facing as and from today &mdash; and will have to make up his mind in presumably the next month or so &mdash; a fairly tricky situation.  It is not straightforward. I understand that as recently as this morning after the announcement from the panel in London that Grand Metropolitan went back into the market in Dublin buying Irish Distillers shares at <Col N="1116" /> 452p in order to build up their holding further.  They have about a 27 per cent holding, or perhaps more by now.  That is a very substantial holding in a public quoted company.  They are in an extremely strong position.  They can block, for example, a special resolution if it had to be passed by Irish Distillers. At the same time, they cannot get at Pernod Ricard, for two reasons: first, because Pernod Ricard is a French company and the French are much more defensive of their national interests than we are and, secondly, because Pernod Ricard is apparently a closed company anyway because about 40 per cent of the equity is held by the Ricard family or by family interests in general.</P>
    <P>One of the challenges which faces the Minister for Industry and Commerce at present with regard to this is that he will have to accept this very unusual position which has never arisen here before and he will have to try to knock heads together as between these two companies.  If he can do that successfully, it could be greatly to the national benefit to have some arrangement whereby both of these overseas companies, Grand Metropolitan and Pernod Ricard, would have an interest in Irish Distillers and would co-operate for the benefit of that industry in Ireland.  Of course, Grand Metropolitan are infinitely the larger company.  They are enormously successful in terms of their worldwide distribution and their sales methods. They have had tremendous success and, in particular, they have had success with what is probably the most successful new Irish product of all of the last ten or 15 years &mdash; Baileys Irish Cream.</P>
    <P>It seems that we might be able to have the best of both worlds if the antagonisms which have grown up over the last six months could be soothed by the Minister and if he could, as I put it, knock heads together and get these two companies to co-operate in some fashion.  Would it not be possible, for example, for some of the brands to be given to one of these companies?  It is not possible for Grand Metropolitan to acquire Pernod Ricard without the consent of the family interests concerned but, without going <Col N="1117" /> into detail, it seems that there are several ways in which a useful relationship could be worked out which would be to the benefit of the industry here, of the name of Irish whiskey, of its wider distribution throughout the world, the interests of the employees here and, hopefully, in the creation of further employment.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome &mdash; as I am sure everybody does &mdash; the provisions in Part IX of this Bill which introduce a form of the US Chapter 11 system here in respect of companies which are in difficulties but not necessarily wholly and irretrievably insolvent.  It sets up here for the first time a system whereby it may be possible, with the protection of the court, for such a company to trade out of its difficulties. That provision has been long overdue. Some time ago I believed that it might usefully have been introduced here and I greatly welcome it.</P>
    <P>One thing which is not in the Bill before us but was referred to by the Minister in his speech on Second Stage is what he calls &ldquo;the proposed Part XI of this Bill&rdquo;, which he said he will introduce on Committee Stage.  This will allow companies, both public and private, to acquire their own shares subject, as the Minister put it, to certain safeguards and conditions. I welcome that provision.  I think we are one of the few Western countries which does not have it.  However, the Minister will be aware that unless there are very definite safeguards, this provision will be open to abuse, and potentially to grave abuse.  If possible, I should like to see a draft of Part XI.  I am sure it is in circulation already, privately at least, in some quarters.  If this were brought in without the proper safeguards it could lead to disastrous consequences.  On the other hand, if the safeguards are too great it might not be possible to utilise the provision in the circumstances in which it should be utilised.  It is one of these provisions in which it is difficult to strike a balance and it will take some time.  I do not blame the Minister in any way for not rushing in with it because it is difficult to achieve it but I should like to get people who fully understand the provision to <Col N="1118" /> read a draft of Part XI to see whether that balance can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I have few reservations about the use of this device in private companies but I have much greater reservations about the abuses it is open to in public companies. In his Second Stage speech on 3 November 1988 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The new facility will be of great benefit to public companies also, where there is often a compelling case for a company to buy in shares which are, perhaps, felt to be undervalued and where the company has surplus cash available to finance the purchase.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, that is the instance, but I am sure that he must realise the potential abuse to which it is open.  He has only to cast his mind back a year to the Guinness company, to Mr. Saunders and all his friends, to see the level to which what was once almost the jewel of the Irish industrial crown has been reduced by the disreputable and dishonest activities of Mr. Saunders.  The danger about giving a public company such a right is that you may no longer have a normal market in the shares.  Mr. Saunders sought to create an abnormal market by improper means, to keep up the price of Guinness shares in order to facilitate the takeover of the distillers in Scotland.  It is only one aspect of the abuses to which this is open.  He did not necessarily do it by Guinness buying their own shares, but by variants of that. The easier and more obvious way is where the company have power to buy their own shares.  For that reason, so far as public companies are concerned there is a considerable need to have safeguards.</P>
    <P>Again, you can go too far and the type of people who have to deal with these matters should be very fully consulted before any final drafts are arrived at in respect of something of this kind.  You have to bear in mind, particularly, that in Ireland, with an extremely narrow market, a very small number, unfortunately, of public quoted companies and a declining number of the larger companies because they tend to merge and to be taken over, it is possible to have a major effect on the price of shares by the <Col N="1119" /> purchase of even quite a small quantity. You could buy as little as £25,000 worth of shares in some Irish company and have a significant effect on their price.  The price could go up 5 per cent for the expenditure of such an absolute pittance of money.  For that reason, this facility must be very carefully watched.</P>
    <P>We also have a new phenomenon on our Stock Exchange of all these companies that are not fully listed, that come under the third market, unlisted market, small company market and various other things.  Many of those are very speculative companies.  The public often do not realise just how speculative they are.  On the other hand, I can see the point of view of the Stock Exchange in wishing to have them there in order to try to widen the Irish equity market.  Particularly with them, the purchase of a few thousand shares could affect their price by 5 per cent or 10 per cent.  It is very easily open to manipulation and we will have to be very careful.  That is why Part V, to do with insider dealing, is so crucially important.</P>
    <P>It was distressing to hear the comments made about a year ago by a stockbroker who is a Member of the Oireachtas regarding insider dealings in the Dublin Stock Exchange where such activity is not a criminal offence and apparently not even a civil offence.  I am sure that that statement was not lightly made.  Those concerned will have to ensure that the law as it will be under Part V of this Bill is properly policed by them &mdash; because in the last analysis they will have to police it &mdash; and that the law is properly enforced. It is particularly necessary in the context of the proposed Part XI of the Bill which may now be brought in.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other points I would like to make if that were possible. The Bill is so enormous and deals with so many matters of great importance that one could go on about different aspects of it at great length but I do not want to do that because some of the points might be more usefully put on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will consider setting up a special committee on this <Col N="1120" /> because if it goes through a committee of the whole House it could take an inordinate length of time.  I would like to see it enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in relation to the general requirements of disclosure, particularly in so far as they affect private companies in this country, again it is difficult to achieve the appropriate balance.  The suggestion has been made to me that perhaps we have gone too far in terms of the proposed disclosure requirements by private companies.  I emphasise that I am not talking here about public companies. This is a very small country.  There is often a certain prurient curiosity about what people are doing that does not take place in larger countries.  Particularly if we want seriously to get into the financial services sector, as the Government hope to do via the Custom House Docks area and other similar proposed activities, we will have to be very careful that our law does not go beyond that of other countries, particularly within the European Community, in terms of unnecessary disclosure. We will have to be very careful, for example, that we are not just pandering to trade union interests or to prurient requirements of gossip magazines, or something of that kind.  Other countries, even where they have fairly strict rules of disclosure, also tend to have available to them offshore locations through which that type of company can operate if they so choose.  Some of the more obvious examples are that the UK have, among many other places, the Cayman Islands available to them; the Netherlands have, of course, the Netherlands Antilles.  The Belgians and French tend to use Luxembourg as an offshore location.  We have not anything specifically the same.  Again, it is a question of trying to achieve the necessary balance, of going far enough to stop those who are acting improperly but at the same time not going too far to hinder unnecessarily or improperly those who are acting honestly.  This is not easy.</P>
    <P>People complain about the slowness of company legislation and I suppose that I have so complained myself, but when you see the complexity of this Bill, the <Col N="1121" /> important matters with which it deals and the way in which it tries to uphold the balance, perhaps sometimes more successfully than others, you realise that unfortunately it is necessary to proceed a little slowly.  A commendable effort has been made in this Bill and I welcome it. In particular, I would like to see a draft of the proposed Part XI.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier in his absence, I would like the Minister to retain the open mind he had in regard to many of these matters in the Seanad and it is hoped that some further improvements can be made.  With a Bill of this kind the passage of even a few months sometimes renders some of it out of date.  That will have to be taken into account.  In the Minister's absence I gave something of a dissertation on the difficulties that are created for him by the present situation in Irish Distillers. I invited him to consider whether it is appropriate now to amend the law, given the very unusual circumstances.  I do not mean to amend the law in relation to Irish Distillers but in relation to future cases of that type, of which we will have several &mdash; I have no doubt about that.  Equally, there are other aspects of company law that may go out of date, as rapidly as in three or six months time.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has reached this House.  I wish it a speedy passage, but not so speedy that it is not fully examined. I would like to see, if possible, that examination carried out by a special committee rather than by a committee of the whole House.  For example, perhaps this could be done over the Christmas recess and then it could be reintroduced at the end of January for a speedy Report Stage, and have it passed into law by February of next year.  Everybody would welcome that and we should strive to try to achieve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed.  I have listened with interest to some of the points made by Deputy O'Malley towards the end of his speech.  I may have missed one or two others, but I will take full cognisance of them before moving on <Col N="1122" /> to the next Stage.  I wish to assure Deputy O'Malley and Members of the House that I still retain as open a mind as I had when I went to the Seanad in the first instance. Deputies will appreciate that over 200 amendments have been made to the Bill. I set out with the objective of publishing the Bill as I found it, but made it abundantly clear that I was wide open to suggestions that would make the Bill more practicable and workable.  Indeed, a number of Government amendments were introduced: there is one more to come on Committee Stage I have signalled already, that is to create a new situation where companies can buy their own shares.</P>
      <P>Indeed, there have been many and widespread contributions during the several hours of debate and Deputies will agree that the Bill has received a very good and thorough Second Stage examination. I will consider the suggestion of a special committee, we have had some discussions about it already and we will consider all the facts immediately the Second Stage is over.  I want to see the Bill passed into law as quickly as possible but I will not rush the Bill through.  I will take on board the suggestions made by Deputy O'Malley and others that company law is changing.  Indeed, new company law directives arise from the EC which we have to consider and take on board.</P>
      <P>However, one always comes to a point when one says &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  If one was arguing the other way it is quite conceivable to say that one should start again but by the time one would get this far again there would be additional changes.  There are many aspects of company law that need to be updated and there is much abuse that calls for action but I believe we have done a reasonable job and I hope we will see a workable and practicable Bill at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening statement, and as the Government have maintained since this Bill was first published, the ultimate aim is to achieve a well-balanced Bill.  I am more than happy to listen to detailed arguments or to detailed amendments that are practicable or that <Col N="1123" /> may add to the Bill when they are teased out and argued.  Deputies have spoken on many desirable things but on closer scrutiny and examination of them one finds that one may run into conflict with the Constitution.  I need do no more than point to the substantial changes we introduced in the Seanad to Part VI of the Bill relating to insider dealing and Part IX relating to the rescue of companies in difficulties.  Both of these Parts have been considerably improved by listening carefully to what has been said by Members and interested observers.  I have been forthcoming in amending the Bill accordingly.</P>
    <P>One word of caution, at the same time; we would not be interested in representations or suggestions that were clearly special pleading for some particular interest group with the intention, or indeed the effect of lessening the impact of the Bill.  However, having said that, I can assure the House that any suggestions made on Second Stage or Committee Stage will be given full consideration. I am only too happy to argue the pros and cons as we deal with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The contributions made by Deputies fall broadly into two categories &mdash; general comments on the aims and general thrust of the Bill and those of a specific nature on individual sections.  I could not really hope to deal with all of the specific points here, given the size and scope of the Bill. Indeed, many of them were points that we could tease out more satisfactorily on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the general side, Deputy Bruton made the point that Departments like the Department of Industry and Commerce, which are constantly engaged in the preparation of complex legislation should be permitted to do the drafting internally rather than relying on the parliamentary draftsman's office.  I think the Deputy was stretching the case somewhat when he suggested that provisions that would take two months using in-house expertise could take ten years by going through the channel of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Indeed the amendments we have introduced on the new sections answer that question raised by Deputy Bruton. Through pressure on the parliamentary draftsman's office we have managed to come the distance we have come.</P>
    <P>Indeed, Deputy Bruton will know from his own experience with this particular Bill that the Department spent a considerable time both preparing the initial draft and in carrying out the inevitable fine tuning which must arise with a Bill of this size and complexity.  I would not wish to let the opportunity pass without saying that the Department have had every co-operation from the parliamentary draftsman's office in the preparation of the Bill and that no avoidable delays have been incurred.</P>
    <P>I had thought I had to make a final decision as to whether we would proceed with a special committee of the House but I do not have to do that.  I can use the time to have discussions with the various interested parties as to how we will deal with the next Stage of the Bill.  I am obliged to make the announcement just before the Committee Stage is due to start.  It would be wrong to force the issue of a special committee if other parties in the House did not see the need for it. There are pros and cons for such a committee and I will be at the mercy of the House when making the decision.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to give precise answers on the 1963 Act because much of the 1963 Act was designed as a framework within which business could operate with the minimum of direct supervision or intervention by the State.  Deputy Cullen questioned how much of the 1963 Companies Act was really effective and how much of it was utilised.  The 1963 Act was complex legislation.  If one could go back in time perhaps we could have simplified the legislation, but when one is trying to amend such a complex Act as the 1963 Act which has stood the test of time inevitably one ends up with a complex Bill.  For instance, in the area of receiverships and liquidations, as mentioned by Deputy Cullen, the rights of the various parties are enshrined in the legislation and it is up to the various <Col N="1125" /> parties involved to use these provisions as they see fit.  The courts are the principal authority involved in the resolution of a dispute between the various parties to any commercial transaction or whatever. In these circumstances, it would be difficult to say how successful or well utilised the provisions of the Act have been.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Companies Registration Office plays a very big part in the operation of companies legislation. It is a reference point to which parties interested in dealing with limited companies can go to seek information regarding the companies, for example to get particulars of debts owing by a company. Deputy Mac Giolla complained about the time and cost of getting information in the Companies Registration Office, which he said acted as a deterrent.  I should point out however that there was a substantial growth in the number of new companies registered at the Companies Registration Office in recent years, and that this imposed a considerable burden on the office.  However, major strides have been made in the improvement of the facilities available, and whereas delays occurred in the past, every effort has been made to improve the service of the office.  The charges are commensurate with the cost of providing the service and are not out of line having regard to the cost of running the office.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the question of enforcement, the real value of serious penalties is, as Deputy Cullen rightly said, the deterrent effect.  It has, of course, also been said by more than one commentator on the Bill that what offenders best understand is what hits them hardest in the pocket and in this regard the monetary penalties in the Bill are set at a sufficiently high level to enable the court to impose punitive awards when this is warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputies Bruton, Ahern and Dennehy questioned whether the accumulation of the provisions of the Bill and the potential penalties will act as a disincentive to entrepreneurs.  I assure the House not only in respect of this Bill but in respect of all legislation we promote, we constantly ask ourselves that very same question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> We also ask ourselves whether the law needs to be complex and whether it could not in some way be simplified.  Unfortunately, because a limited liability company is a creature of statute, there has been a need from the beginning to create a complex system of law to govern how such companies should operate and to ensure that the law is not abused.  As each new companies Bill comes along, the law becomes progressively more complex because evidence has come to light which demonstrates its imperfections.  Having said that, I am more than conscious of the need to reduce the burden on entrepreneurs and I will do so at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>In this connection, Deputy McDowell suggested, as many others have done, that a simpler form of incorporation should be found for small businesses.  I recognise the point.  It is obvious that we place great hope in the small business sector as the economy continues to grow. The European Commission have published a proposal for a directive on what they call single member limited liability companies.  This would seek to simplify company law requirements in these areas.  There are other EC initiatives in the pipeline which would lead to a certain amount of deregulation for small and medium-sized firms.  This is evidence of the emerging realisation of the need to encourage enterprise, no matter how small.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have asked whether this Bill will drive companies off shore. Deputy John Bruton and Deputy O'Malley referred to this point and wondered whether the provision of the Bill would drive people to incorporate elsewhere, for example, in the Isle of Man.  I appreciate the point made in this regard and indeed I have been aware of the direction company law in the Isle of Man has taken in recent times, in many ways relaxing the whole code of control.  However, we do not see that particular argument as a reason why company law in this country should be so relaxed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Part XI of the Principal Act deals with companies <Col N="1127" /> incorporated outside the State establishing a place of business within that State and we are satisfied that these provisions will enable people dealing with such companies to ascertain the true nature of the company and consider whether or not they wish to do business with them.  If people go outside the State to circumvent these rules, I think it will colour the attitude of those people who previously dealt with them, to such an extent that they may, in future, discontinue the trade relationship if they find the safeguards in the present Bill would not be available to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton wondered whether, after 1992, companies will tend to establish in the State where their requirements are least onerous.  While I take the Deputy's point to a certain extent, I would also say that, as a result of EC proposals to harmonise company law throughout member states, the likely advantages which would accrue to a company moving to the country with the least onerous company law requirements will be fairly shortlived, in that many of the provisions we are talking about here will eventually be harmonised throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGiolla said that the importance of employees was not adequately recognised in the present Bill.  I should say straightaway that many of the provisions in the Bill specify the particular parties who may seek the various remedies we are providing for in the Bill. These parties almost invariably include creditors of the company concerned and, of course, the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; would usually include the employees of a company. However, to make it absolutely clear that employees are entitled to certain information, amendments were introduced in the Seanad to provide specifically for this. Thus, sections 11, 135, 146 and 156 now provide appropriate rights for employees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla also suggested that it was too easy to set up companies in the first place, and that this was being availed of by unscrupulous parties.  This comes back to the fundamental question whether it is desirable to have limited <Col N="1128" /> liability companies at all.  If we decide that they are desirable, the framework within which they operate then has to be drawn up.  In the light of the abuses which have come to light in recent years, this Bill aims at addressing the major problems which have been highlighted.  In circumstances where companies go out of business and are found to be insolvent, the directors will not be able to start again in business without meeting the minimum requirements included in section 128.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 118, which provides that a company may be required to contribute to the debts of a related company, are also relevant in regard to the Deputy's concerns in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have pointed to the fact that we will now have a number of separate, complex Companies Acts, and that it would be in everybody's interest if these were consolidated into one Act.  While I have every sympathy with this point of view, it is not a realistic option at this stage.  Not only would the resources necessary to achieve such consolidation in a short period be considerable &mdash; and we do not have them in any event &mdash; but, given the number of other proposals in the pipeline, particularly at EC level, which will impinge on the company law area, I think that the task of consolidation would be out of date before it could have been completed.  At this stage, therefore, we do not propose to go down that route.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have speculated as to the sources of inspiration for many parts of the Bill.  While the bulk of it is our own work, so to speak, I can say that we have not only drawn on the experience of the UK and other European countries, but have also cast our net as far afield as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Of course, when doing something like that, one has always to be mindful of the environment in which their legislation is framed and when applying it to Ireland, the necessary adaptations have to be made.</P>
    <P>Turning to more specific aspects of the Bill, Deputies Bruton and Cullen queried <Col N="1129" /> how effective the provisions of the investigation provisions of the 1963 Act actually are.</P>
    <P>I should say straightaway that the investigation of the affairs of a company is a very serious matter indeed under the 1963 Act.  Only two such formal investigations have been carried out to date. Unfortunately, the results yielded from the exercise in these cases were rather less than satisfactory.  This was partly due to shortcomings in the Principal Act, and indeed is one of the reasons why the powers of investigation are being transferred under this Bill to the High Court.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I do not think that the new provisions will result in an enormous number of investigations, nor do we think they should, since such an investigation is a very serious matter and, as Deputy Cullen said, could be misread by other parties, particularly creditors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also floated the idea under Part II of the Bill that an official investigator at assistant secretary level in the Department of Industry and Commerce should be appointed.  While this is something that has been considered, it is necessary to bear in mind that, in recent years, the increasing thrust of company legislation has been to lay down the framework within which business can operate and then leave it to the business community themselves to manage their own affairs within the parameters laid down by this legislative framework.  I think this is a trend which the Deputy would welcome.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the proposals regarding investigation in this Part, some Deputies suggested that they were rendered inoperative by the substantial security of £200,000 that an applicant might have to provide to begin with.  However, I must repeat that the investigation of the affairs of a company is a very serious matter, and therefore vexatious or frivolous applications must not be encouraged. With this in mind, section 7 provides only that the court may require an applicant to give security of an amount not exceeding £200,000.  I would emphasise that the discretion is absolutely and <Col N="1130" /> totally left to the courts, and in any particular case, the court may decide to seek a much lower level of security, or indeed none at all.  The availability of this discretionary power for the courts should, I think, allay the Deputies' fears in this regard.</P>
    <P>On Part III of the Bill, some Deputies wondered whether an exemption figure of £2,500 for loans to directors was the right way to tackle this problem.  Coming as we are from a situation where companies were only obliged to record loans made to directors in their annual accounts, but were not prohibited from making them <i>per se,</i> I have questioned whether it is reasonable to permit loans of any level or whether they should be prohibited outright.  Certainly, as Deputy Bruton suggests, prohibiting loans outright would simplify this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I am adamant that directors must not use their companies as their own personal bank.  At the same time, I am pragmatic enough to recognise that practical situations may arise where small loans may be necessary for directors, and this is the reason this low limit was introduced.  Remember at the same time, however, that the Minister has power under section 43 to vary the amounts in this Part, and if this is shown to be necessary, I would, of course, take the appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla thought that, as the vast majority of Irish companies are small private companies, they would be exempt from the prohibitions on the making of loans to directors in sections 31 and 32.  I should make it clear, however, that the prohibition in section 31(1) on the making of loans applies to all companies, although of course by virtue of section 32, there is an exemption limit of £2,500 on the amount of such loans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla also said it was wrong to exempt banks or the amount of money that they may advance.  In fact, section 32 (7) only exempts dealings by banks where the transaction is made in the ordinary course of the company's business, and the terms are no more favourable than it would be reasonable <Col N="1131" /> to expect the bank to have offered to an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; of the same financial standing. I think this is a reasonable exemption, given that banks are in the business of lending money anyway, provided of course that we build in sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey suggested that in trying to curb and control abuses under Part IV, a number of registers will have to be maintained and open for inspection and that this will impose a huge amount of work on smaller companies.  However, to facilitate parties dealing with companies, be they members of the company or creditors, it is necessary that they have access to certain information.</P>
    <P>The registers which companies will be obliged to keep under this part of the Bill are the minimum necessary to ensure that parties dealing with a company can obtain relevant information.  While the registers concerned are all necessary for this reason, I do take the Deputy's point about duplication in certain cases, and we will see what we can do about simplifying the requirements.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies welcomed the proposals on insider dealing, and most Deputies will be aware of my determination that this abuse should be firmly tackled.  On a point of information here, I should tell Deputy Bruton that, contrary to what he said, the provisions in the Bill do not derive from the Rules of the Stock Exchange.  At the same time, it would be surprising if there were not a &ldquo;meeting of minds&rdquo; with the Stock Exchange as to what needs to be done here and, as the House will be aware, we have now built into the Bill a substantial enforcement role for the Exchange in this respect.  While Deputy Carey expressed doubts about the self-regulatory nature of the Stock Exchange, we are confident that the Exchange authorities are as anxious as we are to have these provisions enacted, and to have them work effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned the fact that there are proposals for an EC Directive on insider trading and asked whether the <Col N="1132" /> Bill takes account of the proposed directive. As the Deputy is probably aware, the EC proposals in this regard are at a very preliminary stage, so it would be very difficult at this point to say whether our provisions would be on all fours with the EC proposals.  From what we have seen so far, however, it would seem that the provisions of the draft directive are broadly in line with those in Part V of the Bill.  Also in relation to insider dealing Deputy Ahern expressed concern that computerised dealing is not dealt with comprehensively enough in the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, rather than describe the various ways in which people can purchase shares, the approach adopted in the Bill was to define &ldquo;dealing&rdquo;, essentially, as any means of acquiring or disposing of or subscribing for securities or making offers to do so.  In other words, whether the transaction was dealt with by computer or otherwise does not matter.  In the circumstances the Deputy's concern regarding computerised dealing does not appear to be an issue.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Post Office Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  The Minister for Social Welfare may feel that some of the issues which arise in this debate are distant from him, but he will appreciate that since the passage of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act this House has no direct control over the manner in which the postal service is organised, where services are provided and under what circumstances they may be terminated or changed.  However, this House does have an obvious interest in ensuring that social welfare business which, to a large extent, is operated through the post office system, is transacted in a manner which is just to elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances under which I sought this Adjournment debate are as follows.  For 80 years there has been a post office at Clanbrassil Street in the city <Col N="1135" /> of Dublin.  It has recently come to the attention of public representatives, the community at large and the local community council of St. Kevin's Parish that An Post proposed to terminate this service. They were availing of the opportunity afforded by the fact that the sub-postmistress proposed to retire.  That casual fact was to be seized on as the pretext for closing down this post office.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not believe the whole postal service has to be preserved in aspic.  I am not suggesting that every subpost office must be preserved, nor am I suggesting that because this post office happens to be located on the border between my constituency and that of Deputy O'Brien that it assumes some special importance.  However, it is important that the Minister should know that Deputy O'Brien, Deputy Brady, Deputy Mitchell and I, as well as other public representatives and a huge cross section of the local community, were present at a meeting in Synge Street Christian Brothers School the other day. The meeting was packed to the rafters with ordinary people from the area who were inconvenienced or put out by the loss of a local post office.  There were many elderly people at that meeting for whom this change would mean a great injustice.</P>
    <P>An Post had indicated there were five subpost offices within a mile, but for an elderly lady &mdash; and there were some there who were partly immobile &mdash; such distances are a problem.  More than 100 traders had also protested that they lose a local facility which is important for trade and for bringing people into the locality. Of course, they do not concern the Minister for Social Welfare.  However, pensioners and people who get allowances from the Department of Social Welfare through such a post office would be very adversely affected if they had to travel a mile on foot &mdash; most of these people do not have cars or any other facility to travel long distances to cash their pension certificates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The Minister is one of the chief customers of An Post.  He uses An Post to deliver the service to old age pensioners. He has a very legitimate and real concern where subpost offices are to be closed that this service is maintained. When An Post propose to close a post office, especially in an urban area, it is important for them to consult the Department to see whether the Minister, who has a duty to the public, is in a position to see whether it is a reasonable closure. In this case it does not seem to be a reasonable closure.  What is much worse is that nobody from An Post came to explain the matter to the community, nobody was present at the meeting and we have since heard that Deputy Mooney circulated a notice in the area saying that as a result of the intervention by the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, a decision had been made to postpone indefinitely the closure of this sub-post office.  I have doubts as to whether the Minister has the power to intervene in relation to individual sub-post offices &mdash; perhaps it is substantially true &mdash; but the fact remains that, for many people, a very important local facility is under threat and access to the Department of Social Welfare is substantially worsened and made more difficult by decisions of this kind.</P>
    <P>An entire community was united on this issue even though it is under very serious stress.  The inner city areas of Dublin contain many elderly people, there is a high degree of crime and to travel a mile with your pension and perhaps your Christmas bonus in your handbag or wallet at the age of 75 or 80 is a hazardous enterprise, especially when these post offices are watched and beset by young people on occasions bent on robbery and mugging of those people. The south and north inner city areas are in crisis and withdrawal of services of this kind, making it more difficult to get social welfare entitlements, are the very things that lead to creating a concrete desert and abandonment of those areas.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his <Col N="1137" /> undoubted political and correct clout with An Post to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to closures of this kind.  The system of social welfare in which the Minister is involved in supervising and which delivers redistribution to the deprived and weaker sections in the community should not be the subject of arbitrary decisions based on the fact that a person will or will not retire.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to assure the House that he will get in touch with An Post and put as much pressure as he can on them to ensure that these services continue to be available to the elderly in circumstances where it is not a huge hardship on them to get their entitlements, that is, reasonable access to the minimal pension the State can afford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McDowell for sharing his time with me.  This is a very important debate because it highlights the whole question of the payment of social welfare benefits, particularly old age pensions, in post offices.  Many post offices are totally inadequate to deal with the present day social welfare society and for An Post to arbitrarily withdraw a service from a very busy community containing many elderly people is not acceptable. The plan of An Post seems to be that if a post mistress resigns, they will close the post office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another post office in my constituency, Greenlea Road, Terenure, where the very same thing happened. There is also an elderly population drawing pensions in the area and, without consultation or debate, these people in their well heated offices took the decision to close it.  Today we heard that the decision to close the post office in Clanbrassil Street has been deferred.  What kind of management is this?  If that is the way An Post run their business it speaks volumes for the argument against monopolies. However, the fact that An Post are a monopoly means that they have an obligation to provide a proper service.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that this kind of activity will not <Col N="1138" /> be tolerated by his Department.  They simply cannot close offices, willy nilly, without consultation.  In this case, the Department have an obligation to intervene.</P>
    <P>An Post would run a very efficient bureaucracy if they did not have any customers, who seem to be in the way and preventing them from doing a good job. If they were running a private business their customers would come first but that certainly is not the case.  A representative did not even bother to attend the residents' meeting the other night.  Only yesterday afternoon, I spoke to a senior official in the post office who did not know that the decision had been postponed indefinitely.  I thought when semi-State bodies were set up it removed day to day intervention by a Minister but that does not seem to be the case.  Perhaps it is important for Ministers to intervene and to exert pressure but it should be one way or the other.  The system should also be looked at to see if there is a better way of paying our social welfare.  There are plenty of banks and building societies all over the place and perhaps they could be used in the social welfare area.  An Post must be told that if they treat people like this, the business will be removed from them.  I know that the Minister is concerned for the elderly and they are the prime consideration in this matter.  The heavy hand should be used on them to say &ldquo;this far and no further&rdquo;.  Indeed, An Post should be compelled to improve post offices so that they are reasonably comfortable for their customers.  In a post office in Crumlin, people have to queue on the road to collect their pensions and other social welfare payments.  Is that good enough in this day and age?  Anything seems to be good enough for the poor.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department should look at all these matters and ensure that these people are treated as humanely as obviously, An Post have thrown in the towel and are not terribly concerned about their customers, a fact which I very much regret.</P>
    <Col N="1139" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien pinpointed many of the problems in relation to An Post.  He said that semi-State bodies are set up and are not to be interfered with by Ministers.  They are told to be efficient and to get on with the job and this is where the conflict arises when we are dealing with something which has such social concerns as this question obviously has.</P>
      <P>There is a large number of pensioners, invalidity pensioners and widows attending this centre.  An Post are concerned with the overall programme of rationalisation. As the Deputies may be aware, at this stage An Post are reviewing the question of closing Clanbrassil Street post office and have deferred a decision on this matter.  The question of the opening or closing of a post office is a matter for An Post.  We appreciate the difficulties they have but we express our concern in the matter.  We are particularly concerned that there will be an alternative post office available within a reasonable distance.  That is normally the problem that arises if An Post make a hardline decision to close.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that social welfare claimants receive a fast, efficient and modern service.  Considerable progress is being made to ensure that claimants will have an integrated service at local level with access to information on all their social welfare entitlements.  In terms of making payment to clients, I would like, naturally, to see also as many paying outlets as possible, preferably in local community and neighbourhood centres. I must point out, however, that the decision as to the closure of post offices is an internal matter for An Post.  My concern is to ensure that before arriving at such a decision adequate alternative arrangements are available for social welfare clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post, as a commercial State-sponsored body, are concerned with competitiveness. The Fifth Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-sponsored <Col N="1140" /> Bodies in their second report pointed out the advantages which exist in relation to the size of the post office network, in the case for example of the agency work undertaken for my Department. However, the report also points to the fact that the geographical distribution and physical condition of much of its stock of fixed assets moderates the advantages derived from the overall size and geographical spread of that stock.  The report found that there are now too many post offices with too small a customer base and, the report indicates, there have, conversely, been shortages of building accommodation in certain areas. Prior to the establishment of An Post, investment in the telecommunications service had tended to be given priority over investment in the postal service.  All of this now means that An Post are faced with high levels of cost in maintaining a competitive, modern and efficient organisation.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Post re-examine the viability of post offices when they become vacant, for example, in the event of the death or retirement of a postmaster or postmistress.  They assess the matter from a number of viewpoints but their decision is, ultimately, based on commercial considerations.  My concern is to ensure that in arriving at such a decision, An Post are not causing inconvenience for any of the social welfare clients who rely on the particular post office as their office of payment.</P>
    <P>An Post, having conducted an internal review of a particular post office, notify my Department in advance of the proposed closure of a post office.  All the alternative post offices are listed and consideration is given by An Post to the proximity of these post offices to the one about to close.  Many of the social welfare claimants involved are elderly pensioners and an assessment of the new arrangements is made, taking into account that old age and invalidity pensioners have access to free travel.</P>
    <P>Social welfare claimants are always <Col N="1141" /> offered a choice in nominating their post office of payment &mdash; the options available will, obviously, depend on where they are living.  In rural areas, the choice of post office of payment is likely to be fairly restricted.  I am assured, however, that An Post are very conscious of the importance of sub-post offices in rural areas and do not wish to close them without good reason.</P>
    <P>In the case of urban areas, there is usually a considerable number of options available to social welfare clients.  Thus, for example, in the case of the post office cited by the Deputy &mdash; Clanbrassil Street in Dublin 8 &mdash; An Post have pointed out that there are five other post offices which are located within a radius of half a mile or so from that particular post office. These post offices are: Upper Kevin Street, Harcourt Road, which is actually in Richmond Street, Camden Street, Harolds Cross and Dolphins Barn.  I should say, again, at this stage that I have been informed of An Post's intention of deferring the closure of Clanbrassil Street Post Office pending further review.</P>
    <P>In all cases where the Department is notified that a post office is about to close, we write to the pensioners and recipients of other social welfare payments who have been receiving their payments at that post office, asking them to nominate an alternative post office for receipt of payment.  in the case of Clanbrassil Street, it is not intended to make any alternative arrangements for making social welfare payments until An Post inform us of the outcome of the review currently in progress.</P>
    <P>The network of post offices forms an important part of the payment structure in place for social welfare claimants and naturally I am concerned to ensure that all claimants have convenient and easy to use methods for cashing their entitlements. For this reason I am also actively pursuing ways of introducing as wide a degree of flexibility as I can into the various payment methods that the Department use at <Col N="1142" /> the moment.  A large variety of payment methods are used, such as payments in cash, by cheques, by postal draft or by books of paying orders cashable at named post offices.  With the introduction of computerised facilities in many areas of the Department, it will be possible to develop more modern payment methods for social welfare claimants.  Direct transfer of payments by electronic means into bank or post-office savings accounts are possibilities which are being planned for.</P>
    <P>In that regard we have carried out reviews of people's attitudes to these kinds of changes.  Unfortunately, the elderly are very reluctant to change to new systems and that can be one of the difficulties that arises.  Whereas younger people will agree to an alternative system which may be much more convenient for them, elderly people are very reluctant to do so and the surveys which have been carried out show that.  This development is, however, some way down the road yet but is one which we have under active consideration.  A solution of this kind would clearly meet some of the difficulties being experienced by claimants who may consider that they have too far to travel to their nearest local post office.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, An Post are aware of our concern on behalf of social welfare claimants but the question of the opening or closing of post offices is a matter within their own competence. I will, of course, keep the matter under review and will raise it with them as the occasion requires.  I would like to assure Deputies McDowell and O'Brien that I am very concerned about this matter. There are some areas where there are very few claimants and it is somewhat understandable that it is difficult to keep a post office open in these areas.  The Deputies are right in indicating that there is a large number of claimants in the case of Clanbrassil Street.  The Deputies can rest assured that I will convey their concern, after this evening's session in the House, to An Post.  The matter has been deferred for the moment and in this particular <Col N="1143" /> case it may be deferred for quite a long time.</P>

      <P>At this stage, the EC Commission has merely made a proposal to the Council of Ministers in regard to the level of access for New Zealand butter to the UK market in each of the next four years.  The Council has not yet taken any decision on the proposal.  In my approach to this whole question, I will, of course, be taking into account the restriction which has been placed on milk output by the Community's milk quota system.</P>
      <P>This issue is complicated by the fact that at political level commitments have been made in the past regarding continued access for New Zealand butter. The most notable of these was at the European Council meeting held in Dublin in March 1975 which made more specific the commitments originally included in Protocol 18 of the Act of Accession.</P>
      <P>In the discussions to date in the Council of Ministers on the recent proposals, I have made it clear that, in the light of current circumstances on the community and world dairy markets, the package proposed is over-generous to New Zealand. I am seeking a solution which is considerably better balanced.</P>

      <P>Sheep headage grants in respect of ten hoggets were not paid to the person named because the hoggets were inspected and adjudged as being of unsuitable quality both by the Department's inspecting officer on 7 April 1988 and, on appeal, by a senior officer on 3 May 1988.  As these officers are very experienced and inspect thousands of flocks each year and as the flockowner himself has admitted that some hoggets were small, I regret that the decision to reject ten hoggets must stand.</P>
      <P>Headage payments of £323 for the remaining 34 hoggets issued to the flockowner on 4 November 1988.  The 1987 ewe premium of £1,619.33 on 83 ewes issued to the flockowner in two instalments in December 1987 and July 1988.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report on &ldquo;Consumers and the Common Agricultural Policy&rdquo; (CAP) prepared by the National Consumer Council in the UK. The report quotes the results of three independent studies.  The estimate of the overall cost of the CAP to consumers according to these studies varied from £66 (sterling) per person per annum to £9.28 (sterling) a week for a family of four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No comparable comprehensive report is available for this country.  However <Col N="1074" /> experience in the Community as a whole has been that increases in food prices have remained below the general level of inflation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the ongoing changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  Following the February European Council, stabilisation mechanisms are now in place in nearly all CAP sectors. Stabilisers operate by limiting the full level of support to quantities of production more in line with market needs, with cuts in support if those quantities are exceeded.  The European Council also agreed a legally binding ceiling on FEOGA guarantee expenditure and its growth.  This will result, according to current estimates, in a reduction from 64 per cent in 1987 to 56 per cent in 1992 in the FEOGA guarantee expenditure as a proportion of total EC expenditure.  In addition, the Council are also introducing a range of schemes such as set-aside which will help to remedy overproduction in sectors where it is taking place.</P>
    <P>It is my aim to ensure that necessary changes in the CAP to restore market balance in the long-term interests of both producers and consumers are accompanied by measures to safeguard incomes in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under both bilateral arrangements with individual countries and multilateral arrangements within GATT, food products enter the Community from many third countries.  In turn, under these same agreements the Community gains access for its exports to those countries.</P>
      <P>Apart from a minor adjustment of the high quality beef import arrangements, there have been no recent changes at EC level which would alter the pattern of this trade.  A number of the arrangements are, however, due for renewal and are under discussion at Community level.</P>
      <P>Proposals in relation to access for New Zealand butter have been submitted to the Council of Ministers by the EC Commission but no decision has been taken by the Council on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the adaptation of voluntary restraint agreements in the sheepmeat sector with third countries are <Col N="1077" /> underway and I expect that proposals in relation to these will be submitted to the Council of Ministers in due course.  These negotiations are aimed at getting the countries concerned who have unlimited access rights to the Community to agree to limit their supplies in return for tariff concessions.</P>
    <P>The Council will also be considering shortly proposals in regard to imports of manufacturing beef and young animals for which under GATT commitments annual quantities must be fixed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that negotiations aimed at liberalising trade are taking place under the Uruguay Round of the GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations. In the negotiations the Community has insisted on (a) credit for the reform measures it has already taken and (b) other trading partners undertaking equivalent measures.  At a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 14-15 November this approach was confirmed as was insistence on any further liberalisation of trade taking place on the basis of mutual advantage.</P>
    <P>The various concessionary imports do, of course, have some effect on Community markets and where possible Ireland has always tried to have the quantities reduced.  Our room for manoeuvre on this is, however, restricted by the fact that most of the imports take place under GATT commitments.  The effect on the market is in any event limited, as the amounts involved are generally small in relation to Community consumption levels.  The point must also be borne in mind that Community member states &mdash; and Ireland in particular &mdash; have a major interest in exporting to international markets and that it is impossible to maintain an unlimited right to export while totally excluding other countries from access to our markets.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the dispute with the US in which they are threatening to impose penal import duties on a number of Community products if the EC Directive to ban imports of hormone-treated meat is implemented from 1 January 1989.  The products targeted include boneless beef, cooked pigmeat products and certain alcoholic drinks but our exporters will not be unduly affected as we have little trade with the US in the items mentioned.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, in consultation with the Council of Ministers, is negotiating with the United States, on behalf of the Community, in this matter. Talks are still continuing and it is hoped that the dispute can be equitably resolved.  The Community position is that imports from third countries should not be accorded more favourable treatment than that applying to Community producers.</P>

      <P>The availability and use of hormones is strictly controlled under regulations which I have introduced to give effect to the EC ban on these substances. The regulations which, <i>inter alia,</i> prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and possession of the prohibited hormones, and the use of such hormones in farm animals are being vigorously enforced.</P>
      <P>My Department has adopted a variety of measures to ensure compliance with the regulations.  These include on-farm sampling, sampling at abattoirs and regular checks on all veterinary medicines sale outlets.  Authorised officers are provided with extensive powers of entry to land and premises to carry out necessary inspections and for seizure of evidence. The regulations provide for the locking up of suspect herds during investigations, for the special marking of animals found to be implanted and for the slaughter of hormone treated animals either with the owner's consent or by order of the District Court.  Meat from such animals is excluded from the food chain.  Severe penalties are provided for in the regulations including the possibility of a custodial sentence and forfeiture of illegally held drugs for destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined that these regulations will continue to be strenuously enforced in order to protect consumers and the reputation and acceptability of our products abroad.  We are the largest meat exporter in Europe.

      <P>A five-year develpment strategy (1988-1992) for the food industry <Col N="1081" /> has been drawn up jointly by my Department and the IDA.  Several major projects have already been approved for grants by IDA within that programme and I am confident that these will lead to extra jobs over the next few years.  In addition substantial funds are being channelled to the food industry from FEOGA under Regulation 355 on the processing and marketing of agricultural products. Following the decision of the European Council earlier this year to double the Structural Funds generous assistance for the industry from that source will continue to be available in the future.  The food industry is of course, also experiencing what industry in general has been experiencing in recent times, namely, a need for increased capital investment, higher levels of technology and a growing trend of contracting out services not directly related to core business.  While these trends affect the rate at which extra jobs are generated, it is clearly essential for our food industry to be ready to adapt to modern standards in order to be internationally competitive.  The industry has already demonstrated the necessary capacity to prepare itself to meet the challenge of the Single European Market, and with the help of the financial support that is available to it I am confident that the job creation targets envisaged for the industry in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>If all farmers were paid headage grants under the Disadvantaged Areas Schemes regardless of their off-farm income, it would cost the Irish Exchequer a net £5 million extra per <Col N="1082" /> year.  Raising the limit to £10,000, as suggested by the Deputy, would cost the Exchequer a net £4 million per year.  The only way of increasing the limit without extra cost to the Exchequer would be to reduce payments to those farmers already in the Disadvantaged Areas Schemes so as to finance the extra payments to those who are now excluded.  It does not seem very fair to me that the payments made to those with no off-farm incomes or with very low off-farm incomes should be reduced in order to make it possible to extend payments to those with higher off-farm incomes.  For this reason I do not propose increasing the off-farm income limit at present.</P>
      <P>As regards the connection between the off-farm income and an increase in the national herd, no doubt the Deputy is aware that this year for the first time ever I introduced payments on beef cows in dairy herds in our disadvantaged areas in order to alleviate the effects of the milk super levy and encourage the retention of cows that would otherwise be slaughtered. This was a measure taken to increase the national cow herd but the extra payments involved had to be financed by savings rather than by an increased call on the Exchequer.  Among the savings effected this year was the reduction in the off-farm income limit from £6,400 in 1986 to £5,200 in 1987. In my judgment these savings were well worthwhile in order to secure the new payments on beef cows in dairy herds.</P>

As a result of these revised staffing levels a number of officers of Customs and Excise have become redundant in their present stations.

      <P>The level of recorded crime in the Rowlagh and Neilstown areas has not increased in the first ten months of this year in comparison with the corresponding period last year.</P>
      <P>The local Garda officers meet regularly with representatives of local residents and discuss with them possible ways by which the policing of these areas from Ronanstown station can be improved.  The current Garda strength at Ronanstown station is considered to be adequate to meet the present police needs of the sub-district.  The allocation of local manpower to foot patrolling duties can vary from time to time depending on the availability of manpower, commitments to other duties, etc. but foot patrolling is supplemented by mobile patrols operating from Ronanstown station and by mobile units based at Clondalkin station.  Mobile units from the district headquarters at Ballyfermot are also available to respond to calls for urgent Garda assistance from the Rowlagh and Neilstown area and every effort is made to provide such assistance in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>Action has already been taken on a number of fronts to help producers with brucellosis in their herds, with their quota problems.  A national reserve of 7 million gallons was set up by the Government in 1984 in order to reallocate additional quotas to producers whose deliveries in the base year 1983 were affected by animal diseases such as brucellosis or certain other exceptional factors.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have provided that the priority categories of farmers to be covered in the arrangements for the restructuring scheme, the temporary leasing scheme and the distribution of flexi-milk, include producers affected by brucellosis in their herds in the years 1978-1983. I consider that these are the best arrangements I can make for this category of producers within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations.</P>
      <P>Furthermore there is at present a package of proposals before the Council of Ministers to extend the special categories of producers, set out in the Community regulations, to include certain farmers who participated in the non-marketing schemes.  These proposals will cover some producers who joined the schemes as a result of animal disease, including brucellosis, in their herds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations on behalf of the person referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy must appreciate, I have to ensure, as the Minister responsible for fishing matters, that there is fair and equitable distribution of the quotas, including those for herring, among the Irish fishing fleet and it is not possible, within this policy to give special accommodation for particular individuals.  Management regimes incorporating, <i>inter alia,</i> boat quotas, have been introduced for a number of stocks, including herring, following consultation with the various sectors involved in the fishing industry. These are designed to secure the livelihood of the generality of fishermen, and to conserve stocks, and achieve reasonable equity.</P>
      <P>The herring stocks are under pressure given the large number of boats participating in the fishery.  As stated, management of the fishery is carried out by agreement with the fishing industry here and there can be no question of individual quota arrangements which are to the detriment of other fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such circumstances it is not possible to increase the allocation to particular individuals without reducing the fishing possibilities for others as a consequence. I should point out however that the individual in question, like many others, is <Col N="1099" /> not solely dependent on herring and may fish for a number of other species.</P>
