      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that I am persisting today because the next and last day on which this matter can be legally raised is the day on which President Mitterrand will be here and I do not propose to disrupt the business of the House.  Therefore, I am really at your mercy in relation to this matter.  This is, in fact, the last day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I will do that but I would suggest that between now and 10.50 a.m. this House will have to take a decision finally on this matter.  When I propose to move the motion in my name and that of the remainder of my colleagues in the Labour Party I want to be in order unlike the position that attained yesterday when you deemed I was not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, might I seek clarification from you, Sir, on a very simple matter to avoid further acrimony in relation to the Order of Business, as has been listed?  Everybody in this House wants RTE to cover the very important visit of His Excellency, President Francois Mitterrand, to this House. But are you not putting it to us that, if we agree to that, we have to agree to this entire package of succeeding listed items as well?  It seems quite unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I conclude therefore that, when those three separate items &mdash; which alter the normal Order of Business &mdash; have been agreed by this House, as presumably they will, an attempt to raise any other matter by way of motion would be deemed to be out of order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I will accept your ruling on this matter but, if that is the case, we are engaged in some kind of democratic farce because the suggestion that this House can annul within seven sitting days the establishment of this unit is really a piece of democratic nonsense.

      <P>I have, yes.  There are questions down to me which will be taken next Tuesday and I propose to make a fairly substantial statement in reply to those questions.  The factors which influence me in that are, first of all, there is a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference today in Dublin and I would like to wait until that has concluded before making a statement to the House because there may be up-to-date information that I can give, and, furthermore, other developments are expected today in regard to the matter.</P>

      <P>I want to raise with the Taoiseach the question of An Bord Glas.  Last year it was launched in a blaze of publicity and it was indicated that legislation would be introduced in connection with it.  An interim board was set up. Apparently the main requirement for the board members was cumann membership.  Nothing has happened since. Has the Minister accepted the logic whereby the functions of the board should be integrated with those of the new body or does he intend going ahead with legislation?  If so, when?</P>

      <P>We certainly intend to go ahead with legislation.  If the Deputy looked at it reasonably and dispassionately he would agree with the procedure we are following.  Pending the legislation, we have an interim board in place which is doing excellent work and it is on the basis of the experience of the working of that interim board that we can bring forward adequate and suitable legislation.  It will almost certainly be introduced next session.</P>

Do I take it there will be an opportunity next week to discuss matters which are being dealt with by the Anglo-Irish Conference today and issues related to present tensions and difficulties?  Will there be a series of statements which will afford the House an opportunity of expressing its concern at the trend of events?</P>

Having regard to the comments the Taoiseach has made about other legislation which it is hoped to have published and completed, it seems probable that it is not the Government's intention to take Committee Stage of this Bill during this session.  If that is the case, will he again consider the <Col N="782" /> possibility of setting up a special committee of the House to discuss this nonpolitical matter?  It is essentially a technical matter.  It has been going on for three or four years and there are severe difficulties in terms of interpretation between different local authorities in the application of by-laws.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment to consider setting up a select committee.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I can say we would agree to a voting procedure which would in no way embarrass the Government of the day. That is not our intent.  I know it is a worry in relation to committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 (Amendment Order) Order, 1988,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 27th January 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this order is to rectify an anomaly in the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  As the Dáil will be aware, the main purpose of the 1984 Act was to implement an EC Directive designed to preserve certain statutory and other contractual entitlements of employees which are unpaid because their employers have become legally insolvent.  The Act enables these existing entitlements to be paid from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund. <Col N="785" /> It does not confer any new or additional benefits on employees.</P>
    <P>The anomaly which the order is intended to rectify arises from the provisions of section 3 of the Act which limits payments from the fund to employees who are employed in employment which is &ldquo;insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984&rdquo;. Administration of the Act has identified one small category who were excluded from benefit because they are not fully insurable under the Social Welfare Acts solely on age grounds.</P>
    <P>These are persons over the age of 66 years who because they are not fully insurable are excluded from the protection of the Act.  The exclusion means that over 66s are deprived of access to the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund even for payment of basic benefits directly related to their employment which are not dependent in any way on insurable status.  This was not adverted to at the time the legislation was drafted and the order now before the House is designed to enable them to benefit.</P>
    <P>As with the original 1984 Act, the order will not confer any new entitlements on the beneficiaries.  It will merely have the effect of ensuring that they receive existing unpaid entitlements not themselves related to or dependent on insurable status from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  These entitlements are as follows: wages, holiday pay, sick pay, award under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, entitlements under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, entitlements under the Employment Equality Act, statutory minimum wages under the Employment Regulation Order, court awards for wrongful dismissal at common law, and unpaid pension contributions</P>
    <P>The persons covered by the order are persons who would normally have been long-standing contributors to social insurance during a life-time of work and it is fair and reasonable that they should not be deprived of basic benefits under the Act solely on age grounds.  The proposed order will have retrospective effect <Col N="786" /> to insolvencies of employers which occurred on or after 22 October 1983, which is the effective date of application of the Act.  This will enable my Department to make appropriate payments in those cases which have come to notice since the Act came into force.</P>
    <P>The change which I am proposing, though of real benefit to the individuals concerned, will affect only a small number of persons because of the two conditions which require to be fulfilled. First, it will be limited to employees over the age of 66 years, that is, past normal retiring age and, secondly, the person concerned will have to have been in employment where the employer has become insolvent.  The costs of the extension will be minimal in relation to the total assets of and payments from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.</P>
    <P>The extension of the scope of the Act envisaged in the order is among the specific measures agreed with the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and I am sure that this House also will agree that it is a desirable measure.  Accordingly, I commend the order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Losing one's employment in any circumstance is a traumatic experience and that is exacerbated if at the time of losing one's employment one finds oneself denied even the minimal entitlements which one had a certain expectation of obtaining under arrears of wages, sick pay, holidays, and so on.  For those reasons the previous Government brought before the House the Insolvency Bill to ensure that people who, through no fault of their own, found themselves caught up in an insolvency situation when their place of employment closed down would receive basic entitlements.  The Insolvency Act was designed to give effect to the European Community Insolvency Directive. It is fair to say that, when the measure was being prepared and, indeed, when it was going through this House and the other House, no one adverted to the fact <Col N="787" /> that persons over 66 might find themselves excluded because of the test of full insurability.  The Minister has moved promptly and wisely in deciding to rectify this anomaly and we are happy to support it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could take advantage of the fact that this is before the House to put some questions to the Minister on the operation of the fund.  He may be in a position to deal with them when he replies or, alternatively, he could come back to me on them later.  Can he tell us what is the state of health of the fund at present?  At what level are claims running under the insolvency measure?  He will recall that when the measure was brought before the Dáil people were uncertain of what the level of claims was likely to be. They were uncertain as well as to where those claims were likely to fall most heavily.  Would the claims arise most frequently in regard to arrears of wages? There was a belief that that was unlikely to be the case because people, by and large, cannot survive without wages for very long and it was unlikely that arrears would have been allowed to accumulate. There was an expectation that the claims would fall more heavily on minimum notice claims, holidays, and so on.  Has the Minister any figures for the volume of claims and the size of individual claims?  I ask that because, depending on the answers, we will be in a position to form a view about the adequacy of the fund and what we can do with that fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the case that the fund is in such a healthy state that it would be possible to think in terms of extending cover under the insolvency legislation.  At the time the insolvency legislation was going through the House there was a widespread desire that moneys from the fund should be available to people working less than 18 hours per week.  That was felt not to be feasible at the time and there was a belief that it would open up unquantifiable claims and unquantifiable costs, the effect of which would be to require a very substantial increase in PRSI contributions.  With the benefit of some years experience of the measure we should be <Col N="788" /> in a better position to know just what the level of claims is and what are the drains on the funds.  When we know what the drains on the fund are we will be in a position to determine how far we can stretch the fund.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House because what is involved is essentially a technical measure and it is one which we are happy to support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the introduction of this order which sets out to correct an anomaly which has arisen over the past few years since the introduction of this Act.  It was obviously framed with the idea that it would affect those who normally were working and assumed that those over 66 would not be availing of the provisions of the Act.  A small number of people are now in a position where their entitlements are being denied to them.  I support the move by the Minister to rectify this situation, thus ensuring that that small number are not treated unfairly and unjustly as a result of some bureaucratic or mistaken assumption at the time the Act was passed.</P>
      <P>I note that the order will have retrospective effect to the date of the application of the Act.  When replying, perhaps the Minister would indicate how many people that will affect.  I am sure the Department have some information on that.  The Minister said it was limited to employees over 66 who have been in employment in the firm which has become insolvent.  It must be fairly restricted but I would be interested in knowing what numbers are involved.  I do not wish to dwell on the matter and I am happy to support this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I, too, welcome this order which clears up some of the anomalies which have existed since the passing of the Act.  My only regret is that the Minister did not go further and try to clear up some of the other anomalies which still remain.  I refer specifically to the position of preferential creditors when a company <Col N="789" /> becomes insolvent.  Former employees of various firms have encountered problems as a result of delays in having the affairs of a company tidied up.  In Carrigaline, an area with which I am sure the Minister is very familiar, it has taken a number of years to dispose of the property of a pottery business and, as a result, payments have still not been made three or four years after the closure of the firm.  I feel the Minister has lost an opportunity but he will no doubt at a later stage have an opportunity to give further consideration to some of the problems which people who have become redundant have encountered.</P>
      <P>The order will apply only to persons over the age of 66 years of age and, secondly, before payment can be made a person would have to have been in employment in the company when it became insolvent.  It has become commonplace in recent years for a firm in decline to let off workers and a person who may have worked in a firm for 30 or 40 years may have been made redundant prior to actual date of closure.  This order does not take such people into consideration.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to this matter.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency which has a lot of experience with redundancy.  What has been happening is that firms when going into decline have let people go and at the time of closure many people who served the company loyally down through the years were not entitled to full entitlements.  This order does not take such people into consideration.</P>
      <P>By and large, I welcome this order and the intention of the Minister to rectify an injustice which exists.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the amendment to the regulations.  This is an oversight which I certainly was not aware of at the time the measure was going through the House and the Minister is to be congratulated in making this order retrospective to 1983.  In relation to that, can the Minister tell us what procedure he and his Department will be using to follow up those who may have <Col N="790" /> been refused at that time or who may not have applied at that time because of the advice they received from Deputies who were aware of the law and who were thereby denied the benefit of the Act?  A small number of those who may have been caught in this position may have died since 1983.  Can the Minister tell us whether the next of kin will have any rights to the moneys which should have come to them at the time they were made redundant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Minister for introducing this amendment to the Act this morning.  It is a civilised and humanitarian gesture and all reasonableminded people would have to support this measure.  It is also a good indication that the Minister is responding to the officers of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and his own civil servants who have recognised that this anomaly exists.  As Deputy De Rossa has said, this is a measure which everybody should support and approve.  It is only right that the people the Minister has described, those over the age of 66, should not suffer from a firm going into liquidation.  It is a traumatic experience to lose your job at any age, particularly for someone who has given long and loyal service to a company.  People should not be penalised or punished in this way.  It is only right that we in this House should take them into account.</P>
      <P>I have as much experience as anybody in representing workers before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and workers who have lost their jobs when a company went into voluntary liquidation. Deputy De Rossa asked a good question as to how many people found themselves in the position outlined by the Minister since 1983.  I think the Minister's Department should contact them and their families in order to bring this amendment to their notice.  That would be a natural follow-on from voting this measure through this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is often exploited by unscrupulous and ruthless employers. Recently I found this to be so in a few notorious and spectacular cases of abuse <Col N="791" /> in Limerick in that companies closed down and one month later they opened up again as new firms &mdash; what a well known magazine in this country calls the Lazarus league.  Those people have used public money to enrich themselves.  They have gone out of business and the public purse picked up the tab in terms of money not paid, wages, holiday pay, wages due because of minimum notice, redundancy payments and other expenses.  Some of these people are very wealthy and they just stepped aside and left the taxpayer pick up the tab.  I have seen many cases of extremely wealthy and affluent people exploiting the law in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister might take a look at that on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Sometimes an anomaly exists at the other end of the scale also.  It is not as serious as the one which the Minister has pointed out today but sometimes people do start work at 15 years of age and because you cannot be insured until you are 16 years of age they are not covered by the insurable Act.  If a company goes out of business a worker who is under 16 years of age would also lose his or her entitlements.  Admittedly, these amount to only a tiny proportion of the workforce because nowadays people go to work at 16 years of age rather than at 15 years of age but in a number of cases people have lost their entitlements in the case of liquidation because they had not attained the age of 16.  Perhaps the Minister would also look at that aspect of the problem. The anomaly which the Minister has pointed out today is a far more serious one and far more people are involved but perhaps he may address himself to that minor anomaly and clear it up to some later stage.  By and large this is a very good measure and I fully support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make two points on this order moved by the Minister this morning.  The first point is a general one.  It is welcome that when the law is being changed in this way by a ministerial order the matter comes before the House for discussion so that Members who wish to contribute and make a comment <Col N="792" /> on it may do so and those who are against it if they are minded to do so &mdash; which does not apply on this order &mdash; have the opportunity to say so.  That is the very welcome situation we find ourselves in this morning, where the Minister has proposed what is, in effect, an amendment to the Act and we are discussing here in the House a matter of importance to a very small number of people.</P>
      <P>Earlier this morning, a Cheann Comhairle, as you will recall we found ourselves, if I may say so, on a much more important matter of much more general application concerning An Foras Forbartha.  I am not going to go into the merits of that case.  I just want to draw a comparison between that occasion and the situation we now find ourselves in, where it was not possible due to the procedures which apply in this House to debate that matter.  Literally no opportunity was given to discuss, debate or vote on a ministerial order which was being made in regard to An Foras Forbartha, a matter which affects the country at large and all its citizens.</P>
      <P>That is a very important matter, yet today we find ourselves dealing with a relatively insignificant matter.  There is something seriously wrong with the procedures of this House when that practice applies, and I am sure you, as Ceann Comhairle, would readily agree with that.  We ought to look at our procedures and when the law is being changed by ministerial order this House must have an opportunity, in every case, to debate it.  When the proposal was brought in by ministerial order, not by an Act of the Oireachtas, to abolish An Foras Forbartha we could not use the procedures of this House to debate such an important matter.  Yet here we are discussing a matter of relative insignificance.  There is something very wrong with our procedures and it is time we realised it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this matter should be raised in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that when changes in the law are made by ministerial order Deputies will be guaranteed an opportunity to discuss the matter on the floor <Col N="793" /> of the House, as we are doing today, to vote and comment on it.  A ministerial order is law making.  Let there be no misunderstanding about that.  Far more laws are made by ministerial order than are made in Dáil Éireann &mdash; there could be ten times the number made by order. That is a matter which should be looked at, and I want to emphasise that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am commenting on the Standing Orders, the Rules of the House and the way legislation is ordered.  Of course, it would not be within your brief to alter that in any way.  The point I was making was that that matter should be discussed in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and Ministers should not seek to introduce legislation giving themselves powers by ministerial order to amend, vary or alter that legislation in such a manner as denies Deputies the opportunity of debating it.  That happened on the Foras Forbartha issue.  It is very wrong that Ministers should bring forward legislation giving them powers to do that.  Fortunately that has not applied in this case and so we have the opportunity to discuss it here today.</P>
      <P>The amendment to this Act is welcome but I want to make a point about the administration of the Act.  There is a very serious defect in this legislation which is militating unjustly against a large number of people being able to avail of the intent of the Act.  I had hoped the Minister would have dealt with this point by one of these orders before now, but perhaps he will deal with it very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defect arises from the definition of <Col N="794" /> the word &ldquo;insolvency&rdquo;.  When a company go into liquidation there is no problem. The employee who has been deprived of his rights under the various Acts listed in the Minister's statement will get his rights. The problem arises when the company do not go into liquidation, when they just cease trading and close down.  That is a much more frequent happening than the actual liquidation.  There are literally hundreds of companies that simply close down operations, disappear, and do not bother putting the company into liquidation.  That is a very common procedure.</P>
    <P>The employee in such a company does not qualify or get his benefits under the Act because to qualify the company must go into liquidation.  The Minister may say in reply that that is true and if there is a debt owing to this unfortunate employee he can put the company into liquidation. Of course he can.  Anybody who is owed a debt by a company can put it into liquidation, but there is a problem.  It costs a great deal of money, and requires a great deal of expertise to put a company into liquidation.  To expect an employee who has lost his job since the company closed down, and who has been deprived of his rights and benefits under the legislation to be able to undertake the expense to put that company into liquidation is expecting far too much.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that, at the very minimum, if there is an unsatisfied judgment against a company for, say, one month, although it has not formally been put into liquidation, that ought to be deemed sufficient to say the company are insolvent.  In fairness, if there is a judgment against the company which they have not paid and it has been registered in the gazette or whatever, that ought to be sufficient to say the company are insolvent and to give the employee the entitlements and benefits for which he qualifies under this legislation but he does not get them because of the formality that the company have not gone into liquidation. This is not a theoretical notion.  It affects a very large number of employees.  I make a particular appeal to the Minister <Col N="795" /> to look at this difficulty in the administration of the Act and to assure the House that he will take steps to remedy it in the very short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small but important measure.  I wish to thank Deputies from all parties for supporting it.  I will deal now with some of the points made on payments. Since the Act came into operation in early 1985 a total of £11 million was paid to approximately 12,000 employees.  Payments fall most heavily in the area of minimum notice awards.  These payments represent slightly over 60 per cent of all insolvency payments.  The fund is used to finance both redundancy payments &mdash; rebates and lump sums &mdash; and insolvency payments.  Deputy Birmingham mentioned the surplus in the fund.  At present it stands at approximately £14 million. This is kept under constant review to see if it is possible to reduce the contribution rate &mdash; .6 per cent of the employees' earnings up to a ceiling of £15,500 increased to £16,200 with effect from 6 April next.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about Carrigaline.  I do not have any information on that but I will find out what I can and let the Deputy know.  Deputy De Rossa and others asked how many people were involved.  It is difficult for us to know but there could be ten, 20 or even more.</P>
      <P>This order arose from discussions with the heads of sections in my Department and my officials highlighted some of the anomalies in the Act.  Deputy De Rossa was right when he said that many people may have made inquiries but did not necessarily pursue their claims.  What we propose to do is to place advertisements in the newspapers to ensure that people who are not aware of the law in this area will be made aware of it.  We have already informed the trade union movement of the order so that they can circulate it in their magazines to their own members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Kemmy's point about insurability.  I know that a lot of my own constituents would be in a similar situation, starting a lot younger than the age <Col N="796" /> of 16.  A current review of early school leavers shows that the figures tend to go down.  It is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare but I will highlight it to him as it is a relevant point.</P>
    <P>The question of informal insolvency raised by Deputy Taylor was discussed in the House and a solution was not found when the 1984 Act was being discussed. I am not a legally minded person so I will not get into a debate with an eminent legal person.  We have not found the solution to this and I am not sure if a solution can be found.  This has been with eminent legal people for the entire period since I came to office as Minister for Labour.  It was something I raised in Opposition and I have tried to grapple with it.</P>
    <P>So-called informal insolvency is generally taken to mean an employer who merely ceased trading without any formal winding up.  Section 4(2) of the Act enables the Minister to make regulations specifying the circumstances in which employers may be taken to be insolvent. It was clear from the outset that any extension of the Act along the lines suggested would give rise to a range of problems both legal and administrative. Among the points of difficulty were the implications of declaring individual employers insolvent outside the provisions of general laws relating to insolvency.  This is one of the big legal difficulties.  How can I as Minister for Labour declare an individual insolvent? I do not have the power to do that.  I will not argue the legal difficulties; they can be dealt with on another day.  Even for the specific purposes of the Acts there are difficulties in identifying cases in which employers' failure to meet commitments to employees is due to their insolvency &mdash; an essential requirement of the Act &mdash; and there are problems of verification of precise entitlements of employees in a whole variety of circumstances.  Despite extensive consideration of the matter a solution has not been found to the difficulties involved.  We have not devised a scheme that would be compatible with the basic framework of the Act and at the same time be soundly based legally and administratively.  I know the previous <Col N="797" /> Minister, Deputy Quinn, tried very hard to find a solution to this and that the officials have been trying to find a solution over several years.  In my era we have been in constant communication with the Attorney General trying to find a solution.  We are still trying to find a way but I am nearly at the point where I feel it is unsolvable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to make two points on the motion.  I am not opposing the motion but I have points I want to make on the motion.  This motion provides a framework whereby charge can be made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to the grant or renewal of an abattoir licence or of a permit in relation to the grant or renewal of a licence or a permit for a knackery. The Minister came before the House with this proposal to enable these charges to be made.  It raises the issue that abattoirs dealing with the domestic market are now going to pay the same level of charges as export plants.  Arising from that the question has to be addressed as to whether the abattoirs will be able to avail of IDA and FEOGA grants in the same way as the export plants.  Many of these abattoirs will have to spend a lot of money to comply with the provisions of the Bill. If the approach is that we have a level of paying pitched now, with the export plants collecting the same fees, it considerably strengthens the case for having the same entitlement on the part of abattoirs dealing with the domestic market, so that they can avail of the IDA and FEOGA grants to bring their premises up to standard.  I want the Minister to deal with that point on this motion because there are technical difficulties in dealing with the point on the Bill when amendments we put down to it have been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The retail butchering trade employs about 6,000 people.  It is clear from the 1982 survey that, while considerable improvements have been made in the intervening years, major expenditure would be necessary by many abattoir owners to enable them to come up to the standards provided for in the Bill and the regulations to be made thereunder.  Many of them are concerned about their ability to meet those standards and the cost that will be involved.  They have made a reasonable case that, while they are anxious to comply with any reasonable standards laid down, they want to have access to the grants structures whether through the IDA or FEOGA to support them in so doing.  They point out that, while the export plants are grant-aided principally because of their export capacity, there is a significant leakage from those very export plants on to the domestic market, effectively providing competition for themselves.  That adds further to the case they have made from the point of view of access to grants.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, said in reply to Second Stage of the Bill on 10 December that it was very much a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA, but he would make representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that very point.  I am interested to know the response to those representations which the Minister of State wanted to make at that time.</P>
    <P>The second point is the other regulations with which abattoir owners will have to comply when the Bill comes into effect.  Again, concern was expressed to me that these regulations might be too onerous and place too heavy a burden on the abattoir owners.  They were anxious to see those regulations or a draft of them at the time we were discussing the Bill. The Minister pointed out very reasonably on Second Stage that the Bill was an enabling measure and all details of the regulations could not sensibly be included in the Bill.  The point I made on Second Stage was that I wanted a draft of the regulations to be available at that time so that the concerns expressed about the fact that they might be too onerous could <Col N="801" /> be incorporated in the discussion on the Bill.  Again, the Minister of State indicated in his closing address on Second Stage that drafts of the proposed regulations would be available shortly and would be furnished to the trade.  I am anxious, now we are clearing the point with regard to the charging provisions, that the concern expressed in relation to the other regulations would also be clarified at this stage, that we would be aware of the broad outline of what was being provided for in those regulations and that there would be an opportunity for the retail trade to assess the import of the terms of those draft regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the possible availability of funding to the various abattoirs covered by this motion.  Under the present system abattoirs catering for the home market do not have access to the same sources of funding as those catering for the export trade.  That has been a bone of contention for a long time and in turn has contributed to down-grading those catering for the home market.  The lack of FEOGA or IDA grant aid for the provision of extra facilities in those abattoirs now covered by the motion is completely contrary to what the motion and the Bill are trying to do.  I know there are difficulties there, but I ask the Minister of State to take on board the very valid case made by the trade in relation to this matter and perhaps consult with his colleague in Industry and Commerce to ascertain to what extent some provision can be made for these people in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest that some part of the inspection and licence fee be used by way of financing grants for the improvement of slaughterhouses which are the subject matter of this measure.  I have looked at the regulations on abattoir operation and those regarding siting, lay-out, accommodation and construction.  Two things strike me and I would like to bring them to the attention of the Minister.  One is the cost of the provisions and the other <Col N="802" /> is that many small abattoirs located in urban areas will find it impossible to comply with the physical conditions laid down.</P>
      <P>I would not like to think some of these provisions have been framed to put family butchers out of business, but that is what will happen.  The licensing and regulations framed to make abattoirs operate properly do not always mean that when all these things are in place we get a better product.  A family butcher may not have the facilities, physical or whatever as laid down in these regulations. However, I have heard of very few cases of butchers poisoning anybody or causing outbreaks of food poisoning.  Generally contravention of regulations in relation to the meat industry within the Food Acts have occurred where regulations such as we are discussing here were being adhered to but a much bigger operation was in hand or an element of further processing existed on the premises.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I ask the Minister to consider the aspects of this measure which cut across the very life and business of family butchers who are in every country town and village in Ireland, who had a tradition of hygiene themselves before ever regulations became the subject of law, and who have a long history of operating properly in the interests of the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputies O'Keeffe, Durkan and McCoy, the provision of grant aid to abattoirs is a separate issue which cannot be addressed in this measure.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, through the IDA, holds responsibility in this area. Furthermore, neither the Bill nor the House can ordain the provision of aid from FEOGA funds, as that is a matter for decision by the EC Commission. However, a pre-condition for the granting of such aid is that national funding must also be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us back again to the IDA. As I have said, I do not want to pass the buck to anybody else but the statutory <Col N="803" /> position is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for the operations of the IDA.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate how sensitive I am about keeping out of other Ministers' duties and responsibilities, so I have no intention of getting involved in this area. Grant-aid to the export plants was based on the need for export trade development and to secure markets abroad for beef, lamb, pork and bacon products.  In recent years the IDA policy in the meat export sector has shifted away from providing aid for projects whose sole aim is to increase slaughtering capacity, with the emphasis now being placed on added value, down stream processing projects. However, it has been claimed that export plants are increasing their share of the home market and as Deputy O'Keeffe said, a substantial amount of that meat is leaking into the domestic system and this is being facilitated through the provision of grant-aid.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I would be concerned about the possible unfair competitive advantage of this.  Therefore, as I said on Second Stage, I recently wrote to my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and suggested that the IDA should review their policy in this area to ensure that the domestic meat trade is not placed at any competitive disadvantage.  I feel strongly that there should be, as the Taoiseach puts it, a level playing pitch for everybody involved.  While I received an acknowledgment, in the time honoured position of those acknowledgments, the matter is being looked into and examined and I am awaiting a reply to the matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the regulations being made under the Bill, the position is that drafts of the regulations have been circulated to the trade.  They have already been discussed with the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association and they will be discussed with the Irish Master Butchers Federation tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied on the point in relation to the regulations and <Col N="804" /> that full and detailed discussions are under way.  It is appropriate that the drafts should be discussed before they are concluded.  However, I have to express disappointment at the reply to the first question because it seems to close the door on the family butcher to any access to grant-aid.  That is a wrong approach on the part of the Government and I should like to record my major disappointment at the line now being taken by the Minister in that regard.  I appreciate that he has made representations but it is clear that they have not brought about the desired result.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that all slaughterings on the farm, including pigs and injured animals, shall be reported to a veterinary inspector within 30 days of the animal's having been slaughtered.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment provides that all slaughterings on the farm, including pigs and injured animals, shall be reported to a veterinary inspector within 30 days of the animals having been slaughtered.  This proposal is intended to ensure that diseased animals are not used mistakenly by families on the farm and also to ensure that this section which allows for the slaughtering of injured animals is not abused by any unscrupulous individuals, if such exist, in the farming community. I ask the Minister favourably to consider accepting the amendment which is of a minor nature.</P>

      <P>My amendment provides that the slaughter of such pig, or such injured animal shall be carried out in the presence of a veterinary surgeon who shall make a report to the Department of Agriculture and Food veterinary department.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment which is meant in the spirit of his Second Stage speech.  Many of the regulations are geared to cutting out the practice of cowboy butchering on farms, unattended abattoirs, unlicensed abattoirs and abattoirs which are not visited under the present sanitary regulations. To allow such an act to take place without the presence of a veterinary surgeon will mean, as Deputy Stagg pointed out, that nobody will know whether the animal is diseased or otherwise and nobody will know whether that meat is offered for sale to the retail trade.  There is no doubt that the Bill is intended to cut out the gross abuses which are occurring at present and my amendment seeks to close off the loophole in the Bill as it is drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to introduce further controls on the home slaughtering concession provided for in the definition of abattoir under this Bill.  The proposal that all farm slaughterings be reported to a veterinary inspector within 30 days is one I could not be satisfied would be complied with, nor is it in any way properly enforceable.  If we were to make this provision we would only be adding to the bureaucracy and creating additional red tape.  Moreover, non-compliance with such a requirement would create a new offence under the Bill, the reason for which is scarcely warranted given that we are referring to a bona fide and legal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veterinary supervision of the slaughter of a pig on a farm for home consumption only would be extremely difficult to implement on the ground.  It would represent an over-elaborate control.  Moreover, the cost to the local authority, between travel to and time spent on the farm by a veterinary inspector, would be <Col N="806" /> prohibitive.  Indeed, one could foresee such costs falling back on the farmer and all because he wanted to kill a pig for domestic consumption.  There would also be problems in ensuring a veterinary presence in the case of an injured animal whose immediate slaughter would be necessary on humane grounds.</P>
    <P>A common theme in both amendments seems to be a concern that this home slaughtering concession will be abused and that meat derived from such slaughtering will be offered for sale to the general public.  Apart from the restrictions to this concession which I introduced on Report Stage in the Seanad, elsewhere in the Bill there will be sufficient controls to ensure that this does not happen.  The meat stamping arrangements and augmented staffing proposals being provided for in the Bill, coupled with the heavy penalties for breaches of controls, will ensure an end to the activities of any cowboy operators on the home market meat supply scene.  However, should all these controls fail, as I said before, I will have no hesitation in exercising the power contained in section 2 (3) (c) of the Bill by redefining an abattoir to include all slaughterings and, therefore, banning totally slaughterings on a farm for domestic consumption.  It is only fair and reasonable, however at this stage to continue to provide for a farmer slaughtering for his own use, confined now of course to a pig or an injured animal, particularly having regard to tradition in certain areas and also bearing in mind the position of islanders.</P>
    <P>This concession is essentially for farmers living in remote rural areas or for islanders.  From my own experience I know this is not a widespread practice and is declining.  However, I still feel it would be unfair to disallow this traditional practice.  After a period of the operation of the Act we will be in a better position to assess the need either for a continued concession in this area or whether it should be outlawed altogether. The latter, as I have said, can be readily achieved through a ministerial order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to what the Minister <Col N="807" /> has said, may I put it to him that in the case of farm slaughtering at present is it not true to say that most slaughtering of injured animals or pigs is actually done in abattoirs on behalf of the farmers? With the exception of very remote areas, farmers should be encouraged to bring their pig or injured animal to a local licensed abattoir where, if necessary, a concessionary price or the inspection fee could be foregone.  If we allow a loophole at present the cowboy operators will make very good use of it.  In any case those who would traditionally kill a pig or an injured animal would have to pay a butcher to do the job for them on their own farm.  If we could offer them the facility whereby this animal or pig could be processed in a local butcher's yard or abattoir and the inspection fee in this case foregone, it should encourage the farmers to do that.  The thrust of the Bill is to regulate and control and the provision for farm slaughtering is actually a loophole in this regulatory Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me add to what the last speaker has said.  I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude to my own amendment which I would see as a middle course between what he is suggesting as total outlawing of slaughtering in any circumstances on the farm and the present system which he is suggesting.  If my amendment were implemented there would be no travelling fees and no cost arising to the farmer or anybody else.  It would simply be a matter or reporting each individual incident by the person who carried out the slaughtering.  I see a danger in the section on injured animal in that animals might indeed be injured before they were slaughtered.  We could have lambs having their legs broken before slaughter and that would be highly undesirable.  I ask the Minister to look at the amendment again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is suggesting that if his own proposal does not work out when the Bill is in place he will outlaw totally all slaughtering on the <Col N="808" /> farm.  That is where the costs associated with monitoring would arise.  My proposal would have the effect that the Minister would know very positively, where, when and to what extent individual slaughtering was being carried out, without any cost to the Department, at local level or to the farmer.  The farmer would simply fill out a form and send it in for the information of the inspectorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to allow home slaughtering to take place, which is a traditional activity and, as Deputy McCoy has said, is confined to remote areas.  I would like to remind Deputies that I represent a remote area, a very scenic remote area in Cork South-West.  There are a number of islands off the coast and it is a tradition in that part of the country to have an animal slaughtered for home consumption.  I take the Deputy's point, and I am glad that he made it, that people should be encouraged to use local butchers or local abattoirs to slaughter and to dress these animals for return to the farmer for use in his deep freeze.  In fact, that is what is happening on the ground. While farm slaughtering is not a widespread activity, nevertheless it is a traditional activity and should be allowed.  It will certainly be monitored carefully to see there are no abuses of it.</P>
      <P>The home slaughtering provision is legalised under the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935.  I do not want to introduce unnecessary bureaucracy or red tape with regard to the occasional slaughtering for home use and for that reason I cannot accept the amendments.  However, I assure the House that this question will be very carefully scrutinised and monitored to see how it operates on the introduction of this legislation and the regulations under it.  If there is any abuse brought to light a ministerial order can be introduced to have it discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been following the discussion on this item.  I come also from a remote part of the country and there is a case in remote areas, particularly islands, to enable farmers there to continue a tradition which has been there <Col N="809" /> for decades and centuries.  From that point of view, while I appreciate the concern of colleagues to ensure that cowboy operators would not be able to take advantage of this section overall, I would not be in favour of the introduction of additional red tape or expense to genuine farmers in remote areas who would merely be following the traditions of their ancestors.</P>
      <P>However, there is one small point which might be a loophole and which the Minister might deal with.  The section refers to the &ldquo;occasional slaughter of a pig&rdquo;.  I think we should focus on that to ensure that the fears and concerns of my colleagues would not come to fruition. The provisions of the Bill are clear enough in relation to the accident or injury section where it is necessary to prevent suffering.  Quite honestly, if it were necessary to prevent suffering, immediate action might be necessary in many cases and the farmer would proceed without filling any forms.  That is fairly straightforward.  However, on the question of occasional slaughter there is in fact no definition as to what in fact is &ldquo;occasional slaughter&rdquo;.  It is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a question of <i>mens rea</i> here.  I accept that the meat would have to be intended for consumption only by the residents on the farm where the occasional slaughtering takes place.  Perhaps I am being rather technical and legalistic about it but the subsection does not provide that it has actually to be consumed by such residents.  It is merely a question of intention at the time of slaughter.  I do not know whether we need to get into that type of detail.  A deficiency that is there and one the Minister might consider before Report Stage is the lack of definition of the word &ldquo;occasional&rdquo;.  Is &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; once a week, once a month or once a year?  It does seem to leave the position open to question.  I suggest the Minister would look at the matter as to whether it <Col N="810" /> might need to be tightened up by using some definiton of the word &ldquo;occasional&rdquo;. If that were done it might remove the concerns and fears expressed by my colleagues and which are essentially behind their amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a tradition in rural areas of killing a pig coming to the winter and cutting a lamb's throat in spring for family use.  I remember that practice at home; where I come from is a remote area but the area I represent is not so remote from this House, although it is remote in other senses, of course.  I accept that tradition exists but I think it is a fading tradition.  It might be a good thing that it is a fading tradition especially from the point of view of the consumers, and particularly farmers and their families.  I have some personal knowledge of use of that tradition.  One difficulty is that the Minister, under the regulations as set out, will have no way of knowing how extensive is this traditional practice. &ldquo;Occasional&rdquo; is a relative word which can mean anything.  It could mean once every ten years, or five times a day.  The use of the meat also is in question.</P>
      <P>The tradition that I am talking about still exists, which is that quite an amount of meat from the slaughtered animal is given away free, <i>gratis</i> and for nothing to neighbours for their consumption at the time of slaughtering.  I assume that there is no attempt to control that practice and I do not suggest that such control should be required.  Will the Minister look again at my amendment which would simply allow him to be aware of how occasional such slaughterings are?  As Deputy O'Keeffe has said, there might be a little red tape involved because when the farmer kills the pig he sends in the form. That is all that is involved.  If a lamb breaks its leg and has to be killed, the form is also filled in.  Occurring once a year, that is not much red tape.</P>

      <P>I can readily understand the reservations expressed by the previous speakers.  I wonder at the definition of the word &ldquo;occasional&rdquo;, as Deputy O'Keeffe has done.  A great deal of or <Col N="811" /> not very much latitude could be given depending upon whether one was talking about a farm family living in a remote area having many members, as opposed to a very small family consisting of husband, wife and two children.  There could be a vast difference between the occasions of slaughterings in these two cases.  Will the problem which arises here be controlled under a further section of the Bill in relation to the health mark?  I fully accept that as long as the meat is not for sale or distribution outside the family home or farm it does not run counter to the regulation.  Perhaps a subsequent section might be involved here.</P>

      <P>In relation to the wording in the Bill with regard to the occupier's own use, it is one of the objectives of the Minister's Department to promote farmhouse tourism.  People are being encouraged to provide tourist facilities and accommodation on their farms.  In many cases such farmhouses provide for guests meat which would come under this legislation when the animals are slaughtered on the farm.  This practice could be much more prevalent in the future.  In such a case the people staying as guests in the farmhouse would be consuming the meat slaughtered for the farm family's own consumption.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the question of occasional slaughter, this matter is qualified by the rest of the section when one considers that the onus of proving that the meat is for consumption at home lies on the farmer slaughtering the animal. He can only consume a certain amount which will, in itself, make it an occasional occurrence.  I want to reiterate that the whole purpose of the Bill is to allow for a traditional practice which is declining. In relation to pigs, as everybody knows <Col N="812" /> who is familiar with this traditional practice, the animal is cured and salted. Regarding its widespread use, as feared by Deputy McCoy, for guests in guesthouses and so on, these people would prefer a more varied menu than cured bacon on all occasions.  I honestly do not see any way in which this matter can be abused.  Deputy Durkan mentioned the health mark.  The stamping of meat will ensure that it will not get to the retail outlets.  It will be confined to consumption at home and on the farm.  All we want to do is to facilitate that practice is isolated rural areas and reduce the cost and the bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy McCoy regarding farmhouse holidays, subsection (2) provides that a place ancillary to a guesthouse will not be covered by the exemptions.  I think that I can allay everybody's fears in relation to any abuse, or to cowboy operators in this regard.  If during the years ahead it comes to notice that there is abuse, I shall certainly have no hesitation in introducing a ministerial order to remedy the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in relation to this amendment that I wish to refer to this matter.  It could have consequences for the use of premises where, for instance, as mentioned in the subsection, a person keeps greyhounds and feeds animal offal or parts of animals to the hounds in the course of his business.  How can the collection and cutting up of dead animals be controlled under the heading of an animal being used for consumption on the premises?  Will those operations be controlled in some other fashion?  There could be a <Col N="813" /> public health aspect if such an outfit were operating in a semi-urban area, or in any area for that matter, and reasonable standards of hygiene did not apply.  Sometimes &mdash; in fact, very often &mdash; offence can be caused by the location of such knackeries if they are operated in a fashion which does not lend itself to the best hygienic standards.  I wish to refer to this matter in connection with the amendments of Deputies Stagg and McCoy.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, it could be said that an animal because of injury, disease or whatever, could be slaughtered on the premises and used in the course of the ordinary farm enterprise, and the keeping of greyhounds could well be interpreted as such.  On the other hand, an animal could be collected from or delivered to that premises either already slaughtered or needing to be slaughtered which could also be termed animals for use or to be maintained in or to be consumed on the premises.</P>

      <P>On the question of knackeries and supply of meat from knackeries to kennels this matter was raised by a number of Deputies from constituencies where the greyhound <Col N="814" /> industry is a very important part of life. I assured the House on Second Stage, and I want to assure the House now, that the control of knackeries will be covered for the first time under the legislation being introduced.  Anybody who saw recent media coverage of the activities of some knackeries will agree that it is not before time.  There will be rigorous enforcement of these regulations to ensure that some of the activities that have been prevalent up to now will be terminated, that there will be a strict level of control over their activities and that there will be no question of some of these activities being allowed under the regulations now being drafted as a consequence of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to make on this section.  Indeed I want to renew my plea to the Minister in relation to the matter of duplication.  The Minister dealt with a query from Deputy Sherlock about cost effectiveness.  It is largely on that basis I make this plea.  I might refer in particular to the reference to the power of the Minister to transfer his functions in relation to licensing to the local authority within whose functional area the abattoir concerned is situated.  I am concerned at the retention of the power by the Minister, in the first instance, and the entitlement of his Department to issue licences.  Under the provisions of this Bill we are to have a veterinary officer in each council or corporation area with some provision for joint veterinary officers covering smaller functional areas.  In these circumstances it seems to me to be ridiculous to have veterinary officers of the Department travelling down to those local authority areas to exercise functions in relation to the granting of abattoir licences.  Why, in the name of goodness, is that not done, in the first instance, by the veterinary officer in the county concerned?  It would <Col N="818" /> appear to me to be far more cost effective, even bearing in mind the question of travelling expenses of departmental veterinary officers, presumably from Dublin, going to the remoter parts of the country costing, say, 40p or 50p a mile.  That does not seem to make sense when there is a veterinary officer on the ground in those counties who will know the premises, who will have a lot of experience of the day-to-day operations and who will be much better placed and equipped to advise or decide on whether a licence should be granted and the conditions to be applied to any such licence.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister, on Second Stage, referred to the need for a standard system in regard to the issuing of licences.  Surely that could be covered in two ways.  The regulations will lay down broadly the relevant statutes.  Second, if, it were necessary, to have a meeting before the commencement of the regulations between the chief veterinary officers for the various local authorities, the implementation of the regulations could then be discussed and they could get on with the job on the ground.  I urge the Minister seriously to consider my pleas in relation to duplication.  It is making unnecessary work for the Department, for the bureaucrats in Agriculture House, which could be done much more effectively by the local authority veterinary officer.</P>
      <P>Here I might touch on the Minister's experience serving on local authorities. Is it not wise that more and more power should be devolved on local authorities? The retention of that power within the Department is contrary to that notion of devolution.  I know there is an enabling provision to allow devolution, but why not have the power vested in the local authority in the first instance?  As somebody who has had much experience serving on local authorities, I urge the Minister to consider that as a better approach and, if necessary, to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to cover the point.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to raise is in relation to subsection (5) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> Whenever the Minister proposes to make regulations pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the Regulations shall not be made until a draft of the Regulations has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>Provided a decision is taken to transfer the functions, the Minister makes an order to transfer those functions to the local authority within whose functional area the abattoir concerned is situated. Yet, from a reading of subsection (5) one will see that any such regulation cannot become effective until a draft has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there are different ways of implementing regulations.  The most difficult is where one requires an affirmative resolution which has to be approved by both Houses which, effectively, is quite difficult because of time constraints, and so on.  It appears to me that that requirement of an affirmative resolution of both Houses to approve any such regulation is a further protection of the bureaucrats, that it will be more difficult to have these powers devolved because of the requirement to have an affirmative resolution approving of the draft regulation passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get a reputation for being anti-bureaucrat but I am very strongly in favour of devolution and of the cost-effectiveness of having the work done on the ground.  Therefore, there are two avenues open to me: one, give the power in the first instance to local authorities to deal with the licensing, as opposed to the Department; or, alternatively have a very simple procedure whereby a regulation can be made by the Minister to allow devolution without the need to have such regulation laid before and approved by a resolution of both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in saying that I should like to regulate the bureaucrats where I can find them in their places.  But section 9 (5) recognises something which I recognise and appreciate, that is, the primacy of Parliament, rather than giving authority to bureaucrats.</P>
      <P>I become very nervous when I hear of functions being devolved to local authorities, or even powers being devolved to local authorities.  What does not usually accompany such devolution is the requisite money to have the task carried out.  While the fees to be collected would be available to local authorities &mdash; if the regulations are made &mdash; I have serious misgivings about the requirements in that regard from the point of view of the local authority.  As somebody who has served on a local authority, as have most of us, I am very conscious of the fact that this House regularly passes legislation which devolves responsibility to a local authority without allocating them the wherewithal or finances with which to carry out the task involved.  There is a long list of such legislation and I am very anxious for the Minister to assure the House that this Bill is not in that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that a number of Members alluded to the importance of membership of local authorities because, on other occasions in the House, great pressure was put on people to get off them.  However, they serve a useful function.  A good deal of sense has been talked about devolution of power to local authorities and in future the demands on Department staff could be such that it will become increasingly impossible for them to conduct the annual licensing inspection.  Therefore, subsection (3) allows for licensing to be devolved to local authorities at a future stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, some local authorities, particularly those with full time veterinary staff, where licensing of premises is satisfactory, are a bit annoyed at the prospect of losing this function.  However, the problem is that regard must be taken for the unsatisfactory position on licensing <Col N="821" /> obtaining in some parts of the country where they do not have full time veterinary staff.  Moreover, until such time as all local authorities have full time veterinary personnel employed and the provisions of the Bill are fully and properly running in all areas, there would be little point in considering the transfer of licensing functions.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment have asked that, if and when it is proposed to devolve licensing to local authorities, they will be consulted.  This request is considered reasonable having regard to that Department's overall responsibility for local authorities. Accordingly, provision is also made in this subsection for such consultation. Subsection (4) refers to selectively devolving licensing to local authorities only when we are confident that the job will be done properly, having regard to the position in relation to permanent staff in such local authorities.  The Minister will still retain power for the granting or refusal of licences.  The whole thrust of this legislation is to devolve responsibility to local authorities but, until such time as they have the staff to do it, it will not be possible to hand it over to them.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) is important because it gives the Dáil and the Seanad the opportunity to vet any proposals on devolution of licensing before they can be implemented, to which Deputy Stagg referred.  He also referred to the primacy of the Dáil in relation to these matters and I accept his comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of the cost of veterinary inspectors going down the country and chalking up expenses and subsistence.  The Department's veterinary officers are located in every local authority area in export meat plants and travelling would be minimal as they reside in the area.  The Department's veterinary inspectors are being used to bring the domestic abattoirs up to the same standard as export plants which they supervise at present, as required by the Government.  Therefore, I can allay any fears or anxieties in relation to bureaucracy and centralisation.  The decision in devolving licensing to local authorities <Col N="822" /> will be taken when they have the personnel and when their full time veterinary inspectorate is provided by the local authorities.  I hope that can be done as quickly as possible because, like the Deputies who contributed here, I want to reduce bureaucracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I love the note prepared for the Minister in regard to the primacy of the Dáil.  When it comes to establishing regulations which will devolve the powers from the civil servants to local authorities then the primacy of the Dáil is referred to and such regulations cannot be put into effect without going through the usual procedures and having the full approval of the Dáil and Seanad.  However, the Bill also provides for orders to be made by the Minister.  In section 2 (4) the Minister may, by order, amend or revoke an order made under that section.  There is no reference to the primacy of the Dáil and it is very handy for the Minister to be able to make an order without the need to lay it before the House.  I am not at all impressed by the suggestion that the primacy of the Dáil has been taken into account in the drafting of this section.  I strongly suggest it is because such an affirmative resolution requires further trouble and time in this House and the Seanad that it has been drafted in that fashion, to provide an additional barrier to any such devolution.  As one who strongly believes in devolution, that point needs to be made.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is in regard to selective devolution.  The Minister has satisfied me to a degree in his explanation about the Department's veterinary officers in various parts of the country being able to do the initial work in licensing inspection.  I hope it will be a cost effective process and that it will not involve huge additional expense.  If the Minister gives me that assurance, I will accept it.  I also wish to refer to selective devolution to local authorities who traditionally have had veterinary officers and whose affairs are in good order.  In Cork county, a veterinary officer is doing a good job and the same applies to Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> Where there are clear examples that the local authority veterinary officers are doing a good job, I would be very anxious to see selective devolution and I will be anxious for an assurance from the Minister that he is of the same mind.  I do not know if he will be in office long enough to make the necessary orders but at least he should assure the House that his mind is running along those lines and that he will make such orders where there is clear evidence that the veterinary service within selected local authority areas is up to a high standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's last statement regarding staffing gives cause for concern.  While the authority is available to transfer functions, obviously there is a requirement to employ staff.  Will the Minister indicate if the staff embargo in the public service affects the implementation of this Bill?  Local authorities and the Department have to apply this embargo and how will they be able to take on the extra numbers of staff required at local authority level to implement the provisions of the Bill?  Have we provided elsewhere the necessary finances for the extra staff or will the House be asked to pass a Bill which will place on the existing staff, who I assume are working to full capacity, extra duties the effect of which will be that they will not be able to implement the provisions of the Bill?</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was concerned about the primacy of the Dáil.  I should like to refer him to section 63 which states that all orders or regulations may be annulled by the House within 21 days of them being laid before the House.  Important regulations, such as those made under section 9, will be put before the Oireachtas before being implemented.  I should like to assure the House that there will not be any problem about putting such orders and regulations before the House.  All orders and regulations under the Bill will be implemented in the most effective way possible.  Where the Department are satisfied that the job will be carried out in a competent way &mdash; we are satisfied that that is the position <Col N="824" /> in southern counties &mdash; it will be possible to devolve powers quickly to the respective counties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg was concerned about the number of full-time veterinary inspectors that would be required.  I should like to tell the Deputy that there are 23 local authority areas without full-time veterinary inspectors.  The staff embargo will not prevent us appointing full-time veterinary personnel to those areas.  It is worth repeating that the cost of implementing the provisions of the Bill will be borne by the revenue accruing as a result of some of the fees such as veterinary inspection fees.</P>

      <P>I should like to press the Minister on why he considers it necessary to have an affirmative resolution for devolution as opposed to the ordinary procedure under section 63 for laying regulations before the House.  Is it Government policy to devolve powers and, if so, why is it necessary to have an additional barrier in relation to an order for devolution by requiring an affirmative resolution of both Houses while other orders under section 63 are merely <Col N="825" /> required to be laid before both Houses? If the Minister is convinced that the policy of devolution is the correct one and is prepared to selectively devolve his powers under the Bill to those authorities who are prepared and ready to use them, I wonder why he does not consider withdrawing the need for an affirmative resolution under subsection (5) and allowing such orders to be dealt with under section 63?</P>

I do not want an additional layer of bureaucracy introduced because it is Government policy to devolve as many functions as possible to local authorities under this legislation.  It is important, however, to give Members of both Houses an opportunity to look at proposals before devolution takes place. I hope that no cumbersome red tape or bureaucracy is put in the way of devolution by any subsection.  I should like to tell Deputy Sherlock that section 57 empowers the local authority and the Minister to prosecute.

      <P>In page 10, subsection (7), between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(8)  The appropriate fee shall not be altered except by reference to the index of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill places a burden in excess of £2 million, between veterinary inspection fees, licence fees and registration fees, on the home or family butcher.  While the proper control of abattoirs and knackeries is of prime importance, in general that section of the butchery trade which deals with home consumption has a proud <Col N="827" /> record.  I ask the Minister to accept that any increases should be related to the index of inflation.  There is no safeguard in the Bill to prevent him from increasing the various charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence fees set out in section 10 are intended to provide a self-financing basis for the activities of the Department of Agriculture and Food in the inspection of premises for licensing purposes.  This cost will be confined to the travelling and subsistence expenses of the officers concerned.  Their salaries will continue to be borne by the Department.  The fees have been pitched at a level to cover these costs and the estimated licence fee yield of £40,000 annually should be sufficient.  Inspecting officers will be deployed to the export meat plants on a geographical basis to ensure that costs are contained and that the annual licensing programme is conducted as economically as possible. Accordingly any future increase in licence fees should be very marginal.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCoy's amendment is imperfect to the extent that problems would arise as to the interpretation of what constitutes the index of inflation and over what reference period.  It could have the effect of imposing an additional annual charge on butchers, probably unnecessarily.  Amounts would emerge on the three-tier fee structure which would lead to increased bureaucracy.  The domestic meat trade has not voiced any concern about the licence fees, which have been tiered in favour of the smaller operator. Department officials have been involved in comprehensive consultations with the trade over a considerable time and have gone through the Bill section by section. If it has been possible to take their views into account, this has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the narrow cost base associated with licensing, any increase in such costs will require a very minor adjustment.  Any such adjustment will require, under subsection (6) of this section, to be brought forward under regulations to the Houses of the <Col N="828" /> Oireachtas and then this House and the Seanad will have the opportunity of vetting such regulations.  If it is found necessary to increase the rate of fees at some future stage to keep in line with costs &mdash; I hope there will be no need for an increase for a considerable length of time &mdash; the regulations so proposing, as provided for in subsection (4) to this section, would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Minister introducing such regulations would have to justify with facts and figures whatever increase was being sought.  I do not think any Minister will ask for an unreasonable increase in fees.  The fact that it has to be brought before the Oireachtas is sufficient safeguard against inordinate increases.  For that reason I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point relates to the Minister's comments on the need for an affirmative resolution of the Houses to vary the fees.  Subsection (6) provides for a variation of fees by regulation, but it does not require an affirmative resolution of the Houses.  Section 63 states that every order and regulation made by the Minister, other than a regulation made under sections 9 (3), 24(3), 44(3) or 56(3), shall be laid before the Houses.  It does not require an affirmative resolution.  It comes into effect if there is not an annulling order, which is unusual. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  He stated that an affirmative resolution is necessary.  If that is the situation I am very happy with it.  It seems appropriate that the Minister should have to come before the House to get an affirmative resolution if he is raising the fees. Deputy McCoy would probably agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is a technical one.  A <Col N="829" /> small slaughterhouse or abattoir will have a fee of £10, otherwise it will vary according to the throughput of animals.  What happens in the case of the initial application when the Bill has been passed? What is the appropriate fee for a small abattoir applying for a first licence under the new legislation?  One reading of the section would seem to imply that the bigger fee would have to be paid rather than £10.  Will the appropriate fee under subsection (4) be £10 or a larger amount?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Inspection fees are covered under section 44 (4) which states:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister proposes to make Regulations pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the Regulations shall not be made until a draft of the Regulations has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>That relates to inspection fees.  The estimated annual revenue from inspection fees is £1.4 million, whereas in the case of the licence the estimated revenue is £40,000.  The trade were consulted in relation to the licence fees and did not raise any strong objections.  These fees will be necessary at a rate to cover the cost of the annual licensing inspection by the Department.  Licence and registration fees at bacon plants and export meat plants respectively are being increased in sections 48 and 50.  The new fees applicable at these plants will be £500.  The old fees were only £10 for a bacon curing licence and £1 for registration of a plant to export meat.  While these fees are once-off, their increase to the new level will serve to equalise treatment between the export and domestic sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy O'Keeffe's query, in the first year of licensing and also for new abattoirs there will be problems in the determination of the previous calendar year's slaughterings.  To a large extent, therefore, proprietors will have to be taken at their word as to what they slaughtered.  The application form will make provision for such a declaration. <Col N="830" /> We would not expect to receive many false declarations in view of the relatively minimal amounts of money involved.  We will be relying on the integrity of the applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. I am satisfied on that point.  Am I correct in saying that the affirmative resolution applies to the fees per head but there is no need for an affirmative resolution in the case of an increase in licence fees?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying, therefore, that while on the previous <Col N="833" /> occasion, on 16 December, when giving the reply that he anticipated that all that agreement would have been reached the present position is that it has not been reached and that there was an indication that member states would not take up their allocation.  If that is the case would it mean in a redistribution that this country would benefit?  The amount previously was £2 million.  When does the Minister think this scheme will be in operation and will he give a date?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's impatience because it depends on the acceptance of other member states.  I would like to inform the Deputy I have reason to believe that when I say &ldquo;very shortly&rdquo; in my reply it will be very shortly. The Deputy can also rest assured that our application for an increased quota from the scheme stands very firmly in the event of some other member states not opting into the scheme but that has not yet been finally determined.  That is the position and I hope that very shortly the allocations will be fixed and we can put the scheme in place because the consultations have already taken place here at home with a view to implementing this very important scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the previous occasion on which this was introduced was the first time.  Like any major scheme of this nature, obviously there would have been some unsatisfactory elements of the type referred to but, by and large, the experience of everybody was that the voluntary organisations did a tremendous job in implementing the scheme.  We have all learned from such problems as they were &mdash; queueing and delays &mdash; and I am satisfied that the arrangements that will now <Col N="834" /> be put in place will minimise, if not avoid, that kind of experience.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he will clarify the allegations that the Mexican Government will destroy 41 tonnes of milk powder originating in Ireland because it exceeded internationally recognised limits for radiation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Bainne are major exporters of skimmed milk powder to Mexico.  In the last two years exports have averaged 34,000 tonnes a year and similar quantities are expected to be sold there this year.  It appears that questions have arisen about the level of radiation in a very small tonnage out of a total consignment of 28,000 tonnes supplied in 1986.  As the Mexican authorities have not contacted us about the matter I do not have precise details on the nature of the problem.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have also arisen as regards 5,000 tonnes from a consignment of 40,000 tonnes supplied in 1987, which were attributable to the fact that the Mexican authorities, after delivery of the product, stipulated lower tolerance levels for radioactivity than those agreed in the contract with Bord Bainne.  The levels stipulated are, in fact, a fraction of those accepted within EC and in most other international markets.  If rejected in Mexico, this powder will be sold without difficulty elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise also that a rigorous testing programme for dairy products has been in place since Chernobyl and that all exports are certified as being within internationally accepted limits for radiation.</P>

      <P>In tabling this question I am aware that the good name of the industry could be at risk and it was not my intention to do that but there is serious concern that a consignment could go abroad.  Has the Minister or his Department been officially in contact with the Mexican Government's purchasing company in this regard and have we accepted back, as was reported, the consignment <Col N="836" /> of milk powder?  Is this not a legitimising of the Mexican complaint?  Has the Minister got a report on this particular consignment and, if so, will he make it available to the House?  I am not satisfied and I would like to ask the Minister what steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully satisfied that all the consignment complied with EC regulations and international regulations.  In that connection, when any matters relating to radiation levels have been discussed in the European Community we have been in the forefront in insisting that the radiation levels that would be acceptable would be at the lowest possible level.  What we have exported to Mexico and elsewhere has always been within those levels.  What happened in this case is that the Mexican authorities stipulated a level which was about one-eighth of the radiation levels acceptable to the EC and internationally, a radiation level of 50 becquerels.  They then suggested that the 5,000 tonnes &mdash; if 5,000 tonnes is in fact involved, because most of it has been consumed and they are not quite clear how much is involved &mdash; be brought back.  It was Bord Bainne who negotiated the contract and as Mexico is one of our biggest customers we decided, as a gesture of goodwill to a big customer who has placed an immense order with us again this year, that they would bring the 5,000 tonnes back and sell it immediately as there is immediate demand in other markets for this product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to why this happened in Mexico is <Col N="837" /> not a matter for me to go into.  There are internal developments with any country which are not for us to comment on.  We should remember this: we are now about the biggest in the world in this area.  We supply 66 different outlets and export over 360,000 tonnes of skimmed powder and over 300,000 tonnes of butter.  The importance of that market to us is very clear to all of us and perhaps our competitors have certain views also.  I do not want to go any further than that but the amount involved in this case is very small and I can reassure the House and insist that it was well within the lowest possible levels set by the European Community.</P>

      <P>The Minister was in Mexico last October.  Can he tell us whether this question arose in the discussions which he had there?  Secondly, because of the absolute importance of maintaining our good name internationally, would the Minister consider going back again to Mexico or asking his Minister of State to go back there to ensure that this problem is cleared up quickly and effectively once and for all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct when he says I was there last year.  On that visit I met the President who had previously visited Ireland in March and April of last year.  I also met their Minister for Health.  At no stage during the course of those discussions did anyone raise this question or suggest that the consignments which had been sent out either in 1986 or 1987 did not conform, far from it.  Let me make it clear that because of the reputation and standard of our products the only major issue which was discussed was how much we could supply to the Mexican market in 1988.  I do not want to attribute any wrong motives to the people with whom I discussed this matter; I do not believe they had any, and Bord Bainne are very satisfied that our position in this market has not been affected.  As I have said, our reputation internationally is so high that we can dispose of this stock immediately.</P>

I can say no more than that.  We are now in big business and we have to be prepared to recognise that there may be elements within a country or outside of it which may have reservations but I think we can cope with it as we are doing very satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for production, transport and marketing within the dairy sector is ultimately a matter for the industry itself.  Responsibility for planning in these areas lies also with the industry though every encouragement and assistance possible will be given by my Department and the other State agencies involved.  I am pleased to note that discussion is currently taking place within the dairy sector on the type <Col N="841" /> of structures best suited to the years ahead.

      <P>ICOS, the umbrella organisation for the dairy sector, have issued recommendations in respect of rationalisation and there are moves taking place in the management and ownership in the dairy sector which are in line, it would appear, with current trends in the market.  An Bord Bainne, who are not a State agency, have the promoting role and, as can be seen from the last question, they have been very successful in this area.  It may be that some interests under the new re-organised dairy sector may want to pursue their own markets, or it may well be that the bulk of them, as hitherto, want to do it through An Bord Bainne.  I do not see any conflict there.  I know An Bord Bainne are looking at their management structure on an ongoing basis.  From my experience of them, they have the benefit of the most professional sales team on the world market.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when dealing with a free market economy, unless we totally regulate everything, and everything has to be sold by the State or through the State, we <Col N="842" /> can never avoid competition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food whether he will expand and accelerate the proposals for integrated rural development in the light of the decisions of the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on an integrated rural development programme is very well advanced and I should be in a position to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.  As indicated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> it is the intention to introduce the programme on a pilot basis in a number of representative areas initially. The extension of the programme nationally will then be based on the experience gained in the pilot areas.</P>
      <P>It is of course, also the intention to maximise the Community's financial participation in the programme.  In this regard, I am very pleased with the decision taken at the recent European Council, particularly as regards the Community's structural funds and the special provision for Ireland recorded in the minutes of the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a total lack of urgency on the part of the Government in taking advantage of the possibilities which arise under the proposed dumping of the structural fund?  Does he also agree it is appalling that, despite the decision of the European Council, we still do not seem to have Government policy in this area? If he is talking about the establishment of pilot areas, which I understand might run for two years, is it not delaying the national approach to wait that long before we have a well thought out, clearly co-ordinated national policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with the notion that there is a lack of urgency on the part of the Government.  Let me put it on the record that it was this <Col N="844" /> Government, and I representing this Government, who pushed and promoted this idea at the Council of Ministers.  As a consequence of my constant pushing, this proposal was adopted by the Council of Ministers and subsequently brought to the European Council where it was adopted, with terms which were very specific in respect of Ireland.  We had a specific reference to Ireland recorded in the minutes on terms acceptable to us.</P>
      <P>As far as dealy in implementing the decision of the European Council is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that that matter has to be pursued by way of Council regulation.  The European Council is not an institution of the Community. It is the highest level of heads of Government, but it has to consider the regulation.  I hope it will be on the agenda at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers in March.  In advance of that we have plans in my Department, which I hope to announce shortly, for the pilot areas.</P>
      <P>I hope it is clear that, far from delaying, we have been to the forefront in this area and, as soon as it comes to the Council of Ministers we will be ready to act immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know exactly what integrated rural development is, and how it will be implemented. We do not seem to have a policy in this area.  In fact, there does not seem to be any clear idea as to what integrated rural development means.  Perhaps this calls for a White Paper because there is no clear concept.  Merely establishing pilot areas may be part of the answer, but it is not the complete answer.  Another point I want to raise is whether the proposal, in so far as there has been any clear thinking on it, involves a centralised approach to integrated rural development either from the point of view of policy initiatives or structures.  Will there be provisions for a multi-sectoral approach which involves groups in the rural areas making the proposals to be implemented through structures on the ground as opposed to a centralised <Col N="845" /> approach?  I see that as being very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the thrust is, and will be, for a decentralised as distinct from a centralised approach.  The plans are very far advanced.  There is not much point in announcing proposals in respect of a regulation which has not yet been adopted by the Council of Ministers.  The Government are aware of this and we are ready.  We are looking at a range of areas, not just agriculture in the conventional sense but at land usage, rural development, management of rural enterprises, and so on.  I hope we are on the same lines as the Deputy with this, but he will appreciate that I cannot go any further now until the regulation comes into place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food (a) the total number of cases of fraud involving EC grants or finances for meat plants, which have been investigated by his Department since 1980, (b) the number of cases where evidence of fraud was found, and in respect of (b), (1) the names of the plants involved and (2) the number of cases and the plants in respect of which prosecutions were initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ongoing supervision of EC funded beef operations is carried out by staff of my Department and of the <Col N="846" /> Revenue Commissioners at meat export plants, cold stores and at points of export. Where in the course of such supervision cases of suspected fraud come to light, it is standard practice to refer such cases to the Garda authorities for definitive investigation of fraudulent practice.</P>
      <P>The strictest application of this practice is essential to the maintenance and, indeed, enhancement of the positive reputation which this country enjoys with the Commission of the European Communities and the Council of Ministers. This reputation has been gained by diligent supervisory and regulatory work undertaken by the staff of my Department in an area which is not readily discernible by the public at large.  I want it to be clearly understood that it is my intention to protect and vindicate our reputation in the national interest.</P>
      <P>In the period since 1980 there have been seven cases referred to the Garda involving EC funded operations at meat plants.  So far a prosecution has been initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions in one of these cases and that prosecution was successful.  It was taken against the manager of the particular meat plant in his personal capacity.</P>
      <P>It would be improper for me to identify the plants involved in the other six cases referred to the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that very few cases have been referred to the Garda for full investigation and because of the fact that there has been only one prosecution to date does he agree that that indicates that there is a major problem with regard to policing, considering the admitted extent of fraud in the area of EC grants and regulations and that there is need for a crisis re-evaluation of procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy refers to the admitted extent I am not sure what he is referring to.  There are six cases and that is the admitted extent.  We are in constant consultation with the EC authorities and the commissioner responsible acknowledged that the supervision <Col N="847" /> and regulation we conduct in my Department are the best.  We intend to maintain those standards.  The six cases are matters for the Garda and we supply all the information.  The Deputy will appreciate I cannot comment beyond that at this stage.  I assure the House that where there are seen to be breaches of regulations we are immediately in touch with the Commission on the basis of fullest possible disclosure.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a member of the Court of Auditors of the European Communities in evidence to the Committee on Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann said that member countries are very reluctant to report fraud to the Community?  Will the Minister assure the House that he will impress on the Council of Ministers the need for all countries to report fraud so that it can be tackled?  Will he assure the House that he and his Department will ensure that the Court of auditors are assisted on a Community-wide basis in cutting out all fraud?</P>

We have a lot of reasons apart from legal obligation and public morality for complying with regulations.  If our standards are accepted by the Commission we will not have constant checks, wasteful bureaucratic checks by the European Commission. That is why it is so important that we maintain these standards.  I take the Deputy's point after that but it is not for me to introduce the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the average price increase paid to farmers last year for milk primarily arising out of the December 1986 EC agreement; and if he has satisfied himself that the bulk of the benefits <Col N="854" /> arising from this agreement are passed on to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement on milk reached by Council in December 1986 dealt mainly with reduction in milk quotas and with the suspension of intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder.  The new arrangements for intervention were agreed in detail in March 1987 and included a provision that in implementing those arrangements account would be taken of the special importance of intervention to Ireland.  I have ensured that this provision has been respected in practice.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify precisely the effect of these agreements on producer prices for milk as other factors, such as improved commercial market conditions and overall economic environment, must also be taken into account. However, it appears that producer prices increased by between 4 and 5 pence per gallon in 1987.  The actual levels of price are a matter for those involved in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentions the improvement in the market being principally due to buoyancy because of the reduction of stocks.  That together with the green pound devaluation, should have led to an increase somewhere in the region of 10p or 11p per gallon, but as pointed out, it has been only an increase of something like 4p or 5p a gallon.  It would seem that farmers are being shortchanged to the extent of 5p or 6p a gallon. Is the Minister doing anything to see that that shortfall is being made up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that even the farm organisations would use the figure the Deputy uses.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter for the Minister of the day to intervene between the co-operatives, their shareholders and suppliers.  Secondly, while I do not want to engage in argument on this matter, it may be that the co-operatives who are in constant consultation with their suppliers and shareholders, may have reasons as to why every penny <Col N="855" /> of the increase coming to them was not passed on to the producer.  There are overheads, losses from previous years and other matters that they have to cover. It is not for me to intervene.  The fact that the Deputy has raised the matter here will perhaps result in highlighting the issue. Incidentally during normal discussions with the farm organisations they have never requested me to make representations to the dairy co-operatives because they are well capable of doing that themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand that the co-operatives may not want to pass on the full price increase which developed as a result of the stronger market.  They are probably entitled to retain some of it. Nevertheless, as much as 5p a gallon is involved and nationally that would come to a total somewhere in the region of £50 million to £55 million being lost to the farming community.  That is a very considerable amount, if that is true.  It can be corroborated to some extent because of the huge difference being paid for milk by some co-operatives.  Obviously, there is some uisce faoi thalamh on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy particularly, as former Minister, will appreciate that the Department have no function at all in setting prices for creamery milk. Secondly, the fact that someone of his status and experience raised the matter publicly may give rise to further discussion.  There has been buoyancy in prices in the whole dairy sector this year over last year, which I welcome.  Incidentally, some of this is attributable to efforts made by the Deputy himself as Minister in 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I see some merit in the concept of national cereal quotas, there was no support for such a mechanism at the recent European Council.  The Council decided on a figure of 160 million tonnes as a guarantee threshold for cereal production in the Community in the marketing years 1988-89 to 1991-92 but it is not proposed that this <Col N="863" /> figure be divided up between member states.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not; I did not say that.  I have constantly raised the question of a national quota at the Council of Ministers but I am sorry to tell the Deputy that, with the possible exception of one other country, I was on my own.  We discussed this matter at considerable length and I do not see any possibility of a national quota being agreed, although I would favour it in Ireland's case.  As regards the dangers involved in what has been agreed at the European Council, it is very important to acknowledge quite the opposite.  First, as far as our cereal growers are concerned the European Community threshold, before any co-responsibility levy applies, has been increased to 160 million tonnes. I want to put that in the context of the production levels which in 1986 were 154 million tonnes and in 1987, 153 million tonnes.  The likelihood is that there may not be any penalty by way of co-responsibility.  The second point I wish to make, and this is particularly relevant to small producers here, is that they will be exempt from the impact of the co-responsibility levy.  That will cover the vast bulk of our producers.  Once again, I am waiting for the regulation to be proposed at the Council of Ministers.  I do not think that what emerged at the European Council was a disaster from our point of view; it was quite the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear there is an opportunity to raise the matter again and <Col N="864" /> that the regulation has not yet been settled and must come before Council.  It is also clear, and the experts so advise me, that the big producers in the Paris Basin, in East Anglia and in parts of Italy can absorb the co-responsibility levy and the extra 3 per cent cut far greater than the small producers such as ours.  Is there not a great danger that, unless we have a national quota such as applies to milk and sugar, our cereal producers may be wiped out as a consequence of the activities of the major producers on the Continent and in the UK?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the nature of our cereal production and the size of our producers by comparison with those in the Paris Basin and elsewhere, our producers will be, by and large, exempt from the co-responsibility levy but not all of them will be exempt.  The French, British and German producers are very concerned that this exemption applies to small producers only and to that extent we achieved a major success. The stabilising proposal in respect of cereal substitutes was intended to effect a reduction of the support prices but I am quite satisfied that we have achieved the best possible outcome.  One other matter which is of vital importance is that what we argued for at Council of Ministers level and at the General Council of Foreign Ministers, where I also attended for a time, has now been put into the minutes of the European Council, namely, that the European Council has called on the Commission to press for an appropriate solution to the problems arising in connection with the imports of cereal substitutes into the Community.  That is a major breakthrough and I hope we get the balance right across the board.</P>

    <P>The IFA response to the September proposals was made on 22 December and their fresh proposals were discussed in detail with them on 11 January and in broader terms on 16 February.  The veterinary bodies, the Irish Veterinary Association and the Irish Veterinary Union, presented, on 25 January, a joint memorandum broadly welcoming the <Col N="866" /> Minister's proposals and raising a number of questions.</P>
    <P>There has been a generally favourable reaction by the organisations concerned to my proposals for changes in the bovine TB scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply has been a little evasive.  I am particularly interested in the management structures. The original proposal which I made in my draft policy document in June last year and which I understood the Minister was taking on board, was that there would be a management board on which there would be a strong farmer representation, to which they are entitled because they have contributed £22 million.  Will the Minister confirm to the House that the procedures he has in mind to be put into effect this year will involve a management board, not an advisory board, with a strong farmer input.</P>

I hope the Deputy will appreciate that as soon as I returned after Christmas I advanced these as quickly as possible. Incidentally, I should say that no agreement was reached between the farming and veterinary associations.  Of course, if <Col N="867" /> agreement was always forthcoming we could all move very quickly.  I want to assure the Deputy that what I am doing is following the line he suggested and what we had proposed.

      <P>Following recent discussions with the interests concerned, the technical aspects of a scheme for maintaining the national beef cow herd, including the financing of it, have been largely settled.  I will circulate the details of the scheme as I expect it to operate to the organisations involved this week.  The scheme will provide the backdrop to the campaign for an increase in suckler cows which was successfully conducted by ACOT last season and which is being relaunched shortly.  The ACOT drive to reduce calf mortality through better management will also contribute significantly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of live sheep for radiation commenced last summer and covered flocks in upland areas with peaty soil where the rainfall was heavy when the radiation plume from the Chernobyl nuclear accident passed over this country in early May 1986.</P>
      <P>The monitoring covered flocks in upland areas of Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Waterford, Kilkenny, Louth and Wicklow.  A summary of the results of this monitoring was published in a joint statement issued by my Department and the Nuclear Energy Board on 4 February 1988.  Briefly the monitoring showed that 98 per cent of the sheep tested were found to have radio-caesium levels below the internationally accepted action level of 1,000 becquerels per kilogram.  The 2 per cent which showed levels higher than the 1,000 becquerels were, for the most part, sheep retained on farms for breeding purposes.</P>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board report referred to by Deputy Stagg indicated that 89 of the 130 farms (68 per cent) on which live monitoring of sheep was conducted could be regarded as having flocks with more than one animal per thousand having a radio-caesium level over 600 becquerels per kilogram.  It did not indicate that 68 per cent of the sheep in the county could be affected by high levels of radiation.</P>
      <P>The normal practice in these upland areas is to move the lambs to lowland pasture for a period of two to four months prior to slaughter.  This move to lowland pasture results in a halving of caesium levels every two weeks, which ensures that the sheep, even the limited number over 1,000 becquerels per kilogram when on the mountain, are well under the EC safety standard of 600 bq. per kg. for meat at time of slaughter.  This is confirmed by the live monitoring of sheep which is also conducted at slaughter premises and the monitoring of samples of sheepmeat at butchers shops throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme of monitoring will be <Col N="871" /> continued so as to ensure that sheepmeat sold for consumption does not represent any health problem and that there is no cause for any consumer concern.  Last month's results further confirm that our sheepmeat is well within specified limits; no animal tested exceeded 600 bqs. per kg. and over 96 per cent were under 100bqs. per kg.  Our vigilance at point of slaughter is the most effective and reassuring measure we can take not only for consumers but for the image of our food products in general.</P>
    <P>Our export trade in sheepmeat is with member states of the EC and we have not experienced any difficulty in meeting the EC limit of 600 bq. per kg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that 600 becquerels of radio-caesium per kilogram constitutes the Irish and EC limits, not the 1,000 becquerels per kilogram to which he referred?  Will he confirm that the latter is the British level, taking account of their nuclear industry? Further, will he say why it took so long before action was taken by his Department?  Why was it that the Northern Ireland authorities had to impose restrictions before there was any action taken by his Department?  Why did we lag so far behind in that regard?  Furthermore, will the Minister ensure that the findings of the Nuclear Energy Board are published since it is a matter of concern to the public to the industry and consumers generally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that the 1,000 becquerels per kilogram was the internationally accepted action level of radio-caesium.  The Deputy is quite right &mdash; the 600 becquerels per kilogram constitues the European standard and we have been to the forefront in endeavouring to have that level reduced.  Therefore, it will be seen that we are well within the lower European standard.  As far as our being slow in reacting, I should say the fact of the matter is that quite the opposite was the case.  What may have happened in relation to the North of Ireland is a different matter for a variety <Col N="872" /> of reasons.  We took immediate action to ensure that sheepmeat in our jurisdiction conformed to the standards I have mentioned in my reply.

    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1)  The holder of an abattoir licence shall only transfer the licence to another person who is deemed fit by the Minister for Agriculture, and who subsequently sanctions such transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the holder of an abattoir licence dies the licence shall continue in full force and effect for the benefit of the licence holder's personal representative, or as the case may be, his spouse or any other member of his family, for the period then unexpired of the term of the licence, and such spouse, or personal representative <Col N="899" /> shall be entitled to apply for the renewal of the licence in the ordinary way.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment because the Bill, as currently drafted, seeks to exclude the transfer of a business from father to son.  It gives the Minister power, within two months of the death of the owner, to rescind or withdraw the licence, which has very sinister implications for family butchers in towns and villages throughout the country.  If the section is allowed to stand, there will be no incentive for a person with a public house to transfer it to his son or next of kin.  In the interests of continuity, such a licence, subject to my amendment, should remain with the family and they should be given the right to have it renewed in their name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to allow for the transfer of abattoir licences and to alter the provisions relating to continuance of the licence on the death of a licence holder.  I cannot see the need to provide that a licence may be transferred on the lines suggested by Deputy McCoy.  The whole purpose of the subsection is to ensure that a licence &mdash; which has to be renewed annually &mdash; will not be passed on with the sale or lease of an abattoir. In such circumstances, it will be necessary for the new owner or occupier to make a fresh application for a licence.  This is necessary to ensure that the new owner or occupier is a fit and proper person to hold a licence, as required by the provisions of section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCoy's amendment serves no purpose other than to involve the Minister as a party to the transfer of the premises and it will have to be resisted. It is cumbersome and an ineffective approach to the situation.  It could also involve a breach of confidentiality by the Minister.  Subsection (2) as it stands does not preclude the legal personal representative, spouse or any other member of a deceased licence holder's family from applying for a renewal of the licence in <Col N="900" /> the ordinary course.  Accordingly, Deputy McCoy's amendment is unnecessary.  Indeed, in certain circumstances, it could be a disadvantage to some people, for example, where the licence was within a week of expiring, as the amendment makes no provision for this while the existing subsection does.  In regard to the latter, I hope to improve the concession of two months when we are discussing amendment No. 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section which the Minister feels it is not necessary to amend gives him power over the sale or disposal of an abattoir or business involving an abattoir.  My amendment stated that the licence should only be transferred to someone who is deemed fit by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and who subsequently sanctions such transfer.  The wording is unnecessarily restrictive in the section as it stands and if a person has gone to the expense of providing an abattoir which complies with the regulations in terms of hygiene and so on which the Minister has laid down, it will not be much of an incentive for him to discover that the continuity of a family business will be at the discretion of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When a licence holder dies, it is reasonable that facilities should exist for the continuance of the licence for the benefit of his personal representative, a spouse or any other member of the family.  This can and will be done and I have made every arrangement to ensure that the dependants of licence holders are facilitated in every way.  It will be similar to the annual renewal of licences, if a person is deemed suitable and fit, there should be no difficulty in receiving such a licence.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), line 22, to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for accepting my amendment and incorporating it in his own list of amendments.  Having considered the section as originally set out, it appeared that where the death of a licence holder took place and a period of 11 months unexpired licence remained, that person's family would have an advantage over the family of a licence holder who died with, say, a month or two unexpired licence.  This amendment brings it into line in regard to the various administrative problems that usually arise in the case of a death and transfer of the property to another member of the family and it should meet the requirements that will be incumbent on the next licence holder.  It will also give them sufficient time to get their affairs in order, to put in their application and to comply with the regulations as set out in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now move on to amendment No. 7 in the name of the Minister.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 14 are cognate and Nos. 9 and 16 are cognate and are related to No. 7.  It is proposed to take amendments Nos. 7, 9, 14 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Whenever the Minister considers it proper to refuse an application for the grant or renewal of an abattoir licence, he shall, by at least 21 days notice in writing, notify the applicant of his intention to refuse the application and of the reasons therefor.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose behind amendments Nos. 7, 9, 14 and 16 is to provide for an intermediate period between either refusal or revocation of abattoir or knackery licences takes place, and, moreover, before formal recourse to the Circuit Court on appeal becomes necessary.  The trade has been concerned about the Bill's appeal provisions where a licence was being either refused or revoked.  We had comprehensive discussions with the trade and we have tried to facilitate them in every way.  They were anxious to ensure that their members could have some informal procedure available to them before having to resort to the Circuit Court on formal appeal.  These amendments meet this concern by providing that, in the first instance, notice of intention to refuse or revoke a licence must issue at least 21 days before notice of actual refusal or revocation, as the case may be, issues.  This added safeguard of 21 days advance notice will facilitate any aggrieved proprietor who feels his case may not have been adequately reported upon at the time of inspection to represent his case more fully to the Department.  Moreover, it will ensure that proprietors are not immediately catapulted into the formal appeal procedures involving the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I would like to take this opportunity also to clarify the Department's approach to licensing of premises once this Bill is up and underway.  Our approach will be quite straightforward and reasonable.  If a premises is up to licensing standard it will get a licence.  Should the premises not be up to standard but could achieve it through improvements, a temporary permit as provided for under sections 17 and 32 of the Bill will issue.  This permit will have the same force and effect as a licence.  Under this kind of system, it is unlikely that recourse to the courts will need to be invoked very often.  Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, there now will be an added safety valve period provided for proprietors through these amendments and which period does not involve any court procedures.  In other words, if a proprietor does not comply with the regulations he will be given 21 days notice that his licence may be revoked.  That period will give him an adequate opportunity to make representations to the Department, if the licence holder wishes. I should like to stress that I tabled the amendment following consultations with the trade who have found it acceptable and a reasonable resolution of the problem.</P>

      <P>The amendment in principle is good and will lead to more reasonable discussion between the Department and owners of abattoirs in the event of difficulties arising.  However, I am worried about a technical point.  If the Minister says it is proper to refuse an application and then gives 21 days notice in writing of his intention to refuse to grant a licence can he, as the provision is framed, withdraw that notice of intention?  It seems to me that in section 14 there is a mandatory provision, that where the Minister decides to refuse an application he shall by notice in writing notify the applicant.  Will the Minister be able to put a stay on that notice if a reasonable case is made by the owner of the abattoir?  I should like to ask the Minister, and his advisers, to look at this matter before Report Stage.  I am concerned, because of the way subsection (2) <Col N="905" /> is framed, that it could be said that the Minister has decided and, therefore, shall issue the notice.  I am worried that the Minister might not be able to use the period of 21 days to listen to representations and, if convinced by them, to withdraw the notice.</P>

      <P>I should like to stress that before a Minister would signal his intention to withdraw or revoke a licence there would have to be a serious infringement.  Such notification will not be issued lightly.  The thrust of the Bill is to operate standards and stringent standards will have to be adhered to.  However, in this provision we are stating that the Minister will give 21 days notice of his intention to revoke a licence.  Within that period a local TD, or other people, might make representations that improvements had been carried out and in that event the Minister would not put into effect his intention to refuse or revoke a licence.</P>

      <P>I have some experience of dealing with inspectors from the Department in relation to food premises and I am aware that they are very humane and responsible people.  An individual would need to have a binder twine operation, almost, in existence before notice would be issued of intention to withdraw or revoke a licence.  I have found that every assistance possible is given to proprietors of food premises to get their premises up to standard.  As a last resort a threat is issued to withdraw a licence. In such cases it is patently clear that the proprietor is not serious about running a hygienic food premises.  Under those circumstances the 21 days provide a very reasonable opportunity for a person to put his premises in order.  It is an adequate time to show seriousness on the part of a proprietor.</P>

      <P>A person who is self-employed, especially if he works alone, can have a problem in finding time to deal with the veterinary inspector.  It has been known from time to time for personality conflicts to enter into certain relationships.  Where a person finds he has no recourse except to a solicitor, perhaps 21 days is a short period, especially when communications have broken down.  Regarding the regulations generally, what is the Minister's opinion in regard to an abattoir which may be landlocked in terms of its physical dimensions, providing no opportunity for the owner or operator to expand in order to meet the regulations as laid down by the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The period of 21 days was decided upon as the timescale for making improvements and that timescale was acceptable to the trade in our discussions with them.  It is a reasonable period, whether the person decides to contact his local representative or the Department or his legal representative. In the case of a personality conflict, it has always been the case that if a person makes contact with the Department regarding a difficulty with a local inspector, a senior inspector is sent to the premises to see that everybody is getting a fair deal.  I am certain that would be the case under this legislation.</P>
      <P>There will be a standard for premises throughout the country which will mean that slaughtering and processing will have to be carried out under hygienic conditions.  If the premises is too small in area and cannot be extended, the proprietor will have to relocate in order to have adequate space to carry on the business of slaughtering and processing in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

The reality is that it will be virtually impossible for a self-employed person to satisfy local authority requirements, apart from the veterinary and hygiene <Col N="907" /> requirements, in establishing a new abattoir elsewhere.

      <P>I generally welcome the inclusion of these subsections on the basis that the licence holder will be given at least 21 days notice of the Minister's intention to revoke a licence.  That does not apply to a permit holder.  That will obviously create greater difficulties in the interim period because 21 days might not necessarily be a sufficient time to bring the premises up to proper standards. However, a licence holder who has previously been granted a licence should be in a position to maintain these premises in proper order and 21 days notice should be sufficient to get things right if there has been some kind of setback.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments are concerned solely with tidying up a certain vagueness in the subsections to which they relate. Regarding amendment No. 8, the position is that subsection (2) (c) of section 14 as it stands could be defective in that it might imply that a premises which heretofore was not being operated as an abattoir could be allowed to operate as such while the applicant for a licence was appealing the Minister's decision not to grant him one.  This would be especially true in the case of a greenfield premises <Col N="908" /> in respect of which application is made for an abattoir licence but refused.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking about that section when I raised the question.  There is an established practice in some parts of the country whereby large kennels collect dead and worn-out animals and have them slaughtered on site and disposed of to their packs of hounds.  I know that regulations under the Public Health Act apply as well as the legislation covering the diseases of animals.  It could happen that a difficulty would arise in a very <Col N="909" /> large scale operation where the operation might run counter to what is considered under the terms of the section referred to.  What I am saying is that you could have very large kennels operating on a comparative scale to an established and licensed knackery and the same standards might not necessarily be applied.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposing the establishment of an independent tribunal to hear licence appeals, in the first instance may be <i>ultra vires.</i> My colleague Deputy O'Keeffe would know more about that than I.  However, I know what Deputy McCoy means as this proposal was debated comprehensively in the Seanad on Committee Stage.  As I mentioned earlier when introducing amendments Nos. 7 and 9, the trade were concerned about being immediately catapulted into the Circuit Court once a licence was either refused or revoked.  I re-examined the appeal provisions in the Bill and came up with the 21 days valley period povided by <Col N="911" /> those two amendments to allay such concerns.  These would provide for an informal type of appeal to proprietors prior to any involvement of the Circuit Court. The trade, I am glad to say, welcomed this proposal.  I do not think it would be in the best interests of either the trade of the Department to seek yet another buffer by way of an independent tribunal. If we were now to add another stage in the appeal process we would probably end up with the most elaborate licensing appeal system in the world.  This would be in nobody's interest, neither the butchers, the consumers nor the licensing body.  Moreover, the constitution of an independent tribunal would prove contentious, if not extremely difficult, having regard to the existence of three separate trade organisations in the long tradition of having several trade organisations for many matters in this country.  A further consideration would be the suspect legality of any decisions handed down by such tribunal given the role to be played by the Circuit Court on appeals thereto.  All in all, I believe there is no merit in providing for an independent tribunal for the reasons mentioned and particularly having regard to the new provisions contained in sections 14 and 15.</P>

They are concerned that there would be an amendment to this section.  The proposal they made to me was that it should be on the following lines, &ldquo;provided that such slaughterings can be carried out at such times as shall be approved by the local authority having regard to good business practices as is customary in the area except in the case of sick or injured animals.&rdquo;  I did not put down an amendment along those lines because I did not think it would be effective.  The spirit behind the amendment is one with which I agree.  It is important that the Minister should set these concerns at rest.  It may not be that easy to implement effective regulations which would take on board a thought of that kind.  The Minister should be aware that there is a genuine concern on the part of the trade on this issue and it is important that he would allay those fears and concerns at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Uncontrolled slaughterings at abattoirs throughout the country leading to loose veterinary examination of animals and meat would seriously undermine the provisions of the Bill.  Thus, it is necessary to regulate slaughtering times.  In this connection the <Col N="913" /> regulations will provide that local authorities, following consultation with abattoir licence holders &mdash; I want to stress that the local authorities will always have consultations with abattoir licence holders &mdash; will then go on to fix the days and times during which slaughterings may take place.  This amendment would unduly restrict local authorities in making such arrangements as it could render the fixing of slaughtering times well nigh impossible, particularly if some abattoir proprietors choose to be difficult or uncompromising in the matter.  I want to assure the Deputies and the House that sifficient flexibility will be contained in these regulations to satisfy the needs of the proprietors of premises and I expect that local authorities will, in the ordinary course, have regard to local business practices in their particular areas when arranging the times.</P>
      <P>In this connection where fixed slaughtering times are currently in operation, the Department are not aware of any problems having arisen.  Moreover, the Department recently discussed in depth the draft regulation on slaughtering times with the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association.  That body are satisfied with the consultations which have taken place and with the provisions and arrangements by local authorities.  I do not envisage any departure from those good relations and I do not see the necessity for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I require clarification from the Minister.  This Bill is aimed at butchers' abattoirs which are located mostly in towns throughout the country.  As everybody in the trade knows, virtually all butchers do their slaughtering within hours of each other. They slaughter at a particular time for the days on which they do their best business and these times are common to them all as are the times on which they do their slaughtering for the days on which their business is slack.  I cannot see in local authority areas where there are many independent abattoirs how the inspectors are going to be able to attend at all of <Col N="914" /> these abattoirs.  In some of these only a couple of cattle are slaughtered each week and this slaughtering has to fit in with the operations of the butcher in question.  That is the concern I am trying to project to the Minister for State.  It is not as simple as making arrangements, we are talking about a one-man band.  It is not as simple as dealing with a corporation which employs many people. Naturally, people are concerned that a traditional business will now have to be turned around to suit the inspectors for whom the traditional businesses will have to come up with the money to pay the fees.</P>

      <P>In page 23, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  an appeal by the licensee to a recognised independent body against a declaration by a veterinary inspector that a particular consignment of meat is unfit for human consumption.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In framing this amendment I was conscious of the fact that at times without specific analytical facilities being available to a veterinary inspector when he calls to an abattoir or a butcher's premises, a dispute might arise.  I am seeking to protect the good name of the butcher where an inspector declares a consignment of meat on the premises to be unfit for human consumption.  This is a very important point when it comes to the goodwill of the business.  It can hurt a person if a veterinary inspector declares meat unfit for human consumption.  I do not mean to suggest that each and every such declaration would lead to an appeal to an independent body, but from time to time disputes will arise.  It is to prevent those disputes from growing into confrontations or subsequent legal action that I ask the Minister to consider including a right of appeal in this legislation.</P>

      <P>There is concern about possible peremptory, unfair or unjust decisions being made by veterinary inspectors.  Most people accept that the majority of members of the veterinary profession are very objective and no difficulties would arise from their decisions, but human nature being what it is there are bound to be odd occasions <Col N="920" /> when bad blood could arise &mdash; to coin a phrase &mdash; between the butcher and the veterinary inspector.  I know the vagaries of human nature cannot be accommodated totally in official regulations and I appreciate the difficulties of establishing a further appeals procedure, but could the Minister satisfy us that the regulations ensure that if such a situation arises, the butcher or abattoir owner will have some redress and that he is not at the mercy, on that odd occasion, of the bad penny who might have a set against him?  If that concern could be put to rest, we would all be far happier.  It all depends on what is in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to allow an appeal against condemnation of meat by a veterinary inspector.  Such provision would make life intolerable and, for the inspectorate, it would be almost impossible to carry out their duties and functions under the regulations as every condemnation would be likely to be appealed.  Moreover, it would prove to be entirely inoperable given the perishable nature of the product and that meat goes off very quickly.  It would create delays and add to expense, most of which would have to fall back on the trade itself.  The adjudication of the fitness of meat for human consumption by local authority veterinary inspectors has not proved to be a problem in the past.</P>
      <P>In discussions I have heard of no instances where a veterinary inspector's adjudication was causing a problem. Meat condemnations, mostly of offals such as livers, have been taking place at domestic abattoirs.  It is hard to see why this matter should become a problem now or in the future because, to my knowledge and to the knowledge of my Department, there has been no problem in the past because meat is either fit for human consumption or it is not.  That is a simple standard and no butcher could disagree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most instances the reason for condemnation will be readily visible to the naked eye.  Furthermore, the primary reason veterinary inspectors alone are <Col N="921" /> being given this responsibility is that they will be the best qualified and most experienced in determining the fitness or otherwise of meat for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I might add that no such provision exists for the export meat plants and the absence of an appeals procedure has not proved to be a problem at these plants. As the House will be aware, the vast bulk of slaughterings are conducted at these plants with a correspondingly higher rate of condemnations than would be the case with local abattoirs.</P>
    <P>The condemnation in whole or in part of a carcase could deal a heavy blow to a small producer, and I accept that.  For that reason I am confident that individual veterinary inspectors would prove to be absolutely objective and impartial in their determination of the fitness or otherwise of meat for human consumption.  Where there may be doubt and further testing is necessary, section 36(4) and subsections (2) (e) and (2) (g) of this section provide for laboratory tests to be conducted by the public analyst or the State Laboratory.  I will closely monitor the operations of this Bill as to returns to be made by local authorities under section 60 of the Bill.  I would particularly draw Deputies' attention to section 60 (3) (b). On a regular basis I will have available to me up-to-date information on meat condemnations nationally, including the reasons for such condemnations.  It will be open to me to investigate anything that may give cause for concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the regulations for abattoir operations which provide for general hygiene and inspection of meat at any time other than a <i>post mortem</i> examination.  It is simplistic to suggest that there would be contention at all times between a veterinary or public health inspector and a butcher. The reality is that a butcher depends on selling his meat to the public and he is immediately tied to the quality of his meat.  It is not a question of trying to sell unfit meat to the public but there is a question which may arise from time to time that meat which an inspector might <Col N="922" /> consider unfit for human consumption may not be considered unfit by the butcher.  I take the Minister's point that there is a provision, even if it is not in the Bill, for further testing and checking to verify an inspector's decision.  This is what I am really getting at in this amendment. There should be a provision for a dispute arising.  It is not a question of trying to hoodwink the public with substandard products or of trying to disagree with a veterinary surgeon as to his professionalism at the <i>post mortem</i> stage.  A dispute could arise as to colouration, for instance, and a consignment of meat could be condemned by the public health inspector, and it could have been normal in the tradition of that person's operation and his customers would never have found the meat off-putting.  After all a person engaged single-handedly in business has an obligation to the public and if he reneges on that obligation he will immediately lose his business.</P>

I will have up-to-date information on meat condemnations throughout the country and if there is cause for concern I will take action then. Meat inspections have been going on down through the years without causing a problem.  Neither individual proprietors nor the trade organisations or associations have found difficulty with this provision.  They are quite satisfied with the competence, the objectivity and the impartiality of veterinary inspectors in relation to meat condemnation.</P>

I know that ultra-violet stamps are used on people for instances at dances where they use a pass-out arrangement and stamp the back of somebody's hand if he leaves the dance and wants to return later on.  Is there a similar type arrangement that could be used for a health stamp on a carcase rather than having an unsightly mark on the carcase.

    <P>We referred to the indexing of inflation and the Minister refuses to accept that. In relation to this amendment I am quite prepared to drop the indexing to inflation part of it.

      <P>The veterinary inspection fees on slaughterings provided for in section 44 are intended to provide a self-financing basis for the local authority veterinary staff, which will be necessary to operate the Bill's controls and shall be determined solely on that basis.  I cannot therefore accept Deputy McCoy's amendment seeking to index-link any variation in these fields.  His amendment begs the question as to what constitutes indexing to inflation.  There are other equally important reasons for rejecting the underlying theme of this amendment. The rates set out in the section are the same as those currently applicable at the export plants whose inspection fees are not index-linked.  Those fees were last increased as far back as 1984.  The separate index-linking of fees for domestic abattoirs could give rise to an anomalous situation between the home and the export sectors.  More particularly, the cost factor would be lost sight of.  The fees are there to ensure that this scheme is self-financing and that local authorities will have an adequate amount of finance to cover the cost of inspections under this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the table to which this amendment refers, I take into account the Minister's response to the last amendment and accept it.  However, if one considers future developments and takes into account developments in relation to similar legislation in the past, one could foresee a situation in which the scale as set out could be monitored by the Minister &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; to ensure that the trade is protected.  However, given the present straitened financial position of the various local authorities, after a period of time has elapsed the local authorities, as agents for the Department in this and other legislation, could find themselves suffering a loss, in other words, incurring responsibilities, being forced to enforce legislation which, in turn, imposes upon them a liability other than provided for in the Bill.  There are countless instances that members of local authorities can readily recognise where they, acting as agents for Government Departments, implement various Acts of the Oireachtas and take upon themselves responsibilities for so doing, incurring quite an amount of financial liability which is not provided for by this House when passing the legislation.  I am not suggesting that a change should be made whereby the trade should carry the responsibility, because the trade needs to be protected, for two reasons: first, in the present financial situation prevailing in local authorities, the tendency could well be, if the Minister did not have the right to make regulations in relation to the <Col N="926" /> table, at Estimates time to increase the fees on the table to such an extent that the trade would not be able to exist.</P>
    <P>We could not allow that to happen and, rightly, the Minister has those powers. On the other hand, because of the exercising of the powers, the local authority could find themselves operating the legislation at a loss to themselves.  It is no news to the Minister that local authorities operate roughly 300 Acts of the Oireachtas, in many of which they have no direct function other than as agents for various Government Departments. The number of Acts that local authorities are now forced to implement is increasing with each year because of the need to have a certain amount of autonomy among local authorities and a local inspectorate readily available.  Obviously, that is desirable and to be encouraged.  There is also, however, the generally accepted development of a trend whereby the authorities and various county managers within the local authorities rightly bring to our attention that they now find themselves working for State agencies and not receiving remuneration.  Our amendment states: &ldquo;Provided that such variation does not result in a loss of revenue to the Local Authority&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister could vary the table upwards or downwards as the case may be, given particular pressures that might arise at a particular time, but if he were to reduce the table, does he envisage his Department perhaps being able to subsidise the system in order to ensure that both local authorities and the trade are fully catered for?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of problems associated with this amendment and I have gone into very deep research on this.  In the first instance, it is somewhat ambiguous.  Secondly, the amendment is defective.  The word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; could be construed to mean many things.  I decided to refer to my dictionary definition of the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; and found that it means income derived from any source.  Deputies will agree that this <Col N="927" /> interpretation would be highly inappropriate and could lead to all sorts of difficulties.  Furthermore, there is a problem with the words &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo;. There will be 32 individual local authorities involved in the implementation of this Bill, including the collection of the veterinary inspection fees payable at slaughterings provided for by this section. Any variations in these fees could prove inoperable if it were possible that even one of these local authorities could claim that they would either suffer or continue to suffer a loss of revenue arising from such variation.  In other words, the amount of the variation proposed might not satisfy the condition that this amendment would impose for each and every local authority.</P>
      <P>In 1986 the Department of Agriculture and Food conducted an extensive survey in estimated cost to local authorities of this legislation.  At this stage it is as well to remind the House that supervision of abattoirs and slaughterings is not new to local authorities.  They have exercised this function since the last century.  Moreover, the costs associated with such function have been borne by local authorities down through the years without any receipts accruing to them from slaughtering inspection fees.</P>
      <P>The major cost under this Bill will arise for the 23 local authorities who will be required to employ a whole-time veterinary inspector.  Such cost is estimated at £0.6 million annually.  The estimated revenue to accrue to local authorities from the fees under this section will be of the order of £1.4 million annually.  The balance in receipts of £0.8 million will enable local authorities to provide such back-up services as are necessary, as well as covering the remuneration of the corps of part-time veterinary inspectors employed by local authorities.  The cost of the latter is estimated at £0.4 million annually.  Accordingly, for the first time ever the local authorities' veterinary service is being placed on a sound financial footing and the control measures in this Bill should prove to be self-financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if it is found necessary to <Col N="928" /> increase the rate of fees at some future stage to keep in line with costs &mdash; and I would hope that there would be no need for increase for a considerable length of time &mdash; the regulations so proposing and thus provided for in subsection (4) to the section will have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister concerned in introducing such legislation will have to justify to the satisfaction of the Houses that the increases being sought are necessary.  For all those reasons I cannot accept this amendment, as local authorities for the first time ever are being put on a sound financial footing as far as veterinary inspectors are concerned and if local authorities from time to time require an increase in fees to cover the cost of implementation of the regulations under this Bill, then it will be a matter for the Minister of the day to bring the matter to the Houses of the Oireachtas to seek an increase.  As I say, I hope that that would not happen for a considerable time.  I have given an outline of the revenue required and the costs involved and the situation is adequately covered under the regulation as it stands.</P>

In relation to my definition of revenue, it is defined under the City and County Management Act which applies to all members of local authorities; if a proposal is made, the end result of which is a reduction in revenue, or where it has not been provided in the Estimates, obviously a surcharge would apply.  That regulates very tightly the activities of local authorities in relation to such matters.  However, I accept the Minister's assurances and withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a concern about this section which has not been highlighted in the debate so far.  Section 45 deals with the payment of fees and the fee falls due when an animal is slaughtered in the abattoir and must be paid to the local authority within 28 days of the end of the month in which it fell due. Then section 46 provides for the recovery of the fees as a simple contract debt.</P>
      <P>Section 45 (4) provides that anyone who contravenes this section is guilty of an offence.  In other words, if a person is a day late with payment, he is automatically guilty of an offence.  To give an extreme example, somebody who slaughtered a pig one month, and the following month was a day late in sending in his return of 75p, would find himself liable to be charged before the District Court or on indictment, possibly fined £10,000 and sentenced to three years imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the local authorities have to be given a reasonable opportunity to get in the money due to them, but this is <Col N="930" /> taking it to the fair, if I may coin the phrase.  I want the Minister to justify the need to create an offence under section 45 as opposed to the entitlement of the local authority to recover the fee for killing the pig as a simple contract debt as provided in the next section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of section 45 (4), any person who contravenes the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence.  This makes it an offence to fail to comply with the provisions on the payment of fees.</P>
      <P>I want to give an assurance to the House that this subsection will be implemented with discretion.  There are always a number of days grace, perhaps longer, to allow people in extreme cases to make payment.  There could be extreme cases with people not paying fees for up to two years, while people paying on time and complying with the regulations are getting no benefit.  So this section is important to ensure that fees are paid, and paid within a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>This raises another issue.  The section means that the butcher or abattoir owner is automatically guilty of an offence if he is a day late in paying his fees for killing a pig.  Who takes the decision to prosecute, the Minister, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the local authority?  This is a serious issue. We are talking about the creation of an offence out of what could be a very nominal matter indeed.  The Minister should think about this.</P>

I would draw Deputy O'Keeffe's attention to the fact that the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act and the Coras Beostoic Feola Act, where similar fees are payable, have the same provisions.  In any of those it has not been brought to my notice that any undue hardship is being caused by those provisions.</P>

There is a need to justify such powers.  The example I quoted was somewhat extreme, but, in effect, this is a possibility.  I suggest that the Minister consider this.  There is a reasonable case for saying that under section 46 there is enough power for the local authority to recover their fees in the District Court in the normal way rather than making an offence out of something that might be quite trivial.</P>

      <P>I have some concern in relation to the position of authorised officers and the very draconian powers which it is proposed to give them under the Bill.  I am anxious to know how many such authorised officers the Minister is proposing to appoint under section 53. Secondly, how many does he expect the local authorities will appoint?  I would like a general picture as to who these authorised officers will be and the outline of their work.  I will then come to the question of powers given to them.  What is the reason for these authorised officers and what will they do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that both the Minister and the local authorities can appoint persons to be authorised officers for the purposes of the Bill.  It is envisaged that the Minister's authorised officers would be involved solely in the annual licensing of abattoirs and knackeries.  Such authorised officers would be Department veterinary inspectors, drawn from the meat export plants who in slack periods at those plants would conduct the annual licensing operation. Certain administrative personnel involved in licensing and the maintenance of the central record of licences may also be required to be made authorised officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons appointed by local authorities to be authorised officers for the purposes of this Bill will be, in the main, the veterinary inspectorate corps.  In a small number of areas environmental health officers from the health boards are engaged on an agency basis by local authorities to assist their veterinary inspectors.  Such officers may, too, be authorised, as would lay assistants and certain administrative personnel.  In addition, where, for instance under the provisions of section 35 of this Bill, two local authorities pool together for the purpose of providing the whole time veterinary inspector required, such inspector would be appointed by each of the authorities concerned to be an authorised officer.  Local authority authorised <Col N="933" /> officers will be concerned with the supervision of slaughterings, detection of unlicensed premises and unstamped meat, collection of slaughtering inspection fees and supervision of knackeries.</P>

      <P>I sometimes wonder whether the general public or indeed all the legislators realise the kind of draconian powers that are given to various people under the legislation that comes before this House.  We have had the background from the Minister as to who these authorised officers will be.  Under section 54 they will be entitled, I presume without warrant &mdash; the Minister might confirm that in his reply &mdash; to kick down the door and enter any premises which is being used or which they reasonably suspect is being used as an abattoir or a knackery.  They will have powers in relation to vehicles which they have reasonable suspicion are being used in connection with an abattoir or a knackery and they will have powers in relation to the taking of copies, or the removal of any records found on such premises or vehicles.  There is need for the Minister to fully justify in a democracy the provision of such draconian powers to people who will be officials of his own Department or of local authorities.  It is necessary to justify any diminution of civil liberties.  This section proposes to give powers to authorised officers without any need, as far as I can see, to go to a District Court or even a peace commissioner.  The Minister will have to justify the need for <Col N="934" /> such powers on the basis that the civil liberties of those involved in the trade will be restricted and limited by the giving of such powers to authorised officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my more legally minded colleague, I have some reservations about the powers conferred on the authorised officer.  For instance, section 54 (1) (a) and (b) states: &ldquo;enter, by force if necessary,...&rdquo;; paragraph (c) refers to the production of records, and paragraph (d) states: &ldquo;take copies of, or remove, any records....&rdquo;.  If those powers were to apply to the implementation of various other Acts of the Oireachtas affecting the citizens there would be somewhat more reservation expressed by the community.  I know there are good reasons for having that section &mdash; for instance, if an illegal abattoir or knackery exists, obviously in order to ensure that standards are kept the Minister and/or his agents have the right to gain access in order to protect the public interest.  By the same token they should also have due regard to the civil rights and liberties of the people they are dealing with.</P>
      <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that no extraordinary force would be used in order to gain access to premises which would result perhaps in bringing the legislation into disrepute, and that force would not be used too widely.  The interpretation of the Bill should not be too broadly based.  Paragraph (a) states: &ldquo;enter, by force if necessary, and inspect any premises which is, or which he reasonably suspects is, being used as an abattoir or as a knackery&rdquo;. The same applies in relation to transport vehicles.  I hope the powers under the Bill will not be extended beyond that for which they were intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I can give an assurance that the Bill will not be used in any draconian way or beyond what is necessary to implement its provisions. On the ground of experience it has been shown that physical threats to local authority officers investigating illegal slaughterings are fairly commonplace and this <Col N="935" /> was brought very graphically and starkly to the attention of the country recently when this kind of cowboy behaviour took place.  It is only in such situations that these powers will be implemented. Already, under the provisions of section 36, a veterinary inspector has been granted power to enter and inspect any abattoir or knackery.  We are here talking about a marginal number of abattoirs, knackeries or people involved in activities which have to be terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 54 (1) (a) gives power to an authorised officer of a member of the Garda Síochána to enter any premises at any time which either is or which such officer has grounds for believing is being used as an abattoir or a knackery.  The stipulation of &ldquo;by force if necessary&rdquo; will cover circumstances in which, for example, a lock may have to be broken to gain entry, particularly where an unlicensed premises may be concerned. Without such stipulation powers of entry to premises would be severely restrained, that is, it could be successfully claimed by a proprieter that an authorised officer or member of the Garda Síochána had no power or right to use force in order to gain access.  Under subsection (1) (b) the powers of entry and inspection contained therein complement those contained in subsection (1) (a).  Trucks, vans and containers are part and parcel of the meat trade.  From time to time an authorised officer will need to check out the condition of such meat and vehicles and, moreover, the condition and legality of any meat contained therein under subsections (1) (c) and (d).  In the case of a licensed premises the provisions of section 59 of this Bill place an obligation on a licence holder to keep records of all animals slaughtered or handled on the premises.  The checking of such records by an authorised officer will be necessary from time to time to ensure that all animals or carcases are accounted for.  This would be necessary particularly in the case of detection of illegal slaughterings or falsely-stamped meat.  It may also happen, for instance, that records of van sales of meats would far out-weigh the <Col N="936" /> number of animals slaughtered at an abattoir from which such meat originated illegally.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 33 of the Bill confer powers on an authorised officer to suspend operations of an abattoir or knackery where there is grave and immediate danger to public or animal health, or both.  To ensure absolute objectivity in the exercise of this power the provisions of this subsection will allow certain authorised persons only to be suspensory officers.  In this connection it is envisaged that the power would be confined by local authorities to their whole time veterinary officers.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House and Deputies opposite that no draconian measures will be taken under the provisions of this section, rather only those that are found to be necessary.  But it should be remembered that we are dealing with people who are not exactly the essence of propriety nor gentlemen.  As I have said, physical threats to authorised and local authority officers investigating illegal slaughterings are fairly commonplace.  I am satisfied that the provisions of this section are necessary to put a stop to this illegal, very dangerous practice, dangerous to human or animal health, or both. I am satisfied that, without the powers contained in this section, it would be quite impossible to implement these regulations.</P>

      <P>It has taken the Minister some time to justify the provisions of this section and explain them.  To put my mind further at ease perhaps he would clarify something for me: the civil liberties of those being limited by the provisions of the section essentially are those who are involved in the trade, the butchers and abattoir owners.  Are the members of the Irish Master Butchers' Federation fully aware of these powers? Have they been discussed with them and are they perfectly happy that this type of provision is necessary?</P>

      <P>In the ongoing and long discussions taking place with the trade in relation to the provisions of the Bill generally it was gratifying to find that <Col N="937" /> there was pressure being brought to bear on the political head of the Department of Agriculture and Food and their officials to expedite the passage of this Bill and to raise the standards of hygiene and quality in relation to the meat industry generally.  They did not raise any objection whatsoever and had no difficulty in relation to the provisions of this section or indeed any other.  Rather it was thought the Department or their officials could facilitate the trade.  I should say that we have bent over backwards to do so.</P>
      <P>Very stringent regulations will be introduced under the provisions of this Bill.  I should say that the trade are pushing for and insisting on the highest standards and they have no difficulty in relation to the powers to be vested in authorised officers under the provisions of this section.  They have made the point to me that those who might be termed generally as cowboy operators bring the trade generally into disrepute.  Several Members of this House have made the point that 99 per cent of proprietors and people involved in abattoirs and the meat business have a long-standing tradition, usually a family one of which they are very proud.  They are outstanding citizens in their own right and want to have the reputation of the best of them established as the norm.  It is their belief that the activity of a very small number, bringing the whole trade into disrepute, should be discontinued.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Summary proceedings for an offence under this Act may be instituted within six months from the date of the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will understand the import of my amendment.  It is the natural concern of those in the trade operating in a legitimate way that, where an offence has been proved to the satisfaction of inspectors, proceedings would be instituted within six months rather than two years as is stated in subsection (2). The thinking behind this amendment is that, to a certain extent, there is a two-year period or interval in which an impending prosecution would allow <Col N="939" /> somebody to operate in the meantime. Very often, after two years it is very hard to prove a case.  For this reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in good faith as it is meant to give better effect to the provision he is making to prosecute offenders under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have a job convincing me that the two year provision should stand.  When I practised as a lawyer the normal time in a District Court for any statutory offence was a six months period within which the summons had to be issued.  It is putting all the cards into the hands of the officials and letting dust gather on them for two years before a summons is issued.  That is unacceptable and there is no justification for it.</P>
      <P>A variety of offences are specified &mdash; some quite serious &mdash; and the offenders should be prosecuted without any lethargy on the part of the officials.  If people are involved in breaking the law they should be hauled before the courts at the earliest possible opportunity.  There is a saying that justice delayed is justice denied and justice would certainly not be done if a file was lying in a Department for two years before someone is prosecuted.  I hope we will rethink this matter between now and Report Stage.  Under the Bill as it stands, a butcher who killed a pig and who neglected within the following month to send on the fee of 55p is guilty of an offence which could be hanging over his head for two years.  I know it is an extreme example but it could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the sooner these matters are brought before the courts the better for everybody, especially witnesses, whose recollections would be fresh if the matter was brought to court speedily.  I am a bit rusty in regard to the law as I have not practised for a while but I think I am correct in saying that if the matter is serious there is no time limit and it can go on indictment.  Therefore, the Minister is not justified in saying that a serious matter might escape prosecution because of files not being completed.  I strongly <Col N="940" /> urge the Minister to take on board the points raised by Deputy McCoy and myself.  The simple amendment in the names of Deputy Durkan and myself is the answer &mdash; substitute &ldquo;six months&rdquo; for &ldquo;two years&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by the last two speakers in relation to this section.  The authorised officer mentioned in various other sections of the Bill could ultimately be the person or persons to take a prosecution and they would have a very accurate, documented account of the situation prevailing at the time of the alleged offence, whereas the person who allegedly committed the offence might not have such a well documented report of what happened two years later.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to institute proceedings within two years but it does not necessarily mean that those proceedings will be concluded within that time which, in turn, could involve the whole system in extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure, bureaucracy and overlapping of various functions.  It could also bring a burden to bear on the enforcing authority &mdash; in this case the local authority &mdash; and the judicial processes whereby there could be a long drawn out argument two and a half or three years after the event as to the exact nature of the alleged offence. On the one hand you could &mdash; rightly &mdash; have a well documented report from the officer who carried out the inspection because, naturally, they are expected to write a report on the day the offence occurred which would be ultimately submitted in court and placed against the recollection of the person who, allegedly, committed the offence.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting is probably an extreme extension of the situation which might develop but in the case of a personality clash between the authorised officer and the slaughterhouse operator, memories could become impaired if the institution of proceedings was delayed for two years.  A move towards the six months mentioned in the amendment would be beneficial.</P>

      <P>It is my wish under the Bill and regulations that proceedings could be instituted without delay at the earliest possible time.  I previously considered a reduction of time when it was put to me but I found that in certain circumstances perhaps a reduction to six months might limit prosecutions.  I have in mind a situation where extensive investigations might prove necessary in detecting the supply source of an illegal consignment of meat or the stamping instruments.  Such investigations initiated by one local authority could perhaps straddle and involve other local authorities.  On completion of the investigations, a local authority could find their intended prosecution stymied by a statutory bar of six months.</P>
      <P>That is why I am concerned that the period of six months might let certain people off the hook.  This would not be in anybody's interest, least of all the consumer and indeed the bona fide trade. The provision allowing prosecutions to be conducted up to two years after the date of the offence is standard in relation to other legislation in the agricultural area, including Acts which have a bearing on abattoirs, for example, the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, the CBF Act of 1979, and the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience under the disease eradication schemes has shown that the two years currency for instituting proceedings under those schemes has proved to be very necessary.  I am prepared to ask my officials to review this matter and, perhaps, before Report Stage we could reach a compromise.  We do not want to allow matters to drag on and the legislation to become dust filled.  The idea behind suggesting a period of two years was to ensure that nobody escapes the net.  I take the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe that indictable procedures may be instituted at any time and that the restriction on time applies to summary proceedings only.  I have an open mind about this but it is important to stress that the intention is to ensure that those who <Col N="942" /> are involved in illegal transport or processing of meat are dealt with.  The term of six months was too short.  I expect that proceedings will be instituted well within the suggested time limit.  However, in cases where indepth investigations involving several local authorities have to be carried out more than six months may be required.  I will discuss the matter with my colleagues to see if we can agree on a more appropriate time scale.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has made a gallant attempt to justify the two year period but it appears that he has only gone half of the way towards meeting our wishes.  If an offence is serious it can be prosecuted on indictment at any time.  We must remember that we are dealing with minor offences which can be dealt with by way of summary jurisdiction before the District Court.  In my view the Minister has not justified the need for a two-year period. However, he has opened the door in regard to a compromise on this.  This is not a political issue and we are all trying to ensure that a fair balance is struck and that an effective piece of legislation leaves the House.  I should like to respond to the Minister's last comments by indicating that there may be some justification for allowing his officials a little more than six months to complete their investigations.  It may be that it would be better to meet us half way.  If the Minister introduced an amendment on Report Stage specifying a 12-month period rather than two years we would be satisfied.  In my view 12 months would be ample time to complete even the most difficult investigations.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the making of regulations by the Minister in relation to the construction, lay-out, water supply and equipment for premises used as abattoirs or knackeries.  I am interested in abattoirs.  In an earlier response to one of my questions when we were discussing the physical limitations of an abattoir by reason of it being landlocked and so on and also taking into account the regulations in relation to the abattoir's operations with butchers preparing meat for deep freezers and others engaged in the processing of offals, the Minister said that abattoirs involved in such activities would have to be resited. He said that the resiting of the abattoir would be subject to planning approval. Such a process will involve the owners of abattoirs in purchasing expensive sites away from residential areas and in the construction of suitably adapted premises.  They will have to ensure that the new site for the abattoir is far removed from housing estates but such sites are always a distance from sewerage systems. Local authorities will expect such people to instal effluent treatment plants and there will have to be strict compliance with environmental laws which apply to the discharge of effluent into rivers and streams.  In order to comply with these regulations, which are 20 parts per million BOD and 10 parts per million suspended <Col N="944" /> solids, abattoir owners will have to make huge investments in plant.  I have no doubt that they will find it more expensive to comply with the environmental regulations in relation to emissions from such plants than to construct the new abattoir.  In my view some of the provisions of the Bill will spell the demise of a number of family businesses that are now operating in a correct way.  They will find it impossible to operate within the provisions of the Bill in that they will not be able to resite the abattoir and comply with local authority regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I must question whether there is a necessity for the setting up of this tribunal.  During my speech on Second Stage I expressed considerable doubt as to its necessity.  I also questioned the taking away of these matters from the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuation tribunal is to consist of three individuals who will be travelling around the country hearing these cases. <Col N="946" /> A secretariat will have to be appointed and undoubtedly a large number of staff will be attached to the tribunal.  This will entail very considerable expense because of the peripatetic nature of the tribunal's work.  The structure already exists for having these cases heard in open court before a Circuit Court judge.  At a time of very scarce resources when everybody is told about the need for financial prudence, I have reservations about the wisdom of setting up this totally new structure.  Will they have their own headquarters and if so where will they be situated?  How many people will be attached to the tribunal?  Will there be ten, 15 or 20 people involved in hearing the valuations around the country or will there be a limited number of people? Each sitting of the tribunal will consist of three people but certainly a secretariat will be involved as well.</P>
    <P>When so many efforts are being made in different spheres to reduce costs and overheads and where people are laid off from different positions this item strikes me as being an unnecessary luxury which the country can ill afford.  When bodies like An Foras Talúntais and ACOT are being done away with and when doctors and nurses and civil servants are being laid off I doubt whether, at present, there is a demand for this valuation tribunal.  I question it and I am concerned about it. Can we now afford to set up this valuation tribunal?  I do not think we can afford it. I have not heard of any demand for it.  I know there are some valuers who have been unhappy with our courts system. The point the Minister made on Second Stage, which is reasonable enough, was that the required expertise may not be there and that it would involve a good knowledge of planning and valueing of properties and so on and that only qualified people would be appointed on the valuation tribunal, people who would have the necessary expertise in deciding on particular cases.</P>
    <P>Surely the different judges who would be appointed would have that expertise and the case would be put on behalf of the Valuation Office on the one hand and, on the other hand, by the appellant. <Col N="947" /> Judges are deciding on matters of far greater intricacy and of greater delicacy and say that they might not be particularly competent to make decisions on valuations is an argument that holds very little credibility.  It is a weak argument and not one that I could willingly accept.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline to the House, how we on the final Stages of the Bill, it having already passed through the Seanad, precisely whether three people will be sitting on the hearings? How many people does he envisage will be attached to the valuation tribunal? Will the tribunal be setting up its own headquarters?  Where will these people have their head office?  How many staff does the Minister envisage will be attached to the head office?  There is no demand for this particular valuation tribunal.  At a time of very scarce resources when everybody is being told to cut back and to tighten their belt I doubt the necessity for such a tribunal and I have great reservations about it in that the cost will have to be met.</P>
    <P>In the later sections of the Bill fees are prescribed and the person who will have to pay those is the small shopkeeper down the country when his valuation is increased.  The small factory who is not satisfied with their valuation will also have to pay these fees.  Alternatively, if it is not paid for by those who are appealing it will have to be paid for by the taxpayer.  As the resources are scarce I think they could be better spent elsewhere.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to follow on in the general direction in which Deputy Enright is going but with one or two qualifications.  The first is that there is a statable case for the tribunal on the ground that what is required is the degree of continuity as between different rating judgments taken in different Circuit Courts and by different judges.  The whole process of determining a valuation appeal is one which is, by its very nature, an artificial process because the statutory basis of valuation, even though improved <Col N="948" /> by the 1986 Act, still remains a rather Archaean art to put it mildly.  The idea of deciding what the annual letting value of a premises in mid-19th century was and determining people's liability to pay a municipal property tax on that basis is itself rather strange.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Act, as I understand it, at least had the benefit for the first time that it allowed the courts to do what they had already been doing unofficially &mdash; and to some extent without any legal mandate whatsoever &mdash; and that was to do some justice in the matter by having regard to other valuations which applied and not applying the strict letter of the law in relation to what evaluation of a premises should actually be.  The tone of the rating list had always to be maintained with regard to the differentials between valuations of different properties.  On the basis of that philosophy of maintaining the tone of the list the courts found themselves entitled, as a matter of moral justice, if not legal justice, to depart from the principle of establishing the literal annual value of premises and substituting this extraordinary notion of historic annual value related to a bygone age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I believe that since courts are being asked at present to entertain appeals in circumstances in which the volume of appeals varies very much from one place to another and the nature of the appeals heard by Circuit Court judges changes fairly dramatically from case to case and where principles which are brought to bear on rating appeals also are ones which are not easily obtained and are not part of the general corpus of the law as lawyers understand it, it has been my experience that it is becoming a very <i>recherché</i> subject for lawyers to practice in.  It is one in which the availability of a volume of case law is not there to make it simply understood to the layman or even to the legal practitioner who is suddenly forced to deal with a rating appeal.  No doubt, Deputy Enright has extensive practice in the matter but I know of many legal practitioners who do not have such expertise and to whom the whole thing is a frightening process.  From that point of view when some of those <Col N="949" /> legal practitioners end up on the bench I wonder if they have an accumulated expertise in valuation law such as would enable them to bring their intellectual faculties to bear on the issue before them in an educated way.  I doubt it very much in some cases.  They have to learn the law as they go along and that is somewhat unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I welcome the principle of a tribunal where the same standards will be applied, presumably throughout the country, and the personnel will specialise in dealing with the issues before them, but I do have some reservations about the totally open nature of the tribunal as regards eligibility for membership.  Is it to be the case that anybody who has any degree of experience will be eligible for appointment?  I am not trying to create a preserve for lawyers.  Should there not be some statutory criteria on which someone's eligibility should be decided?  On looking through the First Schedule to the Bill it struck me that the circumstances in which a person could be appointed are very vague and they are open effectively to the appointment of virtually anyone to serve as a member of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In respect of section 2, I agree there is no demand for a tribunal of this kind. One could not imagine there being demonstrations on the streets calling for the establishment of this tribunal or that the Circuit Court should not exercise a function in this matter.  This strikes me as being a minor improvement and a tinkering with a subject which has a huge flaw built into its very heart and that is the nature of the valuation process itself. If we are to finance local government out of property taxes, such as rates on commercial and industrial premises, we should at some stage apply our minds to the fairness or otherwise of that as a tax base and to the issue as to whether as between different forms of premises it is possible within the concept of annual value to decide fairly between the burden that should be borne between a hotel on the one hand and a factory on the other in supporting the activities of local <Col N="950" /> government.</P>
    <P>Even though this tribunal is welcome from the point of view that it would establish fairness and continuity in relation to dealing with particular kinds of decisions, it seems we have not faced up adequately to a different question which is whether it is possible within the concept of annual value to direct the tribunal's mind in any way to the issue of what is the fair annual value of a hotel, a processing plant or a fixed crane in a coalyard as between themselves.  Theoretically, why should a hotel in Dublin have a valuation of between £7,000 and £12,000 and a coalyard a valuation of £200?  What theoretical basis is there for deciding those relative values?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are all sorts of concepts such as profitability which are taken into account and that there are concepts such as social function which somehow subliminally seem to be taken into account, but I ask the Minister of State is it not time that we set out a rational basis for deciding as between different classes of property what relative annual values they should be given.  I can see as between one hotel and another it is possible to say that the Gresham Hotel is more or less valuable than the Royal Dublin Hotel and should bear a heavier proportion of the burden of municipal rates and I can see how in that context you can ask a tribunal to adjust their liability to municipal rates by reference to their annual value, but I cannot see how the same can be done in relation to a comparison between, say, a solicitor's office and an accountant's office or a takeaway premises and an hotel.  I do not see how it is possible within the concept of annual value to attack that intellectual task of deciding how much of the burden of municipal tax yield each of those two premises should bear.</P>
    <P>That to me is an issue which the legislature has run away from.  We ran away from it in relation to agricultural rates and, as a result, they were completely annihilated by the courts.  Although by the 1986 Act and by this particular measure things are becoming more fair, there is still a fundamental irrationality at the <Col N="951" /> heart of it.  I ask the Minister of State, and I would like to hear his views on it as to whether we should not go towards a more objective basis for deciding liability to rates such as the value of the premises on the open market.  People at least would be able to say that their coalyard is worth £30,000 while that hotel is worth £3 million and therefore, because it is worth only 3 per cent of the value of the other building they should shoulder only that portion of the rateable valuation.  If open market value is to be the yardstick for determining liability for municipal rates, why should we not at some stage get into the business of enshrining that principle in our laws because it occurs to me that this tribunal will be asked to make slightly fairer a rather irrational process.</P>
    <P>The last question I would like to ask in that context &mdash; I do not want to stray too far from section 2 of this Bill &mdash; is that I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind whether the principle of what is being done here is consistent with a square footage tax on domestic dwellings to support the local authorities' tax base?  If the Government are thinking in terms of square footage as a basis of imposing taxes on domestic dwellings in lieu of domestic rates, would it not be fairer to have a more comprehensive and rational basis, that is, based on the value of the property and nothing to do with square footage in one case and annual value in another?  I ask the Minister of State in connection with this tribunal and in justifying this section to indicate a few of his deeper thoughts on the process of rateable valuation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked again through the First <Col N="952" /> Schedule to the Bill and I ask the Minister of State whether it is necessary that the chairperson of the tribunal must be a lawyer?  He indicated in his speech on Second Stage that the chairperson would be a lawyer and I have my reservations about that.  I would like to know whether the Minister of State has considered that matter afresh in the light of some of the comments which were made in this House during Second Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of points have been made in the three contributions made and I will do my best to answer them.  Deputy Enright opened the debate on Committee Stage and I would like to assure him on a number of points.  It should be borne in mind that the tribunal will take some pressure off the courts which are already overloaded. Many cases are a long time awaiting hearing in the courts.  It is a good thing to ease the pressure on the courts as it will have the result that there will be decisions in the many legal cases which are awaiting a hearing.  The main purpose in setting up this tribunal is that there will be expedition in the taking of decisions <i>vis-à-vis</i> valuations and revisions which are awaiting decision.</P>
      <P>In terms of cost, I do not expect that the tribunal will cost very much.  The secretariat will be supplied from within the existing staff of the Civil Service by way of redeployment.  Some of the bodies to which Deputy Enright referred might have some expertise which could be availed of in the Valuation Tribunal and maybe their deployment would be a good thing.  This could not be regarded as a luxury; it is an essential body which will act in a very fair and consistent way for all the people concerned with valuations. Professional valuers in the private sector have often recommended a tribunal, and a number of individual judges, too, have recommended tribunals over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell spoke about the members of the tribunal.  I want to reiterate what I said on Second Stage.  It is the intention to have a chairman, and deputy <Col N="953" /> chairmen who will have legal qualifications.  They do not necessarily have to have these qualifications, but the tribunal will be sitting instead of the Circuit Court.  It will be a new body, a new tribunal deciding and determining valuations instead of the Circuit Court.  The normal practice is that when a tribunal or body is established instead of the courts, the people who head that tribunal are legally qualified.  The statute does not state that but it is expected that the chairperson and the deputy chairpersons would be legal people and that other professionally qualified and experienced people from the property and other sectors would be appointed to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright and Deputy McDowell queried the numbers on the tribunal. It is expected that three people will sit on the tribunal at all times, as is normal practice.  Deputy Enright spoke about expenses and the difficulties that would arise.  It would be expected that this would become a consistent efficient system and that it would be possible to have regional meetings where the tribunal could sit, hear cases and have them determined in the local area taking into account location and access rather than have everyone coming to Dublin to have their cases heard.  In future we could regionalise part of the tribunal if that were desired, depending on the amount of work to be done in the region.  That is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance.  I would expect the maximum to be appointed to the tribunal to be nine so that the tribunal could sit in three divisions to be constantly hearing appeals and determining the valuations.  As I said, there would be three divisions of nine people &mdash; the chairperson and two, a deputy chairperson and two and another deputy chairperson and two.  If the appeals were so numerous as to need more than that, the Minister for Finance would have the right to increase the numbers on the tribunal.  As I said, the other members on the tribunal would have experience in property, business and commercial activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell spoke about how we assess and reach values, open market <Col N="954" /> values, current market values and a rational basis for deciding valuations.  He said the square footage of domestic buildings might be considered by the Government to create a revenue base for the local authorities.  This Bill is not set up for that purpose.  That would be a matter for the Government to decide at a later date if they saw fit.  The aim of this Bill is clearly to create a consistent professional system of determining current rateable values and to assess and levy rates on commercial property.  Basically, values are determined as follows.  A rental value is adopted and adjusted to maintain the tone of the valuation list.</P>
    <P>This is an interim Bill and when we are preparing the modern statute to be introduced in due course, the points made will be taken into acount and considered.  There are arguments for and against having an open market value. One could say there are three values on every property &mdash; what it is worth, its net book value and what it is worth to any given customer at any given time for any given purpose.  That is my opinion and I think most professionals would accept that, too.  As I said, there are arguments for and against an open market value.  It can be very deceiving at any time and it may be unfair, but the basic principle of valuation is valuing on a net annual value based on the value of the property, the rental income it can create, taking into account location, quality and size and comparing it with similar property in the area.</P>
    <P>If one were to compare the Gresham hotel with the Royal Dublin hotel, they might appear comparable because first, both buildings have historic value and their beautiful facade is an attraction, and second point is their commercial location and the flexible options they might provide for investors.  Comparing both, their open market value could be comparable or varied, depending on how one looks at them.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy McCartan say he had an open mind as to whether the chairman should be a lawyer.  Over the years the practice has been that if we <Col N="955" /> are handing the function of the courts to another body, the people who head that body should be legally qualified.  I would not like to see any body loaded down with legal brains because it is vital that there be a mix.  In this case the chairperson and two deputy chairpersons should have legal qualifications and their colleagues should have property and commercial experience.  With that mix it should be possible to give a consistent ongoing appraisal to current values and to make sure valuations are fair and equitable right across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, in the case of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, similar principles apply?  In that case there is an employer, an employee and a lawyer in the middle, and, as far as I can recollect, and I am subject to correction, there is a statutory requirement that the chairman of the tribunal should be a barrister, or a solicitor or have some legal qualification.  If the same thinking lies behind this Bill, there should be no objection to a Report Stage amendment to make sure that is the case. In my view, this is a matter of some significance.  It is not jobs for the boys, the lawyers, that is concerning me.  It is a different principle completely.  It is independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  For instance, the criteria for appointing somebody and the basis on which the mix is to be decided should, so far as possible, be decided by this body rather than left to an administrative decision at a later date.  I have in mind the undesirability of having somebody from the Commissioner of Valuations Office acting as chairman of the tribunal.  We should legislate to stop that. It would be undesirable that somebody coming before one of these tribunals should face a former close colleague in the dispute.  If we think that is undesirable, and most people here do, we should preclude it from happening.  Supposing <Col N="956" /> a member of the Valuation Office staff resigned or retired or took early redundancy under the new scheme, is he to be eligible to be a chairman of the tribunal where he is entitled to adjudicate on the application of his former colleagues, when he knows them like the back of his hand?  If that is not desirable we should state who we are talking about to act as chairman of this tribunal.</P>
      <P>There is no good reason for deviating from the precedent under the Employment Appeals Tribunal which set out who could and who could not be chairman of the tribunal and left some of the other positions at large to be appointed in accordance with administrative policy. This is unfortunate and it opens the door at a later stage to an unpleasant situation where somebody, however impartial he tried to be, would appear to be partial to an ordinary Joe Soap who brought his case before the tribunal.  We should lay down the criteria in the statute.  I do not see what is desireable about saying that that is the policy now.  Why should we not state what the policy is, as closely as we can, in terms of the Act?  I am not suggesting that it has to be confined to lawyers but certain people should be precluded from being chairman of this tribunal.  One of the advantages of at least stating that it should be a lawyer of 10 years standing, is that it prevents a person who was active on the Valuation Office staff until a few months before, from taking a role in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example that also comes to mind is the income tax appeal commissioners. There was a policy of appointment of various classes of people to that position, but there was not a rule and the policy changed and this House did not make that decision.  That is unfortunate because in something as crucial as the adjudication of tax appeals the legislative values and the policy decisions should be set out in the Income Tax Acts.  It is wrong just to leave it to administrative decision on the part of a Minister for Finance who might be asked by the secretary of his Department to make a particular appointment because somebody suggested that that person should be appointed.  It is wrong <Col N="957" /> that the Minister should be at large to make an appointment and the only guidance on the matter being what this Minister of State said on this occasion in the House.  Under the Act the Minister should not be entitled to appoint a valuation official.  Will the Minister consider accepting an amendment to the Schedule to the Act on the Report Stage to make it clear as to who can and who cannot be chairman of the tribunal, to embody his policy as enunciated, in the letter of the law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the Minister will not change his view with regard to leaving the powers that exist with our courts, as distinct from setting up a tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point and I will not go further with that.  It has been suggested that there have been differences in decisions on valuations. Where two human beings are making separate decisions there are often differences and variations.  Overall, there was considerable satisfaction with the courts system.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware rents tribunals were set up under the Rents Restrictions Act.  I gather that the rents tribunals are similar to the proposed valuations tribunal.  On occasions three wealthy looking gentlemen from the rents tribunal arrived at a small house where usually an old man or woman was living and they spent 15 or 20 minutes inspecting the house and later the rent was increased.  I am sure a lot of the people in question wondered as to the necessity of these visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Values Reference Committee have power to nominate people to carry out different tasks.  They could appoint personnel to hear compulsory acquisitions cases.  A compulsory purchase order is a major thing and it could refer to hundreds of thousands of pounds. This body have powers also under the <Col N="958" /> Capital Acquisitions Act.  The Land Values Reference Committee consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the president of the Chartered Surveyors of Ireland.  They appointed two people to hear compulsory purchase cases and capital acquisitions cases.  From reports I have had the decisions there have been generally very satisfactory.  In this instance instead of setting up a tribunal would the Minister consider appointing a property arbitrator?  Values range from £20 to £100. When a property arbitrator can decide on a major issue such as compulsory purchase and capital acquisitions cases, I honestly believe that a property arbitrator in this instance would be satisfactory and would meet the requirement of the Minister admirably.  Mr. McDermot and Mr. Shackleton are the two property arbitrators appointed at present and if the Minister made two similar appointments it would meet the situation here.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a property arbitrator would be much more effective and would avoid all the paraphernalia that would otherwise be necessary.  Quite a number of people feel that one property arbitrator would be sufficient, but if the Minister wanted to have a second arbitrator appointed, so be it, particularly for cases where the valuation was over £50 or £100 as agreed.  It is not necessary to have, as of right, a legal person sitting to hear points of law in these circumstances. If a legal person is to be appointed by the Land Values Reference Committee, so be it, but I do not see that by statute a lawyer should be specified.  Where a point of law arises, let it be referred to the High Court, specifically and specially.  The property arbitrator or arbitrators would be able to hear the cases and a case could be postponed while the point of law arising was decided.</P>
    <P>In appointing a property arbitrator, one would need somebody with ten years' experience in the business of valuing property.  I should like to see somebody appointed who would also undertake work in a public and private capacity, if at all possible.  The Minister very succinctly <Col N="959" /> put his finger on an important point when he stated that he intended to have meetings of the valuation tribunal taking place so that there would be a uniform code and uniform decisions all around the country, as distinct from varied decisions. He is quite correct in that.</P>
    <P>Instead of a tribunal, would the Minister consider having a property arbitrator appointed?  The final decision could be made by the Land Values Reference Committee.  That committee could advertise among their personnel and have some type of screening and then an appointments commissioner could decide on the appointment.  That would be fair and impartial.  It would give experience and uniformity.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy, but I am bound to say that while I appreciate the very great importance of section 2, I must dissuade Members from embarking upon what seem to me to be more Second Reading speeches rather than remarks appropriate to Committee Stage of a Bill of this kind.  I must dissuade the Member from making a marathon speech more appropriate to a Second Reading. Indeed, the Deputy did participate on Second Stage of this Bill.  I would appreciate it therefore if he would confine his remarks solely to the section and try to avoid straying therefrom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the point that I was making was that there was no necessity for a valuation tribunal.  What I recommend instead is the appointment of a property arbitrator by the Land Values Reference Committee.  I have made my point as fully as I had intended and have outlined the position as I see it. I should be happy to have a reply from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall reply first to Deputy McDowell's remarks regarding the appointment of the chairperson.  The House must clearly decide who that person should or should not be.  We have not any strong, fixed views as such on this matter.  Our views are open.  I would <Col N="960" /> respectfully suggest that the hands of the House should not be tied, as neither should be the hands of the Minister of the day, whoever he or she may be, at any given time on this matter.  We are, basically, appointing people.  There are standard practices which have operated over the years in the State.  Some Statutes and some Acts have clearly decided on the qualifications and professional background of certain people to be appointed to positions on boards.  A number of other Acts which have been passed have left the matter reasonably open-ended, but have given some direction or guidance to the Minister.  Any Minister would be guided by the views of the House on appointments to be made.</P>
      <P>In this case we have looked at situations in respect of similar Bills and Acts and, in particular, at the Farm Tax Tribunal.  The appointment of the chairman of that tribunal was open-ended, but it was hoped that it would be a legal person.  A legal person, a senior counsel, was appointed.  I should like that flexibility to be there.  Perhaps somebody from the property sector who had tremendous experience and wanted a change or diversification might like to sit, either as chairperson or deputy chairperson, on the tribunal.  We would like to include people of that calibre.  We should also like to be in a position to ensure that the legal input was there and the recognition of the courts and that this tribunal was acting instead of the courts. By leaving the appointments open and flexible, it is hoped that we will make the best appointment possible.  The House will agree that there are three key appointments to be made and six other appointments.  It is important that there be a blend of legal and professional expertise in all those appointments.  I hope that common sense and a good decision would be the order of the day and I am confident that they will.  I ask the House to trust itself and the Minister for Finance of the day to make the proper appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright has spoken at length regarding the Land Values Tribunal. <Col N="961" /> That is something that I studied and compared.  That tribunal has many merits.  It does excellent work in its decisions on compulsory acquisition.  It is not too easy to compare the valuations tribunal with the Land Values Tribunal because in the latter case the situation is that it is deciding in a sudden death situation in that a person's property is being compulsorily acquired by a State agency or local authority for a certain purpose.  The function of the Land Values Tribunal must be to ensure that adequate value and compensation are given, not alone for the property that is being acquired but also taking into account the disturbance and inconvenience created, the removal of the right of use of that property in the future and many other items.  It decides on a property in a given situation and then it completely finishes with that aspect once and for all.</P>
    <P>The work of the valuation tribunal would deal with a constant ongoing situation whereby valuations are to be determined on which rates will be levied by local authorities.  Three heads are better than one.  Having three qualified people who are consistently involved in decision making pertaining to the same type of system must result in more consistent decisions than a property arbitrator sitting on his own.  Besides, we want the tribunal to develop a code of case law for a wide range of properties throughout the country.  It is mandatory on them to produce a written report on their findings in each case.  Their decisions will have to stand up.  The information would be available.  I suggest that that is the better road to go.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Justice, Environment and Labour to jointly set a timetable of actions to reduce insurance costs over the next eighteen months and in the light of these actions to obtain the agreement of the insurance companies to appropriate reductions in the insurance premia that would otherwise be charged to the public.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To add to the Motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and calls in particular for the early reintroduction and passage of the Courts Bill, 1986 to abolish juries in civil cases, a reduction in the number of lawyers in such cases, a simplification and speeding up of the procedures in such cases and consideration of whether the assessment of damages could be done by a tribunal on an informal basis, as in the Stardust and criminal injury cases, rather than by a Court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate a few points I made last night in order to crystalise them.  Uninsured car drivers should face the same rigours of the law as drunken drivers.  This is not the case at present and it is an absolutely ridiculous inconsistency in the law so far as safety on our roads is concerned, and there is the consequent cost of insurance.  Driving a car without insurance should be as serious a crime as driving a car when drunk.  People caught driving without insurance should be subject to automatic disqualification from driving on their first conviction as is the case with drunken drivers.</P>
      <P>Just as serious in the overall national interest as the cost of car insurance is the outlandish cost of employer liability insurance.  In a country with a quarter of a million people unemployed and up to 30,000 emigrating each year it is vital that we bring down the cost of employing people to the lowest possible level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' policy in this area is well defined.  We want to shift the present excessive incidence of taxation on work by cutting income tax and PRSI and by widening the tax base. It is also vital in this context to tackle the incredible cost of employer liability insurance.  Every Deputy in this House is familiar with cases of people who would start up new industries or expand existing ones but are pre-empted from doing so by the incredible cost of the insurance cover.  It is time to introduce the equivalent of a no-claims bonus system to employer liability insurance which would take into account the good record of employers.  It would also in turn lead, over time, to a reduction in the cost of such insurance for all employers.  This would also greatly benefit the conscientious employer who maintains proper safety standards in the workplace, and it would be an incentive to employers generally to maintain the maximum safety standards in their premises.  This is only one measure which is essential to <Col N="964" /> get the cost of this kind of insurance down.</P>
    <P>Another key ingredient in this regard would be the eventual adoption of the Courts Bill which would dispense with juries in civil liability cases.  That measure is now long overdue.  I particularly appeal to the Government to bring this Bill before the House as soon as possible for completion.  It is the failure of the Dáil to deal quickly with legislation like this which gives this House such a bad name. We have the spectacle of the Dáil meeting for as little as half a week while it is vital that legislation like this is brought into the House, fully debated and passed into law as quickly as possible.  This is the kind of priority we should be addressing rather than open ended interminable debates like those on the budgets.</P>
    <P>While the Courts Bill will obviously be a step in the right direction, the House should also give consideration to a possible tribunal system as an alternative to the courts system for some civil liability cases.  I outlined yesterday evening the example of the Stardust case in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to deal with this evening is the failure of us all, particularly the Government, to bring home to people the importance of the Single European Act in 1992.  The effects will be huge in many areas and insurance costs is one area that will certainly not escape.  In Europe today approximately 85 per cent of people in business are fully aware of the consequences of 1992.  I would say less than 5 per cent of the people in business here are really aware of the consequences, of what can and will occur in 1992.</P>
    <P>We have many problems in the insurance industry here.  If we do not prepare the insurance industry for what is to happen in 1992 the consequences of the onslaught from the European side will be horrendous.  There were good examples of this in the past.  In 1972 we had a protocol in the Convention for the motor industry but we did absolutely nothing in the ensuing ten years to protect this industry.  We have a protocol again on insurance in the present Convention <Col N="965" /> and we are doing absolutely nothing to get our insurance businesses ready for the competition that they are going to face from Europe.  If something is not done about it we will end up with no Irish insurance companies here because they will not be prepared to fight off the competition that will come their way unless the proper legislative matters are put in train and the industry itself is prepared to look inward and plan immediately.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to take from the meeting of the Council of Europe in the last few weeks, and the Taoiseach's achievement in coming back with the doubling of the funds, it appals me that constantly we look to Europe with our hand out; we get the few bob in our back pocket and are sent back to Ireland and we are all suddenly happy.  Will we never realise that we are an integral part of Europe and we can be leading the charge?  The insurance business is an ideal example of where we should be preparing ourselves for the eventualities that will come our way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am pleased to see the way Irish Life is trying to set itself up by privatising so that they will be in a good position in future years.  That example should be taken up by the insurance industry in general and by the Government in addressing the measures that have to be taken for our eventual grand market under the Single European Act when it comes into force in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the main Opposition party for bringing forward this resolution.  It is timely and very useful.  It is also thoughtful in its content. The Government are taking firm action to reduce the cost of insurance and to improve its availability.  The programme laid out here last evening by Deputy Bruton coincides largely with the programme the Government are engaged in.  To an extent our agendas are closely related.  We will make certain that savings are passed on by insurance companies to policyholders in the form of reduced premiums, assuming that the savings are <Col N="966" /> as large as we anticipate.  My clear message this evening to this House is that the Government will ensure that such savings are passed on to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The wide-ranging and decisive action &mdash; the legal reforms, important new legislation on safety and welfare in the workplace and more enforcement and improved safety on the roads &mdash; now being taken by Government will benefit the hard-pressed consumer.  I do not disagree with any of the speakers in this debate to date that insurance costs are too high but I disagree that we have been doing nothing about it.  We have been engaged in a programme and an agenda on which we have been working for 12 months and we have made some breakthroughs, arguably more than have been made in any previous 12-month period in the past decade.</P>
      <P>I also want to take this opportunity of knocking firmly on the head the notion that the package which I negotiated on the non-life services directive in Brussels was over-protectionist or anything other than in the national interest.  I want to respond to a suggestion made by Deputy Bruton last evening that perhaps it may have been over-generous.  It was no such thing.  I will expand on that matter later.</P>
      <P>On my initiative, a partnership in the form of joint Government-insurance industry discussions has existed since June last.  Its mandate is to identify new cost reduction plans and to make certain that improvements are speedily translated into real benefits for the community.  In September last I asked the Bar Council of Ireland to come to see me to make clear to them the Government's determination to reduce the level of legal representation.  I discussed with them the possibility of their making a gesture in this regard.  In December last they announced that they had voluntarily abrogated the existing three counsel rule and I welcomed that as a first step.  The Government have since gone further and have decided to give the Minister for Justice the power to tackle legal representation levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers have asked when the Courts Bill will be introduced <Col N="967" /> and referred to the delay in introducing it.  The Courts Bill will be proceeded with as a priority measure and the Government are committed to the abolition of juries by 31 July 1988.  I want to put that firmly on the record as the Government's clear intention &mdash; by 31 July 1988 we will have abolished the jury system in these cases.  I can assure the House that the Government have no intention of allowing the benefits arising from an improved insurance environment to be dissipated or misdirected.  Let us all be quite clear that the purpose of these measures is to improve the lot of the hard-pressed policyholder, be he employer, worker, householder or motorist.  My partnership with the insurance industry will mean that this is achieved as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to see agreement on all sides of the House on the measures necessary to tackle the problems of cost and availability of some classes of insurance.  We welcome good ideas and suggestions from every scource.  I welcome, as I did at the time, the policy discussion document from Fine Gael published last August and the policy outlined in Deputy Bruton's address to this House last night.  We welcome those as good ideas and good suggestions but in return I say that, given the complexity of the industry, we have been making solid progress for the past 12 months and our agendas coincide.  I would argue that I am already more than half-way through the agenda which has been outlined to this House by Deputy Bruton and in the document of last August.  We have a completely open mind on some of those suggestions and any other constructive suggestions which we get will be carefully considered.  If they prove practical and workable we will put them into effect without any red tape.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment briefly on some of the points made in the course of this debate.  Reference was made to the proposed legislation on product liability and the implications for insurance premiums.  First of all, I would point out that the legislation is being implemented to <Col N="968" /> give effect to the EC Directive on Product Liability.  Britain has already brought legislation into force giving effect to this directive and all other member states, including Ireland, are in the process of doing so.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure a full and open discussion on the implications of this directive, my Department circulated an explanatory and discussion document which outlined the various provisions of the directive and the proposed manner of implementation.  All sectors of trade, industry and commerce were invited to comment and many detailed submissions were received.  As far as the effect on insurance premiums is concerned, the general consensus among insurance experts is that until the effects of the impending legislation are known and seen in practice it will not be possible to estimate the precise implications for insurance premiums.  However, it is to be expected that in the immediate situation following the passing of the legislation, premium costs in some industry sectors will probably increase to reflect the additional risk involved.  However, it must be remembered that in the longer term the levels of insurance premiums will depend on the actual experience gained as a result of specific cases taken under the new legislation.  The product liability directive was passed to improve the position of consumers and this should not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of incentives by insurers to employers who improve safety procedures in their work-places.  Firms who devote resources to improving safety and who, therefore, have a good claims record pay lower insurance premiums than those firms who are less safety conscious and, as a result, have a higher incidence of claims.  Under the present rating structures these latter firms are heavily penalised.  My colleagues, the Minister for Labour, is holding discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation on the introduction of safety audit procedures which would improve housekeeping by firms in the area of risk management and thus bring about lower premium rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Some Deputies have referred to the need for better services to the customer from insurers in such areas as information on policies, unfair selling practices, and difficulties in obtaining insurance cover in the liability classes.  The Insurance Bill, 1987, includes important new provisions which will improve the information provided to consumers on policy conditions, rates, commission levels and other areas. These provisions will be of great benefit in tackling any information gaps which exist at present.</P>
    <P>It was stated last night that there is no agreement with the insurance industry for dealing with declined cases for employers liability insurance.  I want to make it clear that arrangements exist with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist, where difficulties are experienced, in obtaining liability insurance.  Before a case can be referred to the federation it is necessary that at least half the market be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches, together with a brief synopsis of the risk, should be forwarded to my Department who will refer the matter to the federation.  I must emphasise, however, that no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in every case referred to in this manner. It would be unreasonable to expect a guarantee of that nature.</P>
    <P>A further welcome consumer measure is the new code of practice introduced recently by the life industry which allows consumers who take our new regular premium savings policies a 15 day period of grace in which to review and, if they wish, cancel their decision to proceed with the policy without loss to themselves.  Much more information will also be clearly provided at the time a policy is issued in the form of a notice sent out by all insurers. This will certainly put the consumer in the picture from the very beginning and, I am sure, will help to reduce complaints and dissatisfaction in this area.</P>
    <P>The EC is moving ahead quickly with its internal market programme for the insurance sector.  I spoke about this at the outset.  The major item is the non-life services directive.  It is clear that freedom of services will represent increased competition <Col N="970" /> and freedom of choice for consumers.  The Irish non-life insurance industry must gear itself towards meeting the challenge of intensified competition by 1992.  The temporary respite in the form of transitional arrangements for Ireland, among others &mdash; which I negotiated in Brussels &mdash; must be seen simply as a recognition by the EC Commission and the other members of the Council of the difficulties faced by our industry.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that, to my memory, the insurance industry was the only industry mentioned specifically in the Single European Act and was appended to that Act in the form of a statement by Ireland pointing out that we would seek special understanding at the time when we came to discuss the future of the industry.  The Government of the day felt that the insertion of that statement in the Single European Act was important.  It was the follow-up of that statement that led to the decisions that emanated from Brussels giving effect to the contents of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to achieving a fully competitive insurance market in Ireland.  The Irish market has, of course, been open to increased competition in recent years by way of freedom of establishment for non-life insurance companies.  Many insurers have availed of this right to set up here.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that freedom of services will not, of itself, be a panacea for present high premium levels, in that claims experience in the Irish market will continue to be the major determinant in this regard.  It is precisely for this reason that the Government are pushing ahead to achieve real and lasting reforms to bring about significant reductions in the cost of insurance to industry, motorists and the public generally.</P>
    <P>In the two or three minutes remaining let me remind the House that the agenda which has been set out in this motion by Deputy John Bruton coincides broadly with ours, on which we have been working for some 12 months now.  I would claim that, in the past 12 months, there have been two major breakthroughs: first, the progress on the Courts Bill <Col N="971" /> which I have been able to state categorically this evening will be implemented by 31 July next and, second, the talks that took place with the Bar Council which led to their voluntarily taking a decision to abrogate one counsel in that area.  As was announced last evening, I see in this evening's papers that some lawyers are threatening to increase fees as a result of what they regard as the Government decision &mdash; perhaps to go one step further and re-examine the number of counsel engaged on a case.  I see in an evening paper reaction from the Bar Council to the statement by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, last evening.</P>
    <P>Let me make clear that what is involved here is that the norm in personal injury cases will be one counsel except where the court certifies that a second or, in exceptional cases, and for reasons stated, a third counsel is warranted.  Perhaps the Bar Council have over-reacted in their statement this evening.  It would be my hope that, when they reflect on the actual words of the Government statement last evening, they will reconsider their views &mdash; that it will be one counsel except where the court certifies that a second or, in exceptional cases, and for reasons stated, a third counsel is warranted.</P>
    <P>It has been a year of considerable progress in tackling insurance costs in that, for the first time in many years, instead of just talking about it, we took some action.  We have made progress on the Courts Bill and considerable progress in the area of legal representation and fees. That type of progress, given the complexities involved, is not to be underestimated.</P>
    <P>I might refer again to the EC Directive because Deputy John Bruton seemed very interested in it last evening.  We are not in the business of protecting the Irish insurance industry from competition.  We are not in the business of cosseting them in an artificial way.  They will face competition in due course.  They already face substantial competition but, given the nature of that industry, it is legitimate <Col N="972" /> and in the national interest to allow them a period of years so that they can adjust to the difficulties which will be experienced in the internal market.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the insurance industry, crisply and clearly, that after 1992 &mdash; just some three and a half years away now &mdash; their gloves will be off, they will have to examine possibilities of rationalising the industry, perhaps mergers, perhaps acquisitions, whatever &mdash; I am not telling them how to run their business &mdash; but in every way possible they will have to be ready, come 1992, to tackle the flood of competition with which they will be faced.  I hope that, by now, the industry are under no illusions but that they must be ready for free competition which, in itself, will bring down insurance costs on top of the already excellent record of this Government on insurance costs in the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I would have to say in relation to this whole debate is that the motion before the House is the most succinct comment I have seen from the major Opposition Party on the two most recent opinion polls.  I believe it would be very difficult to conceive of a motion that is less contentious than this one.  There is no Member of this House who would be likely to come in here and say that no action is necessary to deal with the costs of motor insurance.  I cannot imagine that there is a single Member who believes that insurance policies are too low, or a single Member who would vote against any reasonable action that would help to reduce such costs.</P>
      <P>At a time when the fabric of our social services is under daily threat, and when no Government action is being taken to stem the tide of emigration, it is a shameful waste of precious Dáil time to be debating so relatively trivial a motion as this.  The subject matter of the motion is important &mdash; I do not deny that for a moment &mdash; but it could easily be dealt with by a Dáil question or by a letter to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only conclusion I can reach about the motion, therefore, is that its reason <Col N="973" /> for being on the Order Paper at all is to ensure that the major Opposition Party will not cause any offence to the Government, at least for the moment.  Can we look forward to a Private Members' motion from the major Opposition Party next week asking us to pledge our allegiance to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, or asking us to declare ourselves in favour of virtue and apple pie?</P>
    <P>The other thing that forces me to the conclusion is the complete absence of specifics from the motion.  There is no criticism in the motion, despite the fact that the present Government inherited a programme of work already done in this area from the last Government.  There are no concrete suggestions.  There is nothing except a rather mild appeal to the Ministers, if they can see their way to it, to do whatever they think they should, before going, cap in hand, to the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The motion comes from a Deputy who, in fairness to him, has done a lot of work in this area.  He has even published a detailed policy document on the subject on behalf of his party.  He could, if he had wished, put forward the fruits of that work in this motion, rather than in his speech.  But, of course, that might run the risk of a vote against the Government.</P>
    <P>If I could deal with the subject matter of the motion itself, I would have to say that in this area it is time for some new and radical thinking.  It is difficult to get hold of adequate statistics in this area.  I was surprised, for instance, to discover recently that no Government Department gathers information on the number of cars insured in this country.  It is difficult to see how policy can be realistically developed in the absence of such basic information.  However, we do have some information available.  On 1 December last, the Minister for the Environment told the Leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil that in 1986 there were 711,000 cars licensed in the Republic.  On 27 January last, the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, that the amount of gross-written premiums in the motor insurance business was £361 million <Col N="974" /> in 1986.</P>
    <P>If we put those two figures together, it is easy enough to deduce that the average premium in 1986 &mdash; I am using that year because it is the most recent for which full data is available &mdash; would have been £491 for each car on the road.  I use the phrase &ldquo;would have been&rdquo; because clearly, a large number of cars on the road at any one time are being driven without any insurance at all.  It has been estimated that up to 20 per cent of cars are being driven without insurance.  If this estimate is correct, then the true average cost of insurance, per car, is over £500 a year, or £10 a week.</P>
    <P>This is clearly a very harsh imposition on the average driver.  It puts the cost of motoring, and especially safe motoring, beyond the reach of many people, including most young people.  Given these kind of statistics, it seems evident that consideration must be given to moving on three separate fronts; first the overall cost of insurance premia must be driven down; second, action must be taken to ensure that every driver on the road is insured; and third, the cost of insurance must be spread more equitably.</P>
    <P>Now, if we are serious about this, I believe we have to challenge the two assumptions that underlie this whole debate so far.  The first assumption is that if we deal with legal costs, it will be possible to radically reduce premia.  The second assumption is that if we increase penalties for offenders, we will be successful in forcing everyone to insure themselves.  Neither measure, on their own, will work.  Neither measure will contribute substantially to reducing costs.  And neither measure will help to spread the cost of insurance more fairly. We need, if we are serious, to consider going a great deal further.</P>
    <P>First, if we are serious about reducing legal costs, we should consider introducing the concept of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; insurance.  It works very well in other jurisdictions, and it is a simple concept. It means that in the event of an accident, no matter what the circumstances, there is no onus on a driver to establish that the other driver was at fault before a <Col N="975" /> claim can be met.  Both drivers involved in an accident deal with their own insurance companies only, and the only issue that needs to be resolved is the issue of damages.  At a stroke, the introduction of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; insurance has virtually removed the need for litigation in the United States, for instance, and it is something that ought to be examined in our context.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have to give serious consideration to more realistic penalties for drivers who take cars on the road without insurance.  I believe that in addition to the normal penalties that are imposed we should examine the possibility of two extra forms of punishment &mdash; automatic jail sentences for any habitual offender in this area, coupled with the confiscation of their car.  Driving a car without insurance is the same as carrying a loaded and cocked gun without authorisation. Anyone convicted of the latter offence in our jurisdiction faces a stiff jail sentence, but respectable citizens frequently drive cars without offering the most basic form of protection that the community around them demands.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we have to face up to the fact that a significant number of cars on our roads are being driven regularly while they are in a dangerous condition.  We must be one of the last jurisdictions in the world that does not demand a regular check on such basic facets as lights, brakes and tyres.  The introduction of a compulsory MOT-style certificate, which would be a condition of tax and insurance, and which would have to be displayed on the windscreen, would go a long way towards increasing safety on our roads, and reducing the costs of insurance.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, it is a fact that a substantial proportion of serious accidents on the roads are related to alcohol, but we still regard the drunk driver in our society as a &ldquo;bit of a lad&rdquo;.  How many cases have we seen of people convicted of drunk-driving offences for the second or third time?  Perhaps in this case, too, the time has come to ensure that when someone <Col N="976" /> is convicted of a drunk driving offence, their car is taken away from them also.</P>
    <P>It is popular to blame the legal profession for all the excess costs involved in car insurance.  I agree that it is long past time to remove the element of expensive litigation from this area, but it is misleading to suggest that the only factor here is legal costs.  The instances I have mentioned above demonstrate that we will have some responsibility in this area. The measures I have suggested, although they are radical, would go a long way towards making our roads safer and that is the best way to reduce insurance premia.</P>
    <P>If we can do that, and remove the element of litigation, we should then be prepared to move on the other two fronts I mentioned earlier.  There is only one way to ensure that every driver on the road is insured in all circumstances, and only one way to make certain that the cost of insurance is equitably spread among all drivers.  That way involves the introduction of a national insurance scheme, applicable to all drivers and based on the concept that risk increases with every mile driven.  The way to pay for such a scheme is through the cost of petrol.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a single scheme, operated by one insurance company on behalf of the State, which would automatically apply third party insurance to every driver on our roads.  It would apply to visitors as much as to residents, and would be financed by a surcharge on the cost of a gallon of petrol.  It would be possible within such a scheme to offer comprehensive insurance as an optional extra, and to remove the possibility of abuse by excluding, say, the first £100 of damages from any claim.</P>
    <P>The amount of the surcharge would be dependent on a number of factors.  It would depend principally on successful implementation of the kind of measures I mentioned, to make the roads safer and to remove the element of expensive litigation.  At the present level of costs, a reasonable surcharge would provide every driver with third party cover, but to go further would require concentrated action to bring costs down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> In summary, if we are serious about this issue, we can bring about radical improvement.  It requires a concentrated approach on a package of measures, and a willingness to confront established attitudes.  It may also mean being prepared to risk offending vested interests.  Those insurance companies who at present complain about their losses from motor insurance may sing a different tune if they discover they would lose the business. We are well placed to consider such an overall approach.  The State is already in the car insurance business, through the PMPA, and there is no reason why we should be afraid to explore new ways of making insurance affordable to everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage completing my speech by 7.55 p.m.  It is quite clear the insurance industry has now got completely out of control and the Government must take an initiative without delay to get it into line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Fine Gael motion before the House and the Progressive Democrat amendment, a feature or general implication to be found in both the approaches is one in which it is believed that the co-operation of the insurance industry can be secured.  This is a point that causes grave concern to The Workers' Party because in the past &mdash; and we believe in the future &mdash; it was and will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to secure the co-operation of that service industry in dealing with and responding to initiatives from the <Col N="978" /> Government unless there is an element of coercion in any initiative taken. However, The Workers' Party nonetheless welcome the debate initiated by the motion and particularly welcome the initiative that will necessarily flow from its terms in view of the multidepartmental initiative sought by the motion with regard to seriously addressing the problems of an industry and a service that is obviously completely out of control and exploiting a market for which it has a demand by legislation.</P>
    <P>In this context it is important to say that we are not just dealing with motor car insurance.  They are certainly a beleagured sector of the community; they are discriminated against through age, sex, status, employment and through a system of cartel blacklisting where not only people with a certain background but those from particular districts in cities and provincial towns are denied the opportunity of insurance cover.  This discrimination and the practices of the cartel system of blacklisting and weighted disadvantage involved in the system must be weeded out of insurance.  In addition there is a need to look at the question of public, corporate, company and employer liability.  Right across the board it is clear that there is massive exploitation and over-charging of the consumer by the service industry of insurance.</P>
    <P>The approach of The Workers' Party to insurance is basic and simple.  We maintain that we will not achieve the type of fairness in this service until we have a comprehensive no-fault liability, State-controlled insurance industry.  I am thinking of the type of service industry that applies in New Zealand where today the average car owner can secure comprehensive annual cover at a cost of £50. That is achieved on a no-fault comprehensive State run insurance scheme. The system compensates people not because they are in the right and the other party is in the wrong but on the basis that they are entitled to compensation for injury or loss of property caused by accident.  People are not victimised simply because they may have been guilty of an error of judgment or <Col N="979" /> contributed in some say to the cause of an accident.  The system is based on fairness and recognises the duty of the community to help people who are put at a disadvantage in some way by reason of an unfortunate accident.</P>
    <P>The scale of the problem was underscored 100 times by Deputy Bruton in the conclusion of his address last evening when he indicated that the package of proposals coming from his party would achieve in one year, if fully implemented, a saving of £65 million.  On the face of it that seems to be an incredible achievement, if it was possible, but what would the net benefit be to the consumer?  On his estimation, which I accept as being accurate, it represents a saving of £80 on the average premium in one year.  That is an incredibly small achievement and those with insurance cover would want to know what has happened to the service that requires such drastic reform, that is making such huge capital savings on overall cost but at the end of the day turns up a saving which is a minute proportion of the average yearly premium. In my view an £80 saving on a premium will not be greatly appreciated.  It is not a significant achievement but it is as much as we can hope for under the scheme suggested.</P>
    <P>The sheer magnitude of the problem as highlighted by the figures quoted indicates that unless there is a radical overhaul of the system leading to Government control, whether by dictate or in the form of an appointed management team, such as in the case of the PMPA, we will not achieve any reform in the system that will prove of advantage to the consumer.  There are specific proposals in the motion and the amendment. Many of them must be supported, such as the proposals to reduce the number of lawyers involved in insurance cases, the speeding up of pre-trial procedures and the introduction of tribunals.  However, by themselves those changes will not result in savings to the consumer.  At the moment many insurance companies impose the practice of one junior counsel until the day of the trial and one senior <Col N="980" /> counsel at the hearing.  They have been doing that for almost 18 months in the Round Hall but there has not been a penny of a reduction in the cost of insurance.  The savings are going into the profit coffers of the insurance companies and that is where all the savings that will result from the reforms proposed will go unless the Government dictate the cost of the premium to the consumer.  There must be price control if we are to bring premia down.  Given the role of the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the role of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the area of policing insurance companies, there should be no difficulty in a Minister indicating the profit level of insurance companies and, consequently, the price to be charged to the consumer for insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The speeding up of procedures will not deliver a reduction in premia.  The Stardust Tribunal was an effective and speedy way of dealing with the claims of litigants but it did not lead to a reduction in legal costs.  Obviously, the whole object of the exercise is to cut back on the enormous legal costs.  Without central dictate we will not achieve the type of reductions people are seeking.  The Workers' Party are opposed to the suggestion that juries should be abolished but I do not know whether, with four Members, we will be able to do much tonight or when the Bill is brought before us before 31 July.  We oppose the abolition of juries in civil cases because they represent the voice of the people in our courts.  It is very important that the ordinary person is heard and is involved in our court procedures as much as possible.  A story was told to me recently of a judge in a civil case disbelieving a plaintiff's action because he did not believe the plaintiff's evidence that as he got on the bus he was able to tell by looking at the face of the bus driver a certain fact.  The last time that judge had got on a bus was through an open door at the back.  The driver was closeted away in a compartment at the front.  It was so long since he had been on a bus that he did not realise that the interior structure of buses had changed.  That illustrates the importance of having the <Col N="981" /> influence of the ordinary person on our juries.</P>
    <P>An important area of law where juries are essential is in factory accident cases, in deciding on the liability of employers to provide a safe system of work for employees.  I have no doubt that the capacity of workers to bring claims for occupational injury will be seriously undermined by a Judiciary sitting alone who will not appreciate or understand the workings of modern technology on the factory floor.  In my view it amounts to sacrificing a very important feature of our courts system for the saving of £80 on an annual premium.  I do not think that is a fair trading price.  I should like to ask the Government to have another look at their decision to abolish juries.  Juries are rarely employed to deal with civil cases but they are a safeguard for the ordinary person who takes to the courts for a fair hearing.  We must remember that 99 per cent of civil cases are settled and that to have juries hearing civil actions is the exception.  The important thing about them is that they are a safeguard, a sanction, an element of democracy on litigants, insurance companies and the Judiciary should the common person seek to have his case heard by his peers of 12.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government not to go ahead at the breakneck speed they are talking about with the Courts Bill which contains a provision to abolish juries.  It is more important that they should proceed at breakneck speed, because of the EC deadline of July next, to deal with product liability.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, talks about legislation I hope he is referring to a Bill which will be brought into this House before July for our deliberation, not enactment by regulation as has been the preference in relation to EC directives.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party welcome any initiative in bringing light to bear on the operations of the insurance industry.  It is an industry without sufficient controls which has exploited its market to the ultimate penny.  Premia are out of control and there does not seem to be any rational basis for the level of insurance <Col N="982" /> costs.  I am not necessarily a defender of the legal profession but in recent times the premia imposed by insurance companies on professional liability have gone through the roof, with the result that the Law Society are attempting to establish their own internal means of self-insurance against professional liability. Overnight the insurance companies decided to increase premia three and fourfold.  I know of many instances where companies had traded for many years without claim and were faced with a premium which had been trebled or quadrupled for no good reason.</P>
    <P>This debate is useful because it helps us to understand the extent to which this House must go to achieve even a small reduction to the consumer.  It is a problem of gargantuan proportions but at least we are starting to talk about it.  I hope that the Government will take on board the points made on all sides regarding the need for reform, which must involve a measure of control and sanction.  Otherwise the motive of increased profit will continue and ultimately, although not in the short term, there will be a reversion to the trend of increased costs to the consumer.  All our work would then be set at nought and we would be back where we started.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I was somewhat disappointed at the attitude of Deputy Mervyn Taylor who feels the only thing the Opposition should be doing is putting down motions to embarrass the Government rather than putting down motions to which we can all make a positive contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to reduce insurance costs, as far as practicable, is accepted by all Deputies on both sides of the House. This is one of the few major issues which we can discuss on a non-partisan basis. This is the spirit in which I approach tonight's motion.  In responding to the motion, I would like to outline legislative and enforcement action taken to date, as well as to indicate areas where further action is under consideration, which <Col N="983" /> might be of help in achieving the aim set out in the motion.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I am primarily responsible for road traffic legislation which makes third party insurance compulsory for motor vehicles used in a public place.  I am also responsible for the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland which compensates innocent victims of road accidents involving uninsured vehicles.  Accordingly, I have a definite and strong interest in ensuring that the relevant legislation is both effectively framed and enforced.  In this area, I work in close co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Justice, who is primarily responsible for law enforcement.  I am also responsible for promoting good road standards, driver standards and vehicle standards, all of which have an impact on accident levels and on the volume of claims made on motor insurers.</P>
    <P>The level of insurance evasion has a direct impact on insurance costs and premia because compensation payments by the Motor Insurers' Bureau are funded by motor insurers licensed to transact business in this country.  The bureau paid compensation totalling £14.5 million in 1986 and had outstanding liabilities totalling £55 million.  The bureau is faced with increasing liabilities due to implementation of the Second EC Motor Insurance Directive in Ireland.  The directive requires the bureau to compensate victims of &ldquo;hit and run&rdquo; accidents for all personal injuries, from the end of 1988; and to introduce compensation for property damage caused by uninsured drivers, from the end of 1992.  If the implementation of the EC directive is not to give rise to significant increases in premia, it is essential that the underlying level of evasion be reduced.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is to establish the present level of insurance evasion.  We can then use this data as a firm basis for tackling the problem.  The Garda Síochána undertook a roadside survey of the insurance and tax status of a representative sample of about 24,000 vehicles in April and May 1987.  The <Col N="984" /> survey was supported by my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation.  The detailed results will be published shortly. However, I can now inform the House that the survey estimates the national level of motor insurance evasion at between 6 per cent and 8 per cent of vehicles.  I welcome the survey estimate, which is lower than previous estimates which generally ranged from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  There are some regional variations in the figures and the Garda authorities will use the result to identify areas where enforcement must be intensified.  It bears repeating that the number of those uninsured is not anything like that suggested in this debate.  The figure is between 6 and 8 per cent of all vehicles.</P>
    <P>I think the decline in the estimated national level of insurance evasion is due to a number of factors.  First and foremost, the Garda Síochána must get credit for the fact that they instituted 74,000 prosecutions for insurance offences in 1986.  Secondly, the new insurance disc, operative since July 1986, has made it easier for the Garda to spot the evader. My Department have assisted enforcement by making available a computerised record of the insurance status of all 960,000 licensed vehicles to the Garda Síochána since November 1986.  Finally, the Oireachtas itself has given teeth to the enforcement process by increasing the maximum fine for uninsured driving to £1,000 under the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984.  In addition, the uninsured driver is liable to a jail sentence of up to six months and could lose his driving licence.  A one year disqualification is mandatory for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
    <P>Have we done enough to deal with the problem of evasion?  I do not think so. No one can be happy that about 76,000 vehicles are going around uninsured and costing insurers about £28 million in lost premium income.  This puts up the average premium of insured drivers by about £28 per annum.  The uninsured driver is a menace to other road users.  Individuals and families unfortunate enough to suffer death, injury or property damage due <Col N="985" /> to the negligent driving of an uninsured vehicle are faced with financial uncertainty and hardship, unless and until they receive compensation from the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  One way to teach those unscrupulous enough to drive without insurance a lesson might be to take their vehicles from them.  Accordingly, consideration is being given to the inclusion, in a Road Traffic Bill next year, of a provision to enable the Garda to seize and impound uninsured vehicles, pending the production of the necessary insurance.  I would like to hear if the House would accept that as a reasonable response and if we could agree on it across the floor then we might be making a step further down the road to decrease the 6 per cent to 8 per cent even further.</P>

      <P>Some road accidents can be partly attributable to deficiencies in the road infrastructure.  In recent years, successive Governments have devoted increased resources to the improvement of our road network and this has been reflected in the decline in the numbers of road accidents since 1978.  Much more needs to be done however.  I intend to publish within the next few months a Blueprint for Road Development which will consider the medium and long-term needs of the total road network and set out an outline of the proposed long-term strategy to meet these needs.  The improvement of road safety will continue to be one of the main objectives of future road development policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> A key factor which influences the selection of road improvement projects is the accident record of the particular stretch of road and special consideration is given to any project which will eliminate a high accident location.  In 1985, An Foras Forbartha was asked to assist in the assessment of high risk locations identified by it in its blackspot reports and to make recommendations for low cost solutions at those locations.  Initially, this assessment was limited to high risk locations on rural sections of national primary routes where realignment schemes were not contemplated in the immediate future. The reports and recommendations have been brought to the attention of local authorities for necessary action.  Local authorities are now asked in the memorandum on road grants issued annually by the Department, to pay special attention to the elimination of accident black-spots on national roads and road grants are available for approved projects subject to the overall limit on resources.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the sharp increase in road deaths during 1987 which was revealed in provisional road accident figures released recently by the Garda. The figure for road deaths last year at 461 represents a reversal of the downward trend which had been firmly established since 1978.  While that figure is 19 per cent higher than the corresponding 1986 level, it is still however considerably lower than the 628 deaths recorded in 1978.  In addition, available data for road deaths in the European Community as a whole show that, despite the increase in 1987, Ireland's record still compares reasonably well with most member states.  Indeed, the rate of road deaths in Ireland per 10,000 population, now stands at 1.3 compared to an average for the Community in 1986 of 1.55.  I would point out that road accident trends since 1978 have shown that measures taken to improve road infrastructure and vehicle safety, coupled with enforcement action taken by the Garda and the road safety campaigns, have contributed significantly to reducing road accident levels.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to refer briefly to the general question of drinking and <Col N="987" /> driving and to record my own appreciation of the support given by various organisations to the drink-driving campaigns.  These campaigns have undoubtedly achieved a considerable degree of success as is evidenced by the fact that between 1978 and 1986 the number of fatal accidents occurring between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. &mdash; the hours most associated with drinking &mdash; fell by over 50 per cent. In particular, I am glad to note the significant financial support from the insurance industry with regard to the promotion of drink-driving campaigns.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the primary responsibility for behaviour on the roads rests with the road users themselves.  It must be remembered that nine out of every ten accidents on our roads are caused by human error and for this reason I would appeal to road users generally to abide by the rules of the road, to exercise both caution and courtesy when using the road and to be aware of the needs of other road users particularly the less protected groups such as pedestrians and cyclists.</P>
    <P>More rigorous driving tests have been suggested.  The Irish driving test already meets EC standards in this respect.  Regulations which came into force on 3 November 1986 brought the standards of physical and mental fitness to be met by applicants for driving licences into line with an EC Directive on driver licensing. Since that date, persons applying for licences for the heavier vehicles &mdash; lorries, buses and articulated vehicles &mdash; must first obtain a certificate of fitness &mdash; issued by my Department on foot of a medical report from the person's doctor. In the case of the lighter vehicles &mdash; motorcycles, cars and agricultural tractors &mdash; persons must meet minimum standards of eyesight before they will be given an appointment for a driving test in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Since 1964, learner drivers of the larger vehicles &mdash; lorries, buses and artics &mdash; must be accompanied by a qualified person, holder of a full licence for the particular class of vehicle being driven by the learner.  It would not be practicable for motorcycles.  As regards cars, the <Col N="988" />&ldquo;accompanied driver&rdquo; rule, which was revoked in 1979, was restored in a modified version in 1985 and applies to those who took out provisional licences for the first time on or after 12 August 1985. Under the new requirements, a learner driver may drive unaccompanied only during the period of his second provisional licence for the purpose of gaining experience.  It was considered unrealistic to expect every ordinary car driver to get sufficient driving experience if he had to be accompanied all the time before taking the driving test.</P>
    <P>The new system takes account of this with two important safeguards: the driver must be accompanied in the first year to acquire the basic skills under supervision; the driver must be accompanied after the &ldquo;free period&rdquo;, the second year, until he passes the driving test &mdash; firstly to ensure that he does not &ldquo;put off&rdquo; taking a test and secondly if he fails he will not be able to continue to drive unaccompanied.  It should be noted that the accident involvement rate for provisional licence holders is only 1.9 per 1,000 licences compared with 6.2 for &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; drivers.</P>
    <P>Vehicle standards also have a role to play in promoting accident reduction and in reducing the risk of injury and death when accidents occur.  New vehicles are generally designed and assembled outside Ireland.  However, we have benefited from the worldwide trend of building safer vehicles to meet increasing consumer awareness of modern safety features &mdash; such as collapsible steering columns, anti-lock braking systems and so on.</P>
    <P>In recent years, national regulations have been made to require the mandatory fitting of laminated glass windscreens to all new motor vehicles &mdash; thus reducing the risk of serious head and eye injuries to front seat passengers.  The regulations also require the fitting of side guards and rear underrun protective devices to new heavy goods vehicles and trailers.  These fitments reduce the risk of other road users going under the rear or side of heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>However, it is no good building and <Col N="989" /> equipping new vehicles to a high standard if the vehicles are not properly maintained by the owners.  I was concerned about some of the results of the recent winter check sponsored by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and Dublin Road Safety Council.  An analysis of over 1,300 check results showed that 53 per cent of vehicles had either defective brakes or defective tyres.  The roadworthiness of heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances is checked annually as part of the EC compulsory roadworthiness testing scheme.  The EC Commission has proposed the extension of compulsory annual roadworthiness testing to private cars and light goods vehicles over three years old.  There are about 600,000 such vehicles in this country.  A number of member states have entered reservations on this proposal and it will be some time before decisions are taken in Brussels.  In the meantime, my Department are assessing the detailed implications of the relevant draft EC directive. I propose to consult interested motoring organisations and insurers about the possibility of setting up a private body &mdash; representative of both private interests and my Department &mdash; to supervise the scheme, if extended to car testing.  Such supervision arrangements operate quite successfully in Germany and Sweden.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that my contribution to the debate here tonight has clearly underlined my interest in taking all practicable steps to reduce road accidents, the related loss of life and personal injuries, the level of insurance evasion and claims on both the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland and licensed motor insurers.  There has been a good response from the various Ministers and Departments as outlined in the motion.  More needs to be done but at least we can report that the number of uninsured motorists using our roads has dropped dramatically.  What is necessary now is to catch the other 76,000 through whatever means we can agree on here together. After that it comes down to driver care and courtesy and a greater understanding of just how important it is to have good sound roadworthy vehicles.</P>

      <P>I thank all of the Deputies who have contributed to this debate. I believe, contrary to Deputy Taylor who contradicted himself in making a very well thought out and interesting contribution, that this debate did serve a very useful purpose.  It even gave Deputy Taylor an opportunity to say what he did say.  One of the key elements of this motion is the commitment to a timetable of action by all four Government Departments.  While the contributions from speakers on the Government side in this debate were interesting and useful they made no reference to a timetable and there was no indication as to exactly when particular measures will be introduced nor were there any contributions in this debate, which is perhaps understandable in the limited amount of time which was available, from the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Justice both of whom are directly involved.  I hope when this motion is passed the Government will act on its terms and put together a specific timetable for the bringing about of these changes and for tying in the insurance companies, as the motion requires, to implement reductions in premia following the actions taken by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a one-sided approach.  We are not simply looking to the Government to take certain actions, we are also looking to the insurance companies to respond in a quantified fashion to the initiatives being taken here by the Government with the consent of the House.  I would like to say that it is extremely important that the insurance companies also be given a timetable for their response.  Let me illustrate this by referring to something for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce received reasonably favourable, if rather repetitive, publicity yesterday.  This was the question of getting a commitment from the insurance companies that if a young driver has a good driving record on somebody else's policy, for instance his parents, that that good driving record would be recognised in a lower insurance <Col N="991" /> premium when he or she comes to insure in his or her own name.</P>
    <P>Let me recall the history of this as it indicates the slowness of the insurance companies in responding to matters such as this.  This matter was first taken up with the insurance companies by the then Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, a very able Deputy who happens to be related closely by blood to me, Deputy Richard Bruton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Bruton who was then the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce took this initiative and they said it was a very good idea and would do something about it.  A year later in August of last year Fine Gael published our discussion document on insurance. The present Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, came into this House and said that the Government were going to do something about this and that they were going to try to get insurance companies to give this discount to young drivers. That is a great example of the very well-known Irish failing, of verbalising a problem and thinking by so doing you have solved it, of the politics of announcements being the equivalent to action. Deputy Brennan got lots of publicity. The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, also got lots of publicity yesterday for making the same suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Inertia &mdash; two words as the late Deputy Flanagan used to say.  I would like to refer to a number of proposals which I made in my speech last night.  It was very generously acknowledged by a number of contributors to this debate that my speech did contain a very comprehensive range of proposals. I would particularly like to advert to the measures which the Government have not responded to in this debate.  They have responded to a number of them but I would like to single out the ones which they have not responded to.</P>
      <P>There was no reference in this debate to the very high level of management expenses of the insurance companies themselves.  I quoted figures where these have been increasing well in excess of the rate of inflation.  What are the Government doing about this?  Are they satisfied with the level of management expenses in insurance companies?  Why are they shielding the insurance industry from more competition from overseas which would force them to be lean, mean and hungry and competitive in offering the most competitive rates to the community and keeping their expenses down.  Where I part company with Deputy McCartan and Deputy Taylor is that they essentially want a State monopoly in the insurance area.  I believe all economists, including Vladimir Ilitch Lenin, would agree that monopolies tend towards inefficiency. Monopolies controlled by either the public or private sector tend towards inefficiency.  One of the problems in the insurance industry in recent times is that we have had through the PMPA a sort of private sector monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think replacing the inefficiencies of a private sector monopoly, which has at least some element of competition from other people who are free to enter the market, with a public sector monopoly would be a particularly good idea.  However, that is a matter for <Col N="994" /> debate at a very high and interesting level on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of other matters on which the Minister should have acted.  I suggested the introduction by the insurance industry of an insurance ombudsman who would look into claims of maltreatment of companies and individuals by the insurance companies.  In my view the Government could usefully have acted on this proposal.  I also complained of the 10 per cent loading on disabled drivers charged by the insurance companies which has no actuarial foundation.  No ministerial statement was made indicating an intention to act on that matter and I regret that.  I believe there are delays in the courts which could be assisted by reducing the level of representation and so on, and the appointment of two or three additional High Court judges would be useful in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government, in proposing the introduction of pre-trial procedures in legislation to be brought before the House by the Minister for Justice some time in the future, are long fingering that matter.  I would like a specific commitment from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice as to when that legislation will be law, not when it will be introduced in the House to be left languishing indefinitely in Committee Stage like the Courts Bill, but when it will actually become law.  I hope the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will ensure that the Minister for Justice lives up to the promise made on his behalf by Minister Reynolds and that the legislation will be introduced very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also made the suggestion that in regard to reducing the cost of claims it would be useful if people were awarded annuities rather than lump sum damages in every case.  In some cases an annuity <Col N="995" /> would be more relevant and ultimately could be less costly to the insurance companies.  I would have liked the Minister to reply to that suggestion.  I also believe there is a clear need where employers institute agreed safety procedures that there should be a definite recognition in the form of a reduced premium.  The Minister of State referred to the fact that the Minister for Labour was having discussions about the introduction of safety audit procedures which would be related to this matter, but there was no commitment by the Minister of State or the insurance companies to the effect that if an employer applies agreed safety procedures there will be a reduction in his premium.  That is essential if we are to get employers to spend extra money on safety.  There must be an up front financial reward of some kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in place at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is. As in the case of motorists, there should be an acceptance of the principle of a no-claims bonus in respect of employers who have not made claims in respect of accidents occurring in their place of work.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to a number of suggestions I made in regard to the improvements in road safety which were not responded to in the announcements by the Minister for the Environment, good as they were.  These are: the possiblity of having a restricted driving system as applies in Northern Ireland for younger drivers and the possibility of requiring off-the-road lessons before people even receive a provisional licence &mdash; some formal instruction in the rules of the road would be a useful prerequisite to the issuing of a provisional licence.  I also suggested the possibility of on-the-spot fines for non-use of seat belts and for driving vehicles with obvious faults, and the extension of the powers of traffic wardens to enable them to detect and impose on-the-spot fines for vehicles, parked in controlled areas, which have obvious faults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> I am glad the Minister for the Environment responded positively to the suggestion I made last night that one penalty which could be imposed on uninsured vehicles was the impounding of such vehicles in addition to the imposition of a fine.  That is a useful recognition of my suggestion and vindicates the value of the debate.  Another suggestion I made with regard to road safety was the automatic retesting requirement to apply for a new licence and a new test for drivers who have been convicted for drunken or dangerous driving.  That would be useful in ensuring that those people did not repeat that error.</P>
    <P>The Government need to look at the law in regard to public liability of property owners.  At the moment the extent to which property owners can be laible for injuries inflicted on themselves by visitors to their premises or property is far too wide.  This is a source of great worry to a number of organisations representing land owners, farmers and the like. In my view, the grounds are too wide and, therefore, the insurance premia which have to be paid for public liability insurance are too high.  The basis on which claims can be made in this area ought to be narrowed somewhat, not to the extent of giving no reasonable rights to compensation but to bring the matter to a greater degree of reasonableness.</P>
    <P>I was interested that the Minister for the Environment admitted there had been a substantial increase in the number of road deaths in 1987, and he consoled himself that at least the numbers were not as bad as in 1978.  It is interesting to note that in 1978 we had the highest number of road deaths in our history.  It was also a top year in another respect. Anybody interested in Irish social statistics might remember that 1978 was the year, courtesy of the 1977 manifesto and the three stage rocket of the economy which was being launced, when we had the highest alcohol consumption in history.  I think there is a direct connection between those two social phenomena. The Minister ought to investigate and report to the House on the reasons for <Col N="997" /> the increase in road deaths in 1987.  I do not believe the explanation was the same as in 1978 and, in my view, this deserves some study and the Minister should make a report to the House.  That in itself will ultimately be reflected in the higher level of claims&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I believe even the level of uninsured driving that continues is one that justifies the measures to which I have referred.  The last point relates to the compulsory testing of the roadworthiness of vehicles.  It is obvious that unroadworthy vehicles are a continuing cause of accidents second only to the ingestion of alcohol.  Will the Minister indicate whether Ireland supports the EC Commission proposal for an annual roadworthiness test?  When referring to the subject the Minister said that certain member states had reservations but he did not say whether we had reservations and he succeeded in talking about the subject without giving any indication as to his or the Government's attitude in the matter.  I invite the Minister to use the 30 seconds available to indicate the position <Col N="998" /> of the Irish Government in this matter and if they have not got a position on it I do not know why the Minister should have referred to it in his speech.</P>
      <P>I have no problems with the addendum to our motion which is being proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  It singles out a few measures which are some of the ones we are advocating and by singling them out it could be argued that it excludes others.

      <P>Subsection (1) of this section reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An owner or occupier of any property, the rating authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may apply at any time for a revision of the valuation of any property entered in the Valuation Lists or for the inclusion <Col N="1000" /> therein of any property not so entered. On my understanding of the present situation, I contend that it appears strange in this instance that the Commissioner of Valuation is now entitled to look for a revision.  I am wondering why he is now being granted this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, it would be in order to maintain consistency and balance in the updating of valuations. If for any reason a valuation was determined on a specific property which gave a particular service or otherwise, it might be necessary for the Commissioner of Valuation, as a result of that valuation being determined, to ensure that there would be unilateral equity in the valuation of similar properties in other areas.  Consequently, in order to ensure that there would be no discrimination in regard to the increase in valuation against one person, or occupier, or owners of a particular property <i>vis-à-vis</i> others, it would be important to maintain that balance and consistency.  Therefore that flexibility must be given to the commissioner to ensure that that balance is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner of Valuation is a person who should be totally impartial.  He has not had this power or authority up to now to commence or cause a revision.  It would be inconsistent for him to be now granted this power.  He should be absolutely and totally impartial.  I can understand that a rating authority in a particular area would have this power, if they were not satisfied regarding the valuation of a particular premises, to look for a revision.  I am quite happy that the occupier of any premises who is not happy with a valuation could look for a revision of property, as could the owner, but it is wrong that a Commissioner of Valuation who should be impartial is granted this power.  He and his staff have very wide-ranging work.  They have 60,000 revisions per annum to deal with. Their workload should not be further added to.  By deleting that power there <Col N="1001" /> would be a lessening of the workload and the Commissioner of Valuation would be seen to be impartial.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Deputy, but I am afraid that I cannot accept them.  I shall give two simple examples.  Let us take two public utility companies, for instance, the ESB and Telecom Éireann. They both transmit power over cables supported by poles.  If for any reason the valuation is determined in a particular area or on a particular utility, it may be necessary for the Commissioner of Valuation to revise upwards or downwards the valuation of the other utility. Secondly, let us take two manufacturing companies manufacturing the same product under different brands.  A valuation may be determined on the property of one, on their fixed assets and equipment. The other company would be manufacturing the same or a similar product under a different brand.  Again, the Commissioner of Valuation would surely need to have flexibility to revise that valuation either upwards or downwards in line with the first determination, or at least request that that determination be made.  It is in the interest of equity, balance, consistency and fair play that we give that flexibility to the commissioner so that there can be no discrimination against a person, company or utility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a simple question to the Minister?  Why is that power deemed necessary?  If the local authority are not satisfied with the particular valuation, they could make that revision themselves.  If there is an imbalance between two particular companies, the local authority should surely have the power, if they are not satisfied, to make that revision.  If the ESB, being the owner or occupier of a property, are not happy because the cost is too high they have the power.  But this is something new and that is the point I am making.  I see the Minister's point, but I feel the existing position is adequate to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>Of course the local authority has the right to apply for a revision.  The company, the citizen, the owner or occupier of the premises, the local authority and, now, the Commissioner of Valuation have the right to apply for such revision.  It is all very well to say the local authority can request this and maybe they should do so, but the local authority in counties Offaly, Mayo or Sligo may not be aware of a particular valuation in the city of Dublin and, consequently, although a decision affecting one local authority area may be relevant in another area, they would not ask for the revision.  It is in an effort to maintain consistency and build up case law in the determination of valuations that we must allow flexibility to the commissioner.</P>

      <P>In advance of agreement of section 4 there is a matter I would like to come back to which was raised with the Minister on Second Stage.  That is the question of singling out public sector utilities and why the Minister was confining this scheme of things in regard to the valuation of public sector corporations.  I understand that it was <Col N="1003" /> intended, in the first instance, to start with the ESB.  They are already rate-payers to the various local authorities in which their facilities exist.  I listened with interest to the reasons the Minister has for introducing this regime of centrally evaluating and then apportioning out rates on these companies, and the ESB in particular.  If this procedure involves bringing into the rating net a greater range of structures and facilities such as cabling and the transfer of electricity and the like, why have the Government not considered it an appropriate means of evaluating rates on multiunit companies such as banks with their buildings and facilities around the country, shopping centres and shopping chains and other industries like co-operatives with outlets of different kinds?  Why does the Minister reserve this simply to State companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a public utility undertaking.  It is not confined to a public company or a State company or a semi-State company, but a public utility or a public service of any kind whether given by the State, the semi-State sector, the local authority, a private company or individual.  We are talking about any service given nation-wide.  All that would be included.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has alluded to the ESB situation.  The ESB pay an annual bounty to the State of £24 million.  They pay a very small rating contribution in certain local authority areas where they have highly sophisticated and very valuable properties, and in other areas where they have not got the same properties or similar properties they do not pay anything. As a result of this Bill they will be valued right across the board on their total utilities in the State and that valuation will be broken down and apportioned into each local authority area, the bounty they contribute to the State will no longer be paid direct but instead they will pay an equitable rating contribution based on the value of the utility they have in each local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume by that the <Col N="1004" /> Minister means that it will continue to be paid to the local authority and not directly to central funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to section 4 (7) it provides that the Commissioner of Valuation shall apportion the global valuation of an undertaking determined or revised under this section between rating authorities.  I feel it should stop at that because there are areas where local authorities have to maintain roadways, for example, on the coast where a lot of fishing is going on and there are lots of trucks going in and out to a particular port particularly if there is fish factory. In such a case I would regard it as unfair if that county's rates were paid to anybody other than to the particular local authority.</P>
      <P>In Offaly and in the Minister's constituency of Galway where there are Bord na Móna factories, a considerable number of trucks carrying heavy loads of peat and briquettes travel the roads.  There are a number of briquette factories in Offaly and Laois &mdash; for example, Cúl na Móna in Portlaoise &mdash; and trucks are constantly travelling the roads with heavy loads of peat, briquettes and turf.  Those roads are being damaged by such heavy loads.  It would be grossly unfair for the Minister for the Environment, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to prescribe the amount so apportioned to any rating authority.  It should be paid to the county whose roads are damaged.  The roads in Offaly have been damaged by the continuous use over the years of heavy trucks and we are entitled to the rates that are paid on the ESB power stations and the briquette factories.  It is not right that they should be paid to any other authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to copperfasten my understanding of what the Minister has said.  It may be that in the drift of discussion on Second Stage the wrong interpretation was taken of the proposals in regard to section 4.  We should take <Col N="1005" /> them in conjunction with the Second Schedule which seems to be drafted in line with public utilities in the public sector &mdash; I am using a very broad definition in that regard.  I take the Minister's clarification of utilities provided by State, semi-State and other bodies.  Am I to take it that there is nothing in the Bill, as it is currently drafted, to prevent the Minister at a future stage, if he so desires, from using this mechanism of global valuation to deal with multi-outlet private concerns?  As the Minister was speaking I was trying to think of a public utility on the scale that would warrant global valuation as he describes it.  There was a recent Government announcement to set up a private TV channel and that is one area where this type of system could be applied.  Am I to take it that there is nothing in the Bill that will prohibit the global valuation scheme from applying to private concerns in the future?  Am I correct in understanding that in the initial stage the Minister's intention is to concentrate on the ESB alone and, if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back to Deputy McCartan's original point and I will then take Deputy Enright's point.  First, I will clarify the position regarding a public utility undertaking as defined in the Bill.  It includes any undertaking, whether established by or under any enactment or otherwise, which supplies a service to the public whether throughout the State or in any part of the State.  It was in that context that I referred to the regional situation earlier.  As I have said, we are not confining this scheme to the public sector.  The Deputy is correct in his interpretation of the situation in that the Bill will allow, in the future, private companies or individuals providing a multilateral service or facility of any type to the public to be globally valued.  The Minister can add to the Schedule by order but of course all the orders, as contained in section 11 of the Bill, must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The global valuation will be apportioned on a basis to be fixed by ministerial order, as stated in section 4 (7) of the Bill.  The <Col N="1006" /> basis will differ from undertaking to undertaking.  In some cases the distribution will be based on the physical location of the assets in each local authority area and in others on a consumption of products, or possibly a combination of both.  For these reasons it is intended that the precise basis of distribution of valuation will be prescribed by order which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We do not visualise a global valuation of conglomerates, multinational companies, co-ops, supermarkets or chain stores.  The valuations of those outlets would be determined individually on their location within each local authority area.</P>
      <P>To go back to the point made by Deputy Enright regarding commercial dockside where there is constant usage of a particular area by commercial interests within a local authority functional area, it would be only fair that the valuations as determined and the moneys that would accrue as a result of those determinations would be paid to the local authority in that area.  That is the position and the same will apply right across the board. The position will be the same in regard to supermarket chains.  Where a valuation is determined the rates levied as a result of that determination would be paid to the local authority in the area.</P>

    <P>The Commissioner of Valuation shall apportion the global valuation of <Col N="1007" /> an undertaking, determined or revised under this section, between rating authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may not be possible.  I will have to complete the section.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, by order prescribe and the amount so apportioned to any rating authority shall be the valuation of the property of the undertaking in the area of that authority.</P>
      <P>Many of the companies, particularly the semi-State companies, that we are talking about are directly responsible at the end of the day to the Minister of Finance as a representative of the people in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He is the man to whom they must report and give their accounts and balance sheets at the end of each financial year.  We must allow him flexibility, in dealing with and in assessing those companies on behalf of the people and the Oireachtas, to decide that there should be a determination made at a particular time for any given reason.  We must also allow him to consult with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who has overall responsibility for the collection of rates and the funding of local authorities.  That flexibility must be there.  If any changes are to be made they will be made by order which must come before the House of the Oireachtas, the representative of the people, and the House can either accept or reject the orders being made.  The Minister is obliged to put those orders before the House.  It would be unfair, in the interest of the viability of companies and in the interest of maximising State resources, to take that flexibility from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger is that the Minister shall, by order, prescribe the amount so apportioned to any rating <Col N="1008" /> authority.  He might decide to equalise it and spread it out, which might be to the disadvantage of one rating authority and to the benefit of another.  I would contend that the rating authority should fix the valuation in each case on each hereditament.  Such areas will reap the benefits of employment on the one hand but will also carry the disadvantage of having huge trucks passing in their areas, damaging their roadways.  The upkeep of the roads and facilities would be to their disadvantage if other areas were to benefit from the rates paid on those premises.</P>

      <P>Deputies Enright and McCartan have asked why we are using the ESB as an example.  If one looks at the ESB properties at Ardnacrusha or at Parteen in County Clare, then one observes that the water drives the turbines, flows down the Shannon River through the various counties, power is transmitted right across regions, all of which must be taken into account.  If we were to constrain the Minister, the Tribunal or the Commissioner of Valuation too much by way of flexibility we might not achieve equity in the distribution of valuations and, ultimately, in the collection of rates on account of the service being provided.  The reason we are using the ESB as an example is that, first, it is a publicly-known, easily identifiable utility operational in every part of the country.  It is a utility that makes an annual contribution to the State by way of a block bounty, which the ESB regard as somewhat arbitrary in its determination, feeling that it may not be equitable for them.  The new system will be absolutely fair and equitable right across the board, taking into account the entire utility and facility and the whole of their property portfolio.  We are using them as <Col N="1009" /> an example on account of their unique position.  They are a suitable example of how other utilities and valuations can be determined in the future.  We must maintain flexibility to ensure that there is equity, not alone in determining valuations, but also in apportioning the valuations in various local authority areas thereby ensuring that no local authority is placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> another.  If one such utility had an important property on the fringe of a county boundary and the power being generated was beneficial to a county other than the one in which it is generated or <i>vice versa,</i> then there may be some inequity in determining the valuations or in their apportionment.</P>
      <P>For that reason I ask the House to ensure that flexibility is given to the Commissioner of Valuation and, ultimately, to the Minister for Finance, the people's representative in this House.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister's remarks on Second Stage and on earlier sections. Each case or applicant appealing to the tribunal will have to submit a report in writing.  The Minister stated that the reason for this was to build up case law in regard to valuations.  The House would commend that aspiration so that when a valuation was being determined or appealed in the future, there would be precedents and case law for referral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the provisions of this section will be somewhat onerous on people.  At present the only way one can lodge an appeal to the valuation tribunal is by way of a case on a point of law; points of fact will not arise for determination by the courts.  I contend it would be good to have a certain number of cases referred to the High Court for determination on points of law.  I presume <Col N="1010" /> there will be a person with legal qualifications serving on the tribunal.  The Minister might confirm that for me.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of this section, if a person is dissatisfied with a determination, contending that it is erroneous on a point of law, he may declare his dissatisfaction to the tribunal. Then subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The party, having declared his dissatisfaction, may, within twenty-one days after the determination, by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the Tribunal, require the Tribunal to state and sign a case for the opinion of the High Court thereon within three months of the date of receipt of such notice.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that a person owning a somewhat modest house discovers that his valuation has been sizeably increased perhaps by way of error on a point of law.  Let us suppose again that he is a person of humble means and wishes to bring a case before the High Court.  There is no civil legal aid here and this would entail a civil case being brought by such a person.  In accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) the party requiring the case shall pay to the tribunal such fee as the Minister for Finance may by regulations prescribe for and in respect of the case, before he is entitled to have the case stated.  There would be no problem in the case of a supermarket group, a semi-State body, a Government Department or wealthy property owner, but for a person of humble means the valuation of whose property is affected, let us say, a shopkeeper, butcher, draper, some such person might just not be able to afford to bring a case and have it stated before the High Court.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that where a case appears to be reasonable, is not frivolous, where it is not brought for devious or dubious purposes, where a person genuinely believes he has a proper case to be determined by the High Court, in that instance, a person in a democracy, with a solid legal system should not be prevented because of his not having adequate financial resources from bringing his case <Col N="1011" /> before the High Court.  The House should be generous in its provisions in respect of such persons, allowing their cases to be heard and points of law determined in order to build up case law which will be of benefit not just to those applicants but to the courts, legal advisers, architects, engineers, valuers and, most important of all, the members of the tribunal themselves.  It is my belief that subsection (3) should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiments the Deputy has expressed.  Of all the Bills that have come before this House perhaps the broadest and most equitable consideration and/or solution is encompassed in the provisions of this section.  It is normal, in our laws and in international law to have two appeals only: if one takes a case to the court one can appeal it to a higher court.  In this case an applicant has the right to list his property for determination of valuation, or for revision of valuation.  He has the right to be heard by the Commissioner of Valuation and his staff on first appeal in the determination of that valuation.  He can further lodge an appeal to the tribunal on the valuation determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.  They can again appeal the decision of the tribunal to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court which gives them four opportunities to make a case pertaining to the valuation on their property.  This is a very broad option and although I am not that long in the House I have never seen it contained in a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks in relation to a person of modest means not being able to take a case to the courts. However, I do not visualise people of modest means in conflict with the commissioner or the tribunal, at least not very often, because, when a property is being assessed for valuation, unless it stands up to certain criteria it will not be valued. Of course I do not want to create an incentive for people to appeal decisions to the courts but it will relate more to companies or conglomerates.  I hope that <Col N="1012" /> people of modest means would not have to bring a case but in any event the State should ensure that any citizen, irrespective of his means or property, will always have the protection of the law available to them.</P>
    <P>I would not like to argue with an eminent lawyer like Deputy Enright regarding free legal aid but I was under the impression as a layman that if you could make a case to the court that you were not able to defend yourself professionally or to pay for professional assistance, the court could then determine whether to make free legal aid available.  Perhaps that is too simplistic an interpretation but I am sure the Deputy will correct me if I am wrong.  The fee involved will ensure that no frivolous or irrelevant cases are taken to court.  We hope that the time of the commissioner, the tribunal and the court will not be wasted by frivolous or irrelevant cases.</P>

      <P>I should like to put his mind at ease.  I am confident that the fees to be decided will take into account the value of the property which is in dispute <i>vis-á-vis</i> its valuation.  I expect that normal properties of standard value &mdash; small shops, factories or houses &mdash; would have a reasonable fee.  As the property gets bigger the fee may increase but I can assure the House that we will not set a fee which will prevent the owner or occupier of any property from appealing his case either to the tribunal or from the tribunal to the courts.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point and I accept his goodwill in that regard. The principle is the same, from the humblest corner shop to Quinnsworth stores, in regard to points of law and that is the <Col N="1014" /> difficulty I see in regard to the regulations.  It is not as if they can go to the District Court, Circuit Court or the High Court with varying costs involved.  In this instance, the case will be heard on a point of law and it will require the same proofs in procedures as in any normal High Court case.  However, we will deal with it on Report Stage which will give the Minister an adequate opportunity to consider it.</P>

      <P>There are two separate sections here.  There should be no fee on the first appeal stage as this was never the case.  However, when the case comes before the Commissioner of Valuation I would not object to a reasonable fee being charged.  It seems that the initial appeal will now be subject to a fee.  Will there be two fees, one where the appeal goes to the Commissioner of Valuation and a second, separate fee when the case is heard?  I am not sure of that point and I should like clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accuse anybody of doing anything like that; it does not happen.  In my view it is only right to ensure that the valuation office and the tribunal are not a burden on the State, that some money will be raised <Col N="1015" /> from the services they are providing. They should be at least partly self-suf-ficient.  It is necessary to have a fee of some type because otherwise all valuations determined would be appealed. The last section gave the right for four appeals and unless there is a fee set for each appeal there will be a major problem in the offices of the Commissioners and of the tribunal.  We cannot allow that to happen.</P>
      <P>The fee will be set by the Minister for Finance.  He will be setting fees in respect of appeals to the Commissioner of Valuations or to the tribunal or in respect of an application to the Commissioner.  There is no doubt that the fees will be modest and I am confident that people will not quibble about the amount involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's goodwill in regard to this but fees have a habit of increasing annually.  For example, a High Court stamp originally cost £8 but that has risen to between £55 and £60.  Stamp fees for the Circuit Court and the District Court have also increased.  I accept that it is the Minister's intention to keep the fees at a modest level but he cannot speak for Finance Ministers in the future.  They may have a different view of what a modest fee should be.  In my view it infringes on the rights of citizens if in appealing a decision they must pay a fee.  I would not object to a stamp fee being paid on documents lodged with the appeal to the Commissioners of Valuation but I do not think it is right to charge a fee to an appellant to have his or her case heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers being introduced are unique.  A stamp must be paid where there is compulsory arbitration and a very modest fee is charged by An Bord Pleanála but the Minister is proposing to introduce two distinct fees.  It is unfair to charge an individual a fee if he decides to appeal the decision to increase his valuation.  People of modest means will find it difficult to pay such a fee and as a result may not be able to proceed with an <Col N="1016" /> appeal.  A shopkeeper who is not in good circumstances because of bank loans, tax commitments and so on may not be in a position to pay an appeal fee even if his valuation is doubled.  It is wrong to deprive such a person of a right to have an appeal heard by the tribunal.  I do not think the Minister has thought out this provision fully.  There is no doubt that with the ravenous demands of the Department of Finance such fees will be increased and people will be deprived of their right to have an appeal heard against a valuation.</P>

      <P>The fees are enabling powers and it does not follow that they will be charged at any particular stage. Any fee fixed will be moderate.  They are being introduced in order to prevent frivolous applications and appeals being proceeded with.  Fees were provided for in other legislation that has passed through the House.  Under the Bill introducing farm tax fees were provided for in respect of appeals to a commissioner, which was the first appeal, and to a tribunal which was the second appeal.  I hope that when the fees are being set there will be a provision to waive fees where the applicant is in difficult circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a great interest in history and I should like to refer him to a decision of 30 June 1852 when Her Royal Highness Queen Victoria was in power in Britain. When an Act similar to the legislation before us was going through the House of Commons on that day it was decided that when any humble citizen wished to <Col N="1017" /> appeal a valuation a fee of £5 would be charged.  The decision to charge such a fee deprived many people of humble means of the right to appeal a valuation. Such a sum was a lot of money for many people in those days.  In this instance we should not deprive people of the opportunity of appealing a valuation.  It is very easy to introduce regulations and increase fees in a budget.  That is what I am afraid of.  I would not have any objection to charging a fee in the case of frivolous appeals and I accept that there should be a payment for a stamp for the second appeal to the valuation tribunal. Let it be fixed by some graded system.  If the valuation is between £10 and £50, let the amount be £20, and so on.  We should be more definite and precise.</P>
      <P>The sum of £5 in 1852 was a lot of money and it deprived many people of having an appeal heard.  In this instance we should ignore the example of Queen Victoria and paddle our own canoe.</P>

The fee is designed to provide some contribution towards the cost of administration.  It is not intended to be a deterrent.  I would hope that the fee would not be too excessive and would not prevent any person from appealing even to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), to delete lines 32 and 33, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" />&ldquo;`Harbourmaster' includes a person appointed by a harbour authority to enforce the provisions of section 33 of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many amendments are contingent on the first two.  I have a basic objection to the involvement of harbour masters along with the inspector in the various sections of the Bill where they have been included.  The Act essentially imposes a civil liability and requires a ship to carry an insurance certificate.  The Act in no way affects operational matters such as are dealt with by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977.  For this reason I feel that it serves no purpose and does not increase their powers in any useful way to give harbour masters a role in enforcing this Act.  The person in a port traditionally responsible for checking certificates and who has the duty of granting clearance to ships to sail from the State is the officer of customs.  It seems to me that he or she, if there were any female officers of customs, is the appropriate person in addition to any other inspector for enforcing this Act and detaining ships without certificates of insurance.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to an officer of customs power under section 6 (3) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1966.  In so far as harbour masters require more powers, which this Act purports to give them, the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977, should more properly be amended. For the purpose of clarity I would like to point to the fact that the definition of &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; in this particular Bill <i>inter alia</i> includes, and I quote.  &ldquo;a sea fisheries protection officer&rdquo;.  In section 3 &ldquo;sea fisheries protection officer&rdquo; means a person declared by section 220 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to be a sea fisheries protection officer.  In section 220 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, a sea fisheries protection officer includes <i>inter alia</i>&ldquo;every officer of Customs and Excise authorised in that behalf by the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.  What I am trying to achieve is that the various powers of detention and other powers in this Bill, with the exception of section 33, should be given <Col N="1021" /> to customs officers.  I will accept the expression &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; as defined in this Bill to include customs officers and I am satisfied with that.  I am not prepared to accept the harbour masters' role to be amended by this Bill as I do not think it can properly be done that way.  As I said the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts should be amended if we intend now to change the clearly defined role of harbour masters.  I will not be pressing my amendment this evening due to the late hour of the night but I would very much like to hear the Minister's response to the case I have put.  If we cannot meet minds on this tonight I would like leave to press the amendment on Report Stage.  I look forward to the Minister's views on this as I consider it an important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Doyle, if this amendment were accepted it would debar a harbour master and his deputy from enforcing the provisions of section 13 which empower them to stop or detain ships, and also of section 16, that is, the powers of inspection in their own harbour.  It is essential in my view that they should be entitled to these powers, in addition to those in section 33, in their own harbour.</P>
      <P>Since the Second Stage debate we have had consultation with the Attorney General's office and the advice given to us is that we cannot accept this amendment. The intention of our own amendment No. 2 is to make it clear that both the harbour master and any other person enforcing the provisions of this Act must each be appointed by a harbour authority as defined.  I would envisage in certain cases that the harbour master and his deputy might each be appointed by a harbour authority to enforce the provisions of this Act in their own harbour. If we were to accept Deputy Doyle's amendment it would, in effect, mean that a harbour master would be debarred from enforcing the law relating to this in his own fishery harbour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister is making a case for extending the role of harbour masters.  As I said, this Bill does not deal in any way with operational matters.  It deals with civil liability and the necessity for ships to carry certificates of insurance or identity of insurance and adequate insurance.  Under the present Acts this is over and beyond the role which harbour masters now have.  Perhaps the harbour masters should have this role included in their remit or terms of reference.  The point I am making is that this Bill is not the correct one in which to revise the powers given to harbour masters because of the very nature of the Bill, not being an operational Bill.</P>
      <P>I will have more to say on section 13 when we get to it.  Debarring a harbour master from carrying out the provisions of the section would not affect the functions under section 13, as I am quite happy to accept the inspector, who will include an officer of customs and many others as defined under the Consolidated Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to raise the issue of the future of Carysfort College of Education in this House.  On 4 and 5 March 1986 Fianna Fáil came into this House in a paroxysm of what I can only describe as righteous indignation and condemned in the most ringing tones the decision I had taken to phase out primary teacher training at Carysfort College on the grounds that three colleges operating below capacity was a luxury which, unfortunately, the Irish taxpayer could no longer afford.  Interestingly enough, the party went on to vote against discussions with interested parties seeking an alternative role in higher education for Carysfort College having regard to its structure and traditions, the expertise of its staff and the developmental requirements of <Col N="1024" /> education generally.  That was the wording of the motion against which Fianna Fáil voted on 5 March 1986.</P>
      <P>As the House may recall, the present Minister came into the House a month previously and was delighted to announce prematurely to the staff, the Sisters and the educational world, in the most precipitated and opportunistic way the decision which had been made before many of those people had been informed of the decision.  On 4 and 5 March 1986 Fianna Fáil went much further than simply voting against what we were embarking on which was discussions with the college authorities.  They urged the retention of Carysfort College as an integral part of our higher education system with a specific component role in teacher education.  The present Minister for Education &mdash; I remind the House that this was all of two years ago &mdash; went on to talk about in-service education, third level education, social sciences, communications, liberal arts, child studies, whatever that is, youth community work studies and technological studies for Carysfort College.  There was no end to the plans which the present Minister had ready to bring in for Carysfort College while she was Opposition spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Deputy David Andrews came into the house and waxed eloquently as only Fianna Fáil can on the intrinsically flawed economic policies of the then Government.  Deputy Pardraig Flynn came into the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and described the then Government as having &ldquo;a closedown syndrome&rdquo; and even mentioned hospitals specifically.  He also said that recession is not the time to skimp on education and teacher training.  He demanded satisfactory prospects for the professional staff at Carysfort College and demanded teachers should continue to be trained at Carysfort College.  Most importantly, he went on to spell out in <Col N="1025" /> great detail the Fianna Fáil alternative as he called it.  He went on to say it had been spelt out in clear unambiguous terms that they wanted Carysfort College to continue as a teacher training centre with other items added such as in-service teacher training courses, new curriculum development courses, third level education courses in the humanities, education in psychological training for teachers, computer training and a whole lot of other things.</P>
      <P>On that evening in March Fine Gael listened as they had to listen for four years to the total refusal of Fianna Fáil to face realities and their allied tendency to make whatever wild promises that suited the particular occasion but Fine Gael, unlike Fianna Fáil, did not play political games.  We went ahead and appointed a working group under the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, the very respected Mr. Liam Lane, to produce good workable proposals for the future of the college which of course is recognised as a magnificant facility.</P>
      <P>That group did bring forward proposals which were presented to the Sisters of Mercy and made public on 2 March 1987. I will mention what some of those proposals were.  They included that UCD would move their H.Dip. in Education Faculty to Carysfort College making use of all the teacher training facilities there; that the excellent Carysfort College language teaching facilities should become a language centre integrated with the UCD Arts Degree language teaching programme; that history, geography, arts, commerce and social science courses could be incorporated into Carysfort College and that the Irish Folklore Commission would be transferred there from Earlsfort Terrace.  It was suggested that the research work of the Curriculum and Examinations Board, since defunct, should be transferred to Carysfort College. The report also stated that none of the Carysfort College staff should be forced into redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report was given to the Sisters of Mercy and it was left for the incoming Minister.  Fine Gael made it clear before <Col N="1026" /> leaving office in a statement from the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, that the proposals were acceptable to him but because we were going out of Government he could not give undertakings about the future.  Since then there has been total inactivity and silence on the part of the present Minister despite all of the questions she has been asked and all the letters which have been written to her.  In March 1986 the matter was considered to be a very grave national issue and of immense urgency.  The present Minister has for one year refused to answer questions on the progress of the plans and she has left the staff in a state of limbo, not to mention the anxieties of the Sisters of Mercy and the wider population around the college who are so anxious about the future.</P>
    <P>In the debate on that Private Members' motion in March 1986 Fianna Fáil called for immediate acion to ensure that this great and valuable institution be retained as an integral part of our higher education system.  Two years ago they called for immediate action, they have been in office now for one year and yet we have had nothing but inaction.  The reason I raise this issue tonight in the Dáil, the reason I asked for it to be taken on the Adjournment, is because it now transpires that considerable alarm was created among the staff and right across the education world by rumours emanating from a college board meeting just after Christmas that vacant possession of their offices would be required as soon as this academic year ends in June.  If the Minister denies that that was ever mentioned I will be very pleased but following the rumour which emanated from that meeting the Irish Federation of University Teachers were alarmed enough to call for an emergency meeting with the Minister which was held on 4 February.  Again at that meeting mention was made of the need to vacate the premises in June, that the staff might not have any offices to work in after June.</P>
    <P>At that meeting the staff were told that even if they had to physically leave the premises and had no jobs to go to they would still be paid in full.  I have in my <Col N="1027" /> possession a letter which was sent to the IFUT by the Minister on 17 February confirming this arrangement.  One can imagine the effect that that sort of emergency meeting and that sort of information has had across the education world which was promised the earth and the stars by Fianna Fáil as long as two years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mentioned the college board meeting held after Christmas a few moments ago.  It was a result of this confusion and uncertainty about the intentions of the Government as well as the approaching deadline of the last group of students finishing their courses in June that I raised this issue in the Dáil this morning.  It is inexplicable and alarming that the Minister has dragged her heels for so long, that the staff have been treated in this manner, despite the expectations aroused by the behaviour of Fianna Fáil in Opposition, and that even at this late stage we still do not know what plans exist for Carysfort College, except for the rumours emanating from the college board meeting which so alarmed members of IFUT that they had to demand an emergency meeting with the Minister.  To put it mildly, I find the Minister's persistent refusal to answer questions about her plans, provocative and extremely suspicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear today as a result of my raising the issue &mdash; and only as a result of my raising this issue &mdash; that Sister Regina was able to say she felt there were plans, that she had some hopes, although apparently they do not involve the present education staff who <Col N="1029" /> will still have to vacate the premises after June.  I invite the Minister to tell the House now what her plans are, which presumably she must know after a year in office.  I deplore the fact that it has taken this kind of rumour and alarm to try to get the air cleared, to get the Minister into this House and to get some response from her because we have failed for a year to get any kind of response.  I hope her response will be full and clear and will give details to the House, which is the proper place as she so vehemently declared in February 1986.  I deplore also these rumours and meetings that were held in secrecy over the last month.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister had been more frank with me and the House when we asked questions about this matter. However, raising this matter today has meant that we have succeeded in getting some progress made.  We had denials from the Minister earlier today and expressions of hope from Sister Regina but such denials and expressions of hope are not enough to allay the concern and confusion caused by the extraordinary turn-about by the Minister and the Government.  I await with great interest clarification from the Minister about the future of the staff, the Sisters of Mercy and the future of the college at Carysfort. I hope they will allay the suspicions which so many other actions of Fianna Fáil have caused the public.</P>

      <P>May I put on the record the reply from Sister Regina of Carysfort, dated today:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the college authorities are very concerned about the future of the <Col N="1030" /> Carysfort complex, they have not issued any ultimatum to the Department of Education nor have they issued any ultimatum to their college staff about vacating the premises by any given date.</P>
    <P>They still have reason to hope that the Government are considering positive plans for the use of the amenities for the public education and cultural role that will be of benefit to the nation and to many of its young people.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat that once again Deputy Hussey has made a massive blunder. I should state at the outset that I have not received from the Sisters of Mercy notice, as so dramatically described by Deputy Hussey, to the effect that they require vacant possession of the college by the end of June 1988. When I intervened about Carysfort, I knew my facts, Deputy Hussey does not. I have just had a statement to the contrary today from the college authorities which I have just read into the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will know, the previous Government decided as part of their budget strategy that a major college of <Col N="1032" /> education should close. It was Deputy Hussey, then Minister for Education, who decided that the college which would close would be Carysfort and this decision was conveyed to the college authorities on 4 February 1986. Following consultation with the then Taoiseach who intervened, as Taoisigh should on important matters, and on the coming into office of Deputy Cooney it was decided that existing students would be allowed complete their studies at Carysfort but that no new students would be admitted. There are approximately 166 students now in their final year in the college who are due to finish their course in the summer. Recognition will then be withdrawn from the college as a pre-service training institution for primary teachers.</P>

      <P>While the college buildings are the property of the Sisters of Mercy, it would of course be my earnest wish, and I am confident that my aspiration would be shared by the Sisters, that the facilities of the college should continue to be available for the purposes of education. The position is not one to be resolved overnight; it will call for the exercise of patience, foresight and commitment and I would ask the House, in view of the sensitivity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the debate following the announcement of the decision to withdraw grants from the college, the previous Government decided to set up a working party to see if proposals could be formulated for the future use of the college as an educational establishment <Col N="1033" /> other than for the initial training of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>This working party submitted its report on 26 February 1987. While my predecessor in Government, Deputy Cooney, indicated his acceptance of the report to the Sisters, there was of course no question of any previous Government commitment to the recommendations in the report.

Severance terms were envisaged for those who could not be seconded.</P>

      <P>The most recent data from the Central Statistics Office show that whilst the total national cow herd declined by 1.7 per cent in 1987 compared with a decline of 2.3 per cent in the previous year, the number of heifers in calf increased by 1.5 per cent.  Moreover, in the non-dairy sector, the total of cows plus in-calf heifers was up by 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the off-farm income limit in the disadvantaged areas schemes would not necessarily guarantee any increase in cow numbers and in fact would cost the Exchequer £7 million in the first year and £3.5 million in each subsequent year after the benefit of EC recoupment was taken into account.</P>

As Ireland and Northern Ireland are already receiving favourable treatment in regard to the amount of the premium, I do not see any prospect of securing further concessions under this scheme which would involve fundamental changes in qualification requirements applicable to all member states.</P>
    <P>Finally, it simply would not be possible to allow dairy farmers who have some beef cows to participate in either the disadvantaged areas or the EC suckler cow schemes.  The rules of the latter scheme specifically disallow this while under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the difficulty of distinguishing between the dairy cows and the beef cows on an applicant's farm would be so formidable as to rule this option out also.</P>

      <P>Having reviewed reports on a number of studies carried out, the US Federal Environmental Protection Agency concluded in November 1986 that Aldicarb, the active ingredient in Temik 10 G, was non immuno-toxic i.e. does not suppress the immune system. The agency confirmed that pesticides containing Aldicarb were legally available in all states, although some may place certain restrictions on its use to avoid, in particular, contaminating water supplies.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information available at this time it is reasonable to conclude that Temik 10 G does not pose a risk to health or safety when used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and good farm practice.</P>
      <P>Temik 10 G is one of 2,000 pesticides on sale in Ireland and my Department conducts a systematic examination of these under the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985.  A priority list for examination has been drawn up and Aldicarb is one of these due to be examined during 1988.  The regulations include provision for banning or imposing special conditions on sale and/or use where warranted.</P>

      <P>I have reviewed this case with a considerable degree of sympathy, but I regret that the original decision to refuse grants under the 1987 disadvantaged areas schemes must stand for a number of reasons.  There will inevitably be marginal cases in any system where a fixed limit is set and to pay one such case could lead to a rush of claims from others, who are £5, £20, £50 and so on over the off-farm income limit.  The scope for such claims would be endless if one started down that road.</P>
      <P>Headage grants are meant to be income supports to those farmers in disadvantaged areas in need of such supports.  The person named did earn £6,401.79 off-farm income during the 1986-87 income tax year and was considerably better off therefore than many other applicants who had no off-farm incomes at all during that year.  Indeed, an applicant with no off-farm income but with the same amount of stock would have received £329 in headage grants compared to the £6,401.79 received by the person named from outside sources.</P>
      <P>Finally, while I have discretion to set the off-farm income limit for a particular year, I am not at liberty once it is set to vary it in individual cases.  To do so would be unjust and unfair to the many other part-time farmers who were marginally over the limit and therefore did not apply for grants under the 1987 disadvantaged areas schemes.</P>

The scheme is subject to audit by my Department and no State contribution is payable to the lending institutions in respect of cases found to have been improperly admitted into the scheme.  Eligibility for the scheme was confined to farmers in severe financial difficulty who drew up a financial reconstruction plan showing a return to viability by the end of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment assistance payable to claimants residing in urban areas is higher than that which is payable to those residing in other areas. Urban areas for unemployment assistance purposes are defined as every county borough, the borough of Dún Laoghaire and every urban district the population of which exceeds 7,000.  The urban rate is also payable to a claimant who resides <Col N="888" /> outside an urban area in a house owned by the corporation or council of an urban area.</P>
      <P>The provision of different rates for urban and other areas was based on the concept of differing living costs as between the two locations.  With the development and growth of urban areas over the years this concept has undoubtedly been weakened.</P>
      <P>However, the replacement of the non-urban rates of unemployment assistance by the higher urban rates is a matter that would affect claimants throughout the whole country as well as Dublin county. This would have significant financial implications and for this reason a change is not contemplated in present circumstances.</P>

The purpose of designation is to bring forward the date of construction of a town centre for Tallaght.  This project has been delayed for too long and it is the Government's aim to utilise the tax incentives and rates remission of the urban renewal scheme to expedite it.  The precise area to be designated will be the one which offers the best prospects of early completion of a town centre.  Negotiations are presently underway between Dublin Corporation, the owners of lands earmarked for construction of the town centre, and a prospective developer.  The choice of area to be designated will depend on the outcome of these negotiations.  The benefits of designation for developers and occupiers will be the generous tax incentives and rates remission available.  The benefits for Dublin County Council will be the realisation of their aim of providing a town centre.  In the longer term there will also be considerable rates revenue.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of the amount of money which is available in this year's Estimates for the renovation of Cloverhill housing estate, Bally-fermot, Dublin 10; if his attention has been drawn to the proposal by the Cherry Orchard Community Association that all residents-tenants, tenant-purchasers and purchasers should equally share the burden that would, under the strict terms of the scheme fall on tenant-purchasers only, most of whom could not afford the sums involved and therefore would hold up the renovation in at least half the blocks of houses; whether the decision to opt for wooden window frames rather than aluminium frames, although saving money in the short term, will cost extra maintenance in the long term; if, in those circumstances he will review that decision; if he will receive a deputation from the Cherry Orchard Community Association or alternatively the senior officials of his Department will receive such a deputation to discuss the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>A revised cost plan for the refurbishment of this estate was recently received from Dublin Corporation and is being examined in the Department.  A decision will be conveyed to the corporation on completion of this examination.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the remedial works scheme, tenant purchasers are required to meet half the cost of the carrying out of grant-aided works to their dwellings. Tenant purchasers benefit considerably from this arrangement as the value of their dwellings is enhanced on completion of the works, half the cost of which is borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning and the execution of improvement works under the remedial works scheme is the responsibility of the housing authority, in this instance Dublin <Col N="896" /> Corporation.  The corporation's proposals have, I understand, been discussed with representatives of the residents.  In these circumstances a meeting such as suggested, with a deputation from the residents would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position shortly to notify housing authorities of their capital allocations for 1988 under the remedial works scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the great distress that has been caused to a number of patients in pain awaiting hip operations who were attending Dr. Steeven's Hospital, Dublin 8 until it closed recently; the hospital these patients are to attend; their prospects of an early operation especially for those who already have had operations planned twice or three times and have had them cancelled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been lengthy waiting lists for elective orthopaedic surgery for many years, not least because of the ever increasing demand for new treatments which are generally very successful.  The placing of persons on a waiting list is a clinical decision for the consultant involved. There is a regular assessment of those on the waiting list by the consultant, who takes into consideration each patient's condition and other circumstances in determining their place on the list.</P>
      <P>Should a consultant feel that a patient's condition has deteriorated while on the waiting list and require immediate attention, the patient will receive the appropriate attention as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Facilities have now been provided in the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals for patients who require such operations and who were formerly seen by consultants in Dr. Steeven's Hospital.  Operating facilities now available in these hospitals represent a considerable improvement on <Col N="897" /> those which were available in Dr. Steevens Hospital.  Appropriate provision has been made in the non-capital allocations of these hospitals.  I am confident that when staff and services settle in at their new location we will see a significant overall improvement in the quality of service available and a general reduction in the number on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In relation to waiting lists for hip operations in the Dublin area, I have asked my officials to keep the situation under constant review to ensure that people who urgently need an operation receive it.  As I have previously stated, I regard the improvement of the availability of elective orthopaedic services as a priority.</P>
