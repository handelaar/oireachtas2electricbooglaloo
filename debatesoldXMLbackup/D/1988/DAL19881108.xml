      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his Department will make funds available through the national lottery to the Arts Council to enable them to make a payment to the Belltable Arts Centre in Limerick which is due to close in a month's time because of its accumulated deficit; and if his attention has been drawn to the enormous contribution made by this arts centre to the cultural life of Limerick and the mid-west region generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will provide moneys from the national lottery through the Arts Council for the Cork Theatre Company which is in jeopardy; and the action he proposes to take to ensure that adequate funds are available to the Arts Council of 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste (for the Taoiseach) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the excellent work which is being done by both the Cork <Col N="1894" /> Theatre Company and the Belltable Arts Centre.  The financing of these facilities is primarily a matter for the Arts Council which, out of its increased funding, raised the grant to the Cork Theatre Company from £15,500 in 1985 to £60,000 in 1988 and raised the grant to the Belltable Arts Centre from £16,000 to £40,000 in the same period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that the Belltable Arts Centre in Limerick has received a total of £10,000 from the national lottery since its establishment; that the Arts Council have no funds whatever from which they can give it any further support; that as a result of the inability of the Arts Council to fund touring theatres that theatre, in common with others in the provinces, now has difficulty in attracting companies who can play in it; that as a result its cumulated deficit has increased considerably and that it now has had to give notice that it will have to close at the beginning of December if some funds are not forthcoming from the national lottery?  In those circumstances, will the Tánaiste make arrangements for some reasonable payment to be made to avert what will be a catastrophe in artistic terms, bearing in mind that if the theatre closes unfortunately it may never re-open again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly have another look at this.  However, the fact is that there has been a substantial rise in the grant, year in year out.  From 1985 to 1988 there was a lift from £16,000 to £40,000.  I will have the matter examined, as suggested by the Deputy, because we are naturally anxious to help the Arts. However, it cannot be open-ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that this theatre has been run very efficiently down the years and that there has been no waste of money?  Will he agree that the fact that it has been able to survive for eight years with an accumulated deficit of only £70,000 is a great credit to it?  Surely the lottery funds are available for this type of purpose, if for no other?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Lottery funds have been diverted to this project via the Arts Council. Lottery funding, and funding from the Arts Council, have played a major role in rehabilitating a number of art and theatre projects of this type and they stand up to scrutiny under any criteria. However, I will have the case made by Deputy O'Malley examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Tánaiste's reply to Question No. 5, I should like to ask him if his reply refers to the action proposed to be taken to ensure that adequate funds are available to the Arts Council for 1989.  In the Estimates the budget for the Arts Council was cut back by 13 per cent.  Is the Tánaiste aware that the Director of the Arts Council has said that they cannot fund any body or guarantee any funding for any festival next year until they have restored to them the money they need for their year-toyear running?  Will the Tánaiste say if he is aware of that statement and when it is proposed to restore the funding from the national lottery to the Arts Council, something that is of great urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is under examination along the lines suggested by the Deputy but it is premature at this stage to say what the outcome of the examination will be.  The Cork Theatre Company has received substantial help over the years by the Arts Council.  I understand the Deputy's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In conection with the Belltable Arts Centre, I should like to know if the Tánaiste is aware that the better theatre companies are now not willing to put on productions there because the management are unable to underwrite the cost of production. Is the Tánaiste aware that consequently the theatre is unable to trade its <Col N="1896" /> way out of the difficulties?  In the examination which the Tánaiste promised to Deputy O'Malley, will he look at the possibility of underwriting individual production costs so that the theatre can trade out of the difficulties it is in at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement regarding the recent meeting which took place with ICTU indicating the matters discussed, the representations made by the Congress and the Government's response; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the meeting to which the Deputy refers is the meeting of the Central Review Committee held on 26 October 1988.  The committee, which is chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, is comprised of representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federated Union of Employers, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, Macra na Feirme and representatives of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food, Industry and Commerce and Labour.</P>
      <P>The meeting of the committee held on 26 October was effectively devoted to a review of progress in the implementation of the employment measures set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee heard representations from the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA, SFADCo and Udarás na Gaeltachta showing how the job targets in manufacturing industry and international services in the programme were being achieved.  It was agreed that the committee would issue a detailed <Col N="1897" /> statement giving a sectoral breakdown of the new jobs being created in accordance with the programme and this will issue shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste when this sectoral breakdown will be issued and the reason for the delay in issuing it?  Did ICTU express their serious concern at the Government's failure to implement the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and their failure to provide the additional jobs, provided for the the agreement?  Did they refer to the fact that so far this year there were 18,000 redundancies from existing employment coupled with emigration of 30,000 to 40,000, people who otherwise would have been seeking employment here?  Were those matters discussed?  If so, what was the Government's response to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always found the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to be very constructive in these discussions. Indeed, their participation in partnership with the other social partners and the relevant Departments has been a key element in achieving the very real progress that has been made by this Government in the past 18 months.  As I have said, we will be issuing very shortly a sectoral breakdown of the new jobs that have been created.  I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, of course, has been very active, has been very successful in recent weeks and there will be further announcements forthcoming.  By reason of our economic recovery and rectification of the finances, we have secured the economic environment to rectify the job situation.  We take great pride in that achievement and all parties in the House will be hearing more about this shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Irish Congress of Trade Unions give their imprimatur to what the Tánaiste calls the &ldquo;recovery in the economy&rdquo;, as evidenced by emigration of between 30,000 and 40,000 a year and 18,000 redundancies so far this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Tánaiste has not replied to it.  I want to know whether Congress accept that it is in order for the economy and the so called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that 35,000 people are leaving the country per year and that there were 18,000 redundancies?  Is that the economic climate that the Tánaiste would have us believe is doing so well?</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste ensure, in the sectoral breakdown he has promised, that information would be included of the sectoral breakdown of <Col N="1899" /> jobs that have been lost during the relevant period so that we can see the net increase or decrease in a particular sector rather than gross figures?  Will the Tánaiste ensure also that the sectoral breakdown will also contain a reference to emigration, and in particular to graduate emigration, by sector to indicate the extent of the talent lost to the country during the period of the programme for so-called national recovery?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will deal with the Deputy's last point.  The economy has been recovering over the past 18 months. Any job losses and emigration losses germinated and were sustained during the previous Government's period in office. In the past 18 months in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have started to work with the legitimate representatives of the Irish trade union movement and with the workers of this country sitting in on these meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has come in from the cold.  The number of redundancies referred to by Deputy Taylor as being of the order of 18,000 this year are, in fact, of the order of 7,700 in the manufacturing sector.  Has Deputy FitzGerald got those figures?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not 18,000 redundancies, the figure being bandied around by Deputy Taylor, but 7,700.  Jobs are increasing rapidly and recent indices indicate that we are pulling right out of the position under which this economy has laboured since 1982.  We have pulled out of it because of our responsible attitude to public finances in the past 18 months and the creation of an economic environment to rectify the job situation.

The most up-to-date figure we have arises out of a recent labour survey which states that there are 6,000 more at work in the economy now for the first time.  At no stage ever was there such a high level of people at work as there is now and that is the important figure.

      <P>President Delors' discussions with the Government covered Community matters with particular reference to the reform of the Structural Funds and the completion of the Single European Market.  The social dimension of the Single Market was dealt with by President Delors in his address to a conference for trade unions affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 28 October at which I was glad to be present. I am placing copies of his speech and that delivered by the Tánaiste on my behalf at the conference in the Library.  It was a most constructive conference.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will get an opportunity of reading the Taoiseach's speech which I read and Mr. Delors' speech.  It will be seen that both speeches were very much on all fours with each other with regard to the particular aspect of the social dimension.  There was complete understanding between President Delors and the Taoiseach and between President Delors and this Government when we met him as a group.  The main thrust as he sees it and as we see it is to emphasise the social dimension both in regional and in personal terms.  The Deputy will get an opportunity of seeing that in the Library when he looks at the two texts.  So far as the other question is concerned, it was not raised by President Delors.  It stands there and the announcement will be made at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The national accounts publication referred to by the Deputy is the latest in an annual series.  The published data are based on information submitted in response to a regular detailed questionnaire dispatched to member states of OECD countries in July-August each year.  Replies with available data are generally supplied to OECD in November-December each year by the Central Statistics Office.  The material requested is very comprehensive and is sought in the format of the UN System of National Accounts.  While the Irish national accounts conform with the concepts and definitions therein the precise detail is not available for some of the analyses.  Virtually no country supplied all the material desired by OECD.  With regard to the specific items referred to in <Col N="1912" /> the question the following is the situation: Item (a), gross domestic product is not available by reference to institutional sectors in the Irish accounts.  Relatively few countries do this analysis at present. Resources permitting, it is however an area of developmental interest; Item (b), private non-profit institutions are generally consolidated with households in the accounts of most countries and are not separately identified; Items (c), (d), (e) and (f), the sectoral breakdown requested here is greater than is at present available in the Irish national accounts.  Priority is being given to development of a detailed sectoral analysis of value added and its components. In fact for items (e) and (f), additional information has recently been dispatched to OECD.  The National Statistics Board have in their recent report recognised the need to accord a high priority to the further development of the national accounts.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  Would he indicate if there will be a substantial difference in the amount of information that will be available from Ireland when this publication is published next year and, in particular, can he indicate the gaps which are now empty and which may be filled in next year's annual accounts?  Would he agree that it is particularly useful to have information of this kind for a variety of countries so that one can assess how Ireland is doing on a league table?  Would he agree also having large gaps in respect of Ireland in a publication like this is bad from every point of view and, therefore, would he give priority to trying to ensure that we are able to give all possible information for inclusion in next year's national accounts tables?</P>

      <P>Considerable additional work is required each year to supply national accounts material to OECD following the publication of the accounts domestically.  The material is requested purely on a voluntary basis and indeed is so detailed that no country conforms fully with the request.  Very heavy additional <Col N="1913" /> resources would be required if we were to achieve the objective of supplying all of the information they request from year to year.  I might add that the information we give to OECD is very detailed.  I am sure the Deputy has on file the 13 pages of statistical information supplied to OECD for this year alone.  Our main priority is to ensure that the information we are collecting on a statistical basis gives the greatest possible benefit and value to us. If the OECD require additional information which is not readily available, it is difficult for us to confirm.  I would add again that it is requested purely on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to the recoupment of expenditure by Louth County Council on higher education grants.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the higher education grants scheme in 1968, recoupment in respect of the local authorities expenditure in a particular financial year is paid by my Department in the following financial year.  There was no undue delay in the payment early this year or recoupment to Louth County Council in respect of its expenditure in 1987.  In accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, recoupment is payable only in respect of the cost of the grants awarded and paid by an authority and, accordingly, the amount in respect of interest charges cannot be included in the recoupment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying in relation to the statutory obligation which requires a local authority to administer the grant scheme that when it has an interest charge attached to it, that the interest charges which arise specifically <Col N="1915" /> from the timelag between the sanction and the Minister's Department giving out the money to the local authority must be borne from the local authority's budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly willing to answer in a national sense but I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the question related to Louth. The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968 only allows for payment in respect of the cost of the grants awarded and paid by local authorities. There is no provision, therefore, for the payment of any interest charges if incurred by a local authority in connection with the award of the higher education grants.  In relation to the question about County Louth, which was tabled by Deputy Bell, I would point out that Louth County Council's application for recoupment in respect of its expenditure in 1987 was received in my Department on 7 January 1988 and payments was made on 13 January 1988, exactly six days later. A supplementary claim received on 19 February 1988 was paid six days later on 25 February 1988.  That shows great celerity.</P>

      <P>The posts of child care assistant in special national schools come within the terms of the Government directive prohibiting the filling of vacancies occurring in the public service.

Why are areas which under all the criteria are recognised as being disadvantaged not recognised as being disadvantaged by the Department of Education for the purposes of staffing in schools?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This differentiation as between being disadvantaged for staffing purposes and being disadvantaged for the payment of special grants has operated for some years.  It is not a new arrangement. The House and Deputy Mac Giolla know that.  There are two distinct schemes in operation and the inclusion of a school in one scheme does not automatically entitle it to inclusion in another. A total of 164 schools are included in the financial aid scheme which is operated by the special education section.  Of these, 68 are also included in the payments section scheme of concession posts while a further 36 have applied for inclusion in the staffing scheme also.  The remaining 60 schools are outside of that.  I agree <Col N="1917" /> that an anomaly arises between those designated as disadvantaged for staffing purposes and those designated for grant purposes only.  That anomaly has existed for years and when conditions improve it can be looked at by the Department.</P>

The Deputy may not have been aware that they had received the revised allocation. They got it quite recently.</P>

Would she accept, in particular, that because the phrase NIHE &mdash; or National Institute for Higher Education &mdash; is not internationally familiar, there is a real danger that the graduates of these colleges will <Col N="1925" /> be equated with graduates of polytechnics in England, institutions of a much lower standard?</P>

As we are all aware and freely acknowledge, the two institutions in question have done wonderful work in the field of third level education.  It is a matter of very grave concern to me that the correct decisions be taken for the two institutions concerned and in the overall context of the university question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Which index of disadvantage did the Minister consult which led to the situation that ten disadvantaged teachers were allocated to Roscommon, ten to Mayo, but only two to the city of Cork and only four to the city of Dublin?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the intricacies of existing pupil-teacher ratios and the change in ratio is a minefield and one in which I hope the Deputy will have a long time to learn in his position as Opposition spokesperson.  The two counties the Deputy singled out appeared to receive an extra allocation because of the existing over-quota in those two county committees.  I do not have the relevant figures with me because I did not anticipate in the Priority Questions that two counties would be singled out which were not mentioned.  I know from my own knowledge and perusal of the matter when it was raised in the media in the summer that those two county committees were greatly over-quoted and, therefore, the allocation to them had to take that into account.  As has often been said here by many contributors to debates, disadvantage is not fully an urban matter.  It embraces many criteria. One can be disadvantaged in a rural area in County Mayo or in County Roscommon just as one can be disadvantaged in the heart of any city.</P>

      <P>As I have said, the basic qualifications appropriate for employment by the education or training provided under the programme will be required.  To answer the Deputy's question in regard to in-service training courses, there would be a need for the teachers taking part in these Youthreach programmes to have access to in-service training courses.  The areas which are to be included in the scheme due to begin in January were chosen because they <Col N="1929" /> wanted to participate in the scheme. They put their names forward and they are pleased to participate in the scheme. They want to participate because they see there is a need for this scheme.  I feel it is a very worthy initiative and will have an attraction for young people who through no fault of the existing system have found that regular school holds no attraction for them.

      <P>It is a very fair question and with respect, a Cheann Comhairle, it does have a bearing on this matter.  In the first place the participants in any Youthreach programme will have to be six months out of school and the principal of the school which he or she attended will have to vouch for the fact, both of us and the Department of Labour, that the young student has dropped out of school and is six months out of school.  In relation to the question which the Deputy raised, that is one constraint. Secondly, I hope that many of those who will participate in these programmes will be attracted back into the school system and, if not, they will receive skills which will increase their confidence and faith, in themselves, in the future and in what they can achieve through these programmes which will be very carefully worked out, taking into account good economic standards as well as good training standards.</P>

Would he agree that that seems to indicate a lack of clarity in how to address the question of school transport, to put it at its mildest?</P>

      <P>The Department are going to achieve substantial economies in the operation of the service in 1989 and to this end all aspects of the service are under continuing review.  It is fair to say that the standard of service provided remains very high despite the fact that we have found it necessary to make substantial cutbacks in the amount of money allocated and this is due in no uncertain <Col N="1932" /> way to those involved in the provision of the service, particularly CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Circular M85/85 which issued from the Department of Education in 1985, the junior cycle was to be of three years' duration and the leaving certificate course be of two years' duration in all post primary schools.  In accordance with the terms of Circular M8/88 which issued, a pupil may not repeat any year of the post primary courses, except with the prior approval of my Department.  All such applications should be in writing and be forwarded through the principal of the school concerned.</P>
      <P>In the 1987-88 school year my Department received 449 applications for repeat years and approved 334 of them &mdash; over 74 per cent.  A total of 1,288 such applications have been received to date in the current school year and 80 per cent of these have been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the present restrictions are <Col N="1933" /> concerned, I am satisfied that the current procedures and the guidelines in operation in my Department ensure equitable treatment.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to provide details of any savings resulting in repeating a year of the post primary course, which in any case predated the circular referred to. Let me point out, even though this was not asked but it is implied in the question, that there will be no changes in the arrangements for a repeat of the leaving certificate as between last year and this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask two brief questions.  First of all, will the Minister for Education tell us if she has sought the advice of the Attorney General in regard to the constitutionality of removing the discretionary right of parents and principals in respect of repeating a year?  Secondly, is the Minister satisfied and what is her opinion that the charge for repeating a year is one that will create difficulties for those of lower economic means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first question, the parent will consult with the relevant principal who, in turn, will forward an application to the Department.  In regard to the Deputy's second question in regard to students from the lower socio-economic grouping seeking to repeat a year, let me say that following consultation with the IVEA that schools who run a complete remedial year or a year perceived to be such have been given a total concession.  Secondly, when we receive applications from principals we do not inquire into the socio-economic backgrounds of the students concerned.  They are all treated equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to announce, for the information of the House, that I signed an agreement yesterday which delimits the continental shelf between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> Ireland and Britain are situated on a common continental shelf which had been the subject of overlapping claims by both parties.  The line of delimitation, which was agreed by negotiation, is based on the applicable international law.  The negotiations have produced an equitable solution to the division of the continental shelf between the two countries in the Irish Sea, south and south-west areas, as well as in the north-west area off the Donegal coast.</P>
    <P>The agreement will remove the need to submit the matter to independent arbitration.</P>
    <P>Copies of the agreement have been placed in the Library.  I propose next week that a formal motion approving the agreement be taken by Dáil Éireann.  I understand the Government Chief Whip will discuss with the Whips of other parties the details of how this matter will be debated next week.</P>

      <P>The Deputy surprises me.  Does he not appreciate English?  This <Col N="2057" /> has got to do with the division of the seabed resources and is separate altogether from the jurisdictional aspects in regard to Rockall and in regard to Northern Ireland.  They are matters for subsequent political discussion or otherwise. What we wished to do in this agreement was to get the maximum agreement in an area of the continental shelf that carried no contention and that strengthens Ireland's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> all other parties throughout the world that may have claims, as well as Britain, in regard to these substantial waters.  The Deputy really does not appreciate the enormous benefits that accrue as a result of this agreement.</P>

      <P>This agreement, for very obvious reasons &mdash; because of the contention and conflict involved &mdash; does not take into account the coastline of Northern Ireland from Carlingford Lough over to Malin Head, so that is not involved in this at all.  Neither does the rock of Rockall come into this matter.  It has been excluded.  Any jurisdictional aspect of the claim to it is excluded from this agreement. As long as people focus on that as the preliminery starting point we can have a constructive debate on the remainder of the matter.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Bill on Thursday last I mentioned that I would be dealing more with practicalities rather than technicalities in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> However, having had a further look at this Bill over the weekend there are two specific areas about which I am more than a little concerned.  First, the banking institutions in so far as they would come under the scope of the Bill &mdash; I will give my reasons for that at a later stage &mdash; and secondly, the charges and the Revenue Commissioners.  If the gangster element to which I referred earlier &mdash; what I mentioned as the here today, gone tomorrow whizz kids who are liable to turn up the following week with some other get rich quick operation &mdash; are guilty of murder in the financial sense, then the banking institutions, if they could not be accused of murder, could certainly be accused of manslaughter for the way they have behaved over the years.</P>
    <P>The area that concerns me is in regard to section 175, Part IX of the Bill.  It relates to members' and creditors' proposals as to who has priority in regard to charges against a company which has become insolvent.  I understand that there are broadly five categories.  Liquidation expenses is a top priority.  Secondly, secured creditors &mdash; groups of preferential creditors, local authorities and at the top of that list are the Revenue Commissioners.  Category 5 refers to anybody who has a floating charge.  In most cases these floating charges are held by the banks.  What concerns me greatly is, at the bottom of the list, anybody to whom the company owes money and who has not got a charge.  My question to the Minister is, should the Revenue Commissioners hold priority preferential status in relation to this matter?  There is a case for the removal or amendment of this clause and I would ask specifically that the Minister consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of a company which has gone into liquidation and owes £300,000 to creditors, £100,000 to the Revenue Commissioners and has assets of £100,000.  My reading of the situation as it stands is that the Revenue take the lot, after the liquidators' expenses have been paid.  The bulk of the £300,000 could be owed to suppliers who will be forced out of business and who will have to start <Col N="2068" /> on the vicious circle again.  This has been the sad history of many of our small indigenous companies in the past.  They were the last people to be considered.  A supplier might be owed £50,000 and could be totally dependent on getting in that money.  If a company becomes insolvent, by the time the assets are disposed of there is nothing left for the supplier, a legitimate trading company who have met their commitments to Revenue and everybody else.  That company will be forced out of business.</P>
    <P>In the history of small businesses, when such cases as I have mentioned had arisen they found little comfort in going to the banking institutions.  That is why I would like to see the banks coming under the scope of this Bill.  As I said last week, there is now a growing sense of responsibility and confidence in the commercial sector.  They have renewed confidence in the economy and for very good reason.  For far too long this sector has experienced a sense of total insecurity in the market and a total lack of confidence in the banking system.  In the past two years there has been a marked improvement in this area.  Exports have now reached an all-time high.  I feel confident that if the trend continues &mdash; there is every good reason to believe that it will &mdash; export figures will have doubled by 1992 as compared with 1987.</P>
    <P>Much of this is due to the hard work and flair of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with particular reference to the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, for his work in the marketing area in that Department.  I refer specifically to the establishment of the trading houses set up by the Minister.  They will be of enormous benefit to small companies who heretofore had neither the finance nor the capacity in some cases to market their products.  I have known companies in the export business, specifically in the meat trade, who have gone to the wall because companies, mainly in mainland Europe, to which they exported their products had become insolvent overnight.  The operation of the trading house system will, I hope, ensure <Col N="2069" /> that there will be less likelihood of this happening in the future.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, there was a total lack of confidence in the banking system in this country.  I feel I should put on record in this House the irresponsible attitude of the banks over the past 20 years.  During a time of recession and depression the main banks maintained a monopoly and operated a cartel to protect their own ambitious interests.  High interest rates, enormous bank charges and poor service were the only response from those institutions during that period.  Companies, and businesses in general, had to refurbish and reorganise their operations to maintain their competitiveness in the market-place.  To add to that, legislation compelled them to comply with health and fire regulations and most of that work was carried out with money borrowed from the banks. The high interest rates during the late seventies and early eighties and other penalties imposed by the banking institutions, together with depressed trade, the black economy and cross-Border trading, left many of those firms in dire financial straits.</P>
    <P>The least the banks could have done at that time was to have been sympathetic to that sector.  They were not.  Their answer was to impose an extra 6 per cent annually on overdue accounts.  That played a major part in crippling that sector.  In turn, that led to a lower rate of output, unemployment, and added further to the depression.  The Minister, therefore, should continue to keep a close eye on the operations of the banking institutions. They may state that they have dismantled the cartel but many people believe, as I do, that it exists in a practical sense.  It is long past the time that the doors were opened and other institutions such as credit unions were allowed to operate a banking system.</P>
    <P>Most small companies are privately owned and operated.  In addition, most are limited liability companies set up under the terms of the 1963 Act.  The benefits available to a businessman forming a company under the 1963 Act arise <Col N="2070" /> from the creation of corporate personality for his undertaking and limited liability for himself.  In practice, for small companies the procedure of limited liability is circumvented by the banks and other financial institutions because they insist on personal guarantees for the owners or shareholders.  In many instances company directors not only have to mortgage their businesses but their homes.  Therefore, the limited liability holds only for trade and other creditors who tend to be other small companies.  From the beginning a small company tends to suffer from a lack of equity and a high level of bank borrowing. All the risks are being borne by the company and its shareholders, and the rewards favour the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister examines the feasibility of introducing a low interest loan scheme for small indigenous enterprises.  That scheme should not alone cover the manufacturing sector but be broadened to cater for the service sector.  I am sure the Minister will agree that our greatest potential for employment exists in the service sector.  It could expand rapidly if such a scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for inbuilt protection for the legitimate company.  The means should be made available to eliminate the gangster-type operator whom the State has been powerless to deal with up to now.  The problem of delinquent directors who abuse the concept of limited liability had to be tackled.  In liquidations small companies were usually unsecured creditors and they had the problem of dealing with other companies, small and large, who set out deliberately to abuse existing company law.  In other words, the multinationals could buy and sell at their own price.  The ban on below-cost selling introduced by the Minister has more or less put an end to that practice. However, that ban should be extended to cover vegetables, with particular reference to potatoes, because many farmers will be forced out of business this year due to below-cost selling of potatoes by multinationals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> The problem of delinquent directors who salvage the assets of one company only to start up trading with another company, or under a different name, had to be tackled in a positive manner.  I am glad the Minister has done so in section 6.  At the same time there is an inbuilt security, a protection for the ordinary decent and honest businessman on whom the country depends for its continued growth and employment.  Large companies can have inordinate purchasing power over smaller concerns.  Prior to this if a large company became insolvent, or near insolvent, there was little a smaller company, could do under existing legislation to ensure a reorganisation.  I am pleased to see that in Part IX there is a mechanism for the rescue of what has been described as sick companies who are regarded as potentially viable.  The Bill provides a welcome breathing space for such companies to reorganise.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister gives consideration to my remarks about the banks and their responsibilities.  I hope he will consider my remarks about charges and the monopoly that exists.  I am more than pleased to give my support to the Bill which should be adopted unanimously by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which was initiated by Deputy John Bruton and the Coalition Government.  It represents the most major and comprehensive legislation in this area since the Companies Act, 1963, and contains 11 parts and 207 sections.  The Bill appears to strike a fair balance between the need to firmly tackle abuse and malpractice and to discourage and prevent dishonest and reckless people becoming involved in limited liability companies.  The Bill will encourage and promote honest and genuine enterprises. When the Irish economy moved into a recession which it is still in, the problem presented by the growing number of insolvencies received a lot of attention.  The Coalition Government introduced this Bill to protect companies and to prevent abuses.  Those abuses ranged from bad and dishonest directors <Col N="2072" /> to the misuse of the concept of limited liability.  Therefore, I welcome the general principle which motivated the Bill and I should like to acknowledge the work and commitment involved in recent years in bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>However, while I genuinely welcome the Bill, I would like to emphasise that it is imperative that, although abuse must be dealt with, the Bill does not restrict the normal day-to-day enterprise system that exists in the country.  Companies must not be deterred from taking risks which at a later date may become illegal or may be considered as reckless or dishonest trading under the provisions of this Bill.  It is vital that the Bill strikes the proper balance between curbing abuse and restricting normal business practice. Good legislation must never be oppressive. In this case, oppression would lead to the closures of small business, a loss of confidence in the economic sector of the community, a rise in unemployment and ultimately rising levels of emigration. We must protect against this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to look at the proposals contained in the Bill and to make some observations and suggestions, which I believe would ensure that a balance is maintained in this vital legislation. First, I will look at the proposals with regard to company directors.  The purpose of Part VII, Chapter I, is to prevent directors of companies, which are insolvent and winding up, from being appointed as directors or becoming involved in the promotion or formation of companies, unless such companies meet certain minimum conditions, including greater capitalisation as protection to the creditors of the new company.  Section 117 provides that where a company is insolvent and winding up, any person who is a director of the company at the commencement of the winding up or within the previous 12 months will not qualify to be appointed as a director or be concerned with the promotion or formation of any company unless that company has a share capital of £50,000 in the case of a limited public company or a share capital of £10,000 in the case of a <Col N="2073" /> private company and the share capital must be fully paid up in cash in each case. Obviously, the aim is to prevent fraud and to ensure that company directors who have a bad record do not continue to be involved in the destruction of another company.  However, it must be noted that fraudulent, and dishonest directors are in the minority.</P>
    <P>The underlying aim of the Bill as expressed in the explanatory memorandum is to create a climate of confidence for business activity in which genuine commercial development will take place.  If this climate is to be created, the Bill must distinguish between fraudulent and genuine business risk.  It is important to note that in contrast to the 1963 Act, the present Bill provides for the disqualification of company directors in a much wider range of circumstances. Under the 1963 Act, the court could disqualify a person from being a director where such a person was convicted on indictment of any offence in connection with the management of the company or of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty, whether in connection with the company or not.  Under section 128 of this Bill, such a person would be automatically disqualified for a minimum of five years following such conviction.  In addition, the court at its discretion may disqualify a person for such a period as it sees fit, where it is satisfied that the person is guilty of fraud, or breach of duty in relation to the company, which makes him unfit to be concerned with the management of a company.  I am concerned that a director involved in a company which goes into liquidation for perfectly legitimate reasons would be victimised under these penalty clauses. Because of the additional financial guarantees required, they will be put at a severe disadvantage and may find it impossible to launch their development plans.  This section makes no allowance for the honest businessman who is caught up in a liquidation but wishes to form a new enterprise.  We will have to look seriously at this question.</P>
    <P>This section deals also with people who have acted dishonestly within companies. <Col N="2074" /> It is important to emphasise that these positions are not designed in principle to prevent directors of insolvent companies from starting off in business again but merely provide the minimum set of safeguards in the interests of future creditors. The Bill therefore aims to eliminate the Phoenix Syndrome while at the same time attempting to punish the corporate cowboys.  Indeed, I think the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners could lend considerably more support and give valuable assistance in making it much more difficult for these individuals and companies to run up debts in the first place.</P>
    <P>How are dishonest directors to be brought to book?  Under the present legislation if the receiver in a company being liquidated, identifies a fraudulent dealing, he is obliged to take action against such a director.  This is difficult for a number of reasons.  First, the finances necessary to do this within the company may not be available.  Second, it is very difficult to identify legally exactly what is meant by fraudulent and make the case stick.  Therefore how can the problem be solved?  Mr. Peter Usher in his excellent work, <i>Company Law in Ireland,</i> has suggested that a fund be created to enable liquidators to pursue dishonest directors. I believe this idea has a lot of validity, yet it is not catered for in the proposed legislation.  The cost of creating this fund could be spread over the business community as a whole, for instance, by the imposition of a levy on all companies registered at the Companies Registration Office.  Mr. Usher proposes an alternative approach which involves shifting some of the burden of dealing with the consequences of company failure from the ordinary creditor to the secured creditor. The secured creditors, banks and financial institutions, have charges over the assets of the company and could be required to devote a proportion of their secured claims to the liquidator's fund to enable him to pursue directors guilty of fraud.  If the balance, which I suggested at the outset, is to be maintained then it is vital that structures be set up within the Bill to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> The problem of company fraud would be tackled much better by providing the liquidators with adequate resources to pursue directors who have deliberately cheated their creditors rather than providing for directors to be made liable for the debts of the company in cases where there may have been no conscious dishonesty. I accept that it is difficult in certain situations to distinguish between (a) fraudulent, deliberate dishonesty; (b) necessary business risk and (c) what we would call reckless trading.</P>
    <P>Sections 106 and 107 attempt to deal with this problem and section 107 is particularly pertinent.  There have been many cases where directors have operated a company in such a way, that without fraudulent intent they have completely disregarded the interests of the creditors and shareholders.  In devising the reckless trading provision, the Minister and the Department have endeavoured to ensure that it will not have adverse effects on business by providing safeguards to protect the honest director.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 104, if the court considers the person has acted honestly or responsibly it may relieve him wholly or partly from personal liability on whatever terms it thinks fit.  However, it must be pointed out that phrases such as &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; are equitable phrases and the instruction of such phrases may involve much litigation before the exact meaning of these terms is clarified.  Therefore, at this stage, it is important that these ambiguities within the Bill be carefully examined and if possible taken out.</P>
    <P>Great care must be taken in framing the legislation so that appropriate recognition is given to the reality that risk is an inherently acceptable aspect of business and, accordingly, directors of trading companies should not be unjustly penalised because of this reality.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces the concept of reckless trading.  It would be totally unacceptable in any circumstances that directors compelled to take acceptable risks in somewhat uncertain trading conditions <Col N="2076" /> should be held liable for reckless trading. I recommend therefore that the concept of wrongful trading should be substituted for reckless trading in the Bill.  Again, this would help to clarify some of the ambiguous terms which exist in the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    <P>I fully support any move to impose appropriate penalties on those who seek to trade in a fraudulent manner.  It is essential, however, that any steps which are legitimately taken to protect the public from the actions of those who seek to trade fraudulently should not be such as to virtually undermine limited liability status, which is the cornerstone of commercial enterprise and has been so for more than a century.  In a small country with a very high level of unemployment &mdash; approximately 18 per cent &mdash; and with a national output per head of population of only 70 per cent of that of the EC average, the main focus of our efforts should be to ensure the creation of a climate which will attract more people to establish enterprises.  We should ensure that an appropriate balance is always maintained between the need to encourage enterprise and the need to protect the interest of those affected by the enterprise.</P>
    <P>As I have stressed in my general acceptance of the Bill in principle, I hope these suggestions may be useful in tying down the ambiguities which appear to be an inherent part of the Bill as now proposed.  If it is important on the one hand to weed out dishonesty and fraudulence it is also important to provide some kind of structure within which companies going through hard times may find or receive the opportunity to restructure or redevelop their business.  With this in mind I would like to look at Part IX of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IX proposes the introduction of a new legal mechanism for the rescue and reconstruction of ailing but potentially viable companies.  It has been rightly said that the primary objective of insolvency law must be to support the legitimate efforts of directors and shareholders who wish to save an ailing business while, at the same time, protecting the rights of <Col N="2077" /> creditors in the event of the business collapsing. Joseph Chamberlain, the former president of the British Board of Trade, once said that Parliament has to endeavour, as far as possible, to protect, to salvage and also to diminish the number of insolvencies.  In this respect, therefore, we have much to learn from other countries who have tackled the problem of the rehabilitation of companies in trouble.</P>
    <P>Under our present system it is necessary for the directors to have substantially developed their plan for reorganisation before they can approach the court, whereas in the United States, for example, the protection of the court is available during the <i>hiatus</i> period while the plan is being developed.  In the United Kingdom the Insolvency Act, 1985, took note of these developments in the United States.  The proposed legislation proposes a rehabilitation period of three months to allow companies in difficulty to get some type of reorganisation or regeneration into action.  I would welcome this new legal mechanism for the rescue or reconstruction of ailing but potentially viable companies.  The central feature of the proposal is the appointment by the court of an examiner and the policing of the company concerned under the protection of the court for a period of three months.</P>
    <P>However, there are some suggestions and modifications which I would like to point out here. First, the powers of the examiner need to be strengthened and clarified.  It is vital that the brief which is to be given to the examiner be clearly identified.  Otherwise, we may have a situation where companies which are not really potentially viable find themselves benefiting from the rehabilitation period. This would be a time-wasting exercise and would create a terrible lack of confidence in the new structure.  Secondly, the examiner should be required to report in a timely fashion and in full but not to the degree that would prejudice the company's competitive position.</P>
    <P>There is also a very important supplementary point to be made here in relation to preferential collection of debts.  This point deals with the area of <Col N="2078" /> creditors.  In the event of a company being in difficulty, the Revenue Commissioners and local authorities have a public duty to collect unpaid taxes and other charges and they should carry out this duty without reliance on preferential status in the event of a winding-up, if that occurs.  A bad debt owed to the State is likely to be insignificant in terms of total Government receipts but the loss of a similar sum to a supplier in an insolvent company could result in serious hardship and bring further insolvencies into train.</P>
    <P>In this rehabilitation period I suggest that individual creditors be given preference where possible and that the State, if it is deemed necessary, take a secondary role in the collection of debts. This would also have the advantage of creating further confidence in the Government and in their structures.  This would be advantageous to a company in difficulty as they may be able to offset debts during the period of rehabilitation and so allow the company to restructure itself and become economically viable once again.</P>
    <P>Thus, there seems to be obvious merit in providing a system in this country whereby a company in temporary financial difficulties can be given a breathing space in which to reorganise and reconstruct and to face their difficulties at a much earlier stage and to take action to salvage the company instead of letting it slide into liquidation and, perhaps, leave a trail of unpaid creditors behind.  The Bill has made provision to provide for this but the suggestions I have made will help to create the balance which I have consistently stated from the outset of this statement.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the unscrupulous and reprehensible practice of insider dealing.  This is a malpractice which is contrary to the principle of maintaining an efficient fair shares market involving equal access to information and so on and also because it impedes the aim of promoting a wider share ownership among the general public.  Part V of the Bill proposes to make it a civil offence to deal in securities on the basis of insider information, to pass on information by <Col N="2079" /> way of a tip or to deal on the basis of a tip.  I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>In recent years as business transactions have become more complex, more computerised and more technical, it is very important that legislation be there to deal with this kind of fraudulence.  The consequences are twofold.  First, ordinary individuals and small investors may lose out as a result of this kind of activity.  Secondly, this kind of dealing leads to eventual monopolisation of markets and a predominance of multinational companies.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision of civil remedies for parties incurring losses as a result of insider dealing. Provision is made for exemption for directors' qualification shareholdings, for pension funds and other schemes solely or primarily for the benefit of employees, for obligations under an underwriting agreement and other limited circumstances.  However, the provisions of Part V of the Bill, particularly sections 91 and 92, will give rise to many practical difficulties.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the small size of the Irish investment community and the difficulty in determining the loss incurred and identifying each and every shareholder who may have been victims of insider trading, it is difficult to see how the Bill can protect against this problem. However, as in the case of the rehabilitation period and the examiner in the court, I think that the brief should be very clearly identified and that all ambiguities in relation to legal developments must be clearly identified and clarified. This may help to bring about more productive legislative action.  The Bill overall is geared to be more beneficial to creditors while, at the same time, tackling the problem of dishonesty and fraudulence within company activities.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of this Bill I foresee a greater climate of economic confidence for Irish business.  The Bill is aimed at prevention of insolvency, liquidation and fraudulence rather than curing the problem after it has begun.  This is a very valid Bill and is very good legislation. I hope my suggestions will be <Col N="2080" /> accepted in the spirit in which they are offered.  They are aimed at creating a greater balance within the structure of the legislation so as to make the Bill more positive and functional in practice.  For far too long it has been possible for people to trade without respect for liabilities due to others.  Furthermore, unscrupulous people have been able to re-establish businesses which have previously failed without having to meet liabilities previously incurred and flagrantly disregarded.  This has encouraged a situation where a man's word is no longer his bond as successive businesses are pulled down due to the knock-on effect of the failure of one business and has led to a general reduction of business confidence at a time when it is most needed.</P>
    <P>People who have confidence are needed to set up business.  That requires a stable and satisfactory business climate. I believe this Bill will assist in that objective. However, as I have stated it is vital that we avoid the pitfall of over-legislation within our business community.  If we look at the US we can see the huge array of legislation covering all areas of business life.  We are a far smaller economy and in our economy too much legislation can stifle enterprise and initiative. Therefore, while I welcome the Bill I believe the demands for further legislation should be accommodated only when it can be shown that further legislation would assist in generating economic benefit to the country.  In other words, keep it simple and do not fix it unless it is broken.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be open to suggestions and recommendations in relation to this Bill.  This openness must stretch into the future and we must monitor and analyse how this legislation affects the business community.  Then, and only then, can we see for sure if further legislation would be needed.  There is no need to produce too much legislation so as to suffocate any future developments. Legislation must open doors, not close them.</P>
    <P>This new legislation in the long term will create situations where information <Col N="2081" /> will be readily available.  Survival plans can be quickly designed.  Directors and creditors can make valid contributions in all areas of the development of the business and the legal structure will be there to provide and safeguard against dishonesty.  This Bill opens the way for this to take place and, therefore, it is a valid exercise.  I also believe this Bill could be accompanied by a greater drive to encourage investment and industrial development in this country.  The Bill allows for security.  It allows for openness and potential in the future. This must be counter-balanced by active initiation of industry and financial availability.  The IDA and various organisations within the State are geared for this.  We must give them more leeway.  We must encourage greater investment and we must encourage greater confidence.  This is the active side from a business point of view in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to ensure that directors who are dishonest or reckless are dealt with.  Accountability must permeate the company.  Can we be sure that the agents concerned in the company &mdash; perhaps under the section dealing with auditors and the people who advise those companies &mdash; have an obligation to make responsible information available to the company and will be held responsible in addition to the directors for the protection of the common good?  If these agents are knowingly involved and aware of the problems of the company and fail to act in the interests of the common good the auditors and accountants in question will have to be brought into the area of civil and legal liability.  It is not good enough just to touch the tip of the iceberg. This legislation must guarantee greater confidence throughout the structure of a company and that liability must go further than simply the boardroom.  In the area of liability it must be recognised that the penalties imposed upon directors or other members of a company involved in fraudulence must be in keeping and in line with the crime committed.  The Bill must pursue a just line of punishment at all times.  This is vital so as to encourage bona fide directors within companies to <Col N="2082" /> maintain their standards and to feel sure that justice will be seen to be done in relation to business activities.</P>
    <P>As I stated clearly at the beginning, the Bill must strike a balance between reducing malpractices in business and encouraging a healthy economic climate; between the penalties imposed and justice observed and between common sense and illegal practices.  As a piece of legislation it must not take on too much; otherwise it will become inefficient and create a general lack of confidence.  It must strive towards finding a fine line between dealing with dishonesty and not getting bogged down in bureaucracy.  I encourage the Minister to look at this carefully and to look at all the resources available within Government Departments to ensure that this Bill works and is as efficient as possible with the least amount of padding and excess.  In the words of Benjamin Franklin, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  We, as a political entity, have a responsibility to ensure that we maintain vigilance on the business community.  Ireland's vigilance must not be prohibitive but it must strongly, quietly and assuredly do its work in maintaining an honest, productive and legally acceptable business community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I am delighted to contribute to this debate on what is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the Dáil during this session.  This Companies Bill is the first major amendment of the Companies Act, 1963.  Like other speakers I should like to put on record the indebtedness of myself and other Members to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, and also to the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  Deputy Lowry asked that they be open to change but I think it is obvious from the Seanad debate on this Bill that they were willing to make changes and in many areas they completely changed various parts of the Bill. I should also like to put on record the indebtedness of this House to the Senators themselves who spent long <Col N="2083" /> hours on this Bill.  Numerous amendments were made as a result of suggestions made by the Senators which are of great assistance to this House.  Carrying out research on this Bill was made slightly easier as a result of two excellent source books by Patrick Usher and Judge Ronan Keane on company law in Ireland.  Obviously they will have to amend their books as a result of the passing of this Bill in the future and bring out new editions.</P>
      <P>This Bill reacts to a number of issues which are modern phenomena, for instance, the whole idea of reckless trading, insider dealing and in recent times the rescue of ailing companies because of our economic climate during the past 15 years.  As previous speakers have said there is definite need for this Bill to strike a balance.  The Bill addresses various problems which have arisen in company dealings but it should be pointed out &mdash; and indeed the Minister pointed this out in his submission &mdash; that the Bill deals only with a very small minority of companies who for one reason or another have seen fit to be dishonest, fraudulent or whatever.  It should go out from here that the vast majority of companies are working properly and will not be harmed by any of the circumstances taken care of in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry referred to State intervention. I entirely agree with him that there is a need to limit State intervention and that too much State intervention is an anathema to business.  I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, has forged the way in relation to this, in that he has cut red tape in many of the decisions he has taken since he came into this Ministry and he made no bones about it that he would do whatever he could in order to ensure that companies, businesses and firms would not have too much State intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area I should like to mention is codification of the law.  The legislation in this area was more or less contained in the 1963 Act but because of this amending legislation this area will be covered by two Acts and a small number of amendments to the Principal Act.  There <Col N="2084" /> may ultimately be a need to put all the legislation into one consolidating Act. The Companies Act was a model for consolidating the law but that has now been broken.  Perhaps this issue might be addressed in the future.</P>
    <P>A Second Stage debate on a Bill as comprehensive as this is difficult and it would probably be better to go through it section by section on Committee Stage. However, I want to make a number of observations in relation to the various parts of the Bill, the first of which relates to investigations.  Up to now an investigation would have largely been carried out by the Minister and his Department but the Bill is now changing this provision. I believe that this is for the better because it was obvious from research that I did that there was a lot of disquiet about the fact that the Minister and his Department were relatively slow in interfering in companies and that their powers under the Principal Act were rarely exercised. I think companies used the winding-up procedure in particular rather than go through the investigation procedure laid down in the Principal Act. Any loosening of that provision is to be welcomed.  I note that Judge Keane in his book said that the history of the procedure does not inspire confidence.  He was referring to the old procedure and in his book he cast doubts on the new proposals &mdash; not necessarily the new proposals in this Bill &mdash; being floated at the time he wrote his book.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that a number of investigations shall be made in relation to a company's affairs, for example, the ownership of a company.  This is very relevant particularly in this day and age when some disquiet has been expressed about who owns what company.  The Bill also gives power to the Minister to require information and to impose restrictions on shares or debentures if certain facts are not disclosed.  I should like to point out that a bona fide purchaser of shares may have difficulty between the direction made by the Minister and the actual publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the notice of the direction.  I just wonder if the Minister has addresed <Col N="2085" /> his mind to this because if a direction is made the sale of shares is void and between the direction and the publication a purchaser for value who buys in good faith would have this purchase declared void.  I also note that the Minister has power to require the production of documents and also the right of entry and search.  These extra powers are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>One other aspect that might cause some problem is that answers given by people may be used in evidence against them.  I noted that the Law Society in their submission felt that this was undesirable. We hear a lot of talk nowadays about the right to silence.  Perhaps there is a problem in relation to this section in that a person is not obliged to incriminate himself by various statements made.  That is an area that needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>There has been quite a lot of criticism of what appears to be duplication in relation to the investigation procedure whereby there is a preliminary investigation by the Minister and then a subsequent investigation by the inspectors.  I agree that this might lead to uncertainty and it may not allow an investigation by the inspectors to get off the ground quickly.  When a company needs to be investigated things need to be done quickly.</P>
    <P>I notice that the inspectors' report is admissible as evidence as to the opinion of the inspector. It is not evidence of the various matters referred to in the report. In England they allow the inspector's report to be published whereas our legislation does not require it to be published for the general public and it should be. Mr. Patrick Usher in his book suggested that perhaps there should be a permanent team of investigators in relation to these companies.  I would agree with that but perhaps our resources would not allow that to take place.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is vital to solicitors and bankers. It relates to the question of privilege.  Statements made by clients to the solicitors or to the banks are protected, and that is very welcome.</P>
    <P>An aspect which is not covered relates <Col N="2086" /> to the area of costs.  The fact that there is a more open procedure of investigation will lead to increased costs.  I wonder who will be required to pay those costs.  This section gives a better and bigger role to the High Court.  I wonder will that lead to increased legal costs in this area?</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill relates to transactions involving directors and to the duty to declare an interest.  In common law there has always been a duty to disclose an interest in relation to companies.  We are now putting it in statutory form.  One of the first documents a county councillor signs is a declaration as to interest.  It is only right that a company director should declare an interest in this fashion because the omission of a declared interest leads to things like insider dealing and the use of an advantaged position.  The common law duty to disclose an interest has been whittled away by various exceptions, most notably section 194 of the Principal Act.  Up until now it has not been obligatory to disclose, apart from the common law duty, and the proposal in this Bill makes it obligatory.  This is welcome because directors should not be allowed to use their company as a personal bank.</P>
    <P>A number of areas in relation to disclosure of particular interest relate to the long-term employment agreements. These will now have to be disclosed and the fact that they will now be disclosed and published could mean an end to this type of employment agreement which has hamstrung various companies in relation to take-overs.  Substantial property transactions must also be notified to the shareholders. This is vital if there is to be any confidence in the company.</P>
    <P>The other area relating to disclosure relates to loans and the fact that all loans under this Bill, subject to a number of exemptions are prohibited.  In my research I noted that the Cox Committee in 1958 advised against the general prohibition against loans.  Have things changed over the last number of years? That seemed to be the agreed attitude at that time and I wonder what has caused this change, while I fully agree that directors should not be allowed to use companies as personal banks. Various small <Col N="2087" /> loans up to £2,500 are exempt as are credit transactions up to £5,000.  This leaves some leeway for the smaller companies in particular.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with disclosure of interest in shares.  It ties up loose ends in relation to company law where directors have used their advantaged positions. Section 190 of the Principal Act had limited effect and in relation to public companies the Stock Exchange rules more or less ruled.  There has been great public concern in relation to undisclosed benefits and this will be taken care of by this Part of the Bill.  The Disclosure Court Order relates particularly to private limited companies and it is to be welcomed. People with an interest in a company can go to court and get this order.  It does not put a great onus on the people running the company because taking all the regulations in this Act there should be more open disclosure anyway.  This Part of the Bill also lists out the number of registers that company secretaries and registrars are obliged to have.  There are about five or six registers they are obliged to have and this could lead to a plethora of books.  It would be useful if the registers were in one book.</P>
    <P>Taking the very topical case of Irish Distillers Limited I wonder if the proposals in this Part of the Bill are strong enough to ensure that particular shareholdings are notified.  I know that there is a reporting threshold of 5 per cent but I wonder if this is low enough.  It may well have been in the Irish Distillers case but who knows what may turn up in the future.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with one of the biggest aspects dealt with in this Bill, that is insider dealing which is more or less related to public limited companies. County councillors are not allowed to use their privileged position and in just the same way insider dealing is highly undesirable.  This is a modern phenomenon. Directors have a fiduciary relationship with a company.  &ldquo;Let the buyer beware&rdquo; does not apply in this area. Directors could sell shares knowing that a company was in trouble.  This is dealt <Col N="2088" /> with fairly comprehensively in the Bill. The Stock Exchange have rules against insider trading but obviously it goes on and has gone on, particularly in the US and England.  An interesting debate took place in the Seanad relating to the original proposal to make insider trading a civil rather than a criminal offence.  The Minister and Department were quite willing to change this and I compliment them on their decision to make insider dealing a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The issue of how this is to be policed then arises and this may have to be dealt with more comprehensively in the future. Even the manager of the Stock Exchange felt at the time that insider dealing should be a criminal rather than a civil offence. In America they have the Security and Exchange Commission who were successful in the Boesky case and a number of other cases.  We probably do not have the resources ever to have that kind of commission.  The proposal in this Bill is to allow the Stock Exchange to be selfregulatory. Would we be able to find Irish counterparts of Boesky and other similar cases?  I am not sure.  The whole question of self-regulation is an issue.  The Law Society are often criticised for being selfregulatory and a number of people are not satisfied.  I wonder if that would apply in relation to the Stock Exchange and their regulation of the market.</P>
    <P>Computerised dealing, an important area, is not dealt with comprehensively enough in the Bill.  I am not an expert in this area but I wonder if the Department have addressed their minds to it.  There was a suspicion that we could go too far in relation to insider dealing because the whole Irish scene is very small.  Making insider dealing a criminal offence is probably one of the best achievements of the Minister and the people who promoted that change in the Seanad and publicly. I note that there is a proposed EC directive on insider dealing.  Perhaps the Minister when replying will say whether the proposal in the Bill takes account of the proposed directive on insider trading.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the registration of charges under section 102.  Until now a company could, in order to avoid registration <Col N="2089" /> of a charge, transfer its shares to a subsidiary and then charge its shareholding in that subsidiary.  These new proposals attempt to change this.  I have a couple of problems about this area because it is something I have dealt with in the course of my practice.  The legislation proposes a stated maximum amount in relation to the charge.  This would have fairly radical implications for banks and in the whole area of financing for business.  Banks may now be reluctant to give extra loans. People may be reluctant to take them on because of the cost involved.  There is no reference in the Bill as to whether this applies to principal or interest.  It has been possible until now to stamp up a deed in order to get an additional loan. From now on it probably will be necessary to go through all the costs of doing a new charge and re-registering it in the register of deeds in the Land Registry and also in the Companies Office.  This can only lead to extra costs for the companies.</P>
    <P>One other aspect is the 21-day time limit for registration of form 47.  This has caused quite a lot of difficulty from time to time but it is not addressed in the Bill. It is necessary to obtain a court order in order to dispense with that time limit.  If for some reason a person has slipped up and not registered within the 21 days, he is obliged to get a High Court order. Perhaps the Bill could be amended to allow the time limit to be dispensed with in certain circumstances by, say, the secretary of the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with the winding up of companies.  The liquidator or creditor may apply to the court to make related companies responsible for the debts of a liquidated company.  What would happen if the liquidation was due to bad judgment rather than fraud or dishonesty? Why should a related company be penalised for the debts of the other company if the failure was due to bad judgement?  I do not agree with the suggestion that reckless trading should be referred to as wrongful trading.  The latter phrase could include mistaken trading and trading by bad judgment.  That would not amount to reckless trading. <Col N="2090" /> I wonder if it should be referred to as negligent trading.  This area is a minefield. In recent times there have been fairly celebrated or infamous cases of reckless trading.  Perhaps this whole area will be addressed in this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions relate to people who knowingly practice reckless trading. The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is much bandied about in legal circles.  We had a great discussion as to whether to take it out of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill in relation to juveniles in bars.  It is very difficult to prove.  It is rightly included in this legislation because if anyone is to be found guilty of reckless trading there should be a definite onus on whoever is pointing the finger to prove the case beyond all doubt.</P>
    <P>High costs are involved in the whole area of liquidation and winding up.  The increased costs will ultimately be paid from the assets of the company.  Several speakers have mentioned preferential creditors.  The liquidator's fees have first preference, then the secured creditors and the Revenue Commissioners.  Most Deputies feel that the Revenue Commissioners should not have an advantaged status over unsecured creditors. Most people who are involved in business or who deal with people in business know that they are at the bottom of the queue for the repayment of their debt and may never receive payment.  They ask quite justifiably why the Revenue Commissioners should have a preferential status over them.  This is particularly topical in view of the increased powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to sheriffs and the power of attachment. I doubt if this is an area with which the Minister for Finance and his Department would agree.  They hardly ever do, anyway.</P>
    <P>Part VII refers to the disqualification of directors.  We have heard mention of fly-by-night directors and there is no doubt, particularly in the Dublin area, that there have been classic cases of such directors setting up new companies the next day.  This has got quite some publicity but perhaps the occurrence is not as rife as people would believe.  In country areas it is not so easy for people to act in <Col N="2091" /> this fashion because they must face the people in their area; but in Dublin it may be different.  I welcome the restriction in this Bill of directors of old companies being able to become directors of other companies provided that certain conditions are complied with.  In the case of a public company there must be £50,000 fully paid up share capital and for a private company £10,000 fully paid up share capital.</P>
    <P>According to Part VII a receiver or liquidator must notify any person to whom he thinks the section applies.  This puts quite an onus on the receiver or liquidator.  What happens if he omits to notify somebody?  I think that would amount to negligence.  This may very well restrict a liquidator or receiver in his duties and may lead to extra costs.  The liquidator or receiver may feel that there is a greater onus on him under this legislation. Some have said that it may discourage enterprise but I am not sure that it will.  If people do not have anything to hide, they do not have anything to worry about.  Some people may be reluctant to become directors of companies.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad, Senator Hillery mentioned the question of part-time directors, well known people in the community who are asked to go on boards of directors part-time.  Their reputation could be harmed if something happened in which they were not particularly involved in relation to the company.  The Bill does allow for some relief, but such people would have to go to court to get a remedy.  There is a feeling, with which I would agree to a certain extent, that going to court is not the appropriate remedy.  Perhaps something could be done prior to people being disqualified, whereby they could justify their case, or at least have a right of reply with regard to any allegation made.  The publicity could be very harmful to those people.</P>
    <P>According to Part VIII, at the moment only companies and undischarged bankrupts are excluded from being receivers. This Bill proposes that the servant and also related companies of the servant are disqualified from being receivers.  There <Col N="2092" /> was the suggestion, with which I would agree to a certain extent, that perhaps shareholders and creditors ought also to be disqualified.  This matter has not been addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 146 refers to the fact that some specified persons may apply for a direction under this part to the courts.  An attempt was made in the Seanad to include employees or trade unions in this facility.  The Minister has struck a proper balance here.  There is no doubt that really only the receiver should be entitled to apply for a direction because he is the person who is managing the company.  If there were any interference from others involved in the company it might cause problems within that company.</P>
    <P>The Bill also puts a statutory duty on a receiver to get the best price.  It is well that this should be in the Bill.  Up to now, there has been a common law duty to get the best price but now it has been put on a statutory basis, which should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Part IX, one of the final Parts of the Bill, refers to court protection, the rescue of companies and the appointment of an examiner.  Early on, when a company begin to have problems, it is possible that there could be a dissipation of assets by employees, or employers, or directors of the company.  It is important to act quickly in order to protect all interests in the company.  This section is good.  There has been some criticism that it does not go far enough, which may very well be true.  Creditors, employees and members are entitled to go to court and apply for such court protection.  This puts a stay on any creditors' rights.  The debts are frozen for three months.  That gives an opportunity for the whole area to be looked into.  Creditors may feel aggrieved with this, but they are given an opportunity of knowing that an independent eye is being kept on the company which owes them money.</P>
    <P>One aspect of criticism here is that the examiner may spend more time reporting to the court than actually working on the rescue of the company.  I note that under the legislation he is obliged to report within 21 days and if he, or the court, <Col N="2093" /> feels at that stage that the company is viable, there is another 21 days limit in which an effort is made to get all the parties to agree.  At that stage they come back to the court for approval.  As I said earlier, it may be that too much time is taken up with reporting.  Also, there is a suggestion, which is quite justified, that the costs will be a major element of having to go to court and return to court, because of all the various representations. Perhaps we could look into that question overall in the Bill.  There may be too much necessity for going to court, which will lead to massive costs. Ultimately, somebody will have to pay, whether the Minister or the company.  I suppose it will be the company.  Under US legislation the court appointee becomes owner of the company for the duration, whereas here he has only the power of veto.</P>
    <P>That is a broad outline of a number of points in the Bill with which I take issue. I welcome the Bill and hope to have an opportunity on Committee Stage to elaborate on a number of points that I have raised and presumably Committee Stage will take some considerable time. The Bill is a great step forward in the area of company law.  It will give the general public a certainty that people who act fraudulently or dishonestly in relation to companies will be dealt with by the full rigours of the law.  Most parties in this Chamber are in agreement with the broad outline of the Bill, although some may have different ideas on how things should be done.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the excellent attitude he has adopted in relation to amendments and suggestions, not only from within the Seanad but from without.  I note that quite a number of detailed submissions have been made and I have had an opportunity to see some of these.  There was a feeling earlier that various interest groups were a little lethargic in putting in their submissions but ultimately, because of the way in which the matter was handled by the Government in putting the Bill before the Seanad and leaving quite a long time for it to be <Col N="2094" /> debated, people were given the opportunity to thrash out the various points raised.</P>
    <P>One final criticism is that the Bill contains an absolute minefield of legal jargon and this could result in a lot of time being spent in court in deciphering what we as legislators meant when we inserted certain sections.  Perhaps, more simple language could have been used but I hope I am wrong.  Finally, I would like once again to compliment the Minister, the Minister of State and, indeed, the previous Government, for bringing forward this Bill which is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that at long last this Bill has been brought before the House.  It is a Bill which has been talked about for at least a decade.  I think it is five years since Deputy Cluskey said that the heads of a Bill were ready. Now five years later the Bill is before the House.  This Bill is of major importance and, as Deputies are aware, it is a very substantial Bill.  Initially it contained 187 sections but following its passage through the Seanad it has increased to 207 sections, over 154 pages.  It is a difficult Bill for Deputies to understand and, as the last speaker said, it is couched in legal jargon.  It is a very technical and quite complex Bill, which will be difficult for lay people to understand.  It will be difficult for them to know what it is meant to tackle.  They will have to go through the explanatory memorandum to find out what it is meant to tackle and when they think they know what it is meant to tackle they will suddenly discover that there are exceptions which will make it very difficult to achieve its objectives.  Therefore I would imagine the Committee Stage of this Bill will be very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum sets out the objectives of the Bill.  It seeks to stamp out illegalities and fraud and to help those who want to stay in business. One issue which is not referred to in the explanatory memorandum and which the Bill does not seem to address is the question of the employees' interests, some of whom may spend all of their working lives with a company.  Our existing body <Col N="2095" /> of law is unsatisfactory, and unscrupulous and crooked business people have been allowed to get away with all sorts of nefarious practices which it is hoped this Bill will help to stamp out.  The ones who have suffered most are the employees. Because of these abuses, increasingly in recent years workers have been pressing for the reform of company law, and the trade unions have become very active on this issue.</P>
    <P>Governments have shown little enthusiasm for pressing forward with the Companies Bill and I suppose there are reasons for this &mdash; different people may not want to tread on different people's toes.  Instrumental in bringing forward this Bill is the pressure from workers and trade unions and now the legal obligations on the Government to meet the requirements of EC directives on company law reform.  The last such EC Directive to be issued was in 1986.  In other words, Governments are being forced to address the question of rogue companies. Everybody knows about these companies as this issue has been highlighted and written about in our newspapers, but nothing has been done about it.  As I said, pressure has come from the trade unions and the EC but for whatever reason the Bill is now before us and it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is widely known that there has been wholesale abuse of company law.  Companies have been allowed to evade or avoid taxation by, for example, registering companies in such tax havens as the Cayman Islands or the Isle of Man, the establishment of offshore companies and using nominee shareholders to hide the names of the real owners.  Another abuse is in the area of limited liability.  It is well know that companies have closed down leaving wages and holiday pay unpaid and debts owing to the Revenue Commissioners and other creditors.  In many cases these same people have been able to establish new companies in the same area of business under a different name often within a matter of days. Every Deputy in this House could give examples of this in their own areas.  It is <Col N="2096" /> now so widespread in the Dublin area that practically everyone living in the city knows some relation or friend who has been involved with one of these rogue companies and knows precisely what happened.</P>
    <P>I would like to give one example which was highlighted in the newspapers last March.  <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the headline &ldquo;Carpet firm leaves debts of £650,000&rdquo;.  The article pointed out that T &amp; C Carpets had debts of over £650,000.  Creditors at a meeting called to wind up the company, based in Walkinstown, were told quite openly and blatantly that this amount of money was owed and that up to £15,000 in deposits had been accepted from customers.  This was publicly admitted by the company and according to the directors of the company the assets of the company were worth only £8,480.  According to that article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 March 1988 Mr. Graham Campbell, joint managing director, told the meeting that the company management hoped to start again in business under a different name.  He said that the demands from the Revenue Commissioners for unpaid taxes totalled over £38,000, that the company had no choice but to go into liquidation and that he was hoping to start up again in business under a different name.  The fact that a man was able to announce publicly that the company were being wound up and that their creditors would not receive any money because the company had no assets indicates the total inability of our existing company law to deal with that type of situation.  Despite people's anger there was no redress for them from that company.  To the best of my knowledge little if anything, has been paid since.  The company are carrying on business under a new name.  Of course the new company do not inherit or carry the debts of the old company.  Indeed the employees of the old company were owed £18,000 in wages and over £5,000 in redundancy moneys that would have been due to them but in respect of which they had no redress either.  That is a frequent occurence. Probably many other Members <Col N="2097" /> would have similar examples they could quote.</P>
    <P>I recall a case of a company in Dorset Street in Dublin a couple of years ago, a number of whose employees came to me explaining that the crystal glass company concerned was gradually closing down. It had hived off all its assets to a new company.  For example, all its transport activities had been hived off to the new company.  This meant that, while the old company continued in business, it hired trucks from the new.  Gradually all its assets were hived off to the new company and a number of the employees transferred to the new, the remainder being dismissed and the old company closed down.  The new company were already in business, all the assets having been transferred to them and set up business under a different name &mdash; Dublin Glass or some such title, continuing as before. That company, in addition to dismissing a number of their employees, owed the Revenue Commissioners the moneys deducted from their former employees by way of PAYE and PRSI contributions. Yet the Revenue Commissioners could not hit the new company.</P>
    <P>Apart from that type of fraudulent practice there is another example where companies are not doing anything illegal. The whole business of establishing a company is so easy it means that one could establish 500 in a week if one wanted. This practice is most widely resorted to in the construction industry.  Take the example of a building company, such as Brennan and McGowan, who engage in that practice regularly.  Let us suppose they have 100 acres of land on which they decide to build houses.  They will establish a separate company to build those houses.  That company may have another site elsewhere on which they build houses and they establish another separate company to build those houses. I am not saying that such companies are engaging in fraudulent practice; they pay all their taxes and so on.  Nevertheless, when those 200 or 1,000 houses are built the company that built them can go out of business, leaving the people living in such estates with no redress <i>vis-á-vis</i> any <Col N="2098" /> problems arising.  Such purchasers can only go after the separate company established for that purpose which will have gone out of business by then.  Such companies tend to move to another site, build more houses, wind up the company established for that purpose and move on yet again.  This is a widespread practice. It means that such construction companies are leaving residents in estates all over the country encountering problems for ten years afterwards, having to go to the courts and being unable to gain any constructive redress.  It is essential that that practice be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill deal with the question of fraudulent or rogue companies but do not address the ease with which new companies can be established and wound up.  This Bill should render it much more difficult to establish and wind up such companies.  Such areas of abuse cry out for some type of legislative action. Indeed the interests of the workers of such companies &mdash; some of whom might have given a lifetime of service &mdash; have not been and will not be well protected under the provisions of this Bill.  Their interests should be as well protected as those of shareholders.  After all their livelihoods are at stake.</P>
    <P>There has been progress made in this area elsewhere in Europe.  It is significant that, while our company law has required directors to act in the interests of shareholders, there is no obligation on them to act in the interests of employees.  Many men and women are forced to join the dole queues at present simply because their interests were given such low priority by the directors of the various companies in which they worked.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to the other widely publicised example, that of the H. Williams Group.  That whole affair appeared to me to be fraudulent and constituted unscrupulous practice.  Of the 1,500 people who worked in that group 700 lost their jobs.  The remainder did not retain their existing jobs but had to accept inferior working conditions and lower wages than they had had formerly.  Yet that issue has not been addressed at all by the provisions of this Bill.  The <Col N="2099" /> H. Williams Group case demonstrated that individuals such as Mr. Finbar Holland can dump people out of work, lower other employees' standards of living while they carry on, as if nothing had happened, in their residences in paradise island, in the Bahamas or wherever, where they live in luxury on the moneys they gain from the misery of others.</P>
    <P>There are a number of gaps in this Bill. I might refer to a number of issues.  For example, there is need for full disclosure of all directors' fees.  There should also be a requirement for full disclosure of all donations made by companies to political parties.  There should be explicit recognition of the duty of company directors to take account of and act in the interests of their employees at all times.  Bearing in mind the scale of the damage that can be perpetrated under existing company law many penalties are totally inadequate and should be increased considerably.</P>
    <P>I note that the provisions of section 7 give the courts power to investigate the affairs of a company.  This was formerly the remit of the Minister.  It is all right so far as it goes, but section 7 (3) renders that provision totally inoperable because it provides that a court may look for a bond of up to £200,000 to cover the cost of any such investigation.  This sum is excessively high and it means that practically nobody &mdash; with the possible exception of another company or the Minister &mdash; will be able to put up such a bond to enable an investigation to be made by the court.  I do not know how the figure of £200,000 was arrived at but it will act as a major deterrent to people seeking an investigation and it should be reduced.</P>
    <P>Section 11 outlines the persons and bodies to whom a report by an inspector can be given but, in this list, there is no mention of the employees or the union representative.  They should be listed as persons and bodies to whom a report should be given as they are more interested than many other people in their companies.  Section 31 places restrictions on medium sized companies in making loans or quasi-loans to directors and engaging in credit transactions <Col N="2100" /> on their behalf.  However, small private companies are exempt.  A small private company is one which does not fulfil two conditions, its turnover is not in excess of £2.5 million and it does not have more than 50 employees.  That exemption means that the vast majority of private companies will not be subject to any restrictions in these because approximately 80 per cent of all manufacturing companies employ fewer than 50 people. There are over 2,000 small IDA grantaided companies with fixed assets of less than £500,000.  In the context of the 75,000 plus, the number of private companies coming within the scope of this section will be very tiny indeed.  I recommend that this exemption of small private companies, as described in the Bill, should be deleted and that all private companies, regardless of size, should be subject to the restrictions in section 31.</P>
    <P>Further exemptions set out in section 32 include banks and there is no limit on the amount of money which they may advance.  Another section sets down disclosure procedures for banks but we are opposed, in principle, to exempting banks from these requirements.  They should be brought within the scope of section 31 and subject to the same restrictions applying to other companies.</P>
    <P>Section 47 requires every company to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and secretaries in the previous five years.  We think that it should apply to the previous ten years.  In regard to the interest required to be disclosed under Part IV of the Bill, which requires directors and secretaries to disclose interest in company shares, the disclosure requirements do not apply to private companies but provision is made for similar disclosures by private companies on application to the court for a disclosure order.  The interest required to be disclosed should be clarified, particularly in relation to share options and property interest.  The exclusion of private companies from these disclosure requirements cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of alterations in the Seanad in relation to the Bill <Col N="2101" /> dealing with insider trading and fraudulent or reckless trading of a company.  It is difficult to relate the amendments, as they stand, to the Bill but it seems that fraudulent or reckless trading of a company is provided for under civil &mdash; not criminal &mdash; liability.  I am a bit confused on this issue because section 115 provides for criminal liability for fraudulent trading but the following sections provide for civil liability for fraudulent or reckless trading of a company.  In any case, these should be covered under the criminal liability provision.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill places restrictions on directors of insolvent companies and prohibits them from acting as directors or being involved in the promotion or formation of a company unless the company has a fully paid up share capital of £5,000 for a public company or £10,000 if it is a private company.  It also provides for automatic disqualification of directors for a period of five years where they have been found guilty of an indictable offence involving fraud or dishonesty in relation to a company.  The court may also disqualify directors where it is satisfied that a person has breached or defaulted on company duties, etc.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on access to the privilege of limited liability should not be confined to directors of insolvent companies. Directors could evade these restrictions by not formally winding up the company or where the insolvency of the company has not been clearly established.  It is generally accepted that the current situation, putting little or no restriction on the setting up of limited companies, has led to the abuse of these privileges.  All limited companies, not just those who are directors of insolvent companies, should be required to have a maximum paid up share capital of at least £5,000 for public companies and £1,000 for private companies.  This would assist in the point I was making about the ability of certain companies to set up a whole series of separate companies in different sites.  If there was a requirement that the minimum paid up share capital was at least £5,000 for a public company and £1,000 for a private company it would be much <Col N="2102" /> more difficult to set up a series of companies every few months.  The minimum paid up share capital in relation to directors of insolvent companies is too low in any case and should be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>There is a provision for automatic disqualification of directors for five years if they have been involved in fraud or dishonesty.  This should provide, in addition, that such directors would only be permitted to act again as directors of a company on the clear understanding that all debts from the original insolvency or fraud would be carried forward into their new business.  When a company set up a new business, having been insolvent or involved in fraud or dishonesty, they should carry forward all their debts and should be liable to repay all those debts. One of the most important issues is the huge amount of debts left lying after other companies have been established. After five years the company can set up in business and leave those debts and that misery behind them.  They will have no responsibility whatsoever for those debts and liabilities, whether to the Revenue Commissioners or to employees who have been left without their wages.  That is wrong.  They should never be permitted to set up in business again except on the basis that they bring forward all their debts to the new company.</P>
    <P>Under section 143 there is provision for information to be supplied by the court to the Registrar of Companies.  This section should include a provision whereby the companies office would keep a register of all directors who have been subject to disqualification under the previous section to which I referred.  There should be available in the companies office, open to public inspection, and a register of such directors, directors who have been involved in fraud or dishonesty or for whatever reason have left companies and are subject to disqualification under section 125.  That information should be kept in the companies office in a separate register.  The section dealing with defaulting directors should provide <Col N="2103" /> that a disqualification order would automatically apply under paragraphs (a) to (f).  The onus should be on such a person to apply to the court for a relief from such disqualification order.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for proper book-keeping and accounting, that books give a true and fair view of the financial state of a company.  The company must explain their transactions and the books must be maintained consistently and continuously throughout the year.  The Bill also puts personal liability on the officers of a company where it can be shown that failure to maintain proper books was a contributory factor in the case of insolvency. The liability would be on the person responsible for the books.  This is a very good provision and is very much to be welcomed.  The requirement is particularly important and absolutely essential in the case of small companies because in these cases the procedures in regard to bookkeeping are slipshod and nobody in particular is responsible for them.  As I have said, there are 75,000 companies and 80 per cent of them have fewer than 50 employees.  It is in these companies that the problems arise so it is essential that these companies in particular are required to maintain proper books of account.  I would be totally opposed to any exemptions for small companies in regard to the proper keeping of books of accounts and so on.</P>
    <P>Under section 137 a company are required to notify the Registrar of Companies in the case of the removal of an auditor and this is certainly to be welcomed. In addition, the registrar should be required to maintain a register of auditors who have been removed and this register should be open to inspection. Existing company law requires directors to act in the interests of company members only.  I have said this already and I must repeat it.  Under the Bill there is no specific obligation on companies to take into account or to act in the interests of employees.  The Bill should be amended to include a section which states clearly that company directors have a duty to take account of the employees' <Col N="2104" /> interests and to act in their interests.  This should be a general legal obligation.  It should be acknowledge that employees have an interests in companies, at least equal to that of the shareholders, and in the proper conduct of the affairs of the company because they are the sufferers in the long run if the company go to the wall and they are put out of business.</P>
    <P>The increasing complexity of company law has greatly increased the workload of the companies office.  This Bill will add further to that workload.  At present the data available in the companies office is very limited and the procedures for getting it very cumbersome.  It can take up to an hour to get out a company file. The charges for looking for a file have increased rapidly in the past few years from 50p to £1.50 and then £2.  This increase in charges together with the delays act as a deterrent to people going to the companies office to get information, which they are entitled to do, about as many companies as they wish. The £2 fee and the various problems and restrictions prevent them from getting that information.  This might be information to which they are legally entitled in order to fight some injustice that has been done to them.  They must pay for the information and spend time looking for it.  When they get the information they may find that the files in the companies office are totally out of date and probably have not been brought up to date since the company were set up.  The available information is totally inadequate and probably false and people find this out only at a later stage.  Some years ago it was stated that up to two-thirds of company files were not up to date in the companies office.</P>
    <P>There is no point in providing in the Bill for an increase in the amount of information available to the public if the facilities for getting that information and access to it are not provided.  If the information is not available or if wrong information is available all the Bills in the world are totally useless.  I do not blame the staff in the companies office.  They do their best in very difficult circumstances. <Col N="2105" /> The responsibility rests with the Government of the day and they must ensure that the companies' office are provided with the facilities and the finance to permit them to have up to date information readily available for the public. The public are entitled to that service. We are now paying the price for years and years of neglect because previous Governments did not pay the slightest attention to that office.  The set-up in the Companies' Office is totally inadequate, particularly when compared to the service that exists in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the penalties set down in the Bill are adequate, are reviewed and updated regularly.  Some of the penalties are too low and I intend to refer to them on Committee Stage.  The effectiveness of the Bill in curbing abuse and malpractice, which are widespread, will depend on the allocation of resources.  Therefore, it is essential that adequate resources are allocated to the Companies' Office so that the legislation can be properly enforced.  Enforcement of existing obligations under company law is inadequate.  Companies that fail to make annual returns as required by statute are not penalised.  The Bill will be rendered totally ineffective if adequate resources are not provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members I welcome this complicated Bill which represents another important step in regularising affairs in the area of company law.  It is one of a series of measures passed since the enactment of the original Bill in 1963.  The Bill is important from the point of view of business and traders who have been or are likely to be victims of unscrupulous fly-by-night operators. Such operators have folded up leaving massive debts, people unemployed, tax and PRSI due.  Their actions have led in many cases to other smaller companies being forced out of business; they have had a domino effect.  The legitimate businessmen who suffer at the hands of the fly-by-night operators go out of business and suffer great hardships while the unscrupulous people manage to be able to trade again with apparent <Col N="2106" /> impunity.  That should not be acceptable in any society.  It is an indictment of us all that this has gone on for so long and for that reason I welcome the Bill.  I accept that the Minister's predecessors were involved in the preparation of the legislation and they deserve credit for that.  All Members welcome the arrival of the Bill in the House, having been passed by Seanad Eireann.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that the part of the Bill that deals with what has been called the phoenix syndrome or the Lazarus league will get most attention because most Members have had some experience of that directly or indirectly.  There has been a sneaking regard in the last four or five years by society for the cuteness of the fly-by-night merchants but very little thought was given to their victims.  I am glad the Bill will rectify that.  It is time we tackled that scandal effectively.  The Minister, and Members who have contributed to the debate, endeavoured to be constructive. I have no doubt that the Minister, and the Minister of State, will consider all suggestions put forward in the course of the debate and if they consider them suitable I have no doubt that they will be included in the Bill, as occurred in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is complicated and technical, as has been pointed out by commentators. The Minister has not denied that it is complicated and that is an indication of the need that has existed for an updating of company law.  It underlines the gap that has existed up to now.  Many problems have arisen because of the inadequacy of company law.  A great change has taken place in the attitude of business people in the last 20 years.  It is true to say that some time ago a handshake or the word of a person was sufficient to seal a deal or settle a contract, but now, because of the times we are living in, a team of legal experts, accountants, witnesses and so on are required before a deal is sealed.  Not too long ago either if a person hired somebody to work he got an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, but today there has been a change in many people's attitude to work.  The attitude appears to be to do as little as <Col N="2107" /> possible and hope to get away with it. That is a reflection of the fall in standards in society.  It is a pity that we have to pass legislation to try to combat problems which arise from the dishonesty of people.  Some people may say that I am wrong about the standards of honesty but it cannot be denied that in the last 20 years there has been a fall in standards.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for any Member to make a Second Stage speech on a Bill that deals with so many aspects of the activities of companies.  I do not think it is possible for any one speaker to cover all aspects of the Bill and most of the points that concern Members are more appropriate for Committee Stage.  Indeed, the debate on the Bill is likely to take up so much time that it might be worthwhile considering establishing a special committee to deal with it.  The Minister did not set out to make this a technical or complicated Bill because the thrust of his approach to business, and legislation, is to simplify it.  In the Bill the Minister has endeavoured to keep a balance between the need to protect the interests of trade suppliers, employers and other unsecured creditors, and the interests of companies and the general public.</P>
    <P>There are many important features in the Bill, but the principal ones deal with the problems caused by company directors who fail in their duties and responsibilities, or indeed who deliberately set out to defraud the company.  It is inevitable when we are discussing this Bill that the various cases, as I mentioned earlier, of the fly-by-night merchants will be highlighted. This aspect of the discussion will get most media attention.  However, it has to be emphasised again and again that although those cases receive huge media attention and are to the forefront the dishonest individuals are in the minority. Although they are in a minority of companies, this minority can do such serious damage, not just to their own business but also to their employees, the State and indeed to other businesses.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill points out and stresses that the underlying aim of the Bill is to create a climate <Col N="2108" /> of confidence for business activity in which commercial endeavour will prosper and the prospects for economic development in general will be enhanced. I believe the Bill will create that confidence among the business and commercial sector and indeed among the general public as well.  Because of what has happened in the past, it is essential if our economy is to recover that such confidence should be restored.</P>
    <P>A major aim of the Bill is to stamp out abuses that have crept in and which have been referred to previously.  I am satisfied that the Bill will contribute to stamping out abuse.  The major features of the Bill are the restrictions on and the provisions for disqualifications of company directors; the introduction of the concept of reckless trading; the issue of liability of related companies in the event of a liquidation; the prohibition of insider dealing; the new legal mechanism for the reconstruction of an ailing but potentially viable company; and the appointment of inspectors by the High Court with wider powers than heretofore.  The provisions of Part III relating to company directors are particularly important and will undoubtedly receive most attention for the various reasons I have already stated. Everyone in the House will support the moves being made to try to stamp out what has been termed the Phoenix syndrome. The Bill proposes penalties which will appropriately penalise those who trade in a fraudulent manner.  This will help to protect all those involved in legitimate business, their employees, creditors, customers and suppliers.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill must keep a balance between this very important and fundamental aim and the necessity to uphold the principle of limited liability which is the cornerstone of commercial enterprise, particularly in an economy such as ours.  It is important that the principle of limited liability should be protected at a time when the whole emphasis of industrial policy in this country is shifting to small industry.  We have to be careful that we are not on the one hand asking and encouraging people to take risks and to invest their money in enterprises, to set <Col N="2109" /> about creating jobs and setting up industries which will help our import substitution while, on the other hand, not allowing them some protection through the limited liability provisions that we have.  We have to be careful not to discourage the entrepreneurial skills of our people.  We must be willing to support initiative as well as protecting the public. That is a very difficult and delicate balance we have to try to strike in this and other legislation but it is important and very necessary to make it clear to anybody starting off in business that they cannot go into business recklessly and without taking adequate steps to protect themselves, and at a later stage expect the protection of limited liability when their enterprise collapses.</P>
    <P>The extension of the inspectors' powers in Part II of the Bill is very welcome, particularly the power to compel witnesses to attend and also the fact that outsiders can be called to give evidence. The provision that bank accounts can be examined is also welcomed.  I feel this is long overdue and should go some way towards preventing company directors from hiving off substantial sums of money from their business to their private accounts prior to the collapse of their company.  We have had numerous examples of that in the past.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the sections in Part III of the Bill are basically to ensure that company directors do not divert other people's money for their personal use. Few would disagree with the general thrust of this part of the Bill.  However there is a danger in trying to curb and control the abuses which are undoubtedly there, that we could end up by imposing a huge amount of paperwork and extra bureaucracy on smaller companies.  The implications of this part are that a number of registers will have to be maintained and open for inspection.  Because of the proposed financial limits involved in a number of these sections in the Bill, it will mean a huge increase in paperwork for companies, which is something we are all trying to avoid.  Deputy Ahern mentioned earlier that he had counted them and that five or six registers will <Col N="2110" /> have to be kept.  I am sure the Confederation of Irish Industry and other bodies will probably suggest that many of the provisions of this part should be deleted or removed but a reasonable compromise would be to increase the financial limit mentioned in the sections, particularly in the sections dealing with loans, quasi-loans and credit transactions. If those limits were increased there would be a reduced amount of paperwork, without actually reducing the effectiveness of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with what is currently termed insider dealing, a person with knowledge or access to information using that information for personal gain.  Of course, this is contrary to the principle of efficient or fair markets where everybody has equal access to information.  If this were to become too widespread it would hinder development of the wider ownership of shares by the public.  The provisions in the Bill should help in some way to curtail insider dealing, but it would be naive to think that it will stamp it out entirely.  The Bill makes insider dealing unlawful and will leave the person involved in insider dealing open to civil liability; in other words, the third party will be legally entitled to sue for compensation for losses suffered.</P>
    <P>Another provision makes unlawful tips on the basis of inside information.  The principles involved here are praiseworthy but the question remains as to how effective they will be in combating this practice. The basic question is the effective policing of this problem.  The investment community in Ireland is rather small and is very closely knit.  Breaches of the provisions contained in the Bill could be very difficult to detect and, I imagine, more difficult to prove particularly in an age when there is so much computer dealing taking place.  Nevertheless, the problem is there and it should be catered for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty in this area concerns the implementation of section 192 (1).  I wonder if it will be possible to determine the loss incurred as a result of insider dealing and whether it will be possible to identify each and every shareholder <Col N="2111" /> who suffers such a loss to follow up on that particular breach of the law?  I think it will be very difficult.  I am posing the questions but, unfortunately, I do not have the answers.</P>
    <P>Part VI is arguably the most important part of the Bill because it is in the winding of a company that most of the abuses come to light.  It is at this time that there is most public demand for dishonest directors to be made more accountable for their actions.  Part VI attemps to deal with the problems associated with the winding up of a company through a whole series of provisions which deal with abuses likely to come to light.  There is a whole series of different provisions which are probably based on past experiences. The Minister has tried to cover most of them.  This should help to tighten the law in this area.  The proposals in Part VI will give rise also to a careful review of parent-subsidiary relationships particularly where subsidiary companies are experiencing various trading difficulties. The Minister should use this part of the Bill to ensure that all creditors are more diligent in collecting their debts.  There has been some reference to this by previous speakers &mdash; the preferential treatment that goes to the Revenue Commissioners and to local authorities and so on.  The argument used often up to now in relation to the Revenue Commissioners calling in their debt is that they should ease up on a company where the collection of taxes due could lead to the closure of a company.  Many well meaning people would say the Revenue Commissioners should back off, that there are 50 or 70 people employed by the company and that the cost to the State would be so much if they were made redundant.  However, I do not think such argument is sound because anybody who does not pay his debt to the Revenue Commissioners, to the local authorities or to other traders or members of the public immediately has an unfair advantage over his rivals.  Failure to collect and pursue such debts may mean the collapse of a good company who are paying their <Col N="2112" /> debts, meeting their tax and PRSI obligations and so on.  Essentially, the defaulting company are using money that does not belong to them to compete with companies who are meeting all their obligations.</P>
    <P>At this stage when the Revenue Commissioners have, we hope, brought the affairs of most taxpayers up to date, through the amnesty, they should now collect moneys as they become due.  They should not, in the event of the winding up of a company, give preferential treatment and neither should local authorities.  Both of these bodies should be facilitated in law to make it easy for them to collect debts.  That has happened with the Revenue Commissioners through the sheriffs, by way of attachment and so on.  It still needs to be done in the case of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Revenue Commissioners get preferential treatment from the collapse of a company often means that small operations may have to go out of business with the consequent loss of employment and all the hardship that that entails.  The loss of the amount of money owing to them, while it could be considerably less than that owed to the Revenue Commissioners, would have a more serious effect.  For that reason I would urge the Minister, as other Deputies have done, to have another look at this.  As Deputy Ahern has said, I do not think the Minister for Finance would look on it too favourably but, as a State, we should not prop up inefficient organisations whether State, semi-State or otherwise.  The revenue Commissioners have more than adequate powers to collect their debts and they should not be given preferential treatment if they fail in their duty.</P>
    <P>Section 118 and 119 introduce a very important principle, that is the liability of related companies.  It can probably be said that the scandal of the Phoenix syndrome was only matched in the past by the scandal of the assets of one company disappearing into another before the former company was liquidated. Deputy Mac Giolla went into detail on one particular case.  I am confident that <Col N="2113" /> the provisions in this Bill will help to tackle that problem and ensure its elimination. The danger of these sections could be that companies related to a company that goes into liquidation could be brought down in the liquidation process. However, I think the Bill has adequate safeguards to ensure that this does not occur.  The fact that the courts are being given discretion in this regard should ensure that a reasonable approach will be adopted in circumstances of liquidation. This part of the Bill is long overdue.  It tackles the problem which all of us have referred to, of companies and directors rising from the ashes and setting up again in business.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions of the Bill is that companies with which directors of liquidated or insolvent companies become involved must now have a minimum paid up capital in cash of £50,000 for a public company and £10,000 for a private company.  I am not sure if this is an adequate safeguard to prevent people, such as these, from becoming directors again and repeating their escapades.  This section will have to be strengthened in some way.  For most people this is the core of the Bill in that it tries to ensure that people cannot repeatedly go into business, build up debts, go out of business and carry on from there.  I wonder if it would be possible to introduce a stipulation which would require a company where such directors are involved to produce a substantial bond, say, £250,000 or £100,000 depending on the size of the company.  Such a bond would protect the public, the employees and other traders in case of liquidation.  I do not think such a bonding system for the kinds of individuals we are talking of would be a major imposition on any company who were reasonably viable and doing their best to remain viable.  It would probably act as a disincentive to a chancer from starting up in business again.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that area and possibly to introduce some kind of bonding system.  This is not a new concept.  It has happened before and currently even good companies are required to have bonds to protect the public.  This happens <Col N="2114" /> in the travel business, the insurance business and other businesses as well.  It would help to stamp out the practice that was referred to by the previous speaker where companies set up for the duration of the time they want to build a housing estate but they disappear overnight when the last house is sold so that nobody can follow them up for not finishing the estate and so on.  This system would help to cut down on the number of such companies.</P>
    <P>I am unclear as to whether the provisions of section 128 apply to the formation of companies outside the State.  I know that section 17 in Part II of the Bill applies to companies which are registered outside the State but I am not sure if that applies with regard to section 128. It might be useful to have this clarified because some time ago when this Bill was going through the Seanad it was brought to my attention that a number of legal firms were offering their clients the opportunity of registering companies in Northern Ireland or in the UK in order to avoid the provisions of this section. They were offering their clients a service to set up companies in Northern Ireland, the UK or in mainland Europe because at that time &mdash; and as I said I am not clear whether this has been closed off in this Bill &mdash; the Bill did not refer to directors of companies in Northern Ireland and if a company collapsed it could start off in business again.  I should like clarification on this point, and if it is not covered it could very easily be covered by the inclusion of a section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill which allows companies to be put under the protection of the court is a welcome provision.  It is an unusual provision in our legislation but I believe it is common enough in the United States and in other countries.  This provision should be helpful to companies and to all those who might be caught up by the liquidation of a company.  It has the obvious merit of providing a system whereby a company in temporary financial difficulties can be given some breathing space in which to reorganise or reconstruct.  Because of that I believe the section can be seen as an encouragement <Col N="2115" /> to firms in difficulties to face their difficulties at a much earlier stage and to take the necessary actions to salvage the company instead of what happens at the moment whereby a person who sees his company getting into difficulty starts a fire brigade operation, shifting money from one section to another, half paying one fellow and using PAYE to pay creditors. The difficulties mount and there is absolutely no hope of salvation after a short period of time.  This section will help companies to avoid sliding down the slope into liquidation.  Most of the debts of a company are accumulated when the owners attempt all sorts of things to salvage their companies and, therefore, this provision is useful.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill a company can seek court protection under which the rights of all creditors are temporarily frozen.  It will also allow this to happen for a maximum of three months during which the court appointed examiner examines the affairs of a company and keeps a supervisory eye on its affairs while it is under court protection.  At the end of the period the examiner will then make his reports.  The only suggestion I have in relation to this provision is that if at all possible there should be agreement. I know the court will appoint the examiner and the court will be independent but I believe the court should be encouraged, if at all possible, to appoint an examiner who is acceptable to all of the major interested parties.  It would probably smooth the way for everybody if that spirit of co-operation existed from early on.</P>
    <P>With regard to this part of the Bill, there is a school of thought which suggests that it could and should be extended to include not only companies which are unable to pay their debts but also companies which make requests for significant extensions of credit, significant extensions of VAT on revenue payments or companies which seek an extension or roll over bank credit.  I understand the thinking behind that kind of proposal but I fear that that system could be abused and that people would simply look for <Col N="2116" /> court protection so as to avoid paying debts or as a handy excuse for not meeting liabilities for a particular period of time.  I believe the Bill is right in as far as it goes and I would be very reluctant to see it being extended any further.</P>
    <P>Part X of the Bill deals with accounts and audits.  This is very necessary in the light of the evidence available about company failures.  The evidence is that many companies fail simply because of poor accountancy practices.  Some of them fail because of lack of management skills but many fail simply because of poor accountancy practices.  The clarification of the duties of auditors and companies in relation to keeping accounts should help to minimise this.  The final section of the Bill contains a very important provision to tackle the problem of insolvent companies which cease trading without going into liquidation.  In certain circumstances some of the provisions of this Bill will apply and the Principal Act provides that they will become applicable immediately.  I believe that is a vital improvement on the current situation.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to one area which could be tackled in this Bill but which is not, namely, tax defaulting.  I do not know what the position is since the amnesty for those who were in tax arrears or whether every company will at all times be up to date in tax payments now, but in the past at various times the Revenue Commissioners have agreed to the instalment payment of taxation when a customer has fallen into arrears.  If that practice is to continue, the Revenue Commissioners should require personal guarantees from the traders or directors. In certain cases, in larger companies in particular the Revenue Commissioners, where they make such an agreement should be in a position to appoint nominees to the boards of the companies to protect their interests but that is something that can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely.  It deals with a very complex area which has received much media attention.  It must be emphasised again that we are talking about a relatively small group of people and that of <Col N="2117" /> that small group of people a minority set out deliberately to defraud.  The majority of the collapses which we witnessed probably happened through sheer incompetence on the part of the management.</P>
    <P>Because of the complicated nature of the Bill it might merit the setting up of a committee to deal with it on Committee Stage.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State, and indeed the previous Government, for their involvement in drawing up the Bill and I hope it will be passed speedily.</P>

      <P>Legislation of this nature is very complicated and a Deputy such as I must devote a large amount of time to consider all the sections or else a lesser amount of time to deal with the principle of this legislation.  I will make the shorter contribution.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to have the views of business people on this legislation which spans 153 closely printed pages, amending four Companies Acts which are in full force although some sections have been repealed.  The principal Act, the 1963 Act, is a huge enactment covering several hundred pages. The 1987 Bill refers to 15 Acts and the result is a vast complex of laws and amendments set out in a multitude of statutes passed over 25 years.  This is what a businessman has to face to find out the law in relation to his company.  Some of the sections are written in the most complex language with cross references which make it virtually impossible, without legal expertise to understand them.  I doubt if a businessman can either trace the relevant law or understand it if he does find it.  Yet, it is assumed that the businessman knows the law and he must obey it and apply it to his business.  How does he do this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The least this House might do is put company law into one Act.  To the uninformed, and I suspect to many of the self-professed informed, these Acts are a muddle.  They are totally inappropriate, for instance, for a young AnCO trainee who has been advised to set up his own business.  It should be within the competence of this House to produce a simple <Col N="2118" /> Act for private companies of under 50 people.  This would cover the vast majority of companies here.  I accept that for international financial institutions and for big business complicated Acts may be necessary but these businesses can afford the expertise to interpret them. However, the small businessman cannot. We should legislate more effectively for the people in the business sector.  The present mass of inappropriate and complex legislation is unsuitable.  On top of all that there has been imposed a whole range of EC legislation which is often inappropriate to the small man starting up in business.</P>
    <P>This House must have some regard for reality.  We are all being urged to prepare for 1992.  If this House is to contribute to that preparation we should supply simple legislation rather than complicated company law.  This would make the law more accessible to business people.  I ask the House to consider the brevity of my remarks in contrast to the length of the Bill; I hope my remarks are more understandable than the Acts in question.</P>

      <P>The lifting of the corporate veil has preoccupied the minds of lawyers and judges for many years. Some of the most learned judges and lawyers throughout that period have failed to come up with a perfect answer. Indeed, many lawyers and judges are of the opinion that there is not a perfect answer.  The task facing the legislator is extremely difficult.  One has to balance the needs of trade, business and entrepreneurial skills with the need to protect creditors, workers and, ultimately, the general public.  A company Bill such as this is the tightwire without the pole, for any legislator.  Nevertheless, legislators are obliged to try to balance the needs of both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will secure genuine creditors much better than previously.  It is also fair to say that in doing that the corporate veil has been lifted ever so slightly.  That is not to say that directors of companies have not always been in a trustee-like situation with the sharholders in a given <Col N="2119" /> company.  This Bill attempts to tackle specific acts of fraud and/or recklessness. Over the last number of years all too often we have witnessed deliberate deception, fraud and larceny on a grand scale by a small minority who have no regard for their obligation under the law to their shareholders, their fellow-direc-tors and their creditors.  This legislation has been needed for a considerable time to address problems in what may be described as a new busines and industrial age.</P>

      <P>This is the third Bill in 12 months to be moved by the Progressive Democrats during our scarce Private Members' Time.  We have in effect only three Private Members' periods during each Dáil session and it is our intention to use this limited time to initiate legislative change, whenever possible.  For too long Private Members' Time has been wasted on merely passing useles motions of condemnation of the Government of the day. The Progressive Democrats do not intend continuing this tradition, for we believe that our primary role in Dáil Éireann is to bring about legislative reform.  That is why we have always supported the right of the other parties and Deputies to have Bills published and moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three Bills moved by us to date have all sought to end one scandal or another.  Our first Bill which was moved 12 months ago, the Ministerial Pension <Col N="2120" /> Bill, 1987, tried to end payment of ministerial pensions to serving Members of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament and the Judiciary.  The second Bill was the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1988, which set out to tackle the present disgraceful position in relation to the payment of compensation for failure to grant planning permission and to deal with the problems associated with unfinished housing estates.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this National Lottery (Amendment) Bill, 1988, is to end the appalling abuse by Fianna Fáil of the national lottery by putting in place a new and independent process for the disbursement of lottery funds.  Last April I drew attention to the scandalous manner in which members of the present Government were allocating the lottery's proceeds. I said then that the national lottery was in danger of becoming a national scandal and that an independent allocation process was necessary if public trust and confidence in the lottery was not to be eroded.  Unfortunately, the abuse has escalated since then and the spectacle of seeing a pipe band leading the Minister for Agriculture into a town to announce the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; from the lottery has disgusted and sickened most ordinary, decent people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have engaged in the most despicable exercise in gombeen politics ever seen in this country in the way they have handled the allocations from the national lottery.  The behaviour of this Government is seriously jeopardising the future of the lottery itself and leading many people to the view that Fianna Fáil see the lottery as merely a re-election slush fund.  I know many people who tell me that when they buy a lottery ticket they feel they are directly contributing to Fianna Fáil party funds.  I know that all Opposition parties in this House and the Independent Deputies have been critical of the Government's approach to the disbursement of lottery funds and I am also aware that each party have their own particular view of how the abuse should be ended.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of this Bill <Col N="2121" /> last May I met with Opposition Deputies, including the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Alan Dukes, to discuss the Bill's contents and to seek support for the principle of a new and independent system to disburse the lottery's proceeds.  On three separate occasions since then I invited the other Opposition parties to co-sponsor this Bill or a similar Bill with the Progressive Democrats.  I did so because I am anxious to ensure that we use our combined strength to ensure that the present scandal is brought to an immediate end.</P>
    <P>Since the Second Stage vote on any Bill is a vote on the principle involved in the legislation and since the principle of this Bill being moved tonight is to change the method of disbursing lottery funds, I hope that all Opposition Deputies will unite behind it.  Failure to come together on this important issue would be a total abdication of our legislative responsibility to the people.  Collectively we in the Opposition will be as much to blame as Fianna Fáil for the present abuse because we now have it within our grasp to end this scandal if we come together.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to establish an independent board of trustees to disburse the proceeds from the national lottery.  The board of trustees will consist of a chairperson and four ordinary members.  It is proposed that the chairperson would be a High Court judge or someone who formerly held judicial office.  The four ordinary members of the board will consist of one representative from each of the following four areas: 1.  Sporting and recreational interests; 2. Cultural interests &mdash; including the Irish language; 3.  The Arts Council; and 4. Community, health and welfare interests.</P>
    <P>Each of the above groups will nominate three persons and the Government of the day will make the appointments from among these nominations.  The board would be statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.  It would be the sole function of the board of trustees to receive all applications for lottery aid and to make the allocations on the basis of clearly laid down criteria.</P>
    <P>The trustees will be required to set out <Col N="2122" /> the criteria on which allocations are made and to submit annually a comprehensive report to the Minister for Finance, which shall contain the details of all applications received, particulars of applications approved, rejected or deferred and the reason for the decision.  The Minister will be obliged to lay a copy of the report before the Dáil.  It is envisaged that this report would be fully debated and that the board of trustees would be fully accountable to Dáil Éireann through the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance can from time to time, with the approval of Dáil Éireann, give a special directive to the board of trustees requiring them to allocate a sum of money to a particular project. It is important to allow the Government of the day, with the approval of the Dáil, the power to have money provided for what may be a worthwhile national or community project.  It would be well if Members on the Government benches listened instead of sniggering.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that where any person knowingly misappropriates any money allocated by the trustees he will be guilty of an offence, carrying up to three months imprisonment, or a fine of £1,000, or both for a minor offence on summary conviction.  There will be fines of up to £50,000 and imprisonment for up to five years for more serious offences on conviction on indictment.  Persons found quilty of an offence will be liable to repay in full the money misapproptiated. This is one of the major loopholes in the 1986 National Lottery Act.</P>
    <P>Another weakness in the present legislation establishing the national lottery is that it allows members of the Government of the day total discretion as to how and to whom the lottery proceeds are allocated.  This is very unsatisfactory and has allowed Fianna Fáil to continue to engage in the old style &ldquo;stroke politics&rdquo;, and we see that all over the country Ministers and TDs promising and delivering &ldquo;grants from the national lottery&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil have politicised and upset many worthwhile community, sporting and voluntary organisations.  The whole <Col N="2123" /> merit of the lottery fund is being perverted by this cynical party political exercise as they seek to buy votes.</P>
    <P>The lottery is widely supported by many people throughout this country, including people of all political persuasions and those of none.  It is not appropriate that this money should ever be allocated on a party political basis and it is only by establishing an independent board of trustees that it can be placed above party politics.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the groups who have already benefited from the national lottery's proceeds.  In the main these groups are involved in very worthwhile community activity but they have been forced to exploit the present allocation system in order to get a much needed grant.  It is wrong that voluntary and independent organisations are placed in this position.  Everyone's application should be decided on the basis of the merits of the case and not on any other basis.</P>
    <P>A number of the decisions made by members of this Government in relation to lottery grants raise serious questions about Fianna Fáil's sense of priorities. How can they justify refusing to give any lottery grant to the Irish Association for Victim Support &mdash; a voluntary group doing outstanding work for the victims of crime &mdash; and yet allocate £10,000 to a luxury hotel in Kerry to resurface their tennis courts?  On what basis was that decision made?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, who I am delighted to see present in the House, has accused me of referring to golf as an elitist sport.  I would like him to tell me when I said that.  What I did criticise was the huge number of grants allocated to what are private clubs, when a group like the Irish Epilepsy Association got no money to assist in the building of a training centre for disabled people in Dublin.  The public do not have access to private golf clubs.  The lottery funds are public funds and should be applied to organisations that are either fully open to the public or deal with the poor, disabled or disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Another weakness with the existing legislation is that there are no clearly laid down criteria for the allocation of the money.  For many of the grants there is not even an application form.  The present <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements have led to accusations that money has been promised without any correct vetting process.  Fifteen of the 49 groups in County Dublin that received lottery grant approval from the Department of the Environment up to early May of this year did not make any formal application at all.  These loose arrangements must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a matter that can be dealt with by way of legislation, but it is extremely important that the Government introduce a uniform vetting process for lottery aid.  The criteria required for being grant-aided need to be clearly and publicly specified and all groups making an application need to know in advance the basis on which their application will be considered.  Many organisations have informed me that their lottery grant <Col N="2125" /> applications were not even acknowledged, never mind approved.  One organisation dealing with the disabled told me that despite the fact that they made an application last March to the Department of Health for lottery funds, it was not until their name was mentioned in an <i>Irish Independent</i> article recently that they were even contacted by the Department.  Those who are not lucky enough to have the ear of a Fianna Fáil Minister or TD, or who wish to remain totally independent and not compromise themselves or their organisations by being beholden to members of Fianna Fáil, have to linger in the hope that perhaps some day they might get some crumbs from the lottery cake.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for me in the time at my disposal this evening to deal at any great length with the huge discrepancies in the allocations made to the groups in constituencies represented by Fianna Fáil Ministers, but a short examination of the data available clearly shows that Sligo, Mayo, Limerick West and Dublin North are at the top of the lottery league.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment was given responsibility to allocate £6 million for amenity and recreational purposes. He received, in all, in excess of 2,000 applications and he made a decision to grant-aid 60 different groups.  Mayo got £405,000 &mdash;the bulk of, I might add, to his own constituency of West Mayo &mdash; he seems to have known in advance what might happen to that constituency &mdash; while County Louth got a mere £43,000, Kilkenny £47,000 and Carlow £50,000.  It is merely a coincidence that the Minister for the Environment represents Mayo, while Carlow, Kilkenny or Louth have no Cabinet member?  The criteria the Minister for the Environment used were clearly based on his own constituency consideration and not on the basis of need.  Of the 49 applications approved by the Minister for the Environment for the County Dublin area up to the beginning of May of this year, 26 went to the Dublin North constituency represented by the Minister, Deputy Burke.  It would be good to think that the members of the Government could put their constituency <Col N="2126" /> considerations aside and make decisions in the national interest.  That, however, does not seem to me to be possible for members of the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to now deal with the division of the lottery's proceeds.  The 1986 National Lottery Act does not specify the precise way the lottery fund should be divided. This is left to the Government of the day, subject to publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  At the moment, 55 per cent goes to youth and sport, 35 per cent to the arts, culture and the Irish language and 10 per cent to health and welfare.  These percentages were decided at a time when the lottery was expected to yield a surplus of between £10 million and £12 million per annum.  I believe that in the context of this country's present problems, with 30 per cent of the population living below the povery line, high unemployment, emigration of at least 40,000 people per year and the growing crisis in the health services, we need to change the priorities for lottery aid.  I suggest that the allocation to health be doubled, with particular priority being given to the development of facilities for the handicapped, the disabled and the elderly.  It is time to give allocations to groups dealing with the Third World, to emigrant welfare and to other groups that are dealing with the marginalised in our society and to consider our responsibilities to the Third World.  The actual division of the fund is something that could be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage of this Bill.  It is the marginally weak in our society and not the politically marginal who should be the main beneficiaries for the lottery windfall.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are pleased that the national lottery has been successful and we very much regret that this Government have so abused it as to seriously undermine public confidence in it.  Is it any wonder that the national lottery had to spend substantial funds taking out full page advertisements in all the national papers last weekend, telling us where exactly the money was going?</P>

      <P>We are convinced that the establishment of an independent board to disburse the funds will ensure that all groups are treated fairly.  We do not want ministerial control over the allocations to continue.  We want to ensure that the lottery funds go to the most needy and that they are efficiently managed. I might add, as the Minister, Deputy Fahey is in the House, that perhaps he could justify to me why the Port-marnock area is to be given £300,000 for a sports hall when it already has a very comprehensive and well used sports hall which was given £166,000 by ment in 1980 and a further £66,000 by the Dublin County Council?  Why should Portmarnock, a very small area, justify a <Col N="2128" /> need for two sports halls?  I should like the Minister to tell me why he made that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to know that in two recent opinion polls up to 70 per cent of the electorate support that concept of an independent board to disburse the funds and that even the supporters of Fianna Fáil, by a two to one majority, favour this system.  I know that other members of the Opposition do not share our view that a board of trustees, as suggested in the Bill, is the ideal solution. We all agree that the present abuse must be brought to an end and, therefore, our first step as Opposition Deputies, is to ensure that we unite together at the Second Stage vote.  I appeal to all Deputies to do so.  While we are committed to the principle of establishing an independent board, when we come to Committee Stage we should come together and reach a common approach on how lottery funds should be disbursed.  While we, the Progressive Democrats, are committed to the principle of an independent board, we are entirely open to suggested changes in its composition, terms of reference and powers.  I want to build a consensus in favour of an independent board, but at the end of the day there will be no change unless the law is amended, and that can only be done if the Bill passes the Second Stage on Wednesday night of next week.</P>
      <P>A motion urging change or resolving that there should be change achieves nothing.  Just as the Private Members' procedure has been used very effectively to initiate change in the law of marriage breakdown, so it can be used to bring about change in the law relating to the lottery.  Faced with overwhelming public support for the change, in my view, there is no question of an election arising out of a win for the Opposition parties should the Government seek to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are coming to the end of this Government and the bleak days are <Col N="2129" /> beginning to set in.  I notice that the Minister for the Environment is conspicuous by his absence tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many people who believe that by proposing to remove the allocation of lottery funds from politicians we are demeaning ourselves.  I believe that, unfortunately, the blatant abuse and politicising of the lottery allocation system by Fianna Fáil has demeaned politics and politicians.  There are certain areas in which politicians need not be involved.  It was the response to the controvesy surrounding the planning appeal procedure that led the 1973-1977 Coalition Government to courageously establish An Bord Pleanála under the chairmanship of a High Court judge.  I believe that the same independent process is now necessary to disburse national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>Members of Fine Gael seem to dislike the notion of an independent board being chaired by a Hugh Court judge.  I am not totally hung up on the notion of a judge chairing this board of trustees, but I do believe that someone of this calibre generally commands widespread public trust.  In the past, High Court judges were appointed by all Governments to head An Bord Pleanála, recently the Broadcasting Commission &mdash; without any opposition in this House &mdash; the Constituency Revision Commission and so on.  If they were acceptable for these important tasks, I cannot understand why they are not appropriate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of accountability in relation to lottery funds is something members of this Government have continuously referred to.  They have said there is accountability.  Recently the <Col N="2130" /> Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, said all allocations are made and that the Government are accountable to the Dáil.  If that is so I wonder why, on 10 May, column 769 of the Official Report, the Minister for the Environment refused to give me a list of the names and addresses of the people to whom he had made the 550 grant approvals.  He refused to give me this information because he said it would take too much time to compile it.  Yet, three or four days earlier all newspapers, including provincial newspapers, and Fianna Fáil Deputies, as well as several other people were able to get this list and I was able to secure the list privately. Yet, when I raised the matter in the Dáil I was not given the information.  They did not want this list to go on the record.</P>
    <P>A great service is provided by many of the provincial newspapers.  I could show some lovely headlines which would embarrass some of the people opposite, drawing people like Sister Consilio into a nasty political row in West Limerick between Ministers Noonan and Collins. She is one of many who have been dragged into unseemly rows by members of the Fianna Fáil Government as they jump on the gravy train trying to buy support.</P>
    <P>Last week the Leader of the Progressive Democrats launched a six point policy priority programme for this party. One of the six points to which we believe priority must be given in Irish politics is the question of decent standards in public life.  This Bill is about the issue of public confidence in political standards and it is far too important an issue to be funked. Anyone who thinks that a majority Fianna Fáil Government would be good for this country has only to observe their antics in relation to the national lottery. Anything left to their discretion is abused and when one sees the way they allocated the £71 million from the lottery one must wonder what they would do if they had full control over the nation's finances.</P>
    <P>This minority Government need to be kept on a tight rein at all times and I am appealing to my colleagues on the Opposition benches, of whatever political persuasion, to bury our differences, <Col N="2131" /> to abandon our own ideal solutions and to vote together for the principle of change.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge the support which Fine Gael have indicated they will give the Second Reading of this Bill and also the support the Labour Party and The Workers Party are to give the Second Reading.  I am appealing to the Independent Deputies because we have it within our grasp to end this abuse.  There is no point complaining unless we all vote together when it really matters.  The people did not give Fianna Fáil a majority in the last election.  The onus is on us, particularly when we have a minority Government, to come together and to use our strength to bring about change, to ensure that there are decent standards in public life and that the needy and most deserving cases benefit from the lottery. If we come together we will succeed in ensuring that the proceeds of the national lottery will go to the most deserving cases, the lottery will be fully supported and will have the confidence and trust of all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to invite the other Opposition parties to co-sponsor this proposal with us or, failing that, to support us in the principle of stamping out the blatant political abuse of the funds of the national lottery by members of this Government.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I believe that it is of fundamental importance to realise that there is a demonstrable demand for lottery reform and that the public will not thank the Opposition parties if they fail to bring about real change as distinct from partisan posturing.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that I, as Chief Whip of the Progressive Democrats, wrote to the leaders of all the Opposition parties and the Independent Deputies in this House earlier this week seeking their support for the reform, in principle, of the means of allocating national lottery funds in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we elected to put a Bill, rather than a motion, before the House in our Private Members' Time is that a Bill is the only way the National Lottery <Col N="2132" /> Act, 1986, can be effectively amended and altered to provide for the allocation of lottery funds by independent means. A motion, which was requested and preferred by Fine Gael, would be non-binding, debated in three hours, and would preclude another discussion on the same issue for six months without alleviating, in any way, any of the anomalies and abuses which have given rise to this problem.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as I have pointed out to the other Opposition parties, experience has shown us that, over the last 18 months, this Government have responded more urgently to Bills introduced in Private Members' Time to change the law rather than to motions of exhortation passed against the Government. To give a few examples: the two Private Members Bills moved by us to date in this Dáil have brought an end to abuse of one form or another.  The Ministerial Pensions Bill resulted in a new mandate being given to the Gleeson Committee which produced a new recommendation for change, however inadequate, in ministerial pensions within a few months.  Our second Bill &mdash; the Local Government (Planning and Development Bill &mdash; which tried to stamp out the menace of cowboy builders who depart leaving housing estates unfinished, and tried to deal with the complex issues of compensation, resulted in a commitment from the Government to bring forward their own legislation.  The Government's Planning Bill, inadequate though it is, has been published and is part of the Government's draft legislative programme for this session.</P>
    <P>Other parties have also seen the wisdom of this approach if a real attempt is to be made to change the law.  The Fine Gael Party obviously believed that they would change the law in relation to marriage separation more effectively by the introduction of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987, rather than by introducing a Dáil motion, and their Bill will be debated again in the Dáil later this month.  Fine Gael also moved the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Genetic Fingerprinting) Bill, 1988, two <Col N="2133" /> weeks ago.  The Progressive Democrats supported both of these Bills.</P>
    <P>This debate on the Progressive Democrats' National Lottery (Amendment) Bill is taking place within this context tonight.  We have been prepared to go more than half way to secure all-party agreement for the principle and the method of administering national lottery funds in the future.  We have invited all Opposition parties to co-sponsor and support the Bill in the Dáil this week and next.  We expect that this support will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The most important feature of our Bill, as Deputy Harney pointed out is that it embodies the principle of an independent board to administer lottery funds rather than leaving them in the hands of the Government to be used as a political slush fund.  So strong is public disquiet on this issue that the idea of an independent board is supported by up to 70 per cent of the public in the latest opinion poll.  I want to be quite categorical on this point: if our particular independent mechanism does not meet the approval of other parties or Deputies, we are entirely open to suggested changes in its composition, terms of reference and powers once the principle of allocating lottery funds through an independent agency, free from ministerial abuse, can be achieved. That is our aim in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>We believe, in effect, that we can best meet the reservations of other political parties about our particular method of providing an accountable administration of the lottery funds by allowing our Bill &mdash; like the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987 &mdash; to go in to a special committee after Second Stage where the views of all parties, including the Government, on a new and independent means of disbursing lottery funds can be discussed in detail and agreed.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I am quite aware that Fine Gael, at the weekend, stated that our method of disbursing lottery funds is flawed.  If it is, indeed, flawed, we are inviting Fine Gael, by putting this Bill before the House, to join with the other Opposition parties in formulating <Col N="2134" /> a new and independent structure to allocate lottery funds on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I welcome Fine Gael's change of heart on this issue, announced after their parliamentary party meeting today.</P>
    <P>The basic issue which we are putting before each party and each Deputy in the House tonight is as follows: there is blatant abuse of the national lottery funds.  That is beyond doubt.  We have seen the spectacle of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, going on national television to account for the Government's handling of the lottery &mdash; incidentally, the first occasion on which a Minister was prepared to be confronted on television alongside an Opposition spokesperson in recent months and heard him saying that his constituency of Mayo merited funds.  I am quite sure that it did, so does my constituency and so do the constituencies of every other Deputy, but the funds given to any constituency, just as in the case of Dún Laoghaire, should not be determined by the strength or weakness of the representation of the Government party of the day.  The distinction which the Minister failed to make was that, as a member of the Cabinet, he is responsible for the whole country, not just shoring up special projects in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>In brief, we are seeking the support of all Opposition Deputies for the principle of changing the law on the Second Stage of our Bill next Wednesday night.  We invite all parties, including the Government, to sit down together with us on Committee Stage of this Bill to formulate an agreed independent mechanism for allocating lottery funds and removing ministerial abuse.</P>
    <P>When the history of this Dáil comes to be written years from now, the distinctive feature of the 25th Dáil will be the extraordinary consensus that exists in this House.  This consensus, unlike what many people believe, is not limited exclusively to restoring the public finances to a sound footing, but rather its principal purpose is to provide for better Government and to restore public confidence in political life.  I and some other members of my party came into politics <Col N="2135" /> for this reason.  I believe that this Bill will go a long way towards achieving that aim. I do not believe that it is realistic to expect this Fianna Fáil Government can be trusted to end their abuse of the lottery and to mend their ways, because in addition to the gross abuse of the national lottery funds, this Government have deliberately in relation to Dáil gerrymander in relation to Dáil constituencies aimed at marginalising the voice and role of the smaller parties like the Progressive Democrats, and they have also attempted to stage-manage events so that Government Ministers can avoid any serious questioning of their performance on television or radio. Therefore, I believe that by proceeding by way of a Bill, instead of a motion, this minority Goverment can be prevented from wilfully disregarding or prevaricating on the real issue of impartial responsibility in the allocation of lottery funds.  This Bill is the only mechanism which will come before this House, in this session of the Dáil, to stop abuse of the national lottery.  I ask each Deputy to bear this in mind.  They will have no other opportunity for the next six months to voice their criticism and it is for this reason that I call on each party and each Independent Deputy to vote for our proposals next Wednesday night.</P>

    <P>The Bill now before the House proposes the setting up of a board to disburse lottery funds comprising a judge and four others, from the sports, culture, art, health-welfare areas.  This Bill, in effect, is an attempt to cast a slur on the Government, to undermine public confidence in the Government and implies misappropriation of lottery funds.  Let me make it quite clear that the Government have adhered to the criteria as laid down by this House under the 1986 Act.  That <Col N="2136" /> Act was devised, compiled and introduced by the previous Government.  That remains a fact whether the Progressive Democrats like it or not.  As I said, the Government have adhered to the criteria as laid down by the House under the 1986 Act which was devised, compiled and introduced by the previous Government, a combination of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>

      <P>Decisions on lottery allocations are arrived at at the Cabinet table.  Before Ministers may subsequently disburse these funds for schemes and projects, the criteria and conditions for the schemes must first be submitted for examination and approval by the Minister for Finance and his officials.  It is only following the approval of the Minister for Finance that the Minister can allocate grant aid and only strictly in accordance with the regulations as laid down by the Minister for Finance. This procedure is identical in these respects to the procedure adopted in the case of projects funded by the Exchequer.  The Bill is being brought forward by Deputy Harney on the grounds that the lottery funds are not being properly allocated.  I would like to take this opportunity to demonstrate to the House and to the general public that this view is outrageous and without foundation.  I will show that these allegations are spurious.</P>
      <P>With regard to sport, my Department were allocated the following funding for 1988: current expenditure, £6.640 million; capital expenditure, £10.5 million.</P>
      <P>With the House's permission I will show how and where the funding for these areas are being allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the 73 national governing bodies of sport will receive £985,000 in their annual grant for coaching, equipment and administration.  This sum represents an increase of 22 per cent over the 1987 allocation.  For 1988 also I am providing an extra £210,000 for the <Col N="2137" /> appointment of new administrators for these bodies to improve their management and coaching structures.  A further £97,000 is being provided for the purchase of large items of equipment and for attendance at international meetings.</P>
    <P>Further grants of £273,000 are given to enable sports persons to compete in international competitions and for the organisation of international competitions at home.  A sum of £182,000 was allocated for development officers, while £100,000 was granted for the subsidisation of the cost of hurleys.  A sum of £120,000 is being granted under the grant scheme for outstanding sports persons, while the Olympic Council of Ireland received £500,000.  Funding is also given to Cospóir to enable it to develop Sport for All and other programmes.</P>
    <P>Other new projects being grant-aided from the lottery are: the provision of office units for sports bodies in a house of sport; the establishment of the Irish Coaching Bureau; the appointment of a recreation development officer under the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management for the better use of recreational facilities; sports research and sports injuries and funding for the Physical Education Association of Ireland for the development of national projects.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to indicate where grant-aid has been mis-applied by the Government.  In fact, despite the generous increases given this year we still have many organisations who could do with more money.  All of the groups who have received such allocations are subject to the rigours of proper accounting through the submission to my Department of audited accounts on an annual basis.  The schemes in respect of which the moneys have been allocated have all been approved by the Departments of Finance and Education.  Any Member of this House can obtain copies of the schemes in question.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, the provision of a national sports centre on a site immediately below the site for the Custom House Docks Financial Services Centre will satisfy a great longing among our people <Col N="2138" /> for such a facility.  The centre, which is estimated to cost £35 million &mdash; whose configuration will be capable of accommodating a six lane 200 metre running track &mdash; will be multi-purpose and will include also a 50 metre swimming pool. The House will be glad to know that the first stage brief for distribution to design and developer groups interested in competing for the project will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Major regional facilities will be provided by the Government in the main urban areas in Cork, Sligo, Galway, Athlone, Limerick and Waterford.  Lest Deputy Harney would seek to impute to me the reason that facilities are being provided in Athlone, about which I am very pleased, I should say that a decision by Cospóir in 1986, under the previous Government, identified the six regional centres.  Major funding is also being made available for a basketball centre and a badminton centre in Dublin.  Active consideration is being given to the development of a major outdoor stadium.  The development of Morton Stadium is one of the options under serious consideration in this context.</P>
    <P>Works is well advanced on the provision of a 400 metre synthetic track in Waterford. In the case of Cork, Sligo, Galway and Athlone the local authorities are in the process of initiating preliminary planning. The tender procedures have been completed for the badminton centre in Baldoyle and commencement of the work is imminent.  Much preparatory work has been completed by the Irish Basketball Association for their major centre at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The full construction cost of the regional sports facilities will be met by the State from the lottery.  A sum of £100,000 is being provided for the completion of the badminton centre and a total of £800,000 for the Irish Basketball Centre on a £ for £ basis.</P>
    <P>A national coaching and training centre will be provided in Thomond College of Education with total funding from the lottery.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, major facilities will be provided in 18 provincial centres <Col N="2139" /> throughout the country.  These centres will provide for a range of sporting activities based on priorities locally identified.</P>
    <P>For 1988 I have also provided a sum of £4 million for the provision of facilities under the recreation facilities programme. Approximately 270 grants have been sanctioned for schemes all over the country.  As an indication of the enthusiasm of sports and other organisations to provide these much needed type of facilities at local level, I have received, in addition to the 270 successful applications, about 700 further applications for grant assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>According to press reports this scheme has come in for some criticism.  Deputy Harney herself has complained about the availability of grant-aid to golf clubs in particular.  A total of two golf clubs have been given grants under this scheme that is the recreation facilities programme. Kilrush Golf and Sports Club and Slade Valley Golf Club, County Dublin, have received grants of £5,000 and £15,000, respectively.  The total of £20,000 represents 0.05 per cent or one-twentieth of 1 per cent of the total of £4 million allocated.  Therefore the allegation that substantial funding is being given under this programme to well-heeled, élitist sports clubs is just not sustainable.  Kilrush Golf and Sports Club also caters for a cross-section of the local rural community while Slade Valley Golf Club also caters for a good cross-section of the urban community.  Therefore, I have no problem in justifying a grant for these two clubs in the same way as I would for, say, GAA clubs which are just as likely nowadays to contain disproportionate numbers of high, medium or low incomeearning individuals.  Might I say in this respect that the golf clubs that have received grants are participating in a programme devised by my Department to allow the public, especially women working at home, retired people and unemployed young people, to learn to play golf at a minimum cost.  When we put it to them that these grants would be given subject to eligibility they were very anxious to put forward ideas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> Furthermore the House will be aware of the provision of £0.5 million from the national lottery for the commercial development of sport.  The concept here is to attract foreign tourists to Ireland by offering them activity holidays such as walking, pony-trekking, sailing and golf. As part of the development my Department have given pump-priming grants to sports and other organisations in five designated tourist areas &mdash; west Kerry, Shannon region, Wexford, Connemara and west Donegal.  In all a total of 49 grants, totalling £368,500 were sanctioned.  Of the 49 grants sanctioned I find that seven were sanctioned for golf. The total amount of the grants sanctioned was £99,000.  Obviously, through a misunderstanding, Deputy Harney confused the two grant schemes.  There is first the grant for recreational purposes, which I have outlined, and, second, that designated and announced publicly by the Government, for tourist and employment purposes.</P>
    <P>The golf clubs in question are located at Gweedore, Portumna, Ceann Sibéal, Connemara, Cruit Island, Oughterard and Portnoo.  They are situated in tourist areas.  I might reiterate, that the grants given are for the purpose of attracting foreign tourists and generating local employment.  I make no apology for making grants for such worthy purposes.</P>
    <P>While the purpose of these grants is to make sports facilities more attractive to foreign tourists, the primary motive is to generate employment by the development of tourism.  Golf itself is a sport which attracts many visitors to Ireland and contributes substantially to our economy. I feel strongly that there should be no objection to pursuing the generation of employment through making golf or any other sport more attractive.</P>
    <P>The House will not disagree with me when Deputies reflect on the developments in sport which are being grant-aided and on the methodology being used for the allocation of the grant-aid.  But for the lottery we would, sportswise, be in a static position financially.  The Government's policies and strategies, based on sound and fair consideration <Col N="2141" /> of requirements, will provide attractive facilities for our people.  Society as a whole can only benefit socially and culturally. While criticism is part of human psychology, while it is only right that there should be critical debate on the lottery, I contend that such criticism should be objective, fair-minded and not slanted for purely political reasons.  The lottery is here to stay.  I am personally confident that our people will continue to support the Government's control and administration of the lottery funds, especially as they will see the physical and other results of the investment in sport.</P>
    <P>The second area of activity for which my Department are responsible &mdash; under the 1986 National Lottery Act &mdash; is that of youth.  Due entirely to the national lottery I was able to increase the allocation to the youth service from some £3.7 million in 1987 to £10 million in 1988. This increase in funding is unprecedented in the whole history of the State's involvement with voluntary youth organisations and youth work services.  Some £4.68 million has been allocated towards the support of programmes and services for disadvantaged youth.  It is the disadvantaged and marginalised young people to whom the lottery funds have been addressed.  A full £4 million of this allocation is going towards new or additional services for the young homeless, young substance abusers or young people generally at risk.  Applications for assistance from the special fund for disadvantaged youth, established in my Department from the proceeds of the national lottery, were considered by an inter-departmental committee on disadvantaged youth.  This committee were required to draw up a programme of support for disadvantaged young people from the very many individual applications received across a wide range of services.  Priority was given to projects which, heretofore, had received no support or for new services provided by existing grant-assisted bodies, particularly in the following areas; young homeless, substance abuse and special youth work services. It is fair to say that the basis for <Col N="2142" /> a concerted attack upon the problems affecting many of our least advantaged young people now exists.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee were representative of the Departments of Education, Health, Labour, Environment, Social Welfare, Justice and the Gaeltacht.  The committee examined projects which were nominated by individuals Departments or their agencies such as health boards, vocational education committees, or by voluntary youth organisations.</P>
    <P>In the case of disadvantaged youth projects grants were announced by me at a press conference organised in consultation with the National Lottery Company on 5 May 1988.</P>
    <P>The youth service is founded upon a well organised and highly developed voluntary movement of adults.  I make no apology for the fact that the State commitment to the voluntary youth service was greatly strengthened by the allocation of national lottery funds.  Grants totalling some £3.63 million were awarded to voluntary organisations on the basis of pre-determined criteria under the youth service grant scheme.  The organisations which receive funding under the scheme all have educationally sound programmes which hold up under scrutiny.  They are all deserving of the support they have received.</P>
    <P>The balance of the funds available to me in 1988 have been devoted to supporting complementary schemes and programmes in the area of youth exchange, in-service training, youth information,. public relations and programme development. I have also sanctioned the establishment of some nine local voluntary youth councils.  These councils will facilitate the collective voice of volunteer youth providers in their areas.  Their role is to survey what needs to be provided and to draw up an appropriate plan of action.  I also accept that the statutory sector has an important role to play in providing essential back-up to the work of the volunteer in the field and must be accommodated in an appropriate manner in plans for local youth service development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> I was at great pains to see that the description of how the moneys allocated to my Department under the criteria established by the National Lottery Act in 1986 would be laid on the record of the House tonight.  If I had seemed pedantic in going into figures it is because the spurious allegations made, not just in the House tonight but by the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats over the past number of months, needed to be nailed very firmly and with great accuracy and to be shown for what they are, spurious and false allegations, made with the prime purpose of demonstrating that they &mdash; and they alone &mdash; had the God-given right to do everything which is correct.  Quite obviously, the Progressive Democrats are greatly out of touch with urban and rural Ireland.  I do not speak to Deputy Harney in a personal sense but as spokesperson&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have heard herself.  Boy, was she preaching? Deputy Harney gravely insulted the many groups who applied for and received lottery funds.  I take particular exception to what she said about the marginalised in our society when I know the work which has been started &mdash; and which will be continued &mdash; under the programme for disadvantaged young people. I refer especially to homeless young people who have been subjected to substance abuse through no fault of their own but because of the environment in which they came to puberty and maturity. The allocation of money to those people is now being called into question under the banner of propriety and other banners behind which the Progressive Democrats have chosen to parade.  The scandal does not lie on this side of the House but quite fairly and squarely on Deputy Harney's party, the members of whom came in here tonight to show that they alone have a monopoly of feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many sporting and youth organisations have benefited from lottery funds and I <Col N="2144" /> freely acknowledge that the Government would not have been able to allocate such funds but for the lottery.  These funds have been freely given by the people and disbursed to the areas of greatest need. Many of the clubs and organisations who benefited are deeply upset by the slurs and imputations which have been cast on them by the Progressive Democrats.  I wish to thank you and the House for the hearing I got tonight.  My Department's record in disbursing lottery funds can stand up to any scrutiny and will continue to do so under any Minister.  The Government have strictly adhered to the criteria laid down by the House under the 1986 Act which was devised, compiled and produced by the previous Government. To say otherwise is a serious slur on the Government.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no doubt that the disbursement of lottery funds is now a national scandal.  I would advise the Minister for Education and her Government that they had better change because it has reached scandalous proportions. The question is now being asked &mdash; Deputy Alan Dukes asked it directly at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis and I will quote him &mdash; why is it, when Fianna Fáil finds a way of spending money that is not directly accountable pound by pound to the Dáil, that the &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; mentality breaks out.  &ldquo;Briseann an dúchas trí shúilibh an chait&rdquo;, he said.  If they play fast and loose with the national lottery's £70 million, what would they do if they had an overall majority and if we gave them a free hand with the national finances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party are proud of the national lottery.  We brought in the legislation to set it up.  If my memory serves me correctly, Fianna Fáil voted against it.  When we introduced it we underestimated the yield from it, in common with everybody in the country. We expected it to yield in the region of £10 million or £12 million.  In the legislation we laid down a procedure for the use of the funds.  In the 1988 Book of Estimates there is £60 million on the current side in the Vote of the Department of Finance and on the capital side there is a further £33 million.  That totals £93 million, much of which is being spent <Col N="2147" /> properly but a large section of it, particularly on the capital side, is being used now as a political slush fund by the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly by the Ministers in the party, both senior and junior. Not only are they using the political funding to disadvantage Deputies on this side of the House but they are using it to add point to the competition between Deputies on their own side of the House. There are constituency colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party who are trying to score advantage over each other by being the first to make an announcement when lottery funds are being disbursed.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for the Minister for Education because she was sent in here tonight to defend that.  In fairness, many of the decisions made in the Department of Education are subject to accountability but there are others that are not.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy <Col N="2148" /> Geraldine Kennedy talked about Fine Gael having a change of heart.  Deputy Kennedy, as Whip of her party, knows we did not have a change of heart.  We sought, for the past ten days or so, to get agreement with all the Opposition parties in the House to a motion which would have intrinsic to it the principles of accountability and independence.  We know we have different individual policies on the lottery and we are entitled to our individual position as are the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, but we sought to achieve common ground.  In the absence of achieving common ground, because the Progressive Democrats unlike the other Opposition parties refused to go down that road, we are now using the only vehicle that is available to us, the Bill that is before the House.</P>
      <P>In voting that this Bill should get a Second Reading we are not saying we are in agreement with the Bill but it is the only opportunity we have in this House to show the Government, both by word and by action through voting, that we deplore what they are doing now.  They are in the process of wrecking one of the best schemes ever introduced to provide funds for objectives which we all share. They should consider the position between now and next week.  They should agree to give this Bill a Second Reading and bring in their own proposals subsequently if necessary.</P>
      <P>Our position on this Bill is, as I have said, that we are prepared to support the Bill put forward on Second Stage.  We have serious reservations about some central aspects of the Bill.  We believe it is important that this Bill be discussed on Committee Stage so that necessary changes can be made.  At that stage the Fine Gael Party will be putting forward a detailed series of amendments which are currently under discussion at parliamentary party level.  We hope that other parties will also contribute in the same manner, and we include Fianna Fáil in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' Bill is intrinsically flawed.  The suggestion that a High Court judge should play the key <Col N="2149" /> role here is a major flaw and misinterprets the role of High Court judges.  The role of the courts is defined in the Constitution. High Court judges have chaired certain committees outside of court proceedings but most of them traditionally have been of a quasi-judicial nature such as the Adoption Board or the Planning Appeals Board.  It is a misconception of the role of High Court judges to get them involved in this activity.  It is also a misconception of the role of the House because constitutionally the responsibility for the raising of revenue and the disbursement of funds lies in the first instance with the Minister for Finance. Secondly, through that power it transfers to the Government of which the Minister is a member and then it lies with this House to decide by vote on the Estimates what money is spent on what programme. It is a misconception to involve a High Court judge in that kind of activity.  If we were to extend the concept of High Court judges being involved in the disbursement of funds from the millions of pounds in the national lottery to the area of public spending in general &mdash; after all the health budget is £1.3 billion and the education budget is approximately £1 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;thanks to the arrangements made by his colleague in Government, Deputy Flynn.  I realise the Minister's sensitivity tonight.  He should leave the House, have a cup of coffee and let the Minister for Education, who can put a far better face on these shameless activities, sit there and smile at the rest of us and pretend there is nothing going on when we all know it is an absolute scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to make the point that if we were to extend the principle we could have 15 High Court judges sitting around the Cabinet table, each responsible for spending allocations of money far greater than the amount of money in the lottery. We all have our roles and this Parliament has its constitutional role; the Cabinet have their constitutional role and the <Col N="2151" /> courts have their role, and we should, as far as possible, allow people to play on their own pitches and keep their roles separate.  It leads to confusion when the constitutional boundaries are crossed.</P>
    <P>The second reason I have strong objections to this Bill is that if the board are to be really independent they will have to be serviced by a staff.  The decisions required to be made by this board will range from the health area to areas affecting arts, culture, education, and the environment and the provision of community halls and golf clubs, whichever vote they come under.  There is a whole range of activities.  If this proposed board are to be totally independent they will have to have an independent staff and they will have to be a huge staff if they are to have expertise to cross this wide area.  If they do that we are duplicating many areas of the public service simply to have an independent oversight of disbursement of lottery funds.  That is plainly ludicrous.  I am against quangos. We have too many quasi-autonomous non-governmental agencies already and we should be reducing them rather than increasing them, and this will be the ultimate quango.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better than the quango sitting over there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am sure if Deputy Harney got an opportunity to reply she would say that of course there is no intention of them having their own staff, but if they do not have their own staff they are going to be served by the civil servants of the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health, the Department of the Taoiseach and so on, and each of these is subject to the individual Minister who controls the Department.  Therefore, you have two choices.  Either you have the appearance of independence and all the decisions made on the basis of paper put in front of an independent board and civil servants subject to their own Minister, or you create a bureaucratic monster.  Therefore, I do not think this works, but it <Col N="2152" /> incorporates a principle that we in Fine Gael agree with.  We think &mdash; we know &mdash; there should be proper accountability for every round of public money whether collected by means of taxes, borrowed or selling lottery tickets, and there should be an independent input into the decisionmaking process.</P>
      <P>We have our proposals and it is worth while outlining them briefly.  The lottery has been such a success and the amount of money so far ahead of what we had originally estimated that there is scope now for extending the areas in which the money should be used.  For example, as well as for youth and sport, arts, culture, the Irish language, health and special projects which we brought in by legislation when we set up the national lottery, we would like the money to be used also in assistance to organisations catering for the physically and mentally handicapped, a task force for the elderly and provision of educational equipment for primary and second level schools to cater particularly for teaching of language skills.  We would like it to be used for grants for the provision of amenities to promote tourism in the private and public sectors. As the money gets bigger and the amounts reach the proportions I have described and as we extend the areas of activity, the case for accountability and an independent process in arriving at the decision becomes unanswerable, and the Government should move to do that. When it comes to the distribution of the lottery funds, Fine Gael believe the Government should regularly review the proportions of available funds to be allocated to each of the areas specified in the original Bill.  In addition they should allocate a proportion of the available funds to a reserve to finance special projects and needs such as contributions to disaster relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How would you work it?  Funds for the arts and culture area should be allocated by the Arts Council who are there, independent. You do not need a High Court judge and another board of trustees.  Let the Arts Council do it, but do not override the decision of the Arts Council as was done recently by the Taoiseach.  If <Col N="2153" /> you set up an independent body, as long as they are acting properly let them make the decisions.  Of course the responsible Minister would have to authorise it, but he would authorise it like we all authorise things decided by independent groups, by rubber stamping decisions and not altering them.  Funds intended for the Irish language should be allocated by Bord na Gaeilge, again subject to the approval of the Minister for the Gaeltacht but subject to his approval only in accountancy fashion.  He should not be making the decisions.  The board should examine the projects, make the decisions, put them to the Minister; then we would have the strong independent element I am talking about.  Funds for the promotion of amenities in tourism should be allocated by Bord Fáilte.  Funds in the youth and sport area should be allocated by an independent board also. We do not think COSPÓIR are properly structured to fulfil this role.  We would abolish COSPÓIR and set up a new sports and recreation council, but we would not duplicate the quangos.  We would replace one with the other.</P>
    <P>We have independent bodies already and if we had proper accountability to this House and the input by the independent bodies which we already have then we would not have the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, being so upset by allegations made in this House about the disbursement of funds in his constituency because the decisions in effect would have been made by independent groups and the Minister would not be personally involved in choosing one project over another in a way which leaves him open to these kinds of charges.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am sharing my time with Deputy Deenihan and I propose to allow him in very shortly.  That is why we are not supporting the chapter and verse of the Progressive Democrats Bill.  That is why we would much prefer if the Progressive Democrats had allowed us all to keep our independent policy positions and united on a motion which deplored the activity of the Government which is turning the disbursement of the lottery funds into the national scandal it is now.  In the absence of that agreement we are quite prepared, for the sake of registering the protest and ensuring that our views on accountability and independence as regards lottery funds are on the record of the House, by word and by vote to vote for the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I would like to make is on a different issue.  It seems now that there is such a concentration on the manner in which the funds are being disbursed that the quality of decisions made, whether they are accountable or not, are not being brought under the spotlight at <Col N="2155" /> all.  A national lottery should result in projects around the country in which people would have a national pride.  No matter how meritorious local groups are, how good the local GAA club are or how necessary it is to put an extension on a community hall, there is not the feeling of national pride one gets by having the big project.  We need a Madison Square Garden in this city of which all the people of the country could be proud.  We need it bigger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The allocation in this year's Estimates is £93 million, £60 million on the <Col N="2157" /> current side and £33 million on the capital side.  In the Estimates for 1989 that is dramatically reduced, with £40 million on th current side and £15 million on the capital side.  What was £93 million last year is £55 million in 1989.  The Minister can check the figures.  I am sure he is familiar with his own Book of Estimates. There seems to be confusion over on the other side.  The explanation is that there were two years rolled into one last year, but it is a major reduction.  I know the other lottery is increasing its market share.  What the Minister is doing is leading to a process which is disabling the national lottery.  Eventually he will not have the funds for the major projects he is longfingering because he is nursing constituency interests.  I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>As a former PE teacher and a sportsman and as somebody who promoted the idea of a national lottery since I came into politics I must say I am rather disappointed at the manner in which the proceeds were generally distributed. I admit that much good has resulted from the lottery already, but some practices will have to be eliminated to bring back confidence in the whole thrust of the National Lottery Bill which was originally introduced by Deputy Donal Creed.  But for his foresight we would not be here tonight speaking about a national lottery.  He must find it galling to see what is happening at the moment when he had the true interests of sport at heart, when he sees how politicised the whole thing has become.  I am disgusted with what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be a begrudger, but as somebody with a love for sport and a general interest in it, I am not happy with what is happening.  As party spokesman on youth and sport I will be doing my best to bring forward a five-year policy on sport.  I mentioned in the Seanad four or five years ago some of the things mentioned by the Minister <Col N="2158" /> tonight, and I congratulate him on bringing forward those proposals.  They are going in the right direction, but we need a five-year sports policy here so that we can say we expect to have spent so much on, say, a national stadium, be it indoors or out.</P>
    <P>In the short time I have I want to point out that unless we have people who know how to use the facilities we are going no where.  The emphasis is on the building of plant.  There is not enough emphasis on the provision of proper administrative staff or on training people to coach people in the use and running of these facilities.</P>
    <P>The level of physical education has been run down in our schools.  At the Millennium conference the Government spokesman on sport accused the Department of Education of running down physical education here.  This was quoted in an article in the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>

In our secondary schools 60 per cent of students at senior level are not now doing physical education.  That is a national scandal. Here we are providing facilities and looking for results in the Olympics, yet we are not providing the basic training and education for these people.  Instead of running around the country and trying to be popular and providing facilities everywhere, why do we not start at the kernel of our problem, why do we not start in the schools and ensure that there is a proper physical education curriculum implemented?  If we are serious about putting sport on the agenda we should start there.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware from this year's Book of Revised Estimates that the national lottery is assisting five capital projects being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  The lottery assistance amounts to £1.8 million and the largest single element is the allocation of £1 million to the stonework restoration project currently in progress at the Custom House.</P>
      <P>The Custom House is considered by many to be the most important building erected in Dublin in the 18th century. The masterpiece of James Gandon, it was built between 1781 and 1791 at a cost of £250,000.  The location of the Customs House exposes it to both urban and marine pollution and, in its history, it has survived two major fires.  The first fire which occurred in 1789 delayed completion of the building and the second fire in 1921 burned for days and devastated the building.  Temperatures were such as to melt bronze and powder limestone and the cracking of stonework, following cooling, continued for months.  The complex nature and extent of damage caused is only fully understood now &mdash; almost 70 years later.  If Deputy Noonan wanted some place in which we could have national pride all he has to do is go down and examine the Custom House and the work that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy of the work now being aided by the national lottery has been established as one of the conservation and repair, rather than restoration and replacement.  Establishing both the location and extent of ferrous metal in the structure was of prime importance <Col N="2160" /> and non-destructive techniques, including ultrasonics and radiography, were employed.  The contractors on this project have on site a team of highly skilled masons and stone carvers and cleaning processes have been developed to achieve the gentlest possible cleaning.  The work is due to be completed in 1991.</P>
    <P>The restoration work at Kilmainham Jail is receiving lottery assistance of £0.2 million this year.  Part of this money is being spent restoring the infirmary to provide a proper administrative centre for the jail, repointing of the facade, paving with granite sets and slabs, repair of metal balconies, ceilings and window bars and general improvements to the main entrance area.  The lottery money has also assisted with the cost of adapting the chapel for use as an audio visual theatre.</P>
    <P>The national lottery is also providing £0.2 million this year for landscaping and other site works at the magnificently restored Casino at Marino.  The area inside the compound has been cleared of rubble, rotovated and grassed, while an area of eight metres around the building has been prepared for paving.  In the general park area mounds have been moved to new positions and planting of shrubs on them will commence shortly.  Following planting, topsoil will be laid before grassing commences.  Railings will be erected on the north side of the area.</P>
    <P>The fourth project being assisted this year by the lottery is the Holy Trinity Church in Dublin Castle.  This building, in the Gothic style, was designed by Francis Johnson and was first used on Christmas Day, 1814.  Among its most notable features are the 100 stone heads carved by Irish craftsmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I record my disappointment that the Minister has not bothered to attend.  There is an old saying that law does not always equate to justice. Therefore, it is the duty of politicians to continually reform our laws, regulations, State schemes and Government imposed rules so as to ensure, as far as possible, that they equate with justice, equity and fair play.  Where our social customs and traditions change, or where outrageous anomalies show up, there is all the more reason for reform. A particular case in point is the local government officers' widows and orphans contributory pension scheme as extended to female local authority and health board employees in 1984.  There is no provision in that scheme whereby a person who joined the scheme may opt out or whereby a spouse's pension may be paid to any person other than that spouse.  What happens in the event of desertion, legal separation, judicial separation, annulment or any of the consequences of marital breakdown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is increasing evidence, if only from the figures in the social welfare booklet on deserted wife's allowances, of marital breakdown in our society.  At the very minimum, apart from the question of divorce, that is divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> where remarriage rights are the issue, let us ensure that there is some element of fair play and equity in dealing with such problems where they arise.  I should like to give details of a case in point, that of a nurse who has a large family and who had been the main support of that family.  The income of her husband was rather irregular and tended to be spent on purposes other than maintaining and rearing that family.  When the scheme was offered to female employees of health boards in 1984 she was concerned at the position of her family in the <Col N="2163" /> event of her death and, accordingly, she opted to join the scheme.  She wanted to ensure that there would be some provision for her children in the event of her death.  The following year she was deserted by her husband who went to live with another woman.  There followed a legal separation and, thereafter, a church annulment.  Needless to say that large family have no support whatever from the departed spouse.  That woman is in the position that she has to continue making payment into that scheme, but for the benefit of whom?  It is for the benefit of the departed spouse.  In fact, she worked nights so that her earnings would be greater, so that she would be able to provide for her children, and now she is forced to pay almost £400 per annum into the scheme.  There is no provision for payment to any person other than the spouse.  These are not my words but the words of the Minister for the Environment in response to efforts I made to have the scheme changed.</P>
    <P>That person, who suffered a personal tragedy, is making an effort to ensure that her children are cared for and get good schooling &mdash; one of them is in third level education &mdash; but she has to continue to make those payments without there being any possibility of the pension being of any benefit to anybody other than the person who left her, and her family, high and dry.  She is not the only woman in that predicament and, because of the increasing trend of marriage breakdown here, we are likely to see more such instances.  That is why there is a duty on the Government to make the necessary changes to take into account such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House what that woman has done.  After she was deserted by her husband she explained her position to the health board and indicated that she did not wish, obviously, to continue paying for the benefit of her departed spouse.  The health board advised her that their hands were tied and referred her to the Department of the Environment.  When I raised the issue with the Department I was told by the <Col N="2164" /> Minister, in 1987, that there was no provision in the scheme whereby a person who opted to join during the option period may opt out or whereby a pension may be paid to any person other than the spouse.</P>
    <P>I accepted that the scheme did not provide for such a case and that there was a need for a change.  In the course of a question in the House to the Minister for the Environment I asked him to consider changing the terms of the scheme.  In his reply the Minister said there were no provisions whereby the contribution requirements of an entitlement to a benefit may be cancelled in cases of marital separation.  Furthermore, he said his Department had no plans at present to initiate changes in that area.  When I raised the matter with him again I set out the basis on which I felt changes should be made.  I wanted him to take into account the question of marital breakdown. Again, there was a refusal.</P>
    <P>More recently, on behalf of that constituent, I raised the matter with the Ombudsman &mdash; I did that as a last resort &mdash; and I indicated to him that I saw in this case a major injustice.  I felt that the anomaly would apply to other people at present and would most certainly apply in the future, and I asked him to intervene. Unfortunately, the Ombudsman found himself precluded under the Act from examining complaints of this nature and, therefore, was unable to intervene.  We had already raised the matter with the health board and my constituent told me that she had also raised it with the Irish Nurses' Organisation.  I have raised it by way of parliamentary question and by way of correspondence with the Minister. It was also raised with the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that there is provision in the scheme in the event that she had been widowed and it seems that while her husband has not departed this world, he certainly has departed from the family household and at no time since so doing has he contributed one brass farthing for the support of the family.  The entire burden rests on her.</P>
    <P>I suggest, a Cheann Comhairle, that we cannot ignore, like the ostrich, the <Col N="2165" /> increasing extent of marital breakdown in our society.  I further suggest that where our laws, rules and regulations, procedures or schemes make no provision for the fall-out from marital breakdown they must be reformed and amended.  There is a clear duty on us, the Members of this House, to take the necessary steps to take account of the consequences of marital breakdown and to introduce the necessary changes of a practical nature to deal with it.  I am not talking about the issue of divorce with a right to re-marry, that issue was dealt with in a referendum a few years ago, but I am raising the practical consequences of marital breakdown and our clear duty as legislators to make the necessary changes and to introduce the necessary amendments in our laws, rules and regulations and schemes to take account of such circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have already had all-party agreement on my colleague, Deputy Shatter's Bill on judicial separation.  I was glad to see a consensus emerging in this House on the principle of that Bill.  I accept there were some minor difficulties on Committee Stage but the broad principle was accepted and that is the way difficulties of this kind should be attended to.</P>
    <P>Tonight I have raised what I believe to be an outrageous case of injustice.  The lady in question has difficulty enough in ensuring that funding is available to cater for the needs of her large family without having to pay into this scheme.  Justice demands that the scheme be amended for cases of this kind.  There is no use in pretending that in our society there does not exist a growing number of cases of desertion and marital breakdown, which in many instances are ending in legal or judicial separations.</P>
    <P>I had intended appealing to the Minister for the Environment, but since he has not bothered to show up, there is no point in appealing to him.  However, I see that the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Gallagher is here.  I know the Minister to be a family man who would understand fully the situation I have described.  I appeal to the Government, through the Minister of State, to make the necessary <Col N="2166" /> changes to ensure that amendments are made to the scheme so that the outrageous consequences of marital breakdown that I have described will not occur in future.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Officers (Widows and Orphans Contributory Pension) Scheme, 1984 which applies to health board nurses is a statutory scheme and is in line with similar schemes operating throughout the public sector generally.  The scheme provides for the grant of a pension to the spouse and children of a deceased member or former member of the scheme.  These are the only persons who can obtain benefit under the scheme. There are no provisions whereby this entitlement may be cancelled or transferred. Neither are there any provisions whereby a person who joined the scheme may opt out of it at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The scheme was originally introduced for male officers on a non-statutory basis in 1968.  Following negotiations with staff interests membership was extended to female officers in 1984.  Existing female pensionable officers were given an option to join the scheme and I understand that the nurse in question exercised this option within the option period which, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, was between January and September 1984.</P>
      <P>The scheme is structured on an actuarial basis to cover certain risks and on certain assumptions, for example, life expectancy, that the payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members, and that a person may not opt out of membership at a later date.  The combination of these factors ensure the operation of a relatively low contribution rate, 1½ per cent by the member and 1½ per cent by the employer.  Proposals to change the existing structure could have financial implications for the viability of the scheme and could lead to a higher contribution rate following an actuarial reevaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above considerations it should be noted that any proposal to <Col N="2167" /> amend the scheme would require the consent of the Minister for Finance who is responsible for public sector pension schemes generally.  This could not be considered in isolation and would have to be dealt with in the context of all similar schemes operating in the public sector. As I have already indicated, the scheme was extended to female officers following negotiations with staff interests.  There are no current proposals from the relevant <Col N="2168" /> unions and staff associations to amend the scheme.</P>

      <P>However, there are instances where pupils cannot be accommodated on one of the existing services.  In these circumstances the Department may offer a transport grant up to a maximum of £600. The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the attendance of the pupil concerned.  The grant, if accepted, is paid in arrears.</P>

      <P>The average cost per pupil in primary schools was £270 in 1979 and £755 in 1987.  Allowing for inflation as shown in the consumer price index, the 1979 costs would have increased to £610 by 1987.  Spending on a <i>per capita</i> basis, therefore, increased over and above the level of inflation for the period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the authorised allocation of teaching posts to the girls' comprehensive school, Ballymun, for the 1988-89 school-year, my Department had regard to the needs of the school, to the resources available for education and other public services, and to the Government decisions relating to the adjustments to be effected in the staffing of community and comprehensive schools by the application of a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 as from the commencement of the <Col N="1943" /> 1988-89 session.  Regard was also had to the deliberations of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> concerning the implications of the decision to revise the pupil-teacher ratio as from the commencement of the 1988-89 session.</P>
    <P>Because of the particular circumstances of Ballymun girls' comprehensive school, a post was sanctioned under the provision for disadvantaged areas over and above the number of posts warranted by the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>The board of management of the school made an appeal against the initial teacher allocation on a number of grounds; an increased allocation has recently been authorised and the board of management has been advised accordingly.</P>

    <P>The staffing arrangements in the school in question in the current year have been determined in accordance with the agreement between the Government and the INTO, worked out under the auspices of the Central Review Committee for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.

    <P>My Department are not in a position at present to include any further schools in the special scheme of additional teaching assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas, but the application of this school will be considered, along with the very many other applications received, when resources permit the allocation of additional posts under this scheme.</P>

Grants are made under this heading by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the advice of the Cultural Relations Committee and go towards the promotion of Irish cultural and artistic events, lecture tours, etc. abroad.</P>
      <P>Applications for such grants may be received from groups and individuals anywhere in Ireland and in many cases are not readily identifiable with a particular geographic location.  Furthermore, most of the funds granted are of their nature expended either abroad or on travel abroad.  Identification of expenditure by particular regions would not, therefore, be particularly meaningful.</P>

      <P>An official delegation is currently attending the Fifth Session of the Ireland-Iraqi Joint Commission, which is taking place in Baghdad from 7 to 10 November.  The delegation is being led by Mr. Séamus Brennan TD, Minister for Trade and Marketing, and Chairman of the Joint Commission.  The Vice-Chairman is Mr. John Swift, Assistant Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The delegation comprises, in addition, officials representing the following Departments and semi-State bodies: Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Industry and Commerce, Department of Agriculture and Food, Department of Energy, Córas Tráchtála, Córas Beostoic agus Feola, PARC, Electricity Supply Board, Irish National Petroleum <Col N="1970" /> Corporation and the Irish Embassy in Baghdad.</P>
      <P>As the Joint Commission proceedings are still in progress, I am not in a position to give detailed information on the meetings which are taking place.  It is expected, however, that, in addition to the formal sessions of the Joint Commission, the Head of Delegation will meet several members of the Government of Iraq, including the Minister for Trade and Communications, Mr. Hamza, who is Co-Chairman of the Joint Commission, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health.  At the same time as the meetings which are being held within the framework of the Joint Commission, a number of Irish companies will be participating in the Baghdad International Fair.  This year, the Irish participation, which is being co-ordinated by Córas Tráchtála, comprises 21 companies, 12 of whom are directly represented.  The Minister for Trade and Marketing attended this morning a ceremony for the raising of the Irish flag at the international fair.</P>
      <P>It is not the normal practice for individuals who are not members of the official delegation to the Joint Commission to attend its proceedings, nor is it envisaged that there will be any departure from this practice on this occasion.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that, as a result both of the Joint Commission and of the Irish participation in the International Trade Fair, there will be a significant increase in the value of Ireland's earnings in Iraq next year.</P>

    <P>The Government are committed to fighting tax evasion.  The incentive to <Col N="1972" /> clear arrears of tax and the new assessment procedures for self-employed taxpayers will greatly improve the effectiveness of the tax assessment and collection system.  As a result it is anticipated that resources previously utilised in the arduous task of examining and agreeing tax liabilities will be more generally available to intensifying the battle against tax evasion.  The focus of attention is moving away from the complaint taxpayer and resources are now being redirected in an intensified effort to tackle evasion.  This new approach will augment the existing anti-evasion work of the Revenue which involves both investigative work and the use of statutory provisions to deter evasion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 to 94 together.</P>
      <P>As I announced on 8 October after the expiry of the tax amnesty deadline, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that the gross receipts from the amnesty and related measures were of the order of £500 million.  The eventual impact of these factors on the budgetary outturn for the year as a whole will not be clear for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage it is not possible to say definitively how many persons availed of the scheme.  However, some measure of the success of the scheme can be gauged <Col N="1975" /> from the fact that Revenue responded to more than 170,000 inquiries in relation to it.  In addition, something in the order of 150,000 payments were either personally delivered or mailed to the Revenue in the final week before the expiry of the scheme.</P>
    <P>A detailed analysis of the receipts, and of amount still outstanding, will not be available for some time.  The resources of the Revenue Commissioners have been committed in the first instance to the task of lodging the money for the benefit of the Exchequer.  This task has now been completed and Revenue staff are actively engaged in crediting the payments to taxpayers' accounts.  It has emerged, however, that some 80,000 of the payments were accompanied by inadequate directions as to how the money should be credited.  Revenue will have to clarify details of these payments.  All available resources have been drafted in to expedite this work.  Only when this work is completed will firm figures be available as regards the amount paid under the amnesty, the specific taxes, contributions and levies to which the payments relate, the extent to which people availing of the amnesty were not previously on Revenue records, and the amount of interest and penalties waived under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to be in a position to provide these particulars by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>All higher officers of Customs and Excise &mdash; irrespective of age &mdash; have been eligible for the voluntary redundancy scheme as there is a surplus of staff in that particular grade.  In addition all staff aged 50 and over have been eligible to apply for the voluntary early retirement scheme although the Revenue Commissioners have the right to refuse any applications where it would be in the public interest to do so.</P>
      <P>The Government have now decided that the early retirement terms which are on general offer to all personnel aged 50 and over will not apply in 1989.  The voluntary redundancy scheme will continue to be available in 1989 to staff whose posts have been identified as surplus tò requirements and who would not have to be replaced.</P>
      <P>Apart from higher officers of Customs and Excise, no other grades have been identified in the Revenue Commissioners as being surplus to requirements and consequently it is not intended to offer the voluntary redundancy terms to any other Revenue grades.</P>

      <P>This is a perennial request which successive Ministers for Finance have had to reject over the years.  The removal of VAT from hurleys is not permissible under the provisions of EC VAT law by which we are bound.  Even if it were allowed, considerations of equity in regard to other sports and their participants would militate against such a course of action.

      <Col N="1983" /> There is an ongoing review in my Department of the area of law dealing with gaming and lotteries.  However, as I have said on a number of occasions in the House, I could not indicate by way of a reply to a Dáil Question what specific legislative proposals I might have in a particular area.  Any proposals I may have will be announced in the ordinary way in due course following Government approval.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the recent appointment by the Government of 19 superintendents, the Garda authorities are at present making arrangements for the filling of vacancies for superintendents at a number of centres, including Dungarvan. It is expected that the vacancy at Dungarvan will be filled within a few weeks.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are also making arrangements to hold, in the very near future, a competition for promotions to the rank of chief superintendent and it is proposed to fill the vacancy for chief superintendent of the Waterford/Kilkenny Garda Division as soon as new appointments to the rank are made by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or standard period for the filling of vacancies for superintendents and chief superintendents. In filling these vacancies <Col N="1984" /> regard must be had to factors such as the general restrictions on the filling of vacancies in the Garda Síochána and the availability of candidates from promotion competitions.</P>

      <P>On 18 July 1988 an offender &mdash; who had been on two escorted outings previously which had not given rise to difficulty &mdash; was brought to visit his father's home under escort by two members of the prison service. During the course of the visit the offender managed to run from the house and evaded attempts by the prison staff to apprehend him.  Later that day the offender was apprehended by gardaí and subsequently returned to prison where he was dealt with under prison disciplinary regulations.</P>
      <P>It is not the invariable practice to use handcuffs where prisoners are involved in outside visits and the use or non-use of handcuffs falls to be determined in the light of all the circumstances obtaining in relation to a particular escort.  I would not consider it appropriate to detail the considerations which led to the use or non-use of handcuffs in a particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The importation of calves from other member states of the European Community is governed by the provisions of Directive 64/432/EEC under which Ireland imposes a quarantine requirement for bovine animals imported from those states which vaccinate against foot and mouth disease (FMD).  Denmark and Great Britain (apart from Ireland) are the only member states <Col N="1995" /> which do not so vaccinate and consequently direct importation, without quarantine, is possible only from those two countries subject to certain prescribed veterinary requirements.</P>
      <P>In the case of imports from non-EC countries, the requirements are specific to the animal disease situation in each country and in general include a quarantine requirement because of the risk of introducing exotic diseases.</P>
      <P>In the light of the scarcity of calves here, I decided last spring to relax the conditions for importation from Great Britain and Denmark by eliminating some of the pre-export veterinary requirement provided the calves had not moved from the herd of origin since birth and had not been exposed at a public sale.  No calves have been imported so far this year under these conditions, but I understand that some small consignments may be due to arrive shortly. Allegations that calves have been smuggled in from Great Britain, mainly via Northern Ireland, have been investigated by the authorities both here and in Northern Ireland and have not been substantiated.</P>
      <P>The present conditions governing calf imports are designed to safeguard the high animal health status of our national herd and I do not propose to put that status at risk by changing them.</P>

Initial inquiries were made at his old address and the details obtained there proved to be incorrect.  As a result, a delay occurred in finalising inquiries in the case.  The matter has now been resolved, however, and the person concerned has been awarded a living alone allowance with effect from 22 July 1988, the same date from which he qualified for an old age contributory pension.

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of invalidity pension.  He lives with his wife who is in receipt of disability benefit which is not a qualifying payment for the receipt of the fuel allowance.  His wife, therefore, as she is in receipt of disability benefit in her own right, is not his dependant for the purposes of the fuel scheme and his application for an allowance under that scheme had to be refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experiened by a limited number of jarveys in the Killarney area with regard to public liability insurance cover.</P>
      <P>As the Insurance Supervisory Authority, my primary responsibility is to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory reserves and solvency requirements and, as such, I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  No obligation can be placed by me on an insurer to quote in respect of a particular risk or to quote at a particular premium.  In 1987, the latest year for which full figures are available, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £18 million on their general liability business. Faced with such losses, insurers have had no option but to relate premiums to costs and to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An arrangement exists with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist where difficulties are experienced in obtaining public liability insurance.  In nearly all cases to date involving jarveys the <Col N="2004" /> insurance required has been obtained. Before a case can be referred to the federation it is necessary that at least half the market (including Lloyds) be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation.  It must be emphasised that no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in every case referred in this manner to the industry representative body.</P>

      <P>At present, the average delay in carrying out driving tests is 23 weeks. Driver testers are so deployed to test centres that the waiting period for a test is maintained as far as practicable at a uniform level throughout the country. The main reasons for the delays are the general constraints on the recruitment of public servants, retirements of driver testers, and the increased demand for tests in recent years.</P>
      <P>I have taken the following steps to reduce delays: first, six building inspectors have been redeployed to driver testing duties.  Arrangements are being made to redeploy further staff to increase the staff complement of driver testers from 50 to 58 as soon as possible.  Second, I introduced Saturday tests in addition to the normal Monday to Friday tests.  Third I have made regulations requiring applicants to give at least one weeks notice of cancellation of a driving test appointment instead of three days.  This has facilitated the reallocation of cancelled appointments.</P>

      <P>I am aware of some recent allegations that the condition of Lough Derravaragh has disimproved.  However, the most recent data available to me, which is contained in the An Foras Forbartha Report &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland &mdash; the Current Position&rdquo;, published in 1987, indicates that the condition of Lough Derravaragh improved since 1982 and that the lake was in a satisfactory condition at the time of the report.</P>
      <P>It is, however, a matter for Westmeath County Council, as pollution control authority for the area under the Water Pollution Act, 1977, to monitor the lake on a regular basis, to establish the extent of any problem which may exist at present, and to ensure that any necessary remedial measures are taken as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount of money which has been spent in 1987 and 1988 in the practice grant scheme which was introduced to encourage doctors to undertake expensive renovation and improvements to their clinics for the sake of the community; the amount which has been provided in the 1989 Estimates for this purpose; the number of doctors who are waiting for grants; and the amount which this involves as a total sum of money owed to doctors who undertook this work in good faith.</P>

      <P>The amount paid out by health boards to general practitioners participating in the GMS scheme, in respect of grants towards the cost of improvements etc., to practice premises was £35,683 in 1987 and £11,290 to date in 1988.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amount provided for this purpose in the 1989 Estimates for Health, at this time, my Department and the Department of Finance have agreed the 1989 Estimates under broad headings only.  It follows, therefore, that the 1989 allocations in respect of individual agencies have yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the Eastern Health Board are the only board with outstanding applications for such grants. The total amount claimed is £47,363, assuming that applicants were to qualify. The board's current financial position does not allow for payments to be made, at this time.  The number of general practitioners involved is approximately 21.</P>

      <P>The current agreement with general practitioners participating in the general medical services scheme provides for the payment of grants towards the cost of new practice premises or for the improvement or extension of existing premises, having had regard to some specific considerations.</P>
      <P>Such considerations include,</P>
      <P>(a)  the number of eligible persons on the practitioner's list;</P>
      <P>(b)  the extent and nature of the accommodation already available to him in his practice premises and</P>
      <P>(c)  the availability of alternative facilities for general practitioners under the control of the health board.</P>
      <P>I am given to understand by the relevant health board that the doctor in question applied for a grant in August 1986.  The premises was inspected by both the board's technical officer and the local director of community care and both were satisfied with the work carried out. These inspections were carried out after the work was completed.  Subsequently, the board in determining whether a grant was appropriate, had regard to the number of eligible persons on the doctor's list in accordance with the terms of the agreement, as outlined earlier. Having regard to the size of the doctor's list of eligible persons and the overall position regarding the board's available finances in this area, the board considered it inappropriate to pay a grant in this case at this point in time.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's schemes of assistance to youth and sport, annual grants are paid from national lottery funds to national or large regional voluntary youth organisations and to <Col N="2045" /> national voluntary sports organisations and in regard to this scheme it is not possible to furnish information along the lines sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of the national lottery are also used for a special fund for the development of special services to disadvantaged young people.  Grants from this fund are allocated to support local and national initiatives through national youth organisations, vocational education committees or other approved agencies.  In 1987 £89,000 was paid from this fund to the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee in support of youth activities in Waterford city but grants from this fund were not made to youth projects in County Waterford in 1987.  In 1988 £207,000 has been allocated from this fund to the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee in respect of youth projects in Waterford city and £20,000 has been allocated from this fund to the National Youth Federation towards the cost of initiatives to assist disadvantaged youth in County Waterford in 1988.  The only rejected application in 1988 from Waterford city and county for aid from the special fund for disadvantaged youth was that from the Dungarvan Social Action Group and no application from Waterford city and county is at present being processed.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department make national lottery resources available to vocational education committees to enable grants to be made to voluntary youth and sports clubs to assist towards administrative, training and equipment expenses, etc.  Under this scheme in 1987 £19,100 was paid to the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee and £10,900 was paid to the County Waterford Vocational Education Committee. The other information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department but is obtainable from the relevant vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>A grant of £2,000 has also been allocated to the City of Waterford VEC under a scheme for the provision of outdoor activities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds in Waterford city.</P>

      <Col N="2046" /> The provision of the information in the format requested by the Deputy in respect of my Department's capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities would involve an inordinate amount of time and I am not prepared to divert staff for this purpose.

      <P>The original brief for the proposed extension of Rathcoffey national school, County Kildare, envisaged the <Col N="2051" /> conversion of the existing classrooms into a general purposes area and the provision of four new classrooms.  Because of the pressure on the capital funds available to my Department for the national schools building programme, the scheme in that form could not be funded.  I have asked my Department to re-examine the scheme in terms of grant-aiding the provision of necessary teaching accommodation in the form of a number of basic classroom units to be provided in a first instalment of building.  When this approach has been assessed in architectural terms and costed, my Department will communicate further with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the present position regarding the provision of a sports hall at Scoil Mhuire community school, Clane, County Kildare; if her attention has been drawn to the needs for such a provision in this school which caters for almost 800 students; if approval has been given for similar projects in recent times; if she will urgently consider this request in the near future; if it is expected to meet this request within the context of the 1989 <Col N="2052" /> Estimates for her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to make sports hall facilities available in all post-primary schools including Clane community school.  However, the timing of their provision must have regard to capital availability and my Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>
      <P>My Department have before them at present a very large number of applications for second level school building projects involving the provision of urgently needed classroom accommodation and also a large number of applications for sports halls.</P>
      <P>The capital allocation to my Department is not adequate to meet all these demands and in that situation, the available financial resources must be reserved for the provision of essential classroom accommodation.  It is not possible for my Department, at present, to indicate when it might be in a position to approve the provision of a sports hall for Clane community school.</P>
      <P>In 1988 it was only possible to approve the provision of a limited number of sports halls for second level schools under the terms of the recreational facilities scheme.  The provision of sports halls will be reviewed in the context of the capital resources available for second level building projects in 1989.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.</P>
      <P>My Department are currently working to finalise the 1988-89 teacher allocation for Tipperary North Riding VEC in the light of the most up to date information supplied by the committee about teacher numbers and pupil enrolments.  Officials of my Department will shortly be meeting with the chief executive officer of the VEC to discuss the matter further.  It is hoped to issue the final allocation to the committee as soon as possible thereafter. Urgent consideration is also being given in the context of the teacher allocation to the status of the four teachers referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In late August tentative offers of redundancy were made in the case of five teachers in Tipperary North Riding based on information available at the time.  In the light of difficulties arising in relation to the allocation of teachers as outlined above, it has not been possible to confirm these offers.</P>
