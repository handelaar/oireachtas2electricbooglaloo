      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7 and 1.  It is further proposed that the debate on No. 7 shall not exceed 30 minutes and the following arrangements will apply: Speakers shall not exceed five minutes; the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach shall be called on to conclude the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On his return from the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference yesterday the Tánaiste said the next meeting of the conference in December would be devoted to Article 11 of the agreement, that is the review of the workings of the Conference and Secretariat. He also intimated a few weeks ago that he would not be adverse to a debate in this House on Northern Ireland.  Would he agree to have that debate on Northern Ireland and on the Anglo-Irish Agreement in this House before then because there is some contradiction between what the Tánaiste said when he returned from Belfast and what was contained in the communiqué.  I should like to tease that out.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect Deputy Barry has got it wrong.  What I said and what the meeting was devoted to almost entirely was the setting down of the parameters and methodology of the review process which is now beginning.  We were concerned at the meeting yesterday mainly to launch the review process which must begin at the latest on 15 November.  The early December meeting will be devoted primarily to the administration of justice and confidence measures associated with that whole area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has also been quoted as saying that the meeting of the conference is now being &ldquo;wrested&rdquo; from the officials, which the British Government want, to a meeting between the respective Governments.</P>

      <P>I am afraid this is a matter that may not be debated now. It is inappropriate that we should continue the debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Tánaiste whether, when that takes place, we can have a debate in this House on Northern Ireland and on a review of the conference working?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question I should say that what I want to see established quite clearly is what is written into Article 11 of the agreement, that it is a matter between the two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the communiqué said yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what the communiqué said yesterday, so that the respective Governments will have the ultimate responsibility of deciding the shape of the workings of the conference under the terms of the agreement for the future.  But I might add that there will be two legs under that: within the ambit of the conference officials on both sides &mdash; in committee and so on &mdash; will make their recommendations.  Outside that then, on the other tier or leg, there is scope for all interested parties, North and South, every party in this House, every party in Northern Ireland, including the two Unionist parties, to make their representations in whatever manner they wish to whichever Government they wish.  To come to the final point raised by Deputy Barry I should say that that does not preclude a debate in this House. Perhaps we can reflect on that matter and discuss it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek clarification of what the Tánaiste said.  I take it that he will now arrange for the Whips to discuss the holding of a debate in this House on Northern Ireland before the next meeting of the conference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we will consider it while the review process is under way.  I do not see why we should have it from conference to conference, that would be tying us too much.  The conference is part of the process that is going on now.  In fact more meetings of the conference were held in the past 12 months than were ever held before.  I am not making a point of that.  The point I am making is that we will have now a few months review period in which we will want the maximum amount of views expressed.  In my view that may include a debate here in this House.  That is a matter that the Whips may discuss.  But I would not have it on the basis of conference to conference or only just because the conference will meet in December.  The review process will continue for the next few months into the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Resolution of the Dáil of 18th May, 1988, in relation to the televising of Dáil proceedings and reform of Dáil procedure is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;within twelve months&rdquo; for &ldquo;within six months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to extend by a further six months the period by which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges must report back to the House with proposals for the televising of its proceedings, as well as submitting a more general programme of reform of Dáil procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have both tabled an amendment to the motion, which proposed that CPP be allowed only a further three months in which to submit their report.  The Government could not see their way to accept this amendment.  While all parties are in agreement that more time is needed to examine this important matter, we cannot agree with the other parties that an additional three months provides sufficient time to carry out a thorough examination of all the issues involved and produce a report which will meet our particular needs.</P>
    <P>The working group established by CPP have been requested to examine a whole range of matters:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the televising of Dáil proceedings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the permanence of sound broadcasting of the Dáil;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the question of privilege; in particular, how it should be applied to Committee proceedings; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;proposals for a more general programme of reform of Dáil procedures, including limitations on the length of speeches, procedures for dealing with urgent matters and the relevance and admissability of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>Any one of these issues &mdash; except possibly sound broadcasting &mdash; would in itself be sufficient to require lengthy and considered examination by the working group.  However, the group have been asked to prepare a report on all of these issues.  It should be borne in mind that if all the proposals which I have just outlined were to be adopted by the House, it would result in substantial amendment to Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that 12 months is the minimum period required for a proper examination of this matter and strongly urges Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats to reconsider their stance.</P>
    <P>For their part, the working group have already carried out some work in this <Col N="1680" /> area.  Material on how parliamentary broadcasting operates in other countries has been obtained from our diplomatic missions abroad and this will have to be examined in some depth by the group.  In addition, the group have visited both the European Parliament in Strasbourg and the House of Lords in London.  As these institutions were in recess until just a few weeks ago, it has only been possible to arrange these visits recently.</P>
    <P>I may say that these visits were well worthwhile.  Following them, there is a need to evaluate and assess fully the arrangements which both these institutions have in place for the satisfactory televising of their proceedings.  These arrangements, in many ways, are different from what we might envisage for our purposes.  For example, the procedures of the European Parliament are much less rigid than those of the House of Lords.  Nevertheless, there is much to be learned from a careful and thorough study of how these institutions have adapted their workings to the televising of their proceedings.  Indeed, there may even be a case for looking at the arrangements in some of our sister parliaments in the European Communities.  To properly co-ordinate and assess all of this data will take time.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect of this matter to which I wish to refer.  This relates to the broadcasting authority who are to be responsible for providing T.V. coverage.  RTE have been asked to submit proposals on how they would provide this coverage.  I understand it will be some time before they will be in a position to do so.  I fully understand their position in this matter.  They wish to submit a report which they can stand over and which will deal fully with all the issues involved.  The other side of the coin is that the CPP must have adequate time to assess their proposals and possibly proposals from other interests as well, both technical and programme making.</P>
    <P>There are other important matters to be addressed.  These include the necessary changes in Standing Orders, the question of privilege, the extent and manner of coverage, the balance to be <Col N="1681" /> achieved and, of course, which broadcasting authority is to obtain the franchise to transmit the proceedings.  I have already briefly outlined progress in the technical aspect &mdash; cameras, lighting, structural alterations to the Chamber. Finally, there is the major question of financing these arrangements in a time of financial stringency.</P>
    <P>Let me say that it took some three years from the time it was first mooted to get sound broadcasting of this House on air.  In the light of this and in the light of other considerations I have outlined, I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally it was proposed that we would have a report on this within three months.  The Government in the debate when this motion was being put forward suggested that this be extended to six months.  The House agreed to six months and now the Government are coming back looking for a further six months.  In my view there was a considerable delay in getting the original sub-committee, who have now got into their stride, established and that delay is the main reason we are now being asked for a further extension of time.  I feel that the case made by the Minister for an extension is not unreasonable and our party are prepared to go along with the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we would ask that the arrangements that are being made to deal with this very complex range of issues be improved.  At the moment the entire list of issues which the Minister mentioned early in his speech are all being dealt with by one committee with one secretary and the committee consists of four Whips of the parties in the House.  Those people serving on the committee have many other responsibilities and they have essentially one person acting as a secretariat for them.  To my mind we need to have technical committees in support of this body.  When the broadcasting of the Dáil was introduced a committee of officials were established who represented RTE, the Department of the Taoiseach's office and the office of the then Leader of the House, and they did <Col N="1682" /> a good deal of technical work so that when the politicians came to consider it the work was done and simple political decisions had to be taken.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, now all the work that is essentially being asked to be done, including the work that would normally be the problems of officials, is being done by a committee of politicans.  Given the list of matters that have to be considered, I suggest that in regard to the television broadcasting of the Dáil a technical committee be set up consisting of representatives of the Dáil or the services which are the responsibility of the Ceann Comhairle, the Department of Communications from the broadcasting aspect and the Department of the Taoiseach from the governmental aspect. There should be a technical committee who would feed information to and act on requests from the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the issue of privilege on its own is such a major subject that there should be a separate technical committee dealing with that.  I suggest that in that case the composition might be the parliamentary draftsman's office, the office of the Department of the Taoiseach and the office of Dáil Éireann, who would prepare a separate report on the privilege issue.  Also, the more general issue of Dáil reform needs to be looked at again separately, and I feel that the services of the House should be asked to provide a secretarial service to prepare material on that independently of the work that has to be done by the secretary of the sub-committee dealing with broadcasting, otherwise the work simply will not be done.</P>
    <P>I have been told by the Minister of State that it is his intention that we would come to a conclusion on this matter and present arrangements for the permanent televising of the Dáil, that we will not come up with a report which would say there should be an experimental period but with a report which would make definite and final arrangements.  That being the case, there obviously is a greater argument for taking enough time <Col N="1683" /> to make sure everything is done properly, whereas if you have an experimental period you could afford perhaps to press the speed a bit more because you know you could remedy your mistakes up to the end of the experimental period.</P>
    <P>That being the case, our party are prepared to accept the further extension of six months, but I fear that unless arrangements are made to get the work done at official level so that the politicans can have the material upon which to make the decisions, the Minister, or whoever is on that side of the House, will be coming back in six months time looking for a further extension if the work is not done. That means getting officials together, perhaps in the sort of working groups that I suggest, as was done in the case of sound broadcasting.  Television broadcasting raises even more complex issues.  Therefore there is even a greater case for having a committee of officials supplementing the work that is being done. I hope that this further discussion here in the House will give an impetus to the work that has commenced quite well.  It needs such an impetus and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to some of the suggestions I have made as to how that impetus might be translated into reality.</P>

      <P>As one who has not expressed views on the Floor of the House about the televising of Dáil proceedings up to now, I would like first to say that I support wholeheartedly that the Dáil proceedings should be televised, and so do my party, the Progressive Democrats.  This Dáil has approved, in principle, such televising.  This decision represented an all-party approach and I hope we can maintain that momentum because we who have visited other parliaments have seen the difficulties experienced where there has been division in <Col N="1684" /> opinion about whether the proceedings should be televised.</P>
      <P>This matter has been around for a number of years and it has caught the public imagination, quite rightly, because many people, are quite ignorant and in a state of wonder about what in fact goes on in the Dáil during the time that we meet.  One of the benefits to be got from televising the proceedings is simply giving knowledge to those people in the community who have an interest in politics, and it could be acknowledged that there are many people in Ireland who have that interest.</P>
      <P>However, there has been a reluctance to move over the last couple of years even though the proposal has been around for some time.  I fully acknowledge that at this stage an initiative has been taken, some visits have been made to two parliaments, and on-the-ground examination of how the procedure works has actually been undertaken.  We in the Dáil are one of the last parliaments in western Europe, if not in the world, to remain untelevised, so speed is necessary at this stage in order that we maintain some kind of par with our fellow parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the Minister's statement here today.  It certainly sets out the difficulties facing the group who are examining this issue, but nowhere can I find a wholehearted commitment to broadcasting the Dáil proceedings on television, and nowhere can I see a firm commitment to timescale.  It is worth nothing that on page 3 of his script the Minister says that the Government believe that 12 months is the minimum period required.  The fact that the minimum period is underlined is quite disturbing because our party have put forward an amendment that we should only take another three months before we report to the Dáil.  We are willing to reconsider that in the light of a real commitment to moving within six months, but if I and my party felt that the Government were going to renege on that, that they were not fully committed to televising Dáil proceedings, we would have to reconsider, and I would ask the Minister to address that when he replies <Col N="1685" /> to the debate.  I know that the Minister has certainly been supportive of the idea since the initiative got underway, by visiting other parliaments and examining the evidence and so on, so I would hope that he can give a reassurance on that.</P>
    <P>Definitely, technical expertise is needed.  We have seen that.  It would be foolish of politicians to try to enter into this area without technical expertise.  Perhaps we do not need to have a technical committee, but certainly proper advice must be given to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The procedures in the Dáil are, anyway, in need of revamping, in need of reform.  The vast majority of us acknowledge that.  This is an ideal opportunity to examine that also.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that the shortened debate we have today is quite disturbing and it is something that should be mentioned.  We were allocated an hour on the Order of Business that was circulated for this debate.  A great many Deputies have an interest in speaking or in hearing a full report on what has happened so far.  We now find that five minutes per speaker is allowed up to a maximum of half an hour.  That simply is not good enough.  Once more it makes me wonder about the commitment of this Government to televising the Dáil proceedings and to having a full and frank discussion about the issues involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago this House made a decision in principle and, rather uniquely in European parliaments or perhaps in parliaments anywhere, it was a unanimous decision to televise our proceedings.  That was a very useful initiative and a very important debate. The decision then went to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who set up a working group consisting of the four <Col N="1686" /> Whips to investigate the technicalities of it.  There was feeling that the work could be carried out in the six months allocated to the committee for carrying out this task.  When the committee began their work I certainly was unaware of the full implications of the procedures we had embarked on.</P>
      <P>The fundamental principle of televising is one of crucial importance if we are to maintain any semblance of relevance to the majority of people.  I am strongly of the opinion that the issue of democracy itself is included in the issue of televising the proceedings of the Dáil because a lot of people are bewildered by what goes on in these houses.  Nothing will improve the archaic procedures here more than putting them under the scrutiny of the general public.  The way to do that is to put them under the full glare of the television cameras so that what goes on here can be visible in every home in the land.  The Labour Party strongly supported the principle of televising our proceedings because, increasingly, the perception is that this House is irrelevant, that decisions are being made in ivory towers and that we go through the charade of debates and the charade of opposing and the charade of scoring points here, and that none of it has any real relevance to the lives and problems of ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee have so far had the privilege of looking at two very different parliaments.  In Strasbourg there was very easy access but difficulties because there was no fixed parliament in terms of a fixed building as parliament sits in more than one location.  The situation in the House of Lords, in contrast, had very rigid rules and traditions to be adhered to.  We have learned a lot about the difficulties of introducing television into the Dáil from those two visits.  There are important principles to be considered, the principle of control, of impartiality, of who makes the decisions, of who controls the tapes, of the compilation of the archives and the releasing of material from those archives.  We must also consider the question of privilege and rebroadcasting.  Many of those issues may <Col N="1687" /> require separate legislation before we make a final decision.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Labour Party is that we favour televising at the earliest possible date but, in a very measured way.  We must not rush into this matter. We must prepare a proper plan.  Whether we commence televising in three months or six months time is a point of secondary importance.  What is more important is that we do it correctly because it is the intention of the Minister of State, as he indicated to the group, that we will not have an interim period of testing.  When a final decision is made the equipment will be installed in the House.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State to comment on other aspects related to the televised proceedings of the House.  The first relates to technical back-up and support which was raised by Deputy John Bruton.  We have been barraged with technical information we are not competent to assess.  That information relates to the types of cameras, lighting levels, controls and monitoring but we cannot evaluate it.  It is interesting to note that other parliaments have techncial experts from the broadcasting media to support and advise them.  Some of them have been working in that area for many years.</P>

Their role in the television broadcasting of the proceedings will be important.  I should like to ask the Minister of State to clarify one crucial aspect of the matter, the question of finance.  If we are to try to televise the proceedings on the cheap, as some parliaments have, we will get the worst of all possible worlds.  If the Government are committed to televising the proceedings, there must be an equal commitment from them to provide adequate resources to do that job well.</P>

      <P>While the emphasis in the debate has been on televising the proceedings, the motion passed unanimously by the House also addressed the question of general reform of Standing Orders and the way the procedures of the House operate.  The two go together.  If we were to televise the proceedings without a reform of Standing Orders bewilderment would grow among the public rather than be reduced.  There is a lot of bewilderment among Members about the way procedures operate.  We got an example of that last night when Members spent the best part of one hour voting on one issue in Private Members' Time.  In my view that was a waste of time and we should try to reduce the amount of time taken for multiple votes.  I accept that the CPP have looked at that issue and were unable to come up with a solution.  We must address that issue again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also consider the question of access of Members to Private Members' Time and the right of Members to propose and have printed Private Members' Bills.  It is deplorable and unacceptable that any Member can be prevented by the Government from having printed and circulated, as we were last night, a Private Members' Bill.  We are constantly ridiculed for not taking an active part in the proceedings but when Members who go <Col N="1689" /> to the trouble of producing Bills are prevented from having them printed and circulated that is undermining the enthusiasm of those Members for such work.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the question of access to debates.  There is a growing tendency since the Government took office to restrict access of The Workers' Party Members to specific debates.  I am thinking in particular of the debate on the Estimates.  That should be stopped.  I do not think the subcommittee will be in a position to carry out their work in the six months set down for them.  In my view the work will only be done effectively if more than one group is established to work in conjunction with each other.  I urge the Minister of State to have another look at this matter.  However, Members of the CPP should push for progress and an amending of the procedural arrangements of the House.  I hope we will not be back here in six month's time looking for a further extension.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Members who contributed to the debate on this motion. <Col N="1690" /> Deputy John Bruton has put forward all the reasons why the time limit should be extended by at least six months.  We all agree that there is a need to extend the time limit to produce a comprehensive report but we differ on the amount of time that should be given.  We all accept that it is vitally important that the CPP examine all aspects of this matter thoroughly.  There is no point in rushing a report and then finding that some of the more important aspects of the matter have been overlooked, resulting in Members having to go back to the drawing board.  That would cause further delay on the introduction of television cameras to the Chamber.</P>
      <P>Members will recall that the original motion, submitted by Deputies John Bruton and O'Brien in May, suggested that we should allocate three months for the investigation of this matter.  At the time we suggested that this should be 12 months and, following the debate, we reached a compromise and accepted a period of six months.  However, six months was too short and I regret that we have had to return to the House to seek a further extension.  In order to bring in a proper report for full discussion by the House it is vital that the subcommittee go into all aspects thoroughly. The subcommittee will have to investigate all the problems that exist.  During our visits to Strasbourg and the House of Lords we were told of the many difficulties they experienced.  We did not envisage such difficulties arising before those visits.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to ensuring that the televising of the proceedings of the House will take place at the earliest possible date.  We want to ensure that the rights of Members, and the dignity of the House, are fully respected.  When the proceedings are televised we want that done in a proper way.  Some questions were raised about the membership of the subcommittee and I am happy to look at that.  The subcommittee will be meeting this afternoon and in view of the comments made this morning we will review the issue and return to the CPP with some proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> I should like to assure the House that it is our intention to introduce television into our proceedings as quickly as possible. I have indicated that when the report is submitted to the CPP, and subsequently to the House, we should not opt for an experimental period.  It is proposed, therefore, that whatever system is introduced, will be introduced on a permanent basis, but of course with the right to review the matter on an ongoing basis by a committee of the House.</P>

I think this would be helpful in the light of the fact it is now envisaged that the report will recommend a permanent rather than an interim arrangement.</P>

    <Title>Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987    [Seanad]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I introduced this Bill in the Seanad, I suggested that it was the most radical overhaul of Irish commercial law in 25 years.  The level of interest in the Bill since that time has confirmed that this is the case &mdash; in fact, it has produced more public comment and debate than any other Bill that I, for one, have ever been involved in.</P>
      <P>Before the Bill was published, the Companies Act, 1963, was the cornerstone of our company law and, considering its size and scope, it is a tribute to those who drafted it that it has, by and large, stood the test of time.  In the last number of years, however, it has become obvious that up-dating was needed, to take account of the fact, not just that business itself had become more sophisticated, but that, sadly, there has been a certain decline in standards of commercial ethics.</P>
      <P>However, let me make one thing clear at this stage.  I am satisfied that we are not talking here of company law abuses on a grand scale &mdash; I am happy that the majority of people in commercial life still carry out their business affairs in a completely honest and responsible way, and have no intention of cheating their company, its creditors or indeed anyone else. What we are talking about is a minority of directors who abuse the law, their company and their creditors and shareholders in a way which cannot be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> Successive Governments, therefore, have commited themselves to amending the law to tackle, in the strongest possible way, the abuses which we all know about only too well, and I am pleased to be able to introduce to this House the fruits of our long labours in this respect.</P>
    <P>Limited liability is a privilege, not a right, bestowed by law on the creators of enterprise and should never be allowed to be used recklessly as a minority have done in recent years.  The main aim of the Bill is to encourage and protect enterprise, by discouraging the reckless and the dishonest from being involved with limited liability companies.  I cannot over-stress the fact that confidence in the integrity of the institutions and in the practice of commercial life is the foundation stone of all developed economic systems, no matter what their political or ideological flavour.  Certainly, it is basic to the free enterprise system and, if the public is to have confidence in such a system, we must constantly strive to eliminate, deter or punish malpractice.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must acknowledge that, with the best will in the world, companies will get into difficulties, or even fail completely at the end of the day.  My hope, therefore, is that the measures in this Bill will have a deterrent effect so that, faced with the choice of doing business unscrupulously on the one hand, or acting honestly and honourably on the other, they will choose the honest option as being in their better interest.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published in May 1987, I said that I was happy with the general thrust of it.  However, I also said that I wanted a balanced Bill, and one that would work, when enacted.  That being so, I issued a general invitation at that time to anyone with an interest in the subject matter to give us the benefit of their views on the detail.</P>
    <P>I can only say I was surprised by the response.  Since the Bill was published we have received over 70 submissions in the Department from interested parties. These came from every conceivable strand of the commercial spectrum &mdash; from business organisations and trade unions, from accountants and lawyers, <Col N="1694" /> from ordinary companies and individuals.</P>
    <P>Many of the submissions we got were extensive, wide-ranging and considerably detailed, and I want to place on record my gratitude to everyone who responded in this way.  I can assure them all that every suggestion they came up with was carefully considered, to see whether it could be accommodated in the Bill, or whether it would help to achieve its overall aims.  Obviously, we cannot include everything which came up in this process in the Bill &mdash; it has over 200 sections at this stage &mdash; but we have, nevertheless, carefully stored all the ideas and suggestions which arose, and it may well be that the opportunity will arise at some other time to make use of some more of them.</P>
    <P>I can say, though, that the comments we got were unanimous on one central point, and that was that the longer time goes by, the more urgently this legislation is needed.  I am sure the House will thoroughly agree with that sentiment.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as introduced in the Seanad, was considerably amended during its technical consideration in that House.  I said at that time that I had a very open mind on every section and would consider reasonable and practical amendments. Well over 200 amendments were made to it on Committee Stage, and many others on Report Stage, and this process included the adding of 18 new sections on Committee Stage.  The most notable overhauls were to Parts V and IX, dealing with insider dealing and company rescue, respectively, and I will comment in more detail on these changes later.  We also made many drafting and technical changes of a &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; nature, all with the aim of making for a more workable piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>As for the detail of the Bill, it would be impractical to try to cover all of this in a Second Stage speech, but I will try to summarise for the benefit of Deputies the general thrust of each part.</P>
    <P>Part I contains just the normal range of preliminary provisions found in most Bills, dealing with such matters as the coming into effect of the Bill, general definitions and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> Part II deals with various types of investigations into companies' affairs. This part of the Bill will replace sections 165 to 173 of the Companies Act, 1963, with much stronger and, we hope, more workable provisions.  An investigation into a company is a serious affair and while there have been relatively few of them since 1963, those that have taken place have not really produced worthwhile results.  The difficulties have mainly been ones of procedure and so on, and it has become clear that these now need to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The main change being made by Part II of the Bill is the removal of the role of appointing inspectors from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the High Court.  Our hope is that this will smooth the path of any future formal investigations which take place and that any procedural or legal problems which arise can be quickly and effectively settled.</P>
    <P>Part III deals mainly with personal transactions between a company and its directors.  The basic thrust of this Part is that a director should not use his company as his own personal bank.  To put it simply, if a director's credit is good, there are plenty of other sources from which he can borrow money; if he is effectively a credit risk, then his own company is the last place he should be going to to borrow.</P>
    <P>The most important provisions here are sections 31 and 32.  Subject to limited exceptions, these sections prohibit a company from making loans of over £2,500 to any of its directors or their families, or to other companies in which such persons have a controlling interest.  However, because experience elsewhere has shown that restrictions on straightforward &ldquo;loans&rdquo; can be avoided by using other more sophisticated arrangements, these sections also extend the general restrictions, in the case of public limited companies and large and medium-sized private companies, to what we call &ldquo;quasi-loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;credit transactions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Briefly, these are arrangements, for example a company credit card, whereby a third party pays a director's liability in <Col N="1696" /> a financial transaction, or provides him with goods or services on the understanding that the company will eventually pay the third party.  Finally, Part III also contains provisions to deal with other situations involving potential conflicts of interest on the part of directors, such as long term service agreements or contracts, substantial property transactions and so on.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains detailed provisions on the subject of disclosure of interests in shares.  Of the three chapters in this Part, Chapter 2 is, I think, the most significant.  The basic idea here is that the real owner of a given percentage of the share capital of a public limited company should disclose that fact to the company and that this information should be available freely to anyone who wants it.  The Bill sets the opening threshold for such disclosure at 5 per cent, but allows the Minister to vary the figure by order.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 of Part IV, on the other hand, applies to all companies, and merely strengthens existing provisions in the 1963 Act.  This Chapter requires extensive disclosure by directors and secretaries of all their dealings in their own company's shares and, unlike Chapter 2, there is no lower exemption limit.</P>
    <P>Finally, while I do not think a wider, general regime of disclosure is necessary for private companies, Chapter 3 of Part IV contains a special new procedure whereby anyone with a genuine &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; can get a court order to establish the ownership of such companies.</P>
    <P>As to why these provisions are being introduced, there are a number of reasons.  To begin with, a system of disclosure makes for more efficient credit and investment decisions.  On the other hand, non-disclosure creates an environment in which corruption can go undetected. For example, the use of nominee accounts can allow the directors or other officers of a company &mdash; or even public officials &mdash; to channel contracts to firms in which they have an interest.  I am not saying here, incidentally, that this kind of abuse exists on a wide scale &mdash; what I am saying, though, is that sophisticated use of nominee accounts can allow it to <Col N="1697" /> be hidden.  Finally, non-disclosure of real share ownership facilitates fraud and insider dealing, since the insider, or indeed anyone who gets a &ldquo;tip&rdquo;, can conduct all his operations through nominee accounts, and thereby avoid detection.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill addresses the cancer of insider dealing.  I must say that this particular practice is high on my personal &ldquo;hit list&rdquo;, and I am convinced that only the strongest of measures will be good enough to tackle it.  The abuse involved here clearly offends against the basic principle of a fair share market, which relies on equality of information for participants in the market.  Of course, it also hinders the twin aims of promoting wider share ownership and encouraging more equity investment in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that Part V is one of the aspects of the Bill which underwent significant change in the Seanad. When we introduced the Bill originally, we took the approach of making insider dealing a civil offence only &mdash; in other words, a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; who suffered loss as a direct result of insider dealing would be able to take a civil action against the &ldquo;insider&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Most commentators and contributors to the debate, however, felt that this did not go far enough and urged that the provisions involved be strengthened considerably. I agreed and so we introduced a total of eight new sections to Part V in the Seanad; these are now sections 94 to 101 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Briefly, this new approach involves first, making insider dealing a criminal offence, carrying heavy penalties, for example, a maximum £200,000 fine on conviction on indictment; secondly recognising the expertise that already exists in the Stock Exchange itself in this area, creating a kind of &ldquo;policing&rdquo; role for the Exchange; thirdly, where a person is convicted of unlawful dealing, prohibiting such person from any further stock exchange dealing for the next twelve months; and finally, creating a new duty on intermediaries not to deal on behalf of a client if they have reasonable cause to believe, or ought to conclude, that the deal involved would be unlawful. <Col N="1698" /> I believe that this new approach represents a significant improvement to that Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill is also one of the most important, since it is in winding-up situations that many company law abuses finally come to light, and where there is most demand for dishonest directors to be made more fully accountable for their actions.</P>
    <P>While many of the provisions stand on their own, so to speak, and address individual abuses, I might highlight, here, one or two for special mention.  For example, section 107 tightens up the existing law on members' voluntary liquidations, to try and counter abuses of that procedure.</P>
    <P>I should also refer specifically to sections 115 and 116, which both tighten up the law on fraudulent trading and introduce the new concept of reckless trading, with potential personal liability for directors where this is proven.  This is an attempt to deal with those many cases where directors have operated a company in a way which, although not actually involving outright fraud, nevertheless completely disregarded the interests of the company's creditors and indeed its shareholders for that matter.</P>
    <P>Since this is a new concept, we were very conscious of the need to get the drafting right, to make sure it would not have undesirable effects on business life generally.  For that reason, we amended section 116 in the Seanad, to try and define what we mean by reckless trading and the result is, I think, an improvement in terms of definition and clarity.  Furthermore, so that honest directors who play by the rules will have nothing to fear, we have built in a number of safeguards. For example, so long as a person can, if required, show that he acted honestly and responsibly, he can be relieved of liability.  Section 116, like so many others in the Bill, is all about balance, and I am confident that we have now got this right.</P>
    <P>Other areas of note in Part VI which I might mention in passing are section 113 on fraudulent preference, section 114 on the validity of certain floating charges and <Col N="1699" /> sections 118 and 119 which tackle abuses which can occur in inter-company &ldquo;group&rdquo; situations.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part VII of the Bill, which is probably the area felt by many people to be the one most requiring change, and that is the area of disqualification of directors.  At this stage, &ldquo;the phoenix syndrome&rdquo; has entered our commercial folklore.  Many Deputies will be familiar with it &mdash; we are talking here of the &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; director who liquidates one company, leaving a trail of unpaid creditors behind, including tax payments, then turns up in business the next day under another name, often, indeed, even in the same premises.</P>
    <P>I think that honest business people are, quite rightly, very annoyed and frustrated at the sight of their defaulting debtors setting up shop again after leaving them high and dry.  I can well understand how the honest business person, when faced with such effrontery and audacity, might well ponder why he, too, should not adjust his standards when others are lowering theirs.  I think it is high time we grounded the phoenix and the Bill proposes a dual line of attack in this respect.</P>
    <P>First of all, where a director has been convicted of an indictable offence in relation to a company, or indeed any offence involving fraud or dishonesty, he will be automatically disqualified from being a director for a period of five years, or such other period as the court may order.  This is, in effect, a considerable strengthening of similar provisions which already exist in the 1963 Act, and the provisions involved are contained in Part VII, Chapter 2, of the Bill.</P>
    <P>That Chapter also builds on the existing 1963 provisions as regards the discretion of the court to disqualify persons from acting as directors and so on &mdash; for example, where a person has been made personally liable for a company's debts under section 116 of the Bill, or where the court is satisfied that a person's conduct as a director makes him unfit to be involved in company management.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 of Part VII, on the other hand, does not prohibit or disqualify <Col N="1700" /> anyone from being a director.  What it provides is that if you are a director of a company going into liquidation which turns out to be insolvent, leaving unpaid creditors behind, you cannot simply set up in business again the next day as if nothing had happened.  We are not saying you cannot be a director of a company again but we are saying that next time your company must meet a number of conditions, including greater capitalisation, as a protection to anyone who comes into contact with the new company.</P>
    <P>Thus, the minimum capital requirement for such a &ldquo;new&rdquo; company will be £50,000, fully paid up in cash, for a public limited company and £10,000 in the case of a private company.  I think these requirements are modest enough, considering the circumstances.  I repeat that section 128 will not prevent directors of insolvent companies from starting up in business again &mdash; and I do not think it is right that it should &mdash; and we are, instead, putting a minimum set of safeguards in place in the interests of their future creditors.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill is fairly straightforward, and simply tightens up certain aspects of the law relating to receivers. Of course, the remedy of receivership itself is a very old one, going back to the time before company law was invented, as it were.  This means that the law on receivers derives mainly, not from statute law, but from case law.  Accordingly, the proposals we are making in Part VII have mainly to do with the status of the receiver, the question of his independence and with clarifying the nature of his powers and duties.</P>
    <P>The proposals include a new statutory duty on a receiver selling property to get the &ldquo;best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo; for the property, as well as a new procedure whereby anyone connected with the company concerned, whether directors, shareholders, creditors or whoever, can apply to the court for directions as to the performance, or otherwise, by the receiver of his functions.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to be introducing Part IX of the Bill, which contains <Col N="1701" /> what I think is an exciting new mechanism for the rescue, and return to health, of &ldquo;sick&rdquo;, but potentially viable companies.  Deputies will obviously be aware of many cases of companies in difficulties which could have survived if only they had been given a breathing space in which to reorganise.</P>
    <P>The central feature of the new system will be the appointment to the company by the court of an expert, called an examiner in the Bill, and the placing of the company concerned under the protection of the court for a limited period.  From the date the court becomes involved, the debts of the company will be frozen, as it were, and no enforcement action can be taken by creditors.  Neither can proceedings for a winding-up of the company be commenced nor a receiver appointed. The purpose of this &ldquo;stay&rdquo; is to preserve the <i>status quo</i> to enable the company to begin the process of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The examiner will carry out an examination of the company's affairs and, if he considers that the company, or part of it, can be saved, he will draw up a rescue plan.  This will be put to meetings of shareholders and creditors and, if they agree, to the court for confirmation.  If the court confirms the plan, it will be binding on everyone concerned, the examiner's appointment will be at an end and the company will cease to be under the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the system will operate within a fairly tight timescale.  I think, this is the only way of ensuring that the scheme will be successful and will be used to the full.  One of the main criticisms of similar systems operating elsewhere, for example the &ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; system in the USA, is that they are too long-drawn-out and too costly.</P>
    <P>I have great hopes for this new system and I see it as an encouragement to firms in difficulties to face up to their problems at a much earlier stage and take action to salvage the company instead of letting it slide into liquidation, perhaps leaving a trail of angry creditors behind.  On the other hand, I might also say that it is a corollary to some of the tough measures in other parts of the Bill.  In other words, <Col N="1702" /> we are saying to business people here &ldquo;If your company is in trouble, then rather than head blindly on, hoping for the best, and leaving yourself open to, perhaps, personal liability, here is an opportunity to straighten your company out, in cooperation with your creditors&rdquo;.  Consequently, companies will no longer have any excuse for insolvent trading.</P>
    <P>I might just mention here that Part IX was one of the areas that received a particularly close examination in the Seanad &mdash; indeed a further seven sections to that part were added on Committee Stage in that House, which tightens it up a great deal, and makes it a much more workable procedure as a result.</P>
    <P>Part X deals with the inter-related area of company accounts and audit.  There is clear evidence that many Irish companies suffer chronically from poor account keeping, and indeed that this is the reason many of them fail.  Sections 198 to 200, therefore, will considerably strengthen the existing legal requirements in this area.  There is also clear evidence that the law relating to auditors needs to be tightened, both to clarify their duties on the one hand, and strengthen their own position in their dealings with company managements on the other.  Part X contains a number of detailed provisions with these twin aims in mind.</P>
    <P>Part XI of the Bill contains a number of general provisions, dealing mainly with offences of one kind or another.  I would like to make particular mention of section 207 which deals with one specific abuse that most of us will be aware of &mdash; this is the case of insolvent companies which deliberately run down their affairs and then simply close their doors without formally winding up, leaving creditors high and dry.  This in turn means that they can avoid the potential penalties and civil remedies which might otherwise apply to them.  Our solution to this is to apply certain provisions of the Bill, and indeed of the 1963 Act, to companies who go out of business without formally going into liquidation.</P>
    <P>That is a general description of the various aspects of the Bill, and the House will appreciate that, because of its scope <Col N="1703" /> and complexity, I could do no more on this occasion than single out certain particular provisions for special mention.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to mention certain new provisions which I propose to introduce to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The effect of these will be to insert a new Part XI to the Bill, with the purpose of allowing companies to acquire their own shares, subject to certain safeguards and conditions.  The present prohibition in companies legislation on companies purchasing their own shares has been a considerable disincentive to the Government's efforts to encourage investment in industry, particularly in private companies in the context of the business expansion scheme.  The new provisions which I will be proposing will help to ensure that potential investors are no longer deterred by the danger of having their investment &ldquo;locked into&rdquo; a company indefinitely.  The new facility will be of great benefit to public companies also, where there is often a compelling case for a company to buy in shares which are, perhaps, felt to be undervalued and where the company have surplus cash available to finance the purchase.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the safeguards I propose to build into the new provisions will ensure, first, that the overall capital of the company is maintained and, thus, that the fund on which creditors are entitled to rely will remain intact and, secondly, that shareholder approval will be necessary before a company can acquire any of their own shares.</P>
    <P>The right of a company to purchase their own shares has been in operation in the United Kingdom since 1981 and is common in continental Europe and in the United States.  It has been particularly availed of since the stockmarket collapse last year as the market price of shares has been low <i>vis-à-vis</i> the asset value, leaving companies vulnerable to takeover.</P>
    <P>We have been examining the possibility of providing for this in the Bill for some time, and I had hoped to introduce the necessary amendments at an earlier stage.  However, this did not, in the <Col N="1704" /> event, prove possible so I propose, as I said, to introduce the new provisions on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new facility which I am proposing will help companies to operate more effectively in an increasingly competitive world by having all the tools in their armoury and the flexibility that their competitors have as we approach 1992.</P>
    <P>Turning back to the general principles underlying the Bill, I know that these have the wholehearted support of those in the business community, who are as sickened as any Deputy in this House at the abuse and malpractice they see going on in their midst &mdash; indeed I suspect that business people know better than anyone else that legislation of this kind is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the Bill was aimed originally at the growing level of abuse and malpractice in company affairs. However, while that was certainly the original intention, we have now come to see it as much more than that.  I think that it will have the much wider effect of encouraging directors of companies in trouble to face their difficulties at a much earlier stage and that it will play an important part in fostering confidence and honesty in business dealings.</P>
    <P>In summary, what we are saying to people in business is this: &ldquo;first, if you trade honestly and responsibly, you will have nothing to fear; on the other hand, if you abuse your position of trust, there are many sanctions here which may be used against you, and finally, if your company do get into difficulties despite your best efforts, there is a new rescue mechanism in Part IX of the Bill to help you get over your problems&rdquo;.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome two relatively new elements in this legislation which has been in the process of drafting for many years.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I asked the Department to prepare provisions for what is known now as chapter 11-type arrangements where a company can be permitted with the protection of the court <Col N="1705" /> to trade itself out of its difficulties.  I am glad that that has been subsequently incorporated in the legislation.  Likewise I was very concerned as Minister for Industry and Commerce to promote the idea of wider shareholding to encourage more people to invest in small companies so that they would rely on private investment funds to develop rather than solely on borrowing money from the bank, which practice frequently led them into premature difficulties because the interest burden was too great for them. Had they got more equity in the first place they would have survived.</P>
      <P>To that end I was responsible subsequently as Minister for Finance, for improvements to the business expansion scheme, the aim of which was to give tax relief to people to put money into companies to help them get going.  One of the difficulties raised in regard to encouraging investment in companies in that way was how would one sell one's shares after four or five years if the company was still at that time a private company, as there would not be any market for shares.  A solution proposed was that the company could buy back the share from the person who invested.  That solution was impossible because the law forbade the purchase of shares by a company from its shareholders.  The Minister has indicated that he intends to remedy that by Committee Stage amendments.  That is something that I had asked my Department to do.  The legislation, which I expect will require a substantial number of amendments, is now ready to be introduced. Given the complexity of drafting, that is the length of time that things take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the problems faced by Departments such as the Department of Industry and Commerce in the matter of drafting legislation, the Department have to draft heads of the Bill, but the actual drafting of legislation is done by the parliamentary draftsman's office, an office which while it has considerable expertise in a lot of fields has no particular expertise in any particular field.  This is not generally the case.  The Revenue Commissioners are allowed draft finance legislation with the result that finance <Col N="1706" /> legislation is always drafted extremely quickly.  From the day of the Budget to the day of the Finance Bill two months later, a complex, lengthy Bill is produced. Legislation of a similar complexity being produced by a Department like the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Justice, will take not two months but somewhere in the region of ten years because the Department do not have in-house expertise to do the drafting, or if they do, they are not allowed to do the drafting as it has to be referred to the parlimentary draftsman's office where it joins a queue of lots of other legislation.  Even if the Government are jumping up and down looking for legislation, because of the monoply suffered by the parlimentary draftsman's office, in regard to drafting legislation, the parliamentary draftsman's office becomes a road block.</P>
    <P>We should consider whether or not the procedures which require all drafting other than Finance Bill drafting to be done by the parliamentary draftsman's office on the basis of heads supplied by some other Department, should be amended to allow the drafting be done by Departments.  That would greatly reduce the bureaucracy involved in terms of meetings between departmental officials and officials of the parliamentary draftsman's office and waiting for weeks to even get to meet officials in the parliamentary draftsman's office and sending over heads of Bills which are misunderstood but which people will not say are misunderstood, so that the Department get the draft on paper and the Department realise that the draftsman's office have misunderstood the original intention.  It would make a lot of sense if all that type of to-ing and fro-ing could be done in the one Department. The only way that that could be achieved would be to allow the facility that the Department of Finance have to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to the Department of Justice, Departments who have substantial law making functions anyway.  The parliamentary draftsman's office could simply provide a drafting service for the <Col N="1707" /> Departments who are not involved in drafting legislation frequently so that they are unable to build up the necessary in-house expertise.</P>
    <P>That would mean that a lot of problems would be solved more easily.  The Minister might comment on that.  It was certainly my experience that this had become a major road block and Ministers were constantly being beaten over the head for not producing legislation which they were doing their level best to produce.  The people in the parliamentary draftsman's office work extremely hard but they are grossly overworked and they are supposed to be specialists in everything.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech spoke about his gratitude for every suggestion that had been made to him when the Bill was being considered in the Seanad and said that he had carefully stored all the ideas and suggestions and that perhaps an opportunity would arise some other time to make use of some of them.  That implies that while the Minister was very ready to listen to amendments while the Bill was going through the Seanad, he may not be so ready to listen to amendments now that the Bill has come to the Dáil.  I hope that if any of the material that the Minister has stored from those submissions is brought up here in the course of the debates, the Minister will be prepared to accept the proposals and amendments either from this side of the House or from his own side of the House. It is certain that, a major Companies Bill having been produced, we will not see another one of its breadth for perhaps 15 or more years.  Even if it means going back to the Seanad to recommit some sections which are amended here, it is important that we do it.  I hope the Minister will be willing to listen to proposals for amendments.</P>
    <P>I will now make some suggestions with regard to difficulties that exist and improvements that might be made in the Bill.  The first general point is that detection is more important than the size of penalties.  My worry about this Bill is that it will be like a lot of legislation that goes <Col N="1708" /> through this House in that it will look good on paper and be full of clear statements about what is not acceptable and full of penalties for people who do what is not acceptable, but then there will be no mechanism or an insufficient mechanism for detecting events which ought to be the subject of prosecution.  I realise that responsibilities have been delegated for detection, to liquidators and people like that who will be obliged now to report certain matters to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>It will not depend entirely on the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Fraud Squad to identify people who have done things which are wrong, but there are sections of the Bill where that responsibility will largely rest on the Department of Industry and Commerce. I wonder whether the Department and the Companies Office have the necessary staff to initiate prosecutions themselves. Legislation which is not adequately enforced is legislation we would be better off without.  I hope, as we go through the Bill, that we will not discover sections which are in the nature of aspirations with which we would all agree but in relation to which it would be so difficult to prove a breach or to obtain information that the legislation would be a dead letter.  That is a theme which should be in our minds as we go through this Bill section by section.  We must ensure that we are making as much legislation as is enforceable rather than legislation that would look good.</P>
    <P>Early in the Bill there is provision for the appointment of investigators to look into the affairs of particular companies which are considered to be operating in a manner which is not acceptable to some people.  It is provided that up to one-fifth of the shareholders of a company will be able to apply to the court to have a company in which they are shareholders investigated.  Similar rights exist in regard to a creditor of the company.  These investigations are extremely expensive. Only two or three investigations of companies have been undertaken by the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="1709" /> under existing law, which provides that investigations may be undertaken at the initiative of a Minister.  This Bill provides that the court, rather than the Minister, will initiate the investigation.  It will not thereby become less expensive.  The investigation will possibly become more expensive under the present Bill due to the expenses of the initial court hearing securing agreement to the investigation.</P>
    <P>Should there not be a cheaper way of having investigations of companies undertaken?  A suggestion has been made to the Minister that there should be a socalled official investigator appointed who would be an assistant secretary in the Department of Industry and Commerce. It is not without precedent.  One of the assistant secretaries in the Department already acts as Registrar of Friendly Societies, in addition to performing a variety of functions within the Department. Perhaps another assistant secretary might be given the job as investigator of companies and given the ability to make certain preliminary or relatively modest inquiries where a matter might be capable of being rectified fairly quickly and inexpensively.  Obviously if he found himself getting into a scale of work which was quite beyond him in terms of resources, then the provisions in Part II of this Bill would have to be used. Because the investigations will be so costly and because anybody seeking an investigation may have to give security of up to £200,000 even to be heard, the provision may become a dead letter.  A creditor who is owed £30,000 by a company which he feels is being conducted in a very unsatisfactory fashion and should be investigated faces the prospect of having to lodge up to £200,000 as security for the cost of the investigation, all to get back a maximum of £30,000.  I know the reason for the £200,000 security is to prevent frivolous applications.  If an investigation is undertaken which could cost up to £400,000 to complete, there should be some way of sorting out applications so that only those which are genuinely important are considered.  I am not suggesting that the provision should be removed.  I am saying that perhaps there <Col N="1710" /> should be a supplementary system for investigations of relatively minor cases. Should there not be a sort of small claims court in regard to company investigations which would not involve such high costs?</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask why such investigations are so expensive.  Where do all the fees go?  Do the people who get the fees really earn them?  Do they deserve them?  If the fees are high because we are imposing all sorts of liabilities on people, is it not the case that it is our fault?  People have to get bonding against all sorts of eventualities and therefore charge a fee which will enable them to pay these expenses.  Perhaps we should consider having a form of investigation which is less onerous from the point of view of the person carrying it out and which has less serious consequences for those found to be deficient.  It might deal with minor abuses rather than major cases.  Perhaps the Department of Industry and Commerce with one of their assistant secretaries designated as the official investigator might be a means of dealing with this.</P>
    <P>Section 10 contains provisions in regard to solicitors of companies who might be required to give information about the way in which a company is being run.  In regard to the criminal law generally there is privilege in regard to communications between someone who is at risk of being the victim of a criminal prosecution and his legal adviser and such communications cannot be used in evidence against him.  In this case a solicitor would be required to disclose information to the person concerned with the investigation, which could lead subsequently to criminal proceedings.  That evidence would be capable of being used in the subsequent criminal case.  It could be said that people would have privilege in their communications, with their solicitor with regard to the direct criminal proceedings against them, but if the solicitor has been forced to disclose everything in the earlier investigation that protection would be set at nought.  It should be remembered that in this Bill we are creating a whole new set of crimes which frequently will have just as serious consequences as traditional crimes such as theft and burgulary. <Col N="1711" /> If we give certain protections to people who are accused of burgulary we must ensure that similar protections are afforded in regard to those who might be charged under this legislation.  They are innocent until proven guilty.  I question whether this is a breach of this principle.</P>
    <P>There is a similar case to be made with regard to section 13, which is a very strange section in many ways.  It says that the cost of the investigation may have to be met out of his personal assets by the person who is subsequently convicted of a crime that is detected in the course of the investigation.  That is a very interesting new principle in criminal law.  If I am accused of theft I may, for example, go to jail but I am not asked to pay for the cost of the trial as well.  If a rich person commits a murder, if convicted he can go to jail but he is not asked to pay for the cost of the investigation of that crime by the Gárda.  He is not asked to pay travelling expenses for all the official cars used to asemble the book of evidence, any more than he is asked to pay the costs of the prosecution in the court case.  He is, of course, asked to pay the cost of his own defence.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 somebody convicted of a crime which is much less serious than that of murder &mdash; and no matter what one may say about rogue directors they are not people who would be equivalent in terms of culpability to murderers &mdash; may be asked to pay for the entire cost of the investigation of the crime, from the beginning of the original official investigation.  That does not apply in an analogous situation with regard to a crime of murder.  There may be good reasons for this but I have not yet heard them. Given that this is criminal legislation, we should try to apply the same principles in regard to these cases as applied in regard to others.  That is the essential principle I am trying to put across here.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now in more or less general terms rather than about the sections, but that is what Second Stage debate is really about.  If you take section by section, all 207 of them, a very good case could be made for each one that they <Col N="1712" /> are absolutely just.  I am sure that is what the Minister will do.  However, what we need to do is look at the total effect of the whole Bill as a cumulative change in the business environment.  For instance, what effect will it have on the cost of setting up and running a business?  What effect will it have on the choice of somebody currently working in EOLAS, who is in a safe, pensionable job with everything arranged out in front of him, being able to budget for the education of his children, who has a business idea, is thinking of getting out of EOLAS, discarding his pension and leaving his safe job behind him and setting up a business and in due course incorporating that business? He will be moving from the area of virtually no risks into one where there are massive risks.</P>
    <P>There is the accumulation of all the costs involved here and all the potential penalties, for instance, that it could be argued that they ought reasonably to have known something in regard to the administration of the company which they subsequently set up but did not know it and they find that their home is confiscated, for example.  Their fears may be irrational in some cases because one would be able to convince them that in practice, while they could be charged, a judge would not actually take the house from them in those circumstances, that the judge would be behaving reasonably. Let us remember the decision to leave the safety of a public sector job and go into the private sector is taken by people not solely rationally.  It is a visceral decision, taken on the way people feel as well as on the way they work things out on paper.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ask himself if this Bill in its total effect makes it more comfortable for people to stay in safe jobs rather than go out and set up a company.  There are elements in it that will make the situation of people running a company so potentially uncertain as to the safety of their existing assets that they may decide not to bother, or they may decide to liquidate the company quickly before giving the idea a full chance because if they do not do that while they <Col N="1713" /> still can pay off their creditors they might themselves no longer enjoy limited liability and be accused of recklessness.  If they want to set up another company they may not be able to do it because they will have to lodge extra money and will be named as a special breed of people, as director of an insolvent company.  Nobody will touch them with a barge pole.  What will these people do?</P>
    <P>That will be a general problem in regard to this Bill and something we will have to consider.  We have combined concerns here of encouraging enterprise and also ensuring that entrepreneurs are not stung by the activities of people more reckless than themselves.  The main victims of rogue directors are frequently small businessmen.  I know it is not a simple question of the small businessman <i>versus</i> the administrator.  It is the interests of the good small businessman against the less good one.  Accepting all that, the Minister needs to look into this matter and when the Minister of State is replying I hope he will deal with that general concept.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would put to the Minister about the consequences of this Bill.  Will it not be possible that an increasing number of people, faced with the very heavy potential penalties, will decide to incorporate their companies somewhere else so that they not have similar legislation applied to them?  The company law of the Isle of Man, for instance &mdash; which is the nearest alternative place in which one could set up a company &mdash; has been relaxed, shall we say, as a matter of deliberate policy. Company law there and that in the United Kingdom, which previously was very similar, has diverged radically. Company law in the UK has moved more or less in the direction in which we are moving, tightening up the rules very stringently on those who might be considered to be reckless traders while, at the same time, company law in the Isle of Man has been going in the opposite direction, becoming more permissive of what people may do.</P>
    <P>Do we not have the possibility that <Col N="1714" /> somebody who wants to engage in reckless trading and undercutting in this country, to win market share without due regard to the interests of either his creditors or the public in general, will simply relocate his company in Douglas? Recently under their company law the Isle of Man reduced the minimum number of members of a public company to only two; the formality with regard to the formation of companies, particularly the requirement dealing with the direct duration of compliance by a duly authorised person, has been removed; companies will no longer be required to file their accounts in the public register or elsewhere.  An Act which came into effect on 30 June 1988 abolished the need for a company to state their objects in their memorandum and articles of association, and a company is presumed to be resident in the Isle of Man unless it is registered as being non-resident.</P>
    <P>If you set up a company in the Isle of Man it would appear that you could conduct your business elsewhere and the presumption under the Isle of Man law will be that you are an Isle of Man company. If you try to defend yourself from an action you can say you are an Isle of Man company and seek the protection of their courts and they will require the other party to prove you are not a resident company in the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>The Isle of Man is not part of the European Community and will not be subject to any of the directives that may emanate from Brussels with regard to wrongful trading, insolvent liquidations and so on.  The Isle of Man is only half an hour's flight from here.  I imagine what will happen is that while we are terrific guys imposing these massive requirements on business people, at substantial costs to those who comply, the people who do not want to comply, who are currently operating under existing company law, will pop over to the Isle of Man and run their business in Ireland as an Isle of Man company.  Will that not mean that the rogues will be able to emigrate while still at home?  That is a possibility the Minister might address.</P>
    <P>I know there are regulations with <Col N="1715" /> regard to branches and that if a company registered in the Isle of Man establish a branch here, we can impose separate requirements on them in regard to the operation and accounts of the Irish branch, but these people will not bother setting up branches.  In 1992 the whole concept of branches will probably go and they will not have to establish here to provide services for the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>In my view there may be a danger &mdash; and this may apply not just between Ireland and the Isle of Man &mdash; within the EC, without frontiers in 1992, that companies will tend to gravitate to the state where the requirements are less onerous.  If, for example, the Greeks decide they will not bother with legislation like this, and if there is free movement of goods and services between Ireland and Greece, will it not be possible for people who want to avoid this mound of stuff which might be thrown at them in the courts through personal liability, etc., to set up their companies in whichever EC country has the least onerous requirements?  Just as we are trying to attract people to the Custom House Dock site by offering very attractive tax rates, other countries might encourage companies headquarters to come into their jurisdiction by offering the no company law as their equivalent of our attractive tax rates at the Custom House Dock site. If that happens, and we all know how long it takes for the EC to bring anyone to court over a thing like that, could we find that this legislation will be evaded by the unscrupulous but become a burden for the scrupulous thereby penalising the compliant and allowing the non-compliant to evade their responsibility?</P>
    <P>The next point I want to advert to is the appointment of inspectors by the Minister under sections 14 and 15 to find out who owns shares in a company &mdash; this applies to private as well as public companies &mdash; in &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo;.  I can understand and accept that the Minister should be able to find out who owns shares for the effective administration of the law in regard to companies if there is a possible breach of the company law, <Col N="1716" /> and that he might also require to know who owns shares in a company for the effective discharge of his functions under another enactment, for instance, competition law, fair trade legislation and so on, and he might need to use section 14 of this Bill to get information about who owns shares in a company which is taking over another company &mdash; a topical matter at present &mdash; but we have a further provision which says the Minister can look for this information in the public interest. Who judges what is in the public interest? He does.  He may say he thinks it is in the public interest that he should know who owns company X or Y.  He might do that in a very partisan and unscrupulous fashion because Ministers are human beings and you can get bad Ministers as well as good Ministers.  Sometimes a Minister might have a vendetta against somebody in business and might decide to throw the book at that company and get after them through section 14.</P>
    <P>What matter that it is not relevant to company law or to other legislation. Maybe company A, a French company, is in competition with company B, a British company, and the IDA have decided that company B is a favoured company and has been absorbed into the company development programme and is the company everybody believes should succeed. Let us say the Minister wants to favour the French company rather than the British company and decides to slap a disclosure order on the British company to make them disclose A, B, C and D.  When asked why he is doing this he replies that it is in the public interest.  Who decides the public interest?  He does.  There are dangers there.  We must legislate for the worst case scenario.  We are not legislating to deal with best case scenarios. One possible worst case scenario is a malicious Minister.  For the Minister to come here and say he would never do that, does not answer my case.  That should be looked at in the further elucidation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 17 the Minister has the power to get information in regard to companies that are not incorporated in this State.  For example, he can inquire <Col N="1717" /> as to the beneficial ownership of shares in a company in Germany if that company is operating here.  That sounds great but how will he enforce it?  Is there any arrangement for the mutual enforcement of section 17-type provisions between EC members states?  If there is not, the provision will not mean very much.  It is something else the Minister might investigate.</P>
    <P>The next aspect with which I should like to deal is the provision in regard to loans to directors.  Here we have a provision which says loans to directors shall not exceed £2,500.  It has been put to me that really that provision should be related to the turnover of a company, that the bigger the company and the larger its assets the larger the amount of loans it should be able to give its directors.  It has been represented to me that in the case of a very small company £2,500 might constitute too high a limit.  I have not much sympathy with that point of view, in fact I do not agree with it, but it is one represented by me by a reputable group, that the limit should be related to the size of a company rather than have an absolute figure.  I think I would prefer an absolute figure.</P>
    <P>However, I might pose this question to the Minister: why permit loans to directors at all?  Does it not involve a complication? Will there not be quite an amount of difficulty experienced in proving that a loan amounts to only £2,500?  Is there not a possibility that the loan might have been more than £2,500 at some point within a three year period, when a person might have had £3,000 on credit at a given time and broke the limit? One would need to have a flow chart showing the amount owing at any given time.  If a person broke the £2,500 limit at any stage, he could find himself potentially guilty of an offence even though at the time one comes to initiate the investigation the loan outstanding might amount to £1,000 only?  It appears to me that this makes for extremely complicated enforcement for a trivial sum of money anyway.  A sum of £2,500 of a loan from a company will not get the type of people about whom we are speaking very <Col N="1718" /> far.  Why not say just: there should be no loans, period, rather than have £2,500 as a limit?  Certainly it would be easier. Everybody would then know where they stood: one does not get a loan from a company of which one is a director, end of story.</P>
    <P>If I may turn from the particular to the general, one of the worries I have about the provisions of this Bill is that they will create a sort of general sense of guilt, uncertainty, a feeling of, perhaps I am in breach of the law among business people without their knowing exactly what is wrong and what is right at any given time. This is an area in which that uncertainty could be removed relatively simply.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the references in the Bill to insider dealing where, again, I feel there is some element of uncertainty.  People may feel that they may or may not be committing a crime. I have absolutely no quarrel with the provisions of the first part of section 91 (1).  It is absolutely right and says:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for a person who is, or at any time in the preceeding six months has been, connected with a company to deal in any securities of that company if by reason of his so being, or having been, connected with that company he is in possession of information that is not generally available, but, if it were, would be likely materially to affect the price of those securities.</P>
    <P>If a fellow is an officer of the company and has information that would affect the price of those securities he cannot use that information.  That is simple and straightforward and anybody in that position will know exactly what are and are not their obligations.  I have no problem with that provision; it is fine and must be implemented.</P>
    <P>Where I do have problems with regard to the provisions in relation to insider dealings is in regard to section 91 (3). Under the provisions of that subsection someone who is not an officer of a company who may have received information, directly or indirectly, from another person, who is aware or ought <Col N="1719" /> reasonably to have been aware of the facts and circumstances by virtue of which that person might have given him the information &mdash; it being information he had obtained in a privileged way that would be contrary to the provisions of section 91 (1) &mdash; is guilty of an offence. Suppose someone meets another person in a social setting and the person says something about a company to the effect that it is doing well, we are going to do something.  Suppose the person who says it is a director of the company and therefore caught by the provisions of section 91 (1), and the person who hears it says: good idea; I must buy some of those company shares, there might be no intention on the part of the director who said that to encourage such investment, he might have no interest whatever in the other person buying the shares.  But now we are in a position in which essentially someone hears a bit of information which encourages them to invest in a company in particular circumstances.  If it could be shown that he had received that information, either directly or indirectly, although he could have heard it from a third party who had heard the director say it the first time, in other words, indirectly, and if he ought to have known that the person who said it the first time was a director of the company &mdash; even if he did not know he was a director of the company &mdash; if he subsequently invests in those shares, he is guilty of insider dealing.  I know the Minister want to avoid circumstances in which people will get other people to buy shares for them which had they bought themselves would render them guilty of insider dealing. That is what the Minister wants to stop. I fully accept that as an objective but I fear that we may be creating circumstances in which anybody who gets any information about a company which might be useful with a view to buying shares will end up a potential criminal and subject to massive fines.</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer to that problem. I am simply putting the problem forward.  We appear to be really casting the net so wide that anybody who invests <Col N="1720" /> in shares is potentially an insider dealer if they do so on the strength of any information other than that gleaned simply from looking at the newspapers.  We all know that most people who invest in shares do not rely solely on newspapers, creditworthy and all as newspapers are in business matters.  We do know that investors rely on some sort of chat they have had with somebody, who in turn has a chat with somebody else to the effect, that something might be worth investigating as a possible investment.</P>
    <P>Are we going to create this new grey area of offence, of practices that are crimes technically but are not really prosecuted in practice?  If this means the type of law that creates a sort of shotgun approach, rendering everything criminal &mdash; but in practice implies that we will go after the really serious cases only because, after all, we are all reasonable men and we will not pursue a case like that &mdash; that is not good law.  The law should be certain.  People should know they are committing a crime if they do certain things, but we will have circumstances obtaining in which nobody really knows.</P>
    <P>For example, our tax laws have become so complicated that people are told after the event that they have done something which was taxable even though they thought it was not taxable at the time.  They are supposed to know the law, God help us; everybody is supposed to know the law.  Ignorance of the law is no defence any longer.  I wonder how many businessmen will know this law when it is passed by this House?  I wager a guess it will be very few but, as far as the court is concerned, ignorance of the law is no defence.  Therefore, we will have circumstances obtaining in which many people will be in two minds as to whether they are in the clear.  Indeed, they may not know for years whether they were in the clear because it might not be for years afterwards that anyone would investigate the matter.  At its very least that is not good for the mental health of the business community.  Perhaps it is something we should investigate to render the law more certain.  We have <Col N="1721" /> got to stamp out abuses but we must go about it in a way that ensures that the law is clear; black and white, not grey.</P>
    <P>I know also that the provisions of this section on insider dealing are based on the rules in regard to this matter which are set down by the Stock Exchange.  If I might put it this way, the Stock Exchange is not a national institution.  It is an institution which is transnational.  It is an institution that exists in Britain and in Ireland, as one person in two jurisdictions.  The Stock Exchange is almost like the deity, it exists in a whole lot of different places; it is one person but it is not really one person.</P>
    <P>I am told that the regulations on insider dealing are cogged directly from the Stock Exchange's own rules or, shall I say, based heavily on them.  What happens if the Stock Exchange decide to change their rules next year?  Will we have to catch up on them?  Will we be faced with having to follow them or should we perhaps deal with the matter in some other way?  Reliance on the Stock Exchange as the main means of enforcing the provisions of Part V of the Bill will pose certain problems if their code differs or diverges subsequently from that contained in Part V of the Bill.  If the Stock Exchange change their rules next year they will then be enforcing, simultaneously, our rules contained in Part V of the Bill and their own rules, which may be different.  Is that a problem and, if so, how will it be overcome?</P>
    <P>Section 83 of the Bill provides for the disclosure of the ownership of shares in private companies.  I can understand in regard to a publicly quoted company that it is legitimate to find out who owns shares because you want to know if someone is building up a shareholding, the purpose of which might be to take over the company. The people at present controlling the company want to know if an ambush has been set for them.  That does not really apply to private companies because, according to existing company law, it is based on mutual information being given.  Anyway, the affairs of a private company in regard to individuals buying shares do not seem to be a matter <Col N="1722" /> in which the State has any particular interest.  If people in a private company have a row it does not affect anybody except the people concerned.  Why is the State in this section making powers available for the disclosure of interest in shares in private companies?  What public purpose is served, given that this is a private company?  Are these matters that the private company should deal with in their ordinary memorandum of association, whereby members entering a private company should disclose the beneficial onus to the other members of the company? Why should the State be involved? Surely if people enter into the setting up of a private company and fail to get an arrangement with their fellow shareholders about information in regard to the selling of shares, there is no need for the State's involvement?  Possibly there is a good reason but it is no harm to ask the Minister to explain.</P>
    <P>Section 92 says &mdash; essentially &mdash; that if Deputy Cullen and I have an insider deal and I sell shares to him somebody can look for compensation.  How will that compensation be measured?  Will it be the difference between the price at which the shares were sold and what they would have been sold at if one of the parties did not have insider information?  How will we determine it?  Will the person who may sue be somebody else in the company, another shareholder?  How will compensation be measured in the case of insider dealing?  Who is the injured party? I know there are procedures for determining amounts but what will the criteria be?</P>
    <P>Section 107 provides that there shall be a declaration of solvency given in respect of a company by the directors of the company before they put it into voluntary liquidation.  In other words, if the directors of a company decide that they will wind up a company voluntarily, they must make a declaration, and they will be personally liable for the truth of such declaration, that the company have enough funds to pay their creditors.  That is very reasonable protection because it prevents voluntary liquidations being used as a means of liquidating companies that do <Col N="1723" /> not have enough money to pay their creditors and getting away from their obligations in that fashion.  However, section 107 should be extended.  There is also what is known as a creditors' voluntary liquidation where the creditors decide that they agree with the directors that the company should be liquidated because they feel, that by such a move, they will get their money and the directors are prepared to go along with this. There is a possibility that the creditors might be misinformed in agreeing to a voluntary liquidation in the first place. The creditors might decide on voluntary liquidation thinking that the company had certain assets but, in practice, the company may not have these assets and the creditors may only get 50p in the £. Should there not be a requirement for a director to give a declaration of solvency in regard to all voluntary liquidations, those initiated by the members themselves and initiated by the directors of the company?</P>
    <P>The key section is section 116 which provides for civil liability for people who carry on business in a reckless manner.  I acknowledge that the concept of recklessness is fairly well established in law. It means that you know that there is a possibility that what you are doing could cause certain bad consequences and you carry on regardless.  It is not that you just make a mistake.  You do not intend the consequences but you know there is a strong possibility of the consequences and you still go ahead.  Assuming that my definition of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; is correct it is a reasonably well established legal concept and people should know that they are being reckless.  That certainly applies to section 297A (1) (a) of the section but there is also a problem in relation to (b) which says: &ldquo;If it appears that any person was knowingly a party to the carrying on of any business of a company with intent to defraud creditors of the company, or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that he was knowingly a party to carrying on the business of the company or knowingly a party to the <Col N="1724" /> fraud?  If it means that he was knowingly a party to the business of the company without knowing about the fraud it should not be an offence.  It is clear that an employee of a company who did not know about the fraud &mdash; or if he did could do nothing about it &mdash; should not be caught in that situation.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that for an action to succeed under section 116 against something whereby they would have to give up their assets to assist the creditors in getting their money back, all that would be needed would be that it would be proven on the balance of probabilities that the person was acting recklessly, not beyond reasonable doubt as occurs in a criminal case.  Talking totally in theory, it seems to me that where there is even a smell of a possibility that recklessness could be proved, creditors of an insolvent company will sue under section 116 in every case more or less automatically.  You sue the directors of a company that is insolvent.  You do not just throw the normal liquidation law at them, you go for personal liability as well as a matter of course, because no accountant or legal adviser would want it to be said afterwards that he did not advise his client to use all possible remedies open to him.  To take this example: if a company has £150,000 worth of debts of which £100,000 is owed to the Revenue Commissioners, and the company has £100,000 worth of assets, the Revenue Commissioners get all the assets.  There is £50,000 left which is not there, so to speak.  In that circumstance the only course the other, non-Revenue, creditors will have will be to go after the personal assets of the directors.  The tendency will be to take an action under section 116 in all cases of insolvency, almost, to use the legal term, as a sort of &ldquo;fishing expedition&rdquo;.  This is the term used. People put in claims, and if you have lost your money you try every angle.</P>
    <P>If the company is insolvent it may well be that directors who were not reckless will be tempted to buy off creditors with their personal assets simply to avoid the possibility of having to defend a case <Col N="1725" /> under section 116 in court.  Even people whose companies became insolvent but acted perfectly properly throughout &mdash; and that is possible still under this legislation &mdash; will be forced to give some of their personal assets simply because of the need to avoid the nuisance of defending a case such as this.  We all know that in practice insurance companies constantly settle cases where they do not believe there really is any claim on the basis of the person claiming.  In order to avoid the problem of having to defend a case in court they settle.  Is it not going to be the case here that everybody will use this?  If so, what effect is it going to have on people becoming non-executive directors of companies?  If somebody has a bit of money and a bit of expertise and a company is getting into difficulties and that person is brought on board by the company &mdash; maybe on the advice of Fóir Teoranta &mdash; to help the company sort out its mess and get itself back on the road, and by that person's coming to the company it staggers on for another while but eventually closes down, is it not likely that any creditor of that company will go out of his way, if the company has not enough to pay him in full, to try to prove that the director who came in late in the day was reckless in prolonging the life of the company even for a few days and by virtue of that he should be forced to put in some of his personal assets?  If that possibility is even there &mdash; it does not have to be a probability &mdash; will it not be very difficult to get non-executive directors to come on boards because of the possibility of &ldquo;fishing expeditions&rdquo; by creditors under section 116?  The court may not take the view that the person concerned was reckless, but the sheer nuisance value of having to defend such a case where one's reputation would be impugned in court in public might encourage people to pay out even though they were not reckless.</P>
    <P>One point that might be looked at is in regard to a defence against recklessness. Section 116 (2) provides that a person shall be deemed to have knowingly carried on a business in a reckless manner if &ldquo;(b) he was a party to the contracting <Col N="1726" /> of a debt by the company and did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds that the company would be able to pay the debt when it fell due for payment as well as all its other debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities)...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean every director of a company must be qualified in accountancy in practice?  If it is reasonable grounds, or reasonable grounds as would be seen by an accountant, where is that going to leave the director of a company who, like many directors of companies, left school at 14 years of age, and subsequently acquired skill, whose only assets initially were a tool box and who has not got qualifications in accountancy and might not be able to read the signs in regard to a company going off the rails as well as an equivalent individual who had a qualification in accountancy and was sitting on the same board?  Yet section 116 (2) (b) makes no distinction between the knowledge of the director in the one case and in the other.  If a director of a company is an accountant it seems to me he should bear a higher obligation in regard to ensuring that debts are not contracted by the company that cannot be met than somebody who has no formal training in that area.  Should section 116 (2) (b) also include the qualifications contained in paragraph (a) of this same section where regard is had to the general knowledge, skill and experience that reasonably may be expected of a person in that position, in other words, a person who is a director of a company who is there as an accountant and has accountancy qualifications, <i>vis-a-vis</i> someone who has not?</P>
    <P>I put that forward.  I do not know whether it is possible to do this, but it seems it is not going to be enough to prove that you honestly did not know you could not pay the debt.  You would have to be able to prove that you honestly did not know it on reasonable grounds. Would that be &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; in your own eyes or in the eyes of the court? It could be either, and remember it is going to be a civil case, so all that will need to be proved is that on the balance <Col N="1727" /> of probabilities, on reasonable grounds, you should have known.  It could be problematic. Maybe the Minister will expand on it when he comes to reply eventually to this debate.</P>
    <P>I would like to revert to section 128 of the Bill, under which a director of a company who have gone bust and who were insolvent must ensure, before becoming a director of another company who have public liability, that the company have share capital subscribed of £50,000 or, if a private company, have share capital subscribed of £10,000.  So there will be two categories of directors in the future, one of which will be those who in the past were directors of a company who became insolvent even if there was no suggestion of criminal liability in that insolvency.  Companies do become insolvent where there is nobody guilty, even under this Bill, or criminal activity of any kind; people simply make mistakes, and if we are going to make mistakes a crime we can forget about enterprise altogether.  There will be situations in which mistakes will be made and companies will be insolvent and there will be no suggestion of moral culpability of any kind, criminal or ethical.  That will not matter under this section.  If the company become insolvent any director of that company, however blameless, will not be able to become a director of another company unless that company have a subscribed share capital of £10,000.</P>
    <P>This raises a number of difficulties. First, it will create a new class of potential directors of companies, people who have black marks beside their names. In fairness to anybody who is setting up a company, there should be a register of ex-directors so that one does not invite somebody onto one's board only to discover subsequently that they were at one time a director of a company who was insolvent, and that therefore one's company should have had a share capital of £10,000.  If one is going to set up a black list of former directors of insolvent <Col N="1728" /> companies there should be an actual list as otherwise people will not know when recruiting directors whether their accession to the board would require this change in the share capital of the company.</P>
    <P>It will make it very difficult also for individuals, particularly non-executive directors who are brought into companies, directors who may be directors of seven or eight companies put in there at the behest of Fóir Teoranta to help to keep the company going.  If any one of those companies goes down that director goes onto the black list and cannot be on the board of any other company unless that company comply with the requirements of section 128.  This will discourage people from going on boards as non-executive directors.</P>
    <P>Let me suggest a possible remedy for this.  Why not have a general requirement that all public liability companies must have a share capital of a certain amount subscribed and that all private companies must have a share capital of, say, a minimum of £5,000, and let that apply regardless of the directors on the board?  It is absolutely right that limited liability should not be purchased cheaply.  There should be money there to meet initial debts anyway.  Conditions should be more stringent.  Companies should have more subscribed share capital than the present £2, that is all that is required. This would be better than creating two classes of directors and avoid people who may innocently have been directors of an insolvent company, having gone in for no reward but simply to help out, finding themselves on a black list in this way. Requirements similar to those in section 128 (5) should apply to all companies to ensure that they are properly capitalised in general.  We could deal with all cases in that way without creating a black list. It would have the same effect; the protection given to creditors would be much greater because the requirements would apply to novice directors as well as to those who have been over the hoops in the past and may have had one case which went wrong out of many which went right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> Section 137 of the Bill relates to the obligation that is placed on a director who resigns from a company to lodge in the Companies Office a letter saying why he resigned.  I would ask the Minister to contemplate whether this requirement could be used maliciously.  Let us suppose an individual director gets into a row with one of his fellow directors, maybe about something that has nothing whatever to do with the company, and they just cannot live with one another any more and one of them resigns; the row is so severe that the director who resigns decides to get his own back by putting in a letter saying that he had doubts about the management of the company and doubts about its solvency.  That letter would then be public information.  It may be a misleading letter although not actually untrue because it cannot be proved to be untrue, but as a result nobody is prepared to lend that company money.  I know what the Minister is trying to achieve and I support it, but should there not be some provision to prevent malicious statements being included in reports of this kind, to ensure that statements should be strictly factual and related to matter that is being concretely alleged, not simply speculative material put in that might be badly motivated in the fashion that I have described?</P>
    <P>Under section 149 if a statement of affairs of the company is not lodged by the directors, the receiver who goes in subsequently is required to lodge such statement of affairs.  What does that mean?  A statement of affairs, as I understand it, means that he has to put a value on all the assets of the company.  As a result of that the receiver will be in a rather anomalous situation.  He will be asked, under section 149, to put a value on the shares in the company and he then has to go on and try to sell these for the best price possible.  He might have valued a particular asset, say, a building at £50,000, and he cannot value it at more than he believes it to be worth.  He has the obligation then to try to sell that for £100,000 if he can.  He will be dealing with one hand behind his back because in lodging the statement of affairs he has <Col N="1730" /> had to show his hand to the person to whom he is selling the asset.  The other person, knowing that, will use it in the negotiations.  The receiver will be in an anomalous situation by having to put in this statement of affairs, because he is the one who will be subsequently dealing in the assets.  That is almost asking that person to be schizophrenic, I would argue.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill, which was referred to by the Minister, is something I had initiated at the early stages of the preparation of the Bill.  My worry about that provision is that it will cost a lot.  The experience of Chapter XI in the United States is that it is fine as a type of infirmary for big companies because they are so big that they can afford the medical fees in that infirmary.  However, I wonder if Part IX, as it will be known, will be relevant to small companies.  Will they be able to afford the medical fees in the infirmary, in Dr. Brennan's new surgery for ailing companies?  In my view they will not.  I accept that the Minister has made efforts to simplify the procedure and reduce the potential cost but in spite of that this will cost so much that the only people who will use it will be the bigger companies. The smaller companies will not be able to use it and, therefore, we will be creating a new form of discrimination between large and smaller companies.  The large companies will be able to trade their way out using Part IX while the smaller companies will have to go.  The Minister should address that problem in the course of his discussions.  Should we not have a mini-Part X for small companies with a lighter or more inexpensive cutprice infirmary for them?  I do not know if that is possible but I ask the Minister to consider that thought.</P>
    <P>I should now like to move to section 199 and the House will note, with relief, that as I am nearing the end of the Bill I am almost at the end of my contribution. Essentially, that section states that if accounts are not kept, not only are the officers of the company liable to a criminal offence but are liable to have their houses taken from them.  I cannot quarrel with that because there is no way one will <Col N="1731" /> know whether an offence was committed unless people are required to keep the evidence.  By failing to keep accounts one ensures that there is no evidence for any subsequent prosecution.  Therefore, if we did not have a provision like section 199 people would avoid the other provisions in the Bill simply by not keeping accounts because nobody would know whether they were reckless, fraudulent or whatever. I accept that very stringent penalties are necessary for failure to keep accounts.  Otherwise the other provisions in the Bill will fall flat.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if this section really means that every company from now on will have to have an accountant on its board.  The section seems to state that the other directors can get rid of that responsibility by stating that one of the directors shall be responsible for the keeping of the accounts and the others shall not.  I imagine that those who are not accountants on the board will say, &ldquo;you are the accountant and, therefore, you are the person who is responsible under section 199 (2) (b) and, therefore, you are the person whose house is at risk if the accounts are not kept.&rdquo;  For example, those in the building business are not likely to be accountants and in practice this will mean that every small firm that is incorporated, whether it is a building firm or a firm that is involved in clearing drains or engaged in other mundane activities, will have to have their company accountant on the board as a director.  That person will then be personally liable if the accounts are not kept.  What will that mean?  In my view it will mean higher accountants' fees for two reasons.  Firstly, the accountant will charge extra because he or she will have to be a member of the board.  No other member of the board who is not an accountant will be able honestly to put his hand on his heart and say that the books were being kept in accordance with section 198.  Secondly, it will mean that the accountant will add an additional risk premium into the fee to cover against the possibility that he may make a mistake and be liable to prosecution under the <Col N="1732" /> section.  His house, and his assets, as an accountant will be at risk.  In my view the fees of accountants will increase substantially.</P>
    <P>I know that the weight of the advice the Minister will receive from the accountancy profession will be on the following lines, &ldquo;good man Minister; you need to insert such provisions,&rdquo; but I wonder how many ordinary builders have read the Bill.  I wonder if it is the case that Ministers &mdash; in that statement I include myself as a former Minister &mdash; tend when looking for advice on a companies Bill to go to people who know about company law.  They tend to be people who have an interest in making their money out of company law and who do not mind extra requirements being inserted because they will mean more fees for them.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible that the knowledgeable community so far as company law is concerned consists of people who have a vested interest in more and higher levels of regulations?  Is it not true that the only time the average building company director will become acquainted with the provisions of the Bill will be when he is before the court?  I wonder how much advice we, speaking of present and previous Ministers, have been able to take in regard to this from the people who will have to pay the extra accountancy fees that will arise under section 200?  In my view it was relatively little because there is nobody who knows enough about the subject to whom we could talk.  It will only be when there are a few exemplary prosecutions under the legislation when people have the book thrown at them and express the view that they do not think it is just, that we will have people telling us that the provisions are too onerous.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to have another look at these provisions and ask himself the question, &ldquo;what effect will they have on the cost of running a business, apart from the criminal and civil risks of running a business if it is incorporated; what effect will they have on the ordinary running costs in terms of the extra fees that will have to be paid to help people comply with all requirements.&rdquo;  It <Col N="1733" /> is only fair to say that in respect of section 200 anybody who is a creditor of a company that is declared insolvent and who is receiving 80p in the £ may use section 200 to go after the directors for personal liability.  If they can find anything wrong with the records of the company &mdash; we should remember that section 198 requires that they must correctly record and explain each transaction &mdash; they will go after the assets of anybody who could have had anything to do with the company, be it the working director or the professional director.  People will use section 200 which gives them the possibility of getting that extra 20p in the £ they will not be getting from the company. Word processors will be spewing out personal liability actions in order that creditors will get what they can.</P>
    <P>We must remember that those creditors will be in competition with one another and if one creditor goes after the directors and gets something from them the other creditors will feel very sore that they did not go after them.  There will be a race to get the assets, or anything that can be got, when a company are declared insolvent.  To ensure that nobody gets in in front professional advisers will advise people to automatically make a claim under section 200 and a further claim under the earlier section which relates to reckless trading.  That is a possibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that this has not happened under similar legislation in Britain.  That could be for either of two reasons: first, that it cannot happen because the legislation is so well drafted that it will not happen, or second, it may be simply that the British company law practitioners have not copped on to the possibility of this yet and might use it in this way.  The Minister should give this point serious thought.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to some more points.  The provisions in regard to reckless trading apply where a company is being wound up, but they do not apply beforehand, I think. This is going to mean that perhaps people will do everything to avoid winding up the company because they know the consequences once they wind it up will <Col N="1734" /> be so heinous that they could not even contemplate them.  They will actually keep on going, getting deeper into the mire, because the trigger for all the consequences is the winding up of the company.  Some people have argued that by making the penalty so severe when the company is wound up and found to be insolvent that, far from encouraging people to wind up the company once they get into difficulty &mdash; and they know they are in difficulty &mdash; they will keep going rather than stop half-way.  The company will finally be brought to ground at either two points, first, when it is still solvent and people decide to get out and that is all right and, second, once they get into difficulty they will go the whole way because they know they are doomed anyway.  They might as well keep going until it is too late to salvage anything and everything is gone as they are going to be got anyway.  Frankly, I do not know what the answer to these points should be.  This point has been put to me as a possible danger and I ask the Minister to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer back to Part IX of the Bill.  Under Part IX of the Bill the Revenue Commissioners will be able for the first time to forego their Revenue preference and enter into an arrangement with a company which is in the infirmary to keep them alive by writing off some of their debts or by entering into an arrangement about the collection of those debts in the long term which may involve the Revenue not collecting their money on time.  That is fine if a company is under court protection but if a company becomes insolvent and is not under court protection the Revenue Commissioners still retain their full preference and have first preference over everybody else.  I think that because the Revenue Commissioners know that if they refuse to enter arrangements under Part IX that they will still have their full preference, they will not go in under Part IX.  They will simply say they will not agree to Part IX because they do not care about the rest of the creditors or that the rest of the creditors may be better off if the company was kept going.  If the company had <Col N="1735" /> £100,000 of disposable assets and they owed the Revenue £100,000, the Revenue would get that money and they do not care about the rest.  The Revenue have preference and they will take what they are owed.  Their attitude might be: &ldquo;Although Part IX is great, we are not interested, we have first preference&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the only way in practice that the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to co-operate with operations under Part IX would be if they were on the same basis as the other creditors and did not have preference. Then they would know they would be just as much liable to gain from the company continuing and paying all its debts ultimately than by pulling the chain on the company straightaway.  A very strong argument for the operability of Part IX is to get rid of Revenue preference.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Revenue Commissioners have taken on a whole range of new powers in recent legislation with regard to ensuring that they get their money.  They have had a very successful amnesty and have powers of attachment and self-assessment.  They have the services of the sheriffs.  A great many powers are now available to assist the Revenue Commissioners in collecting debts which were not there when the Revenue Commissioners were originally given first preference as a creditor of a company. Therefore there is not the same need now as there was before this legislation to give the Revenue preference.  Giving the Revenue preference will mean that Part IX will be aborted because they will not go along with it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that the Revenue Commissioners are reasonable people &mdash; as they are from my knowledge of them as individuals &mdash; and that they will recognise that it is Government policy to use Part IX.  I do not think that will work because the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners is an Accounting Officer.  He has to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and he has to be able to show that he did everything he could to collect every pound <Col N="1736" /> owed and if he does not, Deputy Gay Mitchell or whoever is chairman of that committee would have something to say to him.  He will be exposed for not going after his pound of flesh from a particular company.  So long as the Revenue Commissioners have the preference and fail to use it, the chairman runs the risk, metaphorically, of being put through the wringer by Deputy Gay Mitchell, or whoever happens to be the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Unless we take away the preference and put the Revenue Commissioners on the same basis as other creditors where they have got to do a deal, and it is simply a question of whether it was a good or bad deal, I do not think the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to go along with reconstructions under Part IX. For that reason there is a very strong case for getting rid of the Revenue Commissioners' preference.  The Revenue's preference in the past has meant that the Revenue Commissioners do not take action early enough to get money from a company.  They relax and sit back in the knowledge that they have preference ultimately if the company goes.  They fail to use information they have to initiate a reconstruction or winding up of the company in good time for everybody including themselves, because they know they can relax as they have preference.</P>
    <P>If the Revenue Commissioners did not have preference, I think they would take action earlier which would not only mean that they would be better protected but that the other creditors would be better protected.  The Revenue would be more vigilant in taking action in a timely way than is the case at present when they can sit back and enjoy the benefits of preference.  This area needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>This legislation was prepared by the Government of which I was a member; I was directly involved in preparing large chunks of it so I am hardly going to speak out against it.  It is necessary to deal with rogue directors, insider dealing and to have better provisions in regard to requiring people to keep accounts.  It is necessary to improve the <Col N="1737" /> position with regard to investigation of companies and the other things that are set out to be done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the Bill very carefully as it goes through Committee Stage to ensure that people know exactly where they stand and that it does not create undue costs, as far as legitimate businesses are concerned, which are greater than the proportionate benefit that would come from the new provisions and, therefore, that this legislation contributes to enterprise rather than takes from it.  That would be the purpose of my contribution and I am sure the contributions of all other Members on Committee and subsequent Stages of this Bill.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to take on board amendments in this House and if necessary to go back to the Seanad with them, that he will not consider that all the work he did in that House is all he is going to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to the House today.  It has gone through many studies and gestation periods in the last few years before finally arriving here.  It is a very detailed and technical Bill and it is a necessary one.  It strikes me, when dealing with a Bill such as this, that perhaps we forget to realise what we are trying to get at.  To the vast majority of people this Bill brings to mind the type of guy they have looked at over a long number of years &mdash; the rogue director &mdash; who has abused the system, who has paid nobody, who has led his employees down a garden path, who has shirked all his responsibilities, who has created hardship in these areas, who closes down on a Friday afternoon and on the following Monday morning is able to open up around the corner and, at times, in the same business where he has so miserably failed to have any responsibilities to anyone.  Essentially that would be the man in the street language that would be simply understood and that is the question that would be directly asked by the vast majority of people looking at this Bill.  The Bill deals with many areas other than just this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of submissions that everybody has obviously received over a long <Col N="1738" /> period and the areas they have come from shows that this Bill affects the whole range and gamut of business in this country. A question we should ask ourselves is if it is creating the environment for enterprise, if the net result of this Bill is that it is going to allow business to prosper. At the end of the day, if business is prospering and is making profits, we must ask whether the Bill is having the effect of creating jobs.  This is what all the legislation we deal with in this House should have as a net end result, the net effect of which should be that it allows businesses, companies and individuals, both small and large, out in the marketplace to improve the facilities under which they operate and that the things that hamper them from growing are removed.  It is important that fairness can be seen on both sides, both what is contained in the guidelines that allow them to work within a certain framework and what the results of these guidelines are so that they cannot go too far to one end of the scale but that they are not prevented from having a free area of movement in business.</P>
    <P>One very important aspect of this Bill is the question of reckless and unfair trading.  We have seen examples here in the not too distant past of the different types of reckless trading that can happen. Companies because of their size, weight and ability to force their position in a certain area of the market can unfairly force other companies out of business purely because they have the financial strength and the wherewithal to do it. They have little regard for the other companies, for what they are doing to the market by removing the competition in many areas, by removing the other companies that exist, by putting the employees of those companies out of work in gaining control of the market. They operate on the principle of what suits them primarily, in the first instance, is what concerns them.  If that reckless behaviour in the marketplace falls within the gambit of some clever lawyers or some clever accountants being able to walk out then they go ahead and do as they see fit.  This Bill in many ways attempts to deal with those areas but as <Col N="1739" /> the Minister said in his speech, there is not a simple answer to dealing with them. In the drafting of this type of legislation it is obvious that parliamentary draftspeople have sat over long periods trying to find the right words and the right provisions that do not hamper the development of business.</P>
    <P>In this Bill it is right that the various aspects are being looked at, for instance, Part II deals with investigations into companies. I should say at the outset that there are many aspects of this Bill dealing with penalties.  The only problem with penalties is that by the time you come to implement the penalty all the suffering and pain has already been caused, the employees are probably out of work and the company has probably folded.  The only real value of serious penalties is the deterrent.  The implementation of that deterrent can affect companies and prevent them from going down certain roads which inevitably lead to the disintegration of the company with which they are involved and its winding down and so on.  What we are looking for in Part II is investigations into these companies. The removal of the role of appointing inspectors by the Minister to a High Court judge is a step in the right direction. It gives it much more clarity and weight.  It is not a road down which the Department would welcome having to go but if it is necessary it should be done but it should not be done as a last resort when all else has failed.  This area must be looked at and must be utilised in the interests of those involved in the company themselves.  If an investigation has to be held into a company it should be done at a stage which allows a positive result to be the net effect of that investigation and not simply a negative result which would mean: yes, we suspected all this was happening, we knew the situation, we went in and closed down the operation.</P>
    <P>If matters are suspected to be going awry at an earlier stage it is right that an investigation takes place early.  I know there are pitfalls in that it can affect the <Col N="1740" /> creditors of a company who can get worried as to the consequences of the investigation and it could create possibly the wrong impression that the company were in extremely serious trouble so that the net effect of one trying to be positive could in fact be negative in a sense.  This, then must be dealt with in a cautious way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill before us today I would ask the Department how much of the 1963 Companies Act was really effected?  How much of it was utilised, how much of the weight given to the various sections in the Bill over a period was used?  It has been said earlier that we are great at devising all these mechanisms &mdash; and in many ways we are probably right to devise them &mdash; but do we actually enforce them?  With a Bill of this weight there is a number of areas in which the provisions can be enforced.  While the legislation is desirable in dealing with the more obvious areas, if it is put into operation in the more subtle areas, it can be of general benefit thus leading to stability in the market and to companies being much more stable in their operations and much more professional.</P>
    <P>I thought it was ironic earlier to hear someone say that if a person has not got a high level of education &mdash; his only qualification might be that he is an expert toolmaker or whatever &mdash; and he forms a company and it is suddenly successful, he could be held responsible for being the accountant and doing everything in the business.  Obviously he could not be held responsible but if his business is to prosper &mdash; and this is a fault in Irish industry and it is a fault of people who set up these companies &mdash; he should realise that he is not the expert and once the company begin to grow and sustain themselves, he should bring in financial expertise.  Obviously this is what we are trying to get at; it is something positive.</P>
    <P>However, it is not only in the area of financial expertise that companies need assistance but also in the area of marketing and production.  It would be misleading to suggest that somebody who has done this will suddenly be responsible for all aspects of the business.  My contention is that if he remained in that <Col N="1741" /> position the business probably would not be able to grow sufficiently and would probably flounder not because the ideas in the business were wrong but because the expertise that was necessary to sustain and help it to grow was not brought in at the time when the business was in a position to handle it.</P>
    <P>Another area dealt with in the Bill, and which is contentious in many ways, is the question of directors' loans.  I would not go so far as to say that there should be no such thing as a director's loan.  There are many reasons why directors who have, perhaps, invested a lot of money over a period of years in their own companies, have worked hard and probably tied up most of their assets in the company, should be able for good and sound reasons to utilise loans from a company. However, I question the figure of £2,500. This suggests that a person who is in a company which may not be doing very well and not able &mdash; and there are many examples of this &mdash; to loan a director some money, is as entitled to gain £2,500 as a person who is in a very successful company with a large turnover and a large number of employees.  Obviously this aspect will have to be looked at on Commitee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that a balance has been struck here.  There has to be some limit in the amount and there may be room for having a minimum to an upper limit range which would set down certain criteria for the availability of loans.  It is wrong to simply set a maximum loan of £2,500.  I am not suggesting that we are talking in terms of a director being able to take out a loan of £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000.  The syndrome of a company being a personal bank to a director is not on.  Over the years this has been a feature in many companies in different areas of the country which have gone under. People who were involved in companies, and particularly small companies, felt that because they had achieved a certain status and standard they were entitled to draw from company funds &mdash; funds which were probably badly needed by the company for reinvestment in equipment, machinery and future employees. <Col N="1742" /> Moneys were drawn out of a company's funds which meant the difference between a company being successful or going under.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which the Bill deals is very pertinent in this country today with the take-over bid of one of our major industries &mdash; the declaration of the 5 per cent minimum share capital in public limited quoted companies.  This provision is extremely important because we live in a world of mergers, take-overs, megamerger take-overs, etc.  This fact should always be borne in mind and will have to be dealt with not just in the context of company law but also in the context of the future of business.  I think that this is getting out of hand because the object of many of the companies who want to take over other companies, be they larger or smaller, is to gain control of certain aspects of those companies.  For example, they may want to gain control of a certain area of the market in which a company might have a major share or of a brand which is either a competitor to their own brand or is in some way compatible with expanding their own portfolio.  Once that aspect of a company has been taken over there may be other elements of the company which are not suitable to their business and what happens of course, is that, asset stripping occurs, companies are broken up and aspects of the company are sold into the marketplace, particularly aspects of the company which cannot stand up on their own.  Because they were part of a larger network these aspects of a company were cushioned in many ways and were probably viable as part of the overall entity but will not stand up on their own.  Obviously, the result is that employees are suddenly exposed, job losses occur and the company closes down.</P>
    <P>In a country like Ireland which has a small population and a low density of population these effects on people in small towns and villages can be huge.</P>
    <P>The onus on a person to declare a 5 per cent stake in a company is tremendously important.  In some instances the take-over of many companies and the deals involved do not make sense.  People who <Col N="1743" /> have built up small companies over a long number of years want to know at a very early stage if a predator is on the market. Obviously if a predator is perceived to be hostile it is going to take time for the directors of a company to decide what is best for the company.  They have to decide whether the person trying to take over their company has in mind the best interests of what the company has developed over a number of years or whether it is simply a mega-take-over or asset stripping to the detriment of what the company had achieved in the past. Of course, it also has the effect on the other side of the coin, that if a company perceives that it is a very compatible and friendly take-over &mdash; and even though the take-over company may have bought up a 5 per cent stake but may not have initially thought of taking over a larger stake &mdash; it allows the people who own the company to say to them: &ldquo;We know you have a 5 per cent stake and because we perceive you to be a friendly investor in our company perhaps there is room for further expansion and investment in our company in the best interests of the company&rdquo;. This aspect of the Bill has to be looked at from this point of view as well.</P>
    <P>Insider dealing is fashionable and seems to have just broken in on the world during this decade.  However, I suspect that insider dealing has been going on since the first companies in the world were founded and is certainly nothing new.  What is new is the size, intricacies and involvement of insider dealing.  This has reached such a professional level that it is nearly a business entity in itself, as has been shown by what happened in the United States.  In dealing with this area the obvious situation where somebody is involved in a company, is about to takeover another company and is in a direct position to tip off somebody else, is very clear but there is a large grey area involved in insider dealing.  Let us be honest about it, any institution or individual who invests in a company does so in the first instance because he believes a company is sound, has potential to grow, that he will get a return on his money and <Col N="1744" /> that his initial investment will appreciate by the value of the shares in that company increasing.  He will have a large level of investigation and knowledge accumulated before he will invest in that company. Because Ireland is such a small country, the number of people in the business community involved at stock exchange level is very small in comparison with other countries.  They all probably know each other extremely well and it is very hard to find the line between insider dealing and people in the marketplace talking about a certain company which seems to be doing fairly well or has reached the stage where it is ripe for a take-over.  How does one decide at what stage one becomes involved in insider dealing in the grey area?  We have all heard of the possible take-over of companies which have been referred to, in the past six months.  For instance, the speculation with regard to Waterford Glass is a very good example.  Rumours were emanating from America about investors who had a large weight of financial credibility and financial backing behind them.  Obviously this information filtered through into this country and shares started to rise and speculation about a take-over was rife.  I am not saying that this was a case of insider dealing driving up the shares but I am referring to the grey area and at what point one can police this, given the stock exchange and the business community situation in Ireland, with people obviously knowing each other and hot on the same information at all times.  If one institution decides for sound business reasons to invest heavily in a certain company it may spark off unbelievable speculation. Everybody suspects that something is in the air.  Is this to be denied by the company or to be encouraged or what is to happen in this area?  To make the direct insider dealing that we can all see immediately a criminal offence, is to move in the right direction because an impression is given that criminal activities of this nature do not really relate to other crimes in society and that therefore these crimes are somehow permissible.  This should not be the case because at the end <Col N="1745" /> of the day one is playing with the lives of people and their employment.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most important areas of the Bill relates to the disqualification of directors.  There are obvious reasons why people should not be allowed to form new companies and become directors of them.  People who have decided at an early stage that a company will not last, but buy in large stocks over a period of a few months, sell the stock without paying any of the creditors or worrying about the taxes collected from employees, and simply use all the goodwill of other companies, the Revenue and everybody else, to abuse the marketplace by amassing a fortune for themselves, and then get out of the company by closing the doors on a Friday afternoon without caring about anybody, should not be allowed to form new companies. An honest company nearby behaving within the rules and struggling on a daily basis to keep a company going can see such a person who has abused everyone, turn around and form a new company at practically a minute's notice. Some directors have actually formed new companies in the pipeline before closing down the original one, knowing that they were going to rip off the system and use the system to form another company. There should be certain basic criteria as to the credentials for people who consider themselves fit to be directors of companies. We should look at a person's track record, on the aspects of business they have been involved in and so on.  All these criteria should be taken into account when allowing people to form new companies and become directors.</P>
    <P>This Bill stipulates that if a company has gone bankrupt and the directors wish to set up a new company, they have to provide £50,000 fully paid up in cash.  I agree with Deputy Bruton in that there is no reason why any company starting out should not put up, in the first instance, a minimum level of paid-up capital.  Many companies have been formed with no real cash injection at all in paid-up share capital and this has caused a lot of problems.  If it is necessary <Col N="1746" /> for a director wishing to restart in a company to put up £50,000 why is it not necessary in the first instance to have a minimum figure to be paid up?  I am not saying that the figure should be £50,000, as for a lot of small companies that figure is probably too high, but the figure could be put at £5,000 or £10,000.  This suggestion is worth looking at.  It is a definite contradiction that the second time round £50,000 is needed but in the first instance a very small figure or nothing at all is needed.  We will have to look at that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A question that has been occupying the minds of people over the last while is the position of preferential creditors.  We will put forward proposals to remove the Revenue Commissioners as a totally secured creditor.  It is unfair to many aspects of business that they should be put in this élitist position.  The financing of Irish industry is unique in that it is a totally lending based system.  It is interesting to note that in three of the most successful economies in the world, Japan, USA and Germany, the banking system and the operation of financing of businesses are equity-based.  Because we have a lendingbased system the secured creditors will always watch the value of the assets and once they think things are going to go astray they can secure what they are owed out of the business by closing down the company on the sale of the assets.  Their inclination all along has been to cut and run.  At no stage is the thinking along the lines of trying to save a company at an early stage by preventing the closing down of a company because some people are secured.  Many companies could have been saved if there were not secured creditors there.  The Revenue Commissioners would probably be in a much better position in that situation because a lot of the companies that have gone bankrupt would not have built up the huge debts owed to the Revenue Commissioners in VAT, PRSI and so on. When companies go bankrupt the biggest item is always in the area of money owed to the Revenue.  If this system was changed substantially it would free up the whole operation of business.  We will <Col N="1747" /> certainly put forward proposals on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The rescuing of the sick companies by the appointment of an examiner and how this whole system is to operate is very ungainly and potentially very expensive. I question whether it can actually work. I do not doubt the intention here, in that if a company has a chance of survival there should be some mechanism to help it to survive.  How, for instance, will smaller companies find the money to put up £200,000 if the debts that are probably preventing them from continuing are substantially lower than that?  This area has to be looked at.  On Committee Stage we will put forward proposals as to how these companies can be effective in operation. We will have many proposals on Committee Stage which I will not go into now. We welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this very necessary Bill.  We have all seen ample evidence over the past number of years to indicate that while previous company law was adequate to deal with matters arising when it was instituted, there have been a number of unsavoury instances which have made it apparent that there is a need to update the legislation.  More often than not, the emphasis has been on the minority of cases which have brought business into disrepute. These are the cases which everyone will remember.  I do not propose to go back over them but I am sure all of us in public life who attend meetings and seminars and meet the public on a regular basis are aware of the countless cases of blatant breaches of company law which put jobs, reputations and other companies at risk due to the unscrupulous behaviour of a minority. The indiscriminate action of some of those people has widespread and farreaching consequences and serious problems would have developed if action were not taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill is timely, especially in view of the developments expected in 1992.  The Bill establishes a framework whereby companies can <Col N="1748" /> achieve a better degree of health in the competition and business sense.  Legislation will now be on the Statute Book whereby it will be possible for employees and all directors of companies to get adequate information pertaining to the general health of their company.  There were instances in the past where a minority of directors had diverse interests which allowed them to operate in a fashion which was not in the best interests of their company or in the best interest of competitors.</P>
    <P>Some people will say that the Bill is too restrictive in the manner in which it will allow confidentiality to prevail.  It must also be taken into account that legislation which is too broadly based has been found to be ineffective in dealing with those who set out to flout it.  The proposals in this Bill are constructive and important.  They arose from unfortunate and bitter experience.  The Minister referred to the Companies Act of 1963 which was introduced at a time of business boom when competition was very obviously to the fore in the minds of the business community.  The emphasis at that stage was on productivity.  Subsequently we found that with tighter competition and tighter margins some people were encouraged, due to financial constraints, to go down a road which was not in their own interests, the interests of their company or the interest of the country. This Bill will be of tremendous benefit. It is highly technical and very long. Most of the important decisions by way of amendments will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was satisfied he was not speaking about company law abuses on a grand scale.  That would be quite true but members of the public who have been at the receiving end of unscrupulous behaviour by companies see their incident as paramount.  That is readily understandable.  The families of these people will remember the experience for a long time.  Many of them have made submissions to the Minister since they are in the best position to advise us as to what went wrong, where it went wrong, how it could have been rectified <Col N="1749" /> and the measures that should have been taken to ensure that the people responsible were not allowed to repeat the performance with other unsuspecting victims at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The latter point is of particular interest to those who have some insight as to what goes on.  Companies were deliberately folded up owing large amounts of money to the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and other creditors.  Perhaps their assets were not sufficient to meet their requirements and they found themselves in an awkward situation due to trading losses or bad management.  The same people were able to set up new companies with impunity and trade in the same fashion, repeating their performance.  This is the greatest cause of dissension in relation to company law.  The Revenue Commissioners, the general public and other people competing with unscrupulous competitors were at the receiving end of this type of activity.  It cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of a competitor. Most business people are realist enough to recognise that competition is cut-throat in the business arena, especially at times of financial stringency when there is even greater pressure. Some company may decide to make the rules themselves and gain an inside advantage over all their competitors. They may refuse to give information to the Department or the Minister which would have an effect on their future. They may refuse to return the amount required to the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare. They may employ people whom they know to be registered as unemployed. All these factors have been brought to our attention and must be taken into account.  When a legitimate company is trading against a competitor who is also operating on a legitimate basis that is all right, but if they are unfortunate enough to trade against a competitor who has the unsavoury advantages to which I refer, then there is a serious problem.  They cannot trade these people out of business. In the ordinary sense, competition will <Col N="1750" /> find its own level; one competitor or other will survive and the volume of business for the other declines but there will be legitimate competition to address the imbalance.  In the case of the unscrupulous operator, however, that is not the case.  He has always the advantage of the under-the-counter-deal.  That is where the most serious problem arises for the unfortunate legitimate trader.</P>
    <P>All of us as consumers have a certain role and responsibility in these matters.  In cases where companies have been deliberately folded up and have reopened with new names, with the same or essentially the same directors but with different information, different track records and so on, many people within the various sectors of industry recognise the track record and know what has happened in the past but still by virtue of the rules of competition find themselves forced to do business with these companies.  This legislation at least will go some way towards resolving that problem.  Companies that had not discharged honourably their statutory duties and that resurrected themselves from the ashes within a period of months and sometimes less than that, on going again into the marketplace seem to succeed.  They appear to be able to carry on in business as if nothing had happened, suddenly emerging as white, legitimate, honourable and upright organisations.  Sometimes traders have fallen by the wayside through no fault of their own, but those who stick out in our memory are those companies that deliberately went underground, deliberately withholding just requirements from the various statutory institutions. They set about drawing up a new company under a new name and setting themselves up to trade in a fashion which is meant to deceive.</P>
    <P>I have had representations, as I am sure everybody in this House has had, from all aspects of business and industry setting out cases in which they can give explicit information regarding the activities of various companies that have folded their tents and gone on to pastures greener, indicating in the second instance that the enterprise is being carried on <Col N="1751" /> in the same fashion as before.  Surely a genuine individual would be anxious to address the position, do something about the problems and ensure that there was no repetition?  As the Minister says, we are here dealing with a minority and that minority will always try to come out best, to advance at the expense of all others, whether it be the institutions of State or competitors in their own field.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions the need to have balance, and rightly so.  As other speakers have also said, there will always be companies which get the financial difficulties through no fault of their own. Through the death of a director or a senior partner the company may find themselves in difficulties and might not at an early stage take the necessary harsh measures to redress that situation and find themselves in difficulties.  At first glance, those people might find themselves put into the category of those to whom I referred a few moments ago.  It may be that liability could fall on a widow or widower or on a number of people in the company who simultaneously may have fallen on harsh times through absolutely no fault of their own.  They may be genuinely anxious to make some amends and try to rectify the position.  We then have to ask ourselves what society should do in those instances.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in our anxiety to tighten up to protect the interests of the State, employees and competition, there may be a tendency to go somewhat overboard, to drum those individuals out of the system indefinitely.  Provision is made for that in the Bill.  That is where it is essential that a very careful examination of the individual case be undertaken with a view to ensuring that fair play prevails.  Otherwise a widow could find herself being victimised or used as a scapegoat in a situation which may or may not have been her direct responsibility prior to events.  It is not the intention of anybody in this House to drum out of society individuals who through no fault of their own happen to have fallen by the wayside or have not fulfilled their duties as we would like to see them do.  The Bill is there to <Col N="1752" /> protect society, business and enterprise and the public, but we should not go witch-hunting where it can be determined that the situation arises not deliberately or through the fault of those concerned.</P>
    <P>We in public life probably have access to information which the general public do not have.  I am sure that all of us in this House will have had members of the public come along to our clinics or meetings who were able to point out, with quite an amount of justification, how a firm or company treated them wrongly or unfairly.  To all visible and outward examples and from the point of view of the information available to them, they would be quite right, but in many such cases we would probably have more personal information having had dealings with the individuals concerned which would throw a different light on the situation. Obviously we cannot publicise or explain to people generally about such matters because I always assume &mdash; and I am sure everybody here applies the same principle &mdash; that we never disclose confidential information when we are dealing with constituents.  This legislation will do something about that.</P>
    <P>The investigations into and the operations of a company will go some way towards exonerating the genuine cases in business and industry which get caught in a situation which is not of their making but which they might have been able to do something about had they had the expertise or the courage.  I say &ldquo;courage&rdquo; because very often &mdash; sometimes this applies to well established companies &mdash; on finding that trade is not as good as it was or because of pressure, the ultimate measures which need to be taken are unacceptable or unsavoury from the point of view of their pride, their track record in the community or, depending on the size of the company, the area within which they operate.  For that reason it is important that there is a balance built into the legislation which will give adequate protection to the firm and fellow directors and to the consumer while, at the same time, giving a reasonable degree of protection to the unfortunate victims of society who happen to <Col N="1753" /> be in companies which have genuinely fallen on hard times through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>In times of recession the chances are that there will be a greater number of incidents in the latter category than there would be ordinarily because in times of economic growth greater emphasis is on getting into the market place and competing as aggressively as possible, with less emphasis on the need to protect the individual interests in the event of a collapse.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to refer to, and this is incorporated in the Bill, is the availability of information to various bodies as to the health of a company. That is important for a number of reasons.  It is important that there be balance.  For instance, and this was referred to by Deputy Cullen, the availability of certain information to a competitor can be advantageous or disadvantageous.  It can be advantageous from the point of view of a legitimate competitor who is doing his or her business in a legitimate fashion with another company and realise something may be wrong, because business is not going as well as it should.  But they may do nothing about it, in other words, they may not take mean advantage.  On the other hand, it may be an advantage to some people who, having gained access to certain information, may use it to their trading advantage, maybe in a take-over.  This is where a new vista opens up.  The Bill deals with this very extensively.  I am not 100 per cent certain if this will be effective, and I have to be honest and admit that, but there is the danger that in some isolated instances there may be an operator in a very competitive enterprise who could gain information of such a nature as to make it possible for him to trade in such a fashion as to put the other person out of business.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to a couple of isolated cases which were referred to in this House over the past couple of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In that kind of case great care will have to be taken to ensure when this legislation has been in operation for some time that it is not abused, in other words, that the cure being introduced in this Bill will not act as a boost to what might otherwise be legitimate trading within the law but which might not be for the good of the community or the country.  I emphasise that point, not because of personal experience, but because of cases which have been brought to the attention of this House and which have been discussed here.</P>
      <P>I believe the availability of information and the necessity to provide such information are obvious, we all accept that, but it is also essential that the degree of information which may and must become available through the implementation of this Bill will not be of such a nature as to create a problem for the company which would have the effect of bringing this legislation into disrepute, in other words, that it would be used unscrupulously.</P>

      <P>In relation to companies, the competition can come from two sources, legitimate sources or the less scrupulous kind.  No company has any objection to strong healthy competition from legitimate sources.  One of the points which has been brought to our attention over the past few years is the recognition that strong and healthy competition was available and acceptable.  The difficulty arose when the competition came from areas that were operating with a distinct and unfair advantage over their competitors by virtue of their trading policies, the manner in which they employed people, rates of pay, the special concessions they gave some of their customers or the possibility that they withheld their remittances from the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare.  It is high time something was done to redress that imbalance.</P>

        <i>Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 42, 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee have recently furnished a report on the question of the deployment of search and rescue helicopters and this is being studied in my Department and the Department of the Marine.  Pending a decision on the issues raised in the report, I am not in a position to furnish the information sought.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> A report on the matter which the Deputy has raised is being considered by my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, and myself.  What the Deputy has suggested is being considered very carefully as indeed are all the other reports which have been presented to us by various committees. That report is now with the Minister for the Marine and myself.  We are studying that report and will be in a position to make suggestions and recommendations to the Government very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is very disappointing in the sense that surely at this stage he must have some views on what is a general policy matter.  Is the Minister aware of the immense difficulties which fishermen on the west coast, along with islanders, are having to put up with?  What I am trying to get at is that it is a policy decision that is required.  We have the Dauphin helicopters and people have been trained to fly them.  Therefore, it is now a question of strategy &mdash; where do we get the best value?  Does the Minister believe that the service should be relocated at Shannon from Baldonnell?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The east coast has also to be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is a very complicated matter.  As I have said, we are examining the report.  We hope to reach a consensus very shortly following which <Col N="1758" /> recommendations will be made to the Government.  I have taken into account what the Deputy has said and let me say to him that it was not for the first time today that we had to undertake rescue operations on the west coast, or indeed yesterday or since I became Minister.  At least this Government are doing something about the matter whereas the Government of which the Deputy was a member who were in office for four and a half years failed to do something about this matter.</P>

In view of the fact that this matter has been agitated for for some time can the Minister tell us if he has any idea at this stage of the order of magnitude of the cost of placing this facility on the west coast and the approximate number of aircraft and personnel that would be involved now that the Minister has enhanced capacity due to the action of the last Government in expanding the helicopter squadron?</P>

Would he accept the validity of the argument put forward by the West Coast Search and Rescue and Action Committee in their report which recommends that the squadron be located on the west coast, either at Shannon or at some other suitable location given the limited range of the Dauphin helicopter? Perhaps the Minister might also comment on whether we bought the correct type of helicopter when we purchased the Dauphins.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 6, 7, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 40, 43, 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Last June I obtained Government approval to set up an interdepartmental committee to examine and report on the pay, allowances and conditions of personnel of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The committee is chaired by Deputy Vincent Brady, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Defence and is comprised of representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Labour and Defence.  The military authorities were invited to put forward their views in relation to matters coming within the remit of the committee.  They have submitted their written proposals to the committee and have had a number of discussions with the committee.</P>
      <P>In response to a formal request which I received on 26 October 1988, I arranged that members of the committee would meet representatives of the spouses of military personnel.  That meeting took place yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the committee will be in a position to submit its report.  The matter is, however, being treated as urgent and will be brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.  The report of the committee, including its recommendations, <Col N="1765" /> will be submitted to the Government as soon as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the report of the committee it will be a matter for me and for my colleagues in the Government to make decisions thereon.  It would not be appropriate to try to anticipate decisions regarding any awards or their effective dates at this time.  If additional funding is required in 1989 to meet the cost of any increases in pay or allowances such funding will be provided separately.</P>
    <P>As regards morale, the position is that the welfare of the Defence Forces at all times has been the special care of successive Governments; pay and conditions of service are kept under constant review. In order to ensure that their pay keeps in step with that of other sections of the public service, the pay of the Defence Forces has been linked traditionally to the pay of civil servants.  The benefits of all increases, including appropriate grade increases, in pay and allowances granted to the Civil Service have been passed on to the Defence Forces as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>Rates of remuneration are not the only factors affecting morale in the Defence Forces.  In that regard I am pleased to say that I have recently secured the agreement of my colleagues in Government to modify, in the case of the Defence Forces the restrictions on promotions and recruitment as applied to the public service generally.  The situation regarding promotion will be kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The information sought regarding resignations/discharges in respect of the Permanent Defence Force is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>As regards the strength of the Defence Forces, 500 recruits were enlisted in July and August of this year in addition to the 700 recruits taken on in December 1987 and January 1988.  Arrangements are also being made for a further intake of 100 recruits for the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>I have asked one question about the actual workings of the interdepartmental committee.  My other question is this: based on the Estimates in the Book of Estimates for 1989 it appears that the committee, the Minister or somebody in his Department has already decided that the increase cannot be greater than 4 per cent because that is all that is contained there.  Will the Minister inform the House from where &mdash; if anywhere &mdash; this money will emanate because it appears to me that the Government have decided that there will be no increases granted?  That is in the Book of Estimates for all to see.</P>

There is a widespread feeling that the appointment of this review committee is a cosmetic exercise to cloud the issue and to save the Government from political embarrassment. He could dispel much of that by telling us how often the committee met.  Am I right in assuming that, because the numbers of personnel projected for 1989 will be the lowest for about ten or 15 years in the history of the Defence Forces, it will thereby effect savings to pay any increase that might be sanctioned?</P>

      <P>I was going to refer to morale but that has been dealt with, although I do not agree with the Minister's answer.  He also said that, traditionally, pay in the Army is related to the pay of civil servants.  Can he say to what grade of civil servant the pay of privates and NCOs is related?  They must be at a very low level of pay.  The second question is, in view of the fact that the members of the Army have no organisation or association to speak for them in matters relating to conditions and pay, does the Minister accept that, therefore, he has the responsibility, as he said, for the men under his charge in fighting this case?  Is the Minister, therefore, prepared to fight the case of the men in the Army with the Minister for Finance?  In view of the fact that there is no other organisation to do so, the Minister himself has accepted it is his responsibility.  Can he say here that he will fight their case with the Minister for Finance?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The result is quite plain, in so far as the Government set up the pay review committee last June just to do that.  As I have said, they are meeting continually and I expect to have this report very shortly. The pay and conditions of the Defence Forces are traditionally tied to the public service and where the public service get an increase it is automatically passed on to the Permanent Defence Forces.  In addition to that, the Government and I feel that the pay, allowances and conditions of the Defence Forces are ongoing and must be considered on an ongoing basis.  That is the purpose of setting up the review committee.  The response to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

Will he confirm that he will meet with them on an ongoing basis to discuss this ongoing review he talks about?  What demands were made of him by the national association at the meeting with him or his Department officials, and what was his response to those demands?

      <P>Would the Minister consider an interim increase pending this report that we are expecting as a gesture of goodwill and appreciation to these men for the work they are doing?  Secondly, is the Minister aware that in the Border areas in Counties Cavan and Monaghan which I represent, many of these soldiers are forced into doing tours of duty of 24 hour and 48 hour duration at a time, to bring home so little extra income to their wives and families?  Would the Minister not consider that this is not a good exercise for security, because soldiers at the end of a tour of 24 or 48 hours could hardly be expected to be as alert as a soldier starting his day's work early? Would the Minister not consider that this is an undesirable development and that extra personnel and sufficient income will be forthcoming immediately so they will not be put into this position?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The current rate of reimbursement by the United Nations in respect of UNIFIL troop costs is $600 per man-month against the envisaged figure of $1,048.  While I have no information as to the level of overseas allowance paid to their contingents by other members of UNIFIL, I understand that the rate of reimbursement by the United Nations is the same for all contingents. The rate of reimbursement is expected to amount to £3.7 million in 1988.  The under-payments by the United Nations arise from a shortfall in the UNIFIL fund which is due to the nonpayment by certain UN member states of their assessed contribution to the fund.</P>
      <P>Daily rates of overseas allowance paid by my Department in respect of service with UNIFIL range from £14.05 to £22.84.  These rates are not related to receipts from the United Nations and are expected to amount to £4.3 million in 1988.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Question Nos. 13 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>General routine orders provide that communications or requests from members of the Defence Forces in connection with service matters addressed to public representatives are expressly forbidden.  The expression &ldquo;service matters&rdquo; includes postings, transfers, promotion, overseas service and other matters connected with service in the Defence Force.</P>
      <P>The official channels for the processing of complaints or grievances relating to service matters are provided in the Defence Acts and Regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>These procedures are a fundamental part of military discipline and it is not proposed to change them.</P>

      <P>The question is specific with regard to the representations that members of the Defence Forces can make to public representatives and I am glad the Minister has given the very emphatic and clear answer which he has given here today.  I do not believe that anyone abroad would have believed, unless it has come from the Minister's mouth, that members of the Defence Forces cannot approach those people whom they elect &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is it not time that the Minister and his Department brought up-to-date the regulations governing the rights of members of the Defence Forces to air their grievances publicly, be it through their elected representatives or their own association within the armed forces?

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Air Corps received a request on 15 October 1988, from the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Shannon to airlift to hospital a boy who had been injured in a fall from his bicycle on Inis Mór.  An air crew was available but due to the existence of widespread fog and a forecast of continuing fog on the Aran Islands, the Air Corps, having consulted the Meteorological Service in Shannon, decided that it would not be prudent to undertake the mission at that time.  The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre then requested the assistance of the Royal Air Force, which carried out the mission, using a larger helicopter and with the advantage of greater experience in such operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I had referred to the question of competition, legitimate competition and competition deriving from other possible non-legitimate sources and the knock-on effects of such competition.</P>
      <P>The Bill does something to redress the imbalance whereby legitimate operators, directors and companies who carry out their business in an orderly fashion found more and more instances where they were put under pressure, for want of a better phrase, by the activities of those who carried out their business in a less legitimate fashion, I believe that the Bill rightly addresses this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area that needs to be addressed is the whole question of public confidence, which is important and fundamental to the entire document before us.  When the public have confidence in the operation of an Act of the Oireachtas it obviously does two things. It reassures those who want to carry out their business in a proper fashion and it dissuades those who have other intentions. It is most important that we give due recognition to those sections in the Bill which deal with that.  The tightening up of company law will obviously have the effect of reassuring those who wish to conduct their business in a satisfactory, straightforward and upright fashion and should have the added and very desirable effect of discouraging those who wish in some way, to bend the rules, the laws or <Col N="1860" /> the regulations in such a way as to benefit themselves or their companies to the detriment of competitors.  Business is all about competition and competition is healthy.  Good, strong, vibrant, legitimate competition can only do good both to the firm involved in carrying on the enterprise and to its competitors because competition begets competition and the result should be a healthier, sharper, fitter, leaner and more active corporation rather than a docile or sleepy operation which could be the position in cases where competition is not as active or as vibrant as in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Public confidence will be much greater after the passing of this Bill as everybody will have to comply with the regulations as set out in the Bill.  If they comply with the regulations in the Bill they will find that they will not have to face the dubious competition to which I referred earlier. The point I would emphasise is that if the public have confidence in the make-up of a company it should lend further to the stability of that company, the stability of its operations, the stability of its credit rating and its general enterprise.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to refer to is the question of the diverse interests of directors and that is adequately covered in the Bill.  Obviously company directors can and have had a number of diverse interests in the past.  While there is nothing wrong in principle with having one or more interests the danger arises if and when a particular trading enterprise comes under financial pressure and that pressure results in the diverse interests being juggled around in such a fashion as to present an unclear picture of what is happening.  Particular reference is made in two sections of the Bill to this matter on the basis that therein could be a serious problem which could evolve to the extent that not only the firm involved would come into difficulty but also other companies in which the particular director, or directors, could have an interest.  In other words the knock-on effect of a problem arising in one area &mdash; which in itself might be innocent or might be sufficiently small not to have a dramatic impact on other interests &mdash; could have <Col N="1861" /> a serious effect which, once started, might be very difficult to control and could have the added difficulty of putting jobs at risk in other areas, in other enterprises and in similar enterprises.  That of course would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>There is another matter and I wonder whether the Bill deals adequately with it. For instance, in planning laws when it was found that various vagabond developers down through the years brought the building industry into disrepute means were found to introduce insurance bonds and cash bonds to ensure against their escape from the system or from their failure to live up to their responsibilities. That legislation in planning laws is quite effective provided the various local authorities renew the bonds as they fall due because if they do not we will revert to the position that existed prior to the introduction of the 1975, 1976, 1977 and subsequent Acts.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some insurance cover is available in certain cases.  I know also that any overheads of that nature likely to be applied or superimposed on companies through the effect of company law is likely to have a carry over or a consequent cost to the consumer.  Notwithstanding all that, in certain dealings between companies and between companies and their consumers there should be some overall insurance type of bond or regulation which would cover the companies being placed at a possible disadvantage should something go wrong.  I know the Bill has dealt to some extent with this matter but I am not so certain that it will be dealt with adequately.  As long as human beings exist there will always be the odd case where some individual decides to have a go at a venture which might not be a useful venture from the point of view of remuneration and could have the result of putting the company in question in serious difficulty.  As a result those dealing with that company might have their interests best served by having some knowledge that at least a part of their liabilities could be met by <Col N="1862" /> way of a particular bond or insurance type of cover.</P>
    <P>In the case of exporting companies reasonable cover exists in this area.  From my discussions &mdash; and I am sure other Members in this House have had similar discussions &mdash; with people in the business world, this does not necessarily mean vast companies.  Very often these are small companies who have a considerable turnover, small corporations operating legitimately on a day to day basis quite effectively and satisfactorily but who, possibly, as a result of some hiccup in the system could well find themselves short of a considerable amount of cash by virtue of decisions taken outside the company.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk about restrictive practices to which I alluded earlier and I am not going to go back over a debate which took place in this House last year but I still think there it is possible &mdash; notwithstanding all that is contained in the Bill &mdash; whereby careful study of this legislation by very studious scrutineers could show a system still operating whereby there could be in operation some restrictive practices with the result that hardworking and legitimate operators of companies could find themselves at a distinct disadvantage.  While the Bill goes some way towards addressing that problem, the Minister may argue that it goes far enough, others will say it does not.  I have not made up my mind on the matter yet and I hope that during the Committee Stage it will be dealt with adequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the investigtions which may be carried out into a particular company.  That is something that is desirable and necessary in the sense that companies entering into contracts with other companies will obviously like to be able to avail of information which goes some way towards assuring them that they are dealing with a company who are above board.  Heretofore in many cases their <Col N="1863" /> confidence was dashed by virtue of subsequent happenings and while they were able to get certain information through the usual channels they found that by the clever operation of the system there were a number &mdash; and admittedly a minority &mdash; of companies and directors within companies who operated the legislation in such a fashion as to make life, to say the very least, very difficult for those who were prepared to operate legitimately.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the investigations into the affairs of a company, as proposed in the legislation, will prove to be invaluable from three points of view: (1) of reassuring the public; (2) of reassuring the competitor or the person with whom a particular company proposes to enter into a contract; and (3) it will have the added effect of reassuring the institutions of State who in the past have been left to carry liabilities which were totally and absolutely undesirable and beyond the bounds of all reasonable latitude which could and should have been given in certain instances.  In that respect, the old case can be argued as to whether it would be better to terminate the operations of a particular company or business earlier or later, depending on whether they are in a position to trade themselves out of their difficulty or whether their activities should be terminated before they involve others and the State in greater and everextended liabilities from which they can never extricate themselves or be extricated.</P>
    <P>Useful legislation is now being introduced whereby it will be possible to get a statement of health at an earlier stage in relation to particular companies.  This should put the Minister and his Department in a position to come to a balanced judgment with regard to the viability of a particular firm at a far earlier stage than could have been done previously.  Of course, quite an amount of this depends on the degree of co-operation but in the final analysis the Minister and his Department will have at their disposal sufficient <Col N="1864" /> legislation and information to be able to take decisions quickly, even if the information is not forthcoming.  I believe that this is a useful, constructive and progressive development.</P>
    <P>Passing inspections into the activities of companies and their operations, etc, to the High Court as opposed to the Minister, as in the past, is probably a good thing.  I know that very often we in this House have not agreed with decisions reached in the courts and likewise we have not agreed with decisions made by Ministers.  I am sure that on occasion even ministerial colleagues have disagreed with ministerial decisions.  I am sure this will continue to be the case and that Opposition people will disagree with ministerial decisions.</P>
    <P>However, this is a change which could be useful or which could cause difficulties. Access to the High Court was reasonably easy for people in this country. The only point I am worried about is whether vexatious inspections, of which there can be some, could cause problems for a company through the clever operation of this Bill.  For instance, information might be available to the effect that a particular company were trading very close to the financial borderline and in order to achieve an advantage it might be possible to instigate an investigation in to the affairs of that company, through the courts in this case, whereby attention might be focused in such a fashion as to make life for the company under investigation very difficult.  I know that in 90 per cent of the cases which are envisaged under the Bill that that would be desirable but there may be another 10 per cent of cases where that attention, when focused, might not have the desired effect and might have the effect desired by other interests.  This is something which should be noted.  I know that there are other safeguards built into the Bill but nonetheless the Minister should take account of this and attempt, if possible, to ensure that when this change is made that it is made for the better and that the <Col N="1865" /> ill-effects, if any, should be solely and wholly directed at those for whom it was meant in the first instance, as proposed to unfortunate or innocent bystanders.</P>
    <P>The other matter I should like to refer to &mdash; personal transactions between company directors &mdash; is dealt with in Part III of the Bill.  The Minister in his speech said that directors should not use their companies as personal banks.  If we check the history of various liquidations, both large and small, over the past number of years we will find adequate evidence to indicate the reason for the inclusion of this section in the Bill.  I know of cases &mdash; and I am sure other Members have had similar experiences &mdash; where the degree of lending that took place between a company and its directors &mdash; and incidentally this takes place on a large scale and I am sure, as has been referred to by the Minister in his speech, will continue to take place &mdash; meant that the liabilities of the director were transferred from them to the company.  The directors' personal transactions, wise or unwise, were suddenly found to be the liability of the company and they could do business from their privileged position of being within a firm, having all the advantages of being within a firm and having the back-up of the financial creditworthiness of that firm, while at the same time being able to speculate in a fashion which would be of personal gain to them and to the detriment of the company.  This was also referred to by Deputy Cullen.  Obviously the company would find itself in a serious situation.  That has happened on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the two types of difficulties that seem to have arisen in relation to the operation of companies during the past number of years and, in particular, during the past ten years.  That arises as a result of a slowdown in the economy where it has become that much more difficult for a business to survive. Often a genuine operation, where the company and its directors hold sincere views and have carried on their business <Col N="1866" /> to the best of their ability, will find themselves losing out at the end of the day.  I am sure other Members of the House have dealt with cases where a husband and wife and a family have been left with no resources through no fault of their own.  They find themselves virtually on the roadside and they cannot qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance or any cover whatsoever.  They find themselves having to queue for long hours in health centres for a supplementary welfare allowance, something they had not heard of before.  There have been countless instances where individuals in that situation have come to our clinics and told us that they did not even know what their entitlements were or what they could do.</P>
    <P>Some people will say that because people have made a mistake and have fallen, they should have known better, and that they only got what they deserved.  What about the human side? What about the families affected?  What happens to them?  The harsh measures that some people would apply in that situation are uncalled for.  If a person makes a mistake and recognises it and if the mistake was made through no fault of his own, there must be a means whereby he can become self-sufficient again.  There is no reason why he should not be allowed to trade again in the future.  I know that the Bill deals with that aspect and that there will be a lot of discussion as to the legitimacy of a plea for such people.  From my dealings with the public I feel that we should be careful not to condemn everybody out of hand. The Minister has referred to that when he referred to the minority of offenders. If a person gets into difficulty for reasons that can be readily explained to the institutions of the State, we should not irrevocably condemn him to a life of dependency on this State.  It is not good for the morale of business and of business people that such a thing would be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>On the other hand are the people who <Col N="1867" /> have been offended by the indiscriminate abuses of company directors and entire companies who have operated outside the system to such an extent that they have put a lot of other legitimate enterprises at risk and have by their general attitude to legislation indicated a contempt which is not helpful or desirable. The restrictions in relation to the personal transactions between the company and its directors is incorporated in the Bill and that is useful and timely.  Hopefully, they will operate as intended to take out the cowboys and to ensure that monitoring can allow the institutions of State to come to a value judgment as to whether an operation was satisfactory and as to whether the people involved were doing something that they should not have done.  Part III of the Bill refers to this conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill refers to the disclosure of interest in shares.  In the case of a small family operation it is not really relevant, but in the case of large corporations interests in shares outside of the company can have a very important bearing on the health and activities of that company or other companies.  I will not use this debate to refer to ongoing discussions in relation to shares, acquisition of shares or sale of shares in the recent past.  I am sure we have all read the newspapers and know what goes on in the business world.</P>
    <P>It is timely that this section is incorporated in the Bill for many reasons &mdash; because it is necessary, because of the development of industry and the expansion of companies which will obviously take place between now and 1992, and because of the greater competition which will be forced on Irish companies trading in this country, in other EC countries and in third countries and <i>vice versa</i>.  The amount of competition which was there previously was quite adequate but from now on the competition will be sharper, the stakes will be higher and they will become higher than we have anticipated <Col N="1868" /> at present, notwithstanding any recent events.  Because the stakes will get higher the interest will be that much greater and the need to succeed will be that much greater.  The need to survive will be the underlying factor in the operation of a company.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Bill is welcome.  It is extremely involved and detailed.  It is something that has been requested for a number of years.  The Bill required a great deal of study by the Minister and the Department and by the Minister's predecessors, before it could be introduced. I note the submissions made by the various interest groups prior to the Bill coming before the Seanad and before this House and I note the number of amendments that have already been made.  I have no doubt that a large number of amendments will be made in this House.</P>
    <P>It is important that a Bill of this nature should receive the most detailed scrutiny we can give it because the effect it is likely to have outside the House is so great.  We may find after the passing of this Bill that situations will arise which we have not anticipated.  When legislation as weighty as this comes before the House it should be possible to take into account the various submissions and the experience gained both here and in other countries.  It should be possible to formulate company law that will be useful well into the next decade and beyond.  Nevertheless, company law will have to be reviewed on a more regular basis in the future.  The previous Act was useful at the time of its passage more than 20 years ago and effective to a point, but there have been deviations from the spirit and the letter to such an extent that a number of people have lost confidence in the whole structure of company law.  Those trading with this country from outside the State were looking at the situation with a very jaundiced eye, for very good reason.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that when passed it will have taken account of the detailed submissions from various <Col N="1869" /> sections who have been in contact with the Minister and the submissions made during the course of discussion in this House.  If the finger is to be pointed afterwards, it must rightly be pointed at us as legislators.  If we do not perform our job adequately we will be blamed.  We should have enough experience at a general and personal level to formulate the most constructive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very lengthy Bill containing 11 parts and a total of 207 sections.  It has been broadly welcomed by most sections of the community and by Members of this House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is to be congratulated on his efforts in bringing it before the House.  The speed and efficiency with which reforming legislation is brought before the House is a hallmark of this Government.  This Bill will be welcomed by the business community who will see it as a genuine effort to tighten the law in relation to administering the affairs of companies and imposing a proper amount of responsibility on directors and other officers of companies.  Trade unions and their employee members will also welcome it and will see in it many provisions which will ensure the proper running of the affairs of companies which, consequently, must of necessity protect those employees and their employment.</P>
      <P>It needs to be said that this Bill when passed by the Oireachtas will not militate against companies with genuine trading difficulties or companies trying to administer their affairs properly.  It seeks to deal in a concrete and reasonable way with companies engaged in fraudulent or reckless trading or sharp practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the power of investigation.  I welcome the extension of the powers of the Minister, particularly as they relate to the possible appointment by the High Court of inspectors to investigate the affairs of companies.  If there are people who are nervous of these provisions or consider them to be an invasion <Col N="1870" /> of some nebulous right of privacy, all they have to do is read the sections which deal with this.  They will see that the powers to be conferred are intended to inhibit those who mean to defraud their creditors or engage in other unlawful activities.  This section might be amended to refer specifically to company employees.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 14 and 17 deal with the right to compel officers and agents of a company to produce books and documents and to make statements.  These sections are a welcome addition to our existing body of company law.  Some people have reservations which are related, for instance, to the right to silence in our criminal law.  The sections are necessary in this Bill because we must make provision for fraudulent and reckless trading on the grounds that not only does such trading affect the officer of the company concerned and a particular creditor, for instance, but may also affect fellow directors and officers of the company, the employees, all the other creditors and in certain circumstances the professional advisers to the company.</P>
    <P>Section 17 extends the powers of investigation to companies registered outside the State who are either conducting their business in the State or have conducted their business in the State.  This is a welcome addition.  I welcome also section 20 which gives power to a district justice if the proper information is laid before him to enter and search a company's offices or premises and to take away books and materials which may relate to the affairs of the company.  This section will prevent many abuses and in cases where abuses have taken place it will help to sort them out to the benefit of the creditors and the employees.</P>
    <P>I believe that many of the features of this Bill, apart from giving the law greater teeth in relation to enforcement of procedures against wrongdoers, will also have a deterrent effect on officers and directors of companies in the conduct of their affairs.  All these sections apply or <Col N="1871" /> could apply to many companies in this State, past and present.  In my constituency of Waterford we recently had a case where a company called Norco, which had received grant aid from the IDA and had enjoyed happy industrial relations and seemed to be trading profitably, simply closed its doors one weekend.  The workers were left without any redress and the company simply folded up and went away.  If this Bill had been in force and if the employees or creditors had had redress to it, many of the practices that went on in that company towards the end of its venture in Ireland could have been reversed.  It is that type of situation which this Bill will remedy and that is one of the reasons I welcome it in broad terms.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with purchasers for value of shares who did not have notice of wrong-doing or any ministerial or other directive.  I sympathise with those who have expressed reservations about this section.  In general the law in this country and in many other countries has given protection to people who purchase an item without notice of any wrong-doing and in complete good faith.  That possibly is a section to which we might look to somewhat soften the blow.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with transactions involving directors and I completely agree with the Minister's statement that a company should not be the banker for their directors or officers. That is a principle that almost goes without saying and I am glad to see it maintained and strengthened in this Bill. There may be cases from time to time where a small loan may be appropriate but, the Bill provides for that in stating that loans up to £2,500 may be made in certain circumstances to directors.  That is quite sufficient and I do not think that anybody could have a serious crib with regard to that Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the disclosure of interest in shares.  I am aware that the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland have <Col N="1872" /> certain reservations with regard to disclosure. They support completely the principle of disclosure of interest in public companies but have certain reservations in regard to disclosure of parent companies of public companies, or subsidiaries of public companies.  I have no such reservations.  The affairs, not just of public companies but of their parents and subsidiaries, and indeed associated companies, should be subject to public scrutiny in the interests of employees, creditors and all other interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very definite statement that he is very anxious to curtail, and indeed prohibit, the powers of people to engage in insider trading.  I agree with his comments on that subject. If one were to go into it in great detail, insider trading can be quite a detailed and esoteric subject.  Every layman knows that, basically, insider trading is wrong and in effect is a sophisticated version of the three card trick, as practised by some unscrupulous companies and unscrupulous officers of companies. It is a welcome addition to our law to see greater teeth being given in this area. There are one or two very small specific points in relation to that subject.  Section 92 (4) restricts the right of action for recovery &mdash; this is in terms of compensation &mdash; to a period of two years after the date of completion of the transaction in which the loss of profit occurred. A period of limitation of two years is quite short, given that in most other branches of our law a standard period of limitation would be three or six years and in some cases 12 years or more.  That subsection might be amended to read three years rather than two.</P>
    <P>Section 97 is the section which deals with a criminal prosecution.  Paragraph (a) refers to a summary conviction making a person liable to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or a fine not exceeding £1,000.  In the District Court at the moment in relation to what would <Col N="1873" /> be considered by most people to be relatively minor criminal offences the jurisdiction of the court &mdash; for a simple larceny, for instance &mdash; is up to two years' imprisonment and fines can be imposed or amounts recovered of up to £2,500.</P>
    <P>Given that we are dealing here with companies, that large sums of money may be involved and that, in a minority of cases admittedly, major frauds can be involved, I see no reason that the punishments to be administered in appropriate circumstances in the District Court should be substantially less than the punishments or sanctions which might be imposed in relatively minor criminal matters where the offender might be, and very often is, a person with little or no income, or from a very poor or deprived background, or with very serious social problems.  These are two minor comments in relation to the overall Bill, but they are worth taking note of.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with windingup and related matters.  Basically it gives greater teeth to the existing law and extends and amends it.  The provisions in that section are generally to be welcomed. Of note and particularly to be welcomed is the introduction by the Minister of the concept of reckless trading. We are all aware that any type of fraud is and has been punishable under our law, but many companies and many officers of companies have engaged in this practice of reckless trading to the detriment of employees, creditors and the like.  The attitude of some appears to be &ldquo;I literally could not care about anybody except myself.  I will do whatever I like in my own interests.  I take no cognisance whatsoever of the general public or my responsibilities to my creditors or employees&rdquo;.  The Minister, in bringing forward this concept of reckless trading, shows himself to be a very broadminded and far-seeing Minister.  This is a concept which will be welcome in broad measure, not just by lawyers or other professional people but by the general public.  It must be stressed, of course, that companies or <Col N="1874" /> officers acting honestly and responsibly need have not worries.  As the Minister says, this is a question of balancing the interests of one group against another but, in general, this concept is a very welcome one.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I welcome the extension of the principle of disqualification of directors from future directorships, or the restriction of their powers in regard to acting again as directors or officers should they be guilty of fraud or wrongdoing. The Bill is very specific in this regard.  It prohibits directors who have been found guilty of fraud from acting again for a period of five years and in some cases, if the circumstances merit, that period can be longer.  If an officer or company go into liquidation where there is no fraud but if there is insolvency and creditors remain unpaid, it is nice to see now that there will be incorporated into our law a condition that the person must satisfy the court or the Minister that such circumstances would not arise again and that provision has been made that they would not arise.  This is done, for instance, by providing greater capitalisation. I notice in regard to public companies that that capitalisation would want to be at least £50,000 and in relation to private companies £10,000.  These are large sums of money but, having regard to the present value of money, they are reasonable sums to make provision for.</P>
    <P>Part VIII deals with receivers.  It is to be welcomed that there is now a statutory duty on receivers to get the best price for any company property over which they have control.  Rightly or wrongly, many people have felt that receivers were not so much interested in getting the best price so that the employees and creditors of a company can be protected as they are in getting rid of the property.  This is a very welcome provision.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision under which interested parties &mdash; and this includes receivers &mdash; can come into court if they have a problem in relation to the company or the administration of its <Col N="1875" /> affairs and ask the court for directions. This will be a great comfort to receivers, directors, employees, creditors and anybody who has anything to do with the company in difficulties.</P>
    <P>Part IX is one of the most forward looking parts of the Bill and provides a very positive indication of the Government's concern to help companies who find themselves in financial difficulties. Very often our laws simply penalise those who have done wrong and impose sanctions on them.  It is a welcome addition in this Bill to see that the Minister is concerned about companies who are in trouble is making provision for them to come into court to look for court protection. As he said, companies who are sick can look for a return to health.  This is a new concept and one which is very welcome.  So far as I can gather the method of doing this will be the appointment of examiners and placing the company under the protection of the court.  If the examiner compiles a plan for dealing with the affairs of the company and the court approves that plan, it will be put in force, and remain in force, until the company cease to be under the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>I have one reservation about that.  In such circumstances I understand the debts of a company are to be frozen and no enforcement action can be taken by a creditor in relation to recovery of the debt due to him.  On the face of it, that is a very protective attitude towards the company but I could envisage a situation where many creditors and employees might be placed under an impossible strain by reason of the inability of the creditor company to recover a debt properly due.  We hear a lot about cash flow and the problems companies can face if they find themselves in difficulty.  This section could have a very serious knockon effect with companies in that category. As I said, Part IX is to be welcomed and is very forward looking but I have that <Col N="1876" /> one reservation about creditor companies.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the position of accountants and auditors in dealing with the affairs of companies, particularly in liquidations or receivership, is to be welcomed. May I digress? I am speaking now as a solicitor, but it has always puzzled me how company law has been extended so far as it applies to auditors and accountants to strengthen their powers, yet over a period we have seen efforts being made by people who genuinely do not know any better, to delimit the areas in which solicitors and the legal profession in general may operate.  I find that puzzling when, for instance, we see in this Bill the powers of auditors and accountants broadened to encompass more and more work.  However, that is not strictly relevant to this Bill.  It is a general observation.</P>
    <P>Part XI deals with offences generally and section 217 is as important as any other section in this Bill because it deals with the situation where companies or their officers allow the affairs of the companies to be wound down so that eventually the companies close their doors without paying their creditors or employees.  There is no fraudulent or reckless trading as such, but it is important to deal with companies and their officers who conduct their business in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister who was responsible for the passing of the 1963 Companies Act deserves a great deal of praise because it codifies the law in relation to companies. This Act has stood the test of time but since then we have seen many amendments as a result of directives from the European Community.  This is a substantial Bill, one which will broaden and strengthen the law in relation to companies in Ireland.  When we see how it is operating &mdash; and I have no doubt it will operate successfully &mdash; it might be useful to put all our company law together and codify it for the benefit of all who deal with companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> This Bill will be welcomed by the public at large and in particular by creditors and employees.  I congratulate the Minister on the tremendous effort he has made in bringing forward this Bill, and the speed with which he has done so, considering the other legislation he is putting through this House and the extent of his other responsibilities.  I hope the Bill has a speedy and safe passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister for bringing in this Bill which was introduced in the Seanad where it was debated at length on Second and Committee Stages.  The Minister said that if suitable amendments were proposed at Committee Stage he would accept them. He has shown a lot of goodwill towards the ideas put forward by Senators and I hope he will be as generous with Members of this House.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a continuation of the old British system.  If I have a regret it is that we have not tried to remove the mantle we inherited.  This is expressed in the way we tend to follow on legislation &mdash; as this Bill does &mdash; already in place in Britain.  It is only to be expected, as other speakers have indicated, that because we are members of the European Community we will have to continue to add to our law various pieces of Common Market legislation in regard to companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we tend to look with a jaundiced eye on people who are prepared to invest.  If, say, one becomes bankrupt in New York, and within a three or four year period had worked one's way to Los Angeles or San Francisco, the best banks in these cities would probably be prepared to lend you money.  As has been indicated, equity is available in the United States to keep companies going there.  However, in this country if a person becomes bankrupt they are condemned to hell, there is little chance that they will get up again because of the consequences of their names appearing in <Col N="1878" /> Stubbs Gazette and of the various related difficulties.  The attitudes currently prevailing in this country break the spirit of entrepreneurs.  I commend the Minister for trying in this Bill to deal with rogue companies and directors and with insider dealing.  What is important is that the implementation of this legislation be policed.</P>
    <P>Something major has to happen in this country.  We may have been given the lead by the British.  Who in this country would have thought that Lester Piggott, the internationally famous jockey, would have received a three year sentence for abuse of the taxation code? That case had a dramatic effect not alone in the United Kingdom, but also in this country or was reflected in regard to the amnesty announced by the Minister for Finance. As the closing date approached there was a rush of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no doubt but that many of those people would have paid up long before the amnesty was announced if the legislation had been policed.  It was our unwillingness to see the law implemented and policed that enabled these people to accumulate such large sums of money.  Had this money been paid to the Exchequer many jobs could have been created and a considerable number of people would not have had to emigrate.  There has been the attitude of a certain sympathy with the person who runs the risk and runs it to the very end.  We do not push him too hard, we give him another chance.  Under company law we have given him another chance.  In 1963 we implemented a Consolidation Act.  We have seen rogue companies set up, companies closing and unions and employees discovering that taxes and PRSI had not been paid.  Politicians have sought in the past to relieve the pressure on these companies, asking the Revenue Commissioners if they would accept phased payment of back taxes and PRSI payments.  We allowed them latitude but we are now paying the <Col N="1879" /> price for the lack of policing of the legislation. This has had an effect on the employment prospects of many people. If this Bill encourages the authorities to police the law as enacted a good days work will have been done by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Delayed payments cause unnecessary harm to creditors.  Deputy Swift was right to illustrate this fact as I have seen companies go to the wall in my own constituency and creditors being left destitute because they extended their goodwill for too long.  It is time that the position of creditors was strengthened. This issue is tackled in certain sections of this Bill and I hope by the time Committee Stage is completed those sections will have been further strengthened.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I wish to make.  I would not quibble with the current system.  I like the idea that companies can be easily established.  I believe that accountants and solicitors do a good job in making their clients aware of limited liability status.  At present there are many small companies run by husband and wife teams.  A husband or wife wishing to establish a company may go to a solicitor or accountant and be asked if anybody else will be involved.  They may indicate that shares may be taken out by the other spouse.  The responsibilities which would fall on the silent partner are not always fully explained at that time so I would like to see the law providing for a solicitor or an accountant to be involved in the setting up of a company to indicate to the silent partner that while there is limited liability there are exceptions.  For instance, where fraudulent intent is proven some spouses are not aware that debts can accrue to them.  Therefore, we should require that an accountant or a solicitor give an independent appraisal to the silent partner.  It is not good enough to say that a person can take a document home for the other spouse to sign it and to have it back the following day.  We have now reached the stage where both <Col N="1880" /> partners in a partnership should be made aware of their responsibilities in what they are undertaking and of the liabilities which could accrue to them.</P>
    <P>I have read most of the Second Stage debates in this and the other House and do not want to repeat anything already said.  One matter that has been brought to my attention for some time past has been that of companies who advertise in newspapers a service, that of giving advice as to how to invest money.  While there is at present some protection here in that regard, I predict that after 1992 the stage will be set when a Frenchman, German or Englishman can advertise in our newspapers, giving free advice with regard to investment.  Of course such people will be fly-by-nighters.  I wonder whether the Minister has examined that aspect of company law to ascertain whether any protection might be built into the provisions of this Bill with regard to such potential advertisers, or whether they could be prohibited in some way from preying on innocent people.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on confronting the problem of insider dealing which constitutes another pushover.  It is really by way of policing of the law that the regulations with regard to insider dealing will be respected.  In this respect I have the impression from a reading of the provisions of this Bill that the Stock Exchange will be self-regulatory.  I do not know that that will operate satisfactorily in practice.  For instance, I know that people on the New York Stock Exchange, in respect of what would be considered to be a minor misdemeanour here, have spent lengthy terms in prison for their indiscretions.  If Americans feel it essential to have hard and fast rules on insider dealing and they can enforce them, it should be possible for us to tackle the matter.  It should be remembered that the long-term future of this country will be dependent on workers and directors having shares and trust in their companies. It is my contention that insider dealing should constitute a criminal <Col N="1881" /> offence.  I am not certain from a reading of the provisions of the Bill that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I might commend the Minister also on the idea of the appointment of inspectors which constitutes a step forward.  Certainly in so far as constituency politics are concerned this provision will mean that much pressure will be taken off public representatives by means of there being now a mechanism by which companies can seek the protection of the courts in obtaining an operational period within which they can trade out of their difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this long overdue Bill.  For a number of years past I have been of the opinion that something needed to be done to tackle and eliminate the gangsters who operate here in various types of businesses.  I refer to people who set up businesses, mainly in the electrical and household goods trade, who operated under a cloak of high-powered advertising, sometimes below-cost selling. They then closed shop, walked away, owing their creditors and the State millions of pounds, in the case of the latter by way of unpaid taxes.  In many such instances their workers found themselves redundant, discovering it too late to tackle the problem of unpaid social insurance contributions by their former employers.  Because those contributions had not been paid they did not qualify for social assistance.  Something had to be done to abolish those types of cowboys. At the same time, legitimate companies who conformed to the regulations laid down by the 1963 Companies Act experienced severe financial hardship on account of the recession and lack of confidence in our economy.  Such legitimate companies, especially those in Border areas, had to compete with counterparts in the North when the incidence of trading anomalies was very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister introduced the Bill in the Seanad, the prolonged <Col N="1882" /> debate that took place in that House, the number of amendments tabled and the additional sections inserted convinces me once more of the great role the Seanad plays <i>vis-á-vis</i> legislation.  Those people who advocate the abolition of that House should take a good look at Bills such as this one &mdash; and indeed the Control of Clinical Trials Act and the tremendous work done on it &mdash; and they will be equally convinced of its usefulness.  Even bearing in mind the expertise of people like Deputy John Bruton and his contribution, including any amendments he may table to this Bill, Bills leaving this House very often leave much to be desired.  I know what I am talking about, having been a Member of the other House for four and a half years.  Therefore, I advocate that those people who recommend the abolition of that House should think again.  Indeed, some might be glad to gain a seat there some time themselves.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Bill before us constitutes a history of the practices of companies, good and bad.  It is also my belief that it constitutes a pooling of the resources of the Department and the business sector which is a very good thing. While long overdue, its introduction is opportune in the sense that we are now experiencing a climate of industrial peace almost historic in nature.  In this respect I compliment the Minister for Labour on whose initiative and hard work this climate of industrial peace has been brought about by way of his negotiations with our social partners.  I also compliment the social partners, in particular the trade union movement, on their role in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very technical and complex one.  I should prefer to deal with the practicalities as I know them in relation to companies and their solvency.  There is now, thankfully, a growing sense of responsibility in the commercial sector. The main reason for this is that that sector has renewed confidence, and for good reason, in our economy.  For much too <Col N="1883" /> long that sector experienced a sense of total insecurity.  There existed a lack of confidence in the economy, a sense of insecurity <i>vis-á-vis</i> the market and a total lack of confidence in our banking system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 38 on yesterday's Order Paper dealing with delays in cataract operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 38 on yesterday's Order Paper in my name reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health if people requiring cataract operations are experiencing indefinite delays; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many of these people are living alone; if he has any plans to resolve this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health replied as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indefinite delays are not experienced by patients requiring cataract operations. The waiting time for this operation varies from health board to health board.  Priority is given to urgent cases.  Information regarding the proportion of people awaiting cataract operations who live alone is not readily available but the majority of such patients are elderly.  The Working Party Report on Services for the Elderly &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> has recommended that <Col N="1884" /> present arrangements for cataract surgery in the elderly be reviewed to ensure that those requiring treatment receive it in reasonable time and that the service is expanded to deal with increasing numbers of elderly people. I am currently examining the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>I asked for permission to raise this matter because I was not satisfied with that reply.  I regret to have to say that there is an indefinite delay in relation to certain categories for these operations, that is the category dealt with in public wards by a consultant free of charge, in other words, the middle income group.</P>
    <P>This matter came to my notice when I was asked to help a patient from County Monaghan, the constituency of the Minister for Health.  The patient is not elderly. For this operation he would be classified as one of the younger patients as he is in his late fifties or early sixties.  He was seen by a consultant, having been referred to the Eye and Ear Hospital, in August and he was informed that an operation would be necessary.  When he did not receive any notification he contacted me.  I got in touch with the consultant concerned and learned that I would have to contact the hospital.  I did so and I was told that they were booked up until the end of the year. I was told that it would be well into next year before this patient was reached.  I regard that as entirely unsatisfactory. The fact that the man is not elderly makes it worse in one way because he would have expected to have good eyesight and it is all the greater hardship to be without it.  He lives alone.</P>
    <P>The man who contacted me knew that another patient from County Monaghan saw his consultant in Dublin regarding the same operation.  He is an elderly man and, having seen the consultant in Dublin, he was called to hospital there about a forthnight later, on a Sunday, and he was discharged the following Friday having had his operation successfully <Col N="1885" /> completed.  There is a difference.  In the latter case the man who was contacted a fortnight after he had seen the consultant had VHI and could pay his way. The other unfortunate man, who is living alone, was stricken earlier than he might have expected with this complaint but, three or four months after seeing his consultant, he has not been called to hospital. It will be well into next year before he knows when he will be attended to.  That is deplorable.</P>
    <P>When this service is available to some people it is unacceptable that this man should be deprived of it for so long.  It is also unacceptable because it creates a very bad climate and considerable unrest. It makes people unhappy and it convinces them that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor and now it is going a step further with one medical service for the poor and another for the rich.  That is bad in a country where so many people are trying to overthrow our system of government, some by lawful means and some by unlawful means.  It is providing ammunition to overthrow our democratic system which is the best system devised when it is properly worked.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the junior Minister, Deputy Leyden, is here this evening because we all know he is a caring man. A few years ago he kicked up an unholy row in his native County Roscommon because a hospital for the elderly was threatened with closure.  He was in here at Question Time at every available opportunity to protest at the failure of the then Minister for Health to provide the necessary services as he saw them and, as I hope, he still sees them.  It is also a coincidence that the county concerned is one which I have the honour to represent and in which the Minister for Health resides.  In his reply the Minister said there are different waiting times in different health board areas, but for the life of me I cannot understand that.  I cannot understand why, because a man lives in the North Eastern Health Board <Col N="1886" /> area he should have longer or shorter to wait than the man who lives in the Western Health Board or Southern Health Board area or somewhere else.  These operations, or most of them, are done in Dublin.  This is a scandal &mdash; it is not too strong a phrase &mdash; that a man should have to wait less than a fortnight to be diagnosed, get the complaint attended to, get whatever is put into the eye in, be discharged and be in comfort, able to read the deaths in the newspaper and to drive his car which he was not able to do previously because he could pay for it, and the other man is sitting at home moping in the dark not knowing when he is going to be attended to.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputy to exercise his influence. There are two sorts of influence. One is influence properly so called, the other is nuisance value.  I do not care which of them he exercises as long as he exercises one of them within his own party and reminds them of what he was sent out to do.  I am sure Deputy Terry Leyden did not go down to Roscommon and kick up the row he was kicking up there about the breakdown in the health services and did not come in here and kick up the row he was kicking up here without the benediction and even encouragement of his own Fianna Fáil Party. Indeed, he got a bit of promotion as a result of his activities in his constituency. I am asking him to get to work on his party and his Minister in all seriousness.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that it is unfair that one person should be kept with this very unpleasant complaint, especially for rural people, farmers, who are moping around in the course of their duties in the dark not able to see, for what I call this indefinite period, because I cannot find out what is going to happen, and surely that is indefinite.  It is unfair and it is not good for the country.  There are things that can wait and there are a couple of things I would say cannot wait.  One of them is in order to mention here and the other might not be so much in order.  The health services cannot wait.  People such as we <Col N="1887" /> are talking about cannot wait.  Children with malformation of teeth cannot wait, and the by-roads of Ireland cannot wait. I do not think Deputy Leyden would disagree with me on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for his comments, first, in connection with my situation.  Just because one aspires to ministerial office, as you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Fitzpatrick know, one does not change one's attitude and still would have the same concern when in Government as one would have in Opposition.  However, when you are in Government you have responsibility for raising the funds to pay for the services.  That is the only difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a detailed statement here but I will just give an outline of the position.  I am not going to lecture Deputy Fitzpatrick about the financial situation, debt or cost to the health services because he <Col N="1888" /> is well aware of the position.  He has dealt with a specific problem which is there. He says waiting for any time is a problem, particularly in cataract operations.  I have dealt with some cases, so I appreciate what happens.</P>
    <P>Let me give the overall scene.  We have expenditure of £1.3 billion on health services at the moment and the difficulty is in trying to provide resources for the health services generally.  In particular there are inevitably problems in relation to choices between the many competing demands for resources.  A decision to allocate additional resources to a particular hospital or service would mean a reduction in some area of the health services.  Elective surgery is one area of the health services where demand outstrips supply.  While I cannot accept that indefinite delays are experienced by people requiring cataract surgery, a review of the situation around the country indicates that there are waiting lists for these procedures.  The number on the waiting lists and the waiting time for this operation vary from health board to health board.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to add a word of caution in interpreting waiting list data.  The numbers on waiting lists are not as important as the time spent on a list.  A lengthy but fast moving list is not as big a problem as a small but slow moving or static list.  Urgent cases always receive priority treatment.  I want to emphasise that the urgent cases are being dealt with as a matter of priority.  There is also regular assessment of those on the waiting lists by the consultants involved who take into account each patient's condition and other circumstances in determining that patient's place on the list. Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out that those living alone particularly are a priority, and I agree.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to outline the position concerning cataract operations in each health board area.  However, I want to refer to developments concerning the two eye and ear hospitals in Dublin and Cork. <Col N="1889" /> My Department's policy in relation to ear and nose treatment and ophthalmic services is that they should be provided at a general hospital.  Accordingly, in the rationalisation of hospital services in Dublin it is proposed that the specialities at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital be transferred to appropriate general hospital in Dublin and to the Midland Health Board for which the Royal Victoria has been providing ENT and ophthalmic services pending development of facilities for these at Tullamore General Hospital.  St. Vincent's Hospital has been proposed as the regional centre for eye services while discussions are ongoing concerning the transfer of ENT services.  Ophthalmic services in the Southern Health Board area will transfer from the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in Cork to the Cork Regional Hospital from 14 November 1988.  A new ophthalmic out-patients' department has been provided at the regional hospital to facilitate the transfer, and capital funds of £250,000 have been approved for equipping the new ophthalmic unit.  A fourth post of ophthalmic surgeon for the Southern Health Board area was approved at the September meeting of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I am confident that the new ophthalmic unit together with the additional consultant post will greatly improve ophthalmic services in the Southern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has drawn attention to the fact that many people needing cataract operations may be living alone. I understand that information on the number of people requiring cataract operations who live alone is not collected by hospitals.  However, I accept that many people requiring this operation are elderly and, of course, many old people live on their own.  The impairment of eyesight in old age is a major cause of immobility and dependency.  The removal of cataracts by microsurgery is one of the most effective ways of improving the sight of elderly people.</P>
    <P>Last month the Minister was presented <Col N="1890" /> with the working party report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i> This is a very comprehensive report which provides a blueprint for planning services for the elderly in future years.  The benefits to the elderly of cataract operations and the cost effectiveness of the operation are referred to in the report. It recommends that the Department should review present arrangements for cataract surgery in the elderly to ensure that those requiring treatment receive it in reasonable time and that the service is expanded to deal with increasing numbers of elderly people.  I am currently examining the recommendations of this report and I can assure the Deputy that the arrangements for cataract surgery will be dealt with in the context of discussions with the health board to implement it.</P>
    <P>Let me just give an idea of the situation. In the Sligo General Hospital, for instance, there are 62 people on the waiting list with a five to six months delay.  The waiting period varies quite considerably from hospital to hospital. There is a much longer wait in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital at the moment.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's constituents and indeed the Minister's constituents in the Cavan-Monaghan area would be referred mainly to that hospital. This is something I am certainly going to look into as a result of the points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    <P>In relation to the variations in waiting lists at different hospitals, in the Western Health Board area there is at least a two year delay at the moment, it is down to five or six months in Sligo General Hospital, and it is about nine months in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital. Those figures are unacceptable to the Department but we have to bear in mind also the question of resources and the utilisation of the resources by hospitals.  I believe rationalisation and improvement of the services will take place.  I will certainly look at the situation in the context of the variance between the different hospitals.  The waiting period is longest in <Col N="1891" /> the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick is well made.  We would all be concerned about any patient waiting for an excessive length of time for a cataract operation.  I will discuss this matter with Deputy O'Hanlon and we will take whatever action we feel is necessary, depending upon the availability of resources, to try to alleviate this situation.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that patients who require urgent treatment should ensure that this <Col N="1892" /> is brought to the attention of the consultants. People living alone &mdash; and I have particular cases in mind &mdash; require urgent treatment because they are totally immobile without the operation.  It has been of tremendous assistance to people.  We will look at the situation to see what we can do to improve it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the practice recently introduced by the Valuation Office of adding a valuation of the value of the milk quota to the market value of dairy farms in family farm transfers; whether this practice will create a considerable disincentive to the transfer of holdings to young farmers because of the additional stamp duty payable; and if he has proposals to remove this disincentive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the availability of a milk quota is one of the factors taken into account by the Valuation Office in assessing the market value of agricultural land. For stamp duty purposes, a milk quota is property which attaches to land and which is valued in conjunction with lands which are being leased or transferred. This is in line with normal practice for other types of property.</P>
      <P>In providing a valuation service for the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty and other capital taxation purposes, the objective of the Valuation Office is to estimate the accurate value of a holding and the question of creating disincentives to the transfer of family farms does not arise.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer has a number of sources of income.  His income tax liability would normally be deducted at source through the PAYE system (taking into account credit for DIRT on building society interest paid).  However, in the absence of returns of income for 1987-88 and 1988-89, the amount of his income tax liability has to be established. Consequently a notice of preliminary tax was issued to the taxpayer in respect of the year 1988-89.  If he considers that his income tax liability will be discharged in full under the PAYE system and that he has no additional payment to make under self-assessment, he should indicate this on the relevant part of the notice of preliminary tax and submit it to the Office of the Collector-General, without delay. He should also reply to the letter of 1 March 1988 from the Inspector of Taxes and submit completed returns of income for 1987-88 and 1988-89.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of numbers serving, on the dates closest to those requested by him for which they are available, is set out in the table below.  The earlier figures are based on returns made by Departments to my Department and the current ones on the staff information system, respect of officers actually serving.  Authorised establishments have not been systematically recorded centrally, and these figures are not therefore available on the basis sought.</P>

      <P>Following the recent Government announcement that an additional £8 million is being provided for farm grants, the limited staff resources available for this work are being concentrated on speeding up grant payments so that the arrears can be cleared as quickly as possible.  The response to representations and inquiries about particular cases recently has been that all outstanding grants will be paid inside a few weeks.  This response has been generally accepted as adequate interim acknowledgment of their representations. As a result of the concentrated effort, to speed up payments, it is expected that all the arrears will be cleared by the end of this month.</P>

      <P>Applicants for social assistance payments who have capital are assessed with a notional income from the capital. Under existing arrangements in relation to capital alone, a married couple could have joint capital of over £53,000 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension. Under the notional income, the percentage <Col N="1814" /> rates used vary but the maximum 10 per cent of assessment is applied under the old age pension and unemployment assistance schemes to amounts of capital over a certain level.</P>
      <P>The deposit interest retention tax is refundable to a pensioner who is not otherwise liable for tax.</P>
      <P>The assessment system is not related to interest actually earned but is based on the determination of a capital value. Under the old age pension scheme a person can have means from all sources of up to £6 a week and still qualify for the maximum pension.  In the case of a married couple this would be £12 per week.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 7 May 1988 after which date payment was disallowed following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 21 June 1988 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He submitted notice of appeal on 8 July 1988 and indicated that he would submit further medical evidence which he did on two separate dates in July and August.</P>
      <P>The medical evidence was submitted to the medical adviser for his opinion and the case was submitted to the chief appeals officer on 14 September 1988.

      <P>Persons in receipt of the longterm rate of unemployment assistance are entitled to a weekly fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme provided that they (a) live alone or (b) reside only with a qualified adult dependant or child dependant.  A qualified dependant for this purpose is a person in respect of whom an adult or child dependant allowance is payable.  No fuel allowance is payable where any person other than qualified dependants are residing with the claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and qualified for a fuel allowance during the 1987-88 fuel season.  Payment of the child dependant allowance in respect of his eldest child was discontinued in August 1988 when the child attained 18 years of age.  As he is not a qualified dependant and is still residing with the household, the person concerned does not fulfil the conditions of entitlement to a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.</P>

      <P>Arrears of invalidity pension for the period 7 May 1987 to 7 September 1988 will be issued to the person concerned by payable order within the next ten days.  The delay in the issue of these arrears was due to the fact that the person concerned omitted to claim for a qualified child dependant on his application for the pension.</P>

      <P>The chemicals referred to are used to treat infections/parasites in farmed fish. They are only used intermittently and are used at low concentrations.

      <P>£2.36 million has been earmarked for aquaculture development projects in the latest decision tranche by the European Commission.  This level of grant-aid represents a major boost for the aquaculture industry in Ireland and is timely recognition of the commitment of the industry and the Governments programme for its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant-aid package follows an initiative undertaken by me with two specific objectives: these were to convince the EC Commission of the critical importance of the development of aquaculture <Col N="1828" /> to less developed areas in Ireland and to work with the industry and State agencies to ensure that projects submitted for grant-aid were presented in the best possible light.  A total of ten projects will be grant-aided from 22 submitted; of the 12 unsuccessful applicants this time round, ten remain eligible for grant aid in the next tranche.  This is the largest ever award to Irish aquaculture projects by the European Commission and compares with grant aid award of £0.994 million in April, 1988 in respect of eight projects from a total of 19 submitted.</P>
    <P>I will be continuing my efforts to secure high levels of EC grant-aid for aquaculture development in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine when he will introduce regulations or other proposals in order to ensure that smolt rearing in the context of fish farming takes place in tanks on land rather than on lakes as at present, in order to ensure that proper standards of monitoring of effluent and other pollutants can take place in such land-based conditions as opposed to the totally uncontrolled arrangements which operate at present; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the present arrangements do not require any form of licensing or evaluation from the point of view of environmental impact, whereas such activities taking place on land in land-based tanks would.</P>

      <P>Freshwater aquaculture is strictly controlled by the Department through a licensing arrangement under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  There is no basis for the Deputy's assertions that this activity is uncontrolled or not subject to proper evaluation procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department to encourage land based smolt rearing units and to phase out cage rearing of smolts in freshwater lakes.  Cage rearing was allowed as a temporary measure to help to meet the shortfall in the supply of <Col N="1829" /> smolts in recent years.  Land based units are preferable because greater control is possible over pollution and disease. There is also less risk of escape of the farmed fish.</P>
    <P>All fish culture in fresh water, whether in tanks or cages in lakes, is governed by the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. Cage rearing is only allowed in lakes where there are no significant stocks of wild salmon or trout.  Environmental monitoring is carried out regularly, at specified sites around the cages.</P>
    <P>Freshwater fish farms are also subject to planning regulations as implemented by local authorities.  In addition, the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment to which effect is being given in the State at present will formalise and strengthen procedures for the thorough vetting of freshwater projects prior to approval.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the criteria for Teamwork and other schemes operated in his Department; the way in which these are justified; whether the criteria involved pose any particular problems; the way in which the assertion that the people who are long-term unemployed are most in need can be justified without reference to other criteria; and if he will review the scheme so that people who are most entitled to the work and who are most capable of doing the work will get the jobs regardless of the length of time they have been out of work.</P>

      <P>In brief, FÁS employment and training schemes assist early school leavers and the unemployed to obtain jobs and also assist the expansion of employment.  In addition, the schemes have the objective of being cost effective to the Exchequer when account is taken of social welfare savings and other receipts to the State. The criteria for admission to a particular scheme reflects the objectives of that scheme and the needs of the group being catered for, e.g., early school leavers, <Col N="1844" /> other young people, long-term unemployed, etc.</P>
      <P>The objective of Teamwork is to help young unemployed persons through assisting local voluntary organisations provide temporary community based employment for the mutual benefit of the young people and the communities.  By way of comparison, the objective of the building on experience programme is to reintegrate the long term unemployed into the labour market.  The objective of FÁS community training workshops and skills foundation programmes is to assist the early school leavers with little or no qualifications to make the difficult transition from the world of education to the world of work.</P>
      <P>As regards questions over the criteria adopted for admission to schemes, the Deputy will be aware from answers I gave to questions earlier this year that claims are currently under examination within the employment equality area about the eligibility of married women for participation in schemes.  FÁS or myself are, of course, prepared to examine any problems or difficulties identified by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the long-term unemployed, there are at present 109,000 persons who have been unemployed for more than a year and this represents 46 per cent of the total unemployed.  The corresponding figures for 1979 were 30,000 and 34 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>The severe financial, social and other problems of the long-term unemployed have been pointed out by community and social workers and have also been well documented in research.  In addition, the indications are that even with a pick-up in the economy the long-term unemployed have, for a number of reasons, difficulty in getting jobs and are last to be taken on by an employer.  Against this background, my policy is to assist as many long-term unemployed by way of training and temporary work as I can within the resources available to me.  In the present year, about 19,300 long-term unemployed persons will be assisted by employment and training programmes.</P>

      <P>The authorised staff, as commonly understood, and the serving staff in the Department of Labour for the grades specified in the question as at 30 September, 1988 (the most recent date for which figures are available) were 297 and 276 respectively.  Details of the numbers and grades are set out in Table A which is being circulated in the Official Report. This figure does not include staff <Col N="1846" /> employed in specialist-technical grades, paperkeepers, messengers, service attendants, cleaners and staff employed in the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
      <P>The comparable figures for 1985, 1986 and 1987 were, respectively, 666, 664 and 654 authorised staff and 648, 640 and 624 serving staff.  Tables B, C and D detail the breakdown of grades and numbers for each of these years.  On 1 January, 1988 the functions of the National Manpower Service were transferred to An Foras Áiseanna Saothair (FÁS).  This accounts for the reduction in staffing levels in 1988.</P>
      <P>The total number of civil servants authorised and serving in this Department during the years 1985 to 1988 were as follows:</P>

      <P>I have allocated £1 million this year to the Western Health Board for the purposes of equipping the Phase I development at Castlebar General Hospital which I consider to be a priority project.  The board are currently going through the process of seeking quotations on items of equipment and I expect final lists to be drawn up in the very near future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 500 people in the North Western Health Board area, many of them old age pensioners, are unable to obtain dentures under the medical card scheme because of cancellations of this scheme arising from the Government health cuts; that many of these people have been waiting for two years; that some had their teeth extracted on the understanding that dentures would be provided; and if in view of this serious situation he will provide the necessary funds to enable the North Western Health Board to resume this very essential service immediately.</P>

      <P>It was due to my concern at the level of operation of health board dental services generally that earlier this year I set up a small working group under the chairmanship of my colleague Deputy Terry Leyden, Minister of State at my Department, to look into the situation and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to bring about improvements. I am at present examining the findings and recommendations contained in the working group's report.</P>

      <P>I had inquiries made of the South Eastern Health Board in this case and have been informed that the person in question was not considered eligible for the allowance on means grounds.  In determining eligibility for the allowance health boards are obliged to take the income of an applicant's spouse into account, which in this case exceeds the income level for DPMA.
