      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, to welcome His Excellency Francois Mitterrand, President of the French Republic, to Ireland and to mark his visit in a signal manner, a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas be held in the Dáil Chamber on Friday, 26 February 1988, and that the President of the French Republic be invited to address such joint sitting; that the proceedings at such joint sitting shall consist of a <Col N="312" /> speech by the Ceann Comhairle welcoming the President, the address by the President and a speech of thanks by the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for the address; and that the time of such joint sitting shall be 3 p.m.</P>
    <P>Next week the President of the French Republic, Mr. Francois Mitterrand, will visit this country in his capacity as Head of State of France.  It will be the first ever visit to our country by a French President in office and I know that the entire House will wish to warmly welcome President Mitterrand and offer him all the honour and courtesy appropriate to his high Office.</P>
    <P>The President will come here as the representative of a great nation that has contributed immeasurably to international advancement, and to the philosophy and culture of humanity.  His visit will mark the unique and enduring realtionship between France and Ireland &mdash; a relationship that can be traced back to the beginning of European history.</P>
    <P>Those early settlers who established in the Boyne Valley in Neolithic times and created there a vibrant culture whose traces can still be seen today are likely to have come from Brittany.  From France, too, came the Celts or, at least, many of them and much later, the Normans &mdash; two waves of settlement that had a profound effect on the course of Irish history and the character of our race.  Indeed so fruitful has been the intellectual, cultural and artistic exchange that it is difficult to think of a major Irish writer or artist who has not worked or studied in France.</P>
    <P>In the political field France provided a refuge for Irish exiles during the most difficult moments in our history.  It was there that members of Ireland's leading families fled in the 17th century after the collapse of the Gaelic nation; and later France provided a haven for thousands of our people who had been forced by penal legislation and persecution to seek refuge abroad.  Many of these &ldquo;wild geese&rdquo; played a distinguished role in the armies of France from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.  Many more went on to study at the great Irish colleges there <Col N="313" /> and subsequently returned to lead the Irish Church.</P>
    <P>But France was more than a refuge.  It was also a source of aid and, perhaps more importantly, of political ideas.  The ideas of French republicanism were to endure and ultimately to succeed.  The democratic republic that Ireland is today owes much to the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity developed in France 200 years ago.</P>
    <P>Today, the relationship between France and Ireland is closer than ever. France is our fourth largest trading partner and an important source of foreign investment and tourist revenue.  Our two countries are partners in the European Communities and share a joint commitment to the task of building a peaceful and prosperous Europe.  In the week after a difficult but successful European Council, I can say that French and Irish interests proved once again to complement one another and that the Irish and French delegations worked together effectively and in a spirit of great understanding and friendship.  We now look forward to co-operating further with France in putting into effect the decisions of the European Council and achieving the ambitious targets set out in the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>President Mitterrand's visit will provide an opportunity to reflect on and further strengthen the links between our two countries and to celebrate a relationship that has endured over many centuries. His coming will be an honour and I believe it should be marked in a signal way by inviting him to address a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest of pleasure in agreeing with the Taoiseach's proposal that we welcome the President of the French Republic and do him the honour, and ourselves the pleasure, of having him address a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As something of a Francophile myself, and having more than a drop of Norman blood in my veins, I must say, a Cheann Comhairle, I am aware of the various links to which the Taoiseach has referred.  At a time when <Col N="314" /> we are striving to build closer links and to bring about a greater unity within the European Communities, a visit by the President of the French Republic, which is after all one of the most powerful of the States in the EC and has been in the past one of the most powerful influences for the unification of Europe, I think at this time a visit of the kind proposed, all other things being equal, will be extremely welcome.</P>

Like all Members of the House, I welcome very much indeed this visit by the President of France, a country with whom this country has always had very friendly relations, not least since we joined the European Communities.  I look forward to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which the President will address.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to add our words of welcome to the motion in the Taoiseach's name.  We are certainly very honoured that the Socialist President of France will be coming to Ireland and addressing a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  No doubt the Taoiseach will have an opportunity of getting an insight into the cohabitation of socialists and conservatives in the French system.  I am sure an interesting exchange can take place on many matters which affect both our countries.  I trust that the French will also give our rugby team a warm reception in Paris on Saturday.</P>

We may have some reservations in regard to their foreign policy, particularly in the area of nuclear testing, but nevertheless <Col N="315" /> I think it is particularly appropriate that he should visit us this year as 1989 is the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution which had such a profound effect on Irish history.  We unreservedly welcome President Mitterrand.</P>

    <Title>Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to amalgamate An Foras Talúntais and ACOT and to transfer the existing functions of the two bodies to a new single authority with responsibility for agricultural advisory, training, education and research services.</P>
      <P>I hardly need to remind this House that agriculture is undergoing a period of rapid, almost revolutionary change at the present time.  Through the application of modern technology, increased productivity has created surpluses in a number of products.  The changes in agriculture are not, of course, confined to Ireland or even the EC but are happening worldwide.</P>
      <P>It is vital that this country meets these changes in agriculture in a positive, constructive and developmental way.  We cannot afford to continue to supply services simply because they were effective and relevant in the past.  We must meet the challenge that the changed circumstances pose by tailoring our services to the future development needs of the agriculture and food industry.</P>
      <P>This new authority will be responsible for establishing the knowledge base of the most important agricultural and food sector in any European country.  The proportion of our total exports represented by agriculture and food exports at 27.6 per cent is the highest in the European Communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wonder whether the usual procedure could be followed and copies of the Minister's speech would be circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point raised.  I thought they were on their way and available for distribution.  Our external trade as a percentage of GNP is at 62 per cent, one of the highest in Europe and indeed, among the OECD countries generally.  These facts underline the unique importance of the agriculture and food industry in Ireland.  The education, research and advisory facilites which this Bill will put in place will reflect that unique importance.</P>
      <P>It has been a priority for me as Minister for Agriculture and Food to make our partners in the EC sharply aware of the primacy of agriculture in our economy. This, in turn, filters through to the consumers of Europe so that quality products from a pure and natural environment must be universally associated with the name &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; on any level.  The professional services provided by this new authority will have an unique responsibility to enhance this reputation.  That unique perception of Ireland is a priceless asset and the new authority will have an immense challenge to launch our producers and processors into a new programme of efficiency and quality.</P>
      <P>The farmer of tomorrow will not be someone who survives by sheer endurance and inherited social attitudes.  He must be a successful enterprise manager who can compete successfully with his best international counterparts.  The test of success will be the same as in any other enterprise &mdash; knowledge and the confidence that comes with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Government is to ensure better co-ordination and cost-effectiveness of agricultural research, education and advisory services.  Such a development can help us to focus more effectively on the priorities required for the current and future needs of agriculture.  The main objective of this Bill is to set in place, by combining the considerable resources of the existing <Col N="317" /> organisations, a strong unified organisational structure for the effective delivery of support services vital to the successful development of the agriculture and food industry.  Such a unified body will be a powerful aid to the industry in its response to the difficulties &mdash; and indeed the opportunities &mdash; which rapidly changing agricultural developments are bringing.  At the same time, given the constraints on the Exchequer, there is an overriding need to apply the resources that can be made available to the sector in the most efficient and effective way. The establishment of a single body and the consequential reorganisation should ensure that any duplication or overlapping of services will be eliminated and that resources are not wasted in unnecessary administration.</P>
    <P>These considerations led to the Government's decision to amalgamate the two organisations of An Foras and ACOT.  In taking that decision, the Government were mindful of the excellent services provided and the invaluable contributions made by both organisations, over the years, to the development of agriculture and the economy as a whole.  An Foras Talúntais have earned a reputation extending far beyond our shores for the excellence of their research work.  The improvements since the early sixties in the production and quality of our primary farm products &mdash; in dairying, pig production, crop husbandry and horticulture, to name a few &mdash; have been dramatic.  ACOT, for their part, have transformed the former county advisory services into a single, tightly organised national service closely integrated with the State and private agricultural colleges.  In particular, they have, through the certificate in farming, achieved a major breakthrough in the training of farm entrants.</P>
    <P>The accompanying explanatory memorandum sets out the various provisions of the Bill and therefore I propose to refer only to the more important aspects. Basically, the Bill provides for the transfer of the existing functions, responsibilities, assets and liabilities of An Foras and ACOT to a new authority which will <Col N="318" /> be known as Teagasc &mdash; The Agriculture and Food Development Authority.  The Irish name, meaning teaching or instruction, will, in my view, provide an appropriate short title for an organisation whose objective will be to transmit scientific and technological information to the agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately expanded the definition of agriculture in section 1 of the Bill to include, <i>inter alia,</i> agricultural economics and rural development.  I am at present drawing up plans for a comprehensive integrated rural development programme and it is my intention to bring these plans before the Dáil at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in outlining the functions of Teagasc at section 4, places special emphasis on the training of new entrants to farming, especially young farmers, and in research on the food sector.  The Government intend to provide our farmers and especially our younger farmers with at least as good an access to the knowledge and skills they will require as that available to their counterparts abroad.  That is the reason we are expressly assigning a degree of priority to training and education in the merger Bill. We are attaching a similar priority to food research and development as a responsibility of the new agency.  The two are complementary and the food processing sector is faced with ever changing consumer preferences and fierce competition on both home and foreign markets.  The priority to be given to entrants into farming will not mean the exclusion of the advisory services, as has been suggested, but rather will ensure that the advisory services will be put to best effect by fully trained farmers and utilised in a cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the new body to be governed by a board of 11, comprising a chairman and ten ordinary members. The chairman and five of the ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the basis of appropriate experience or qualifications and the remainder will be appointed by the Minister, following consultation with the various interests <Col N="319" /> involved.  In deciding on the composition of the board, the Government's concern is that it should not be unwieldy in size, but should consist of persons of the highest calibre in order to discharge its responsibilities in a fully effective and business-like manner.</P>
    <P>An important thrust in Government policy is that bodies such as Teagasc should have a strong commercial orientation and receive a good measure of funding from the industry.  Teagasc will be expected to secure funding from the agriculture and food sector to the maximum degree possible, through gearing their services to the essential commercial development needs of the industry.  The Bill at section 6 enables Teagasc to charge for any of their services, through charges in the case of education, training or advice will require ministerial approval because of the wider policy implications that such charges might have.  Charges in appropriate circumstances should establish an effective professional relationship between producer and adviser and should ensure that the services provided are of the highest professional standards.</P>
    <P>In the changing pattern of agriculture, increased production is not the only criterion for success.  Prudent financial management, for instance, and the environmental consequences of certain production units such as silage pits are now matters of primary importance for all farmers and the research and advisory services under Teagasc will have to be competent professionally in these areas also.  The Bill also provides that the new Authority, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, may engage in activities outside the State, but solely on a fully commercial basis.  Both An Foras and ACOT have over the years built up a considerable reservoir of technical, scientific and other expertise and have earned a wide reputation overseas through their participation in international consultancies and other projects.  Further opportunities for income generation arise in the exploitation of the results of research through royalties, <Col N="320" /> joint ventures and other means.  The example may be cited of an Foras's achievement in the plant breeding area where the introduction of new and successful potato varieties have proved to be significant export earners for the seed potato industry.  There are, of course, many other areas of advanced technology &mdash; animal reproduction and physiology, plant tissue culture, biotechnology to give some examples &mdash; where research findings may afford opportunities for considerable commercial exploitation.  The Bill provides for such income generating activities and further facilities them by enabling Teagasc to set up subsidiaries for the purpose, with the approval of the Ministers.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion on the adequacy of the Exchequer funding for the research, advisory and training services for the current year.  The allocation of £20 million shown in the Book of Estimates, which, of course, was settled some months ago, took account of a number of exceptional and new factors that would influence the situation after the merger of ACOT and AFT.  One of these is the increased commercial orientation that I have already mentioned, involving greater financial participation from the farm and food sectors and the generation of enhanced consultancy and other income at home and abroad.  Another is the major staff reduction flowing from the Government's voluntary early retirement package &mdash; already some 350 people have left An Foras and ACOT, of whom 120 were professional and 230 were from other grades.  A further 120 or so are expected to leave during the year.  I want to stress, as I have already conveyed to the union representatives, that the Government decision provides for voluntary redundancies only.  The amalgamation will also make possible the rationalisation of the countrywide physical resources of the present organisations and consequential savings will accrue. Teagasc will concentrate on the essential services and those of lower priority will be reduced or phased out.</P>
    <P>The net effect of these factors means a <Col N="321" /> reduction in the very considerable Exchequer support which An Foras and ACOT separately have hitherto been given.  I recognise that the £20 million allocation sets a formidable challenging task for the management, but I do not accept the negative attitude expressed regarding the capacity of the Authority to meet their financial targets over the full year's operation.  If there are temporary initial difficulties, it will be my purpose to ensure that the new body will not lack for the essential funds to enable them to become an efficient, cost-effective agency to service the agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that, on the date of establishment of Teagasc, staff members of An Foras and ACOT will be transferred to and become members of it.  Such transfers of staff will be on the basis that their terms and conditions of service shall not be less favourable than those applying to them before transfer.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the inevitable staff reductions following the formation of a single integrated agency, the new Authority will be formidable in size with a diverse range of important functions and nationwide distribution of staff and resources.  Its Exchequer funding requirements remain substantial.  It is important, therefore, that a proper balance should be struck between, on the one hand, the exercise of effective overall policy and financial control by the Minister and, on the other hand, scope for Teagasc to implement its mandate. Accordingly, section 13 provides for arrangements on the lines of those in the Labour Services Act which covers the broadly analogous area of industrial training, whereby Teagasc will be required to furnish the Minister with advance reports of its planned activities and associated cost estimates for each year.  These will indicate the main areas of intended resource allocation as between research, training and advisory work and will require the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance.  This mechanism will enable an adequate measure <Col N="322" /> of central policy control while leaving Teagasc with the requisite degree of freedom and flexibility to carry out its work. Under section 19 the Minister may give a direction to Teagasc to carry out, or not carry out, specified activities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amalgamation of An Foras and ACOT the Bill provides at section 20 for the abolition of the county committees of agriculture.  The policy considerations which led to the decision to amalgamage An Foras and ACOT made it necessary also to review the position of the committees of agriculture, particularly in view of their linkages with ACOT under present legislation.  The fact must be faced that, since the transfer to ACOT in 1980 of the committees responsibilities for farm training and advice the committees' scope for playing an active role in agricultural development work has become increasingly attenuated, particularly under the developments of CAP and the pressure on national funding.  The position now is that over 70 per cent of committee expenditure has been absorbed in travelling expenses of the members and payment to ACOT for administrative services.</P>
    <P>The Government have looked at the situation in the light of the general thrust of their rationalisation objectives and the need to shed any layer of public administration where possible.  They decided that in the integrated organisation of the agricultural services, the continued maintenance of the county committee structures could no longer be warranted on cost-effective criteria.  Hence, the Bill provides at section 20 for the dissolution of the committees.  Given the long-standing place of the committees in the local agricultural scene, that decision was not taken without a measure of regret.  Over the years since their establishment in 1931 they have rendered a special service to Irish agriculture of which the Government were mindful.  Nevertheless, the realities of the present time could not be ignored.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure that the new Authority will want to have available to it constant access to the best practical <Col N="323" /> advice at local level and will make appropriate arrangements accordingly.  The Bill provides at section 22 for the transfer to the Minister of the assets and liabilities of each committee on the date the legislation comes into effect.  Any sum remaining after the discharge of liabilities will be disposed of in a manner acceptable also to the Minister for the Environment since the committee funds have been derived in roughly equal measure from county council contributions and Exchequer grants.</P>
    <P>The legislation will have the consequence of terminating the statutory obligation on the councils to make annual contributions towards the cost of the agricultural services provided in the counties. The Government have directed that administrative arrangements be made to compensate for the loss of funding to agriculture through an appropriate transfer from the rates support grant provision in the Environment Vote.  The revised system will have beneficial effects in assisting the rationalisation of the local authority finances and eliminating wasteful administration in transfers of moneys from county councils through the committees of agriculture to ACOT.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the radical change which agriculture is undergoing and the need to respond to that change in a positive way.  Given the changes and developments in the agriculture and food area and the current demands which these are making on the sector, the purpose and functions of the new authority must be clear and unambiguous for the outset.  It will have to provide the most relevant and cost effective services with greater involvement and participation, including financial, from the commercial agriculture and food industry itself.</P>
    <P>The Government are placing a very high priority on the provision of appropriate training for young farmers, especially for the new entrants to agriculture.  The achievement in this area already is considerable but we must endeavour to ensure that, as far as possible, every young entrant to farming is adequately trained.  This will ensure that <Col N="324" /> investment in advisory work will give maximum returns.  We need also to deploy resources away from undue concentration on production aspects and concentrate on providing services to the post-farm gate stage, especially to process and product development in the food area.  In this regard, the progress towards setting up a national food centre in Dunsinea is welcome.</P>
    <P>In the establishment of this food centre the technical and other resources of AFT and the IIRS are being combined and integrated in order to service the commercial development of the food industry.  The new centre will complement the operations already established in dairy food products at Moorepark.  The new facility should provide a major focus in the work of Teagasc for the development of the food sector in the years ahead. Given the current restrictions of primary production, it is essential to make maximum use of our agricultural output by way of value-added and job creation. The potential of the food area is so great that its development should not be impeded by the lack or inadequacy of key services.</P>
    <P>The changes sought by the Bill are designed to ensure that the research and advisory services will serve the technological requirements of the rapidly changing agricultural and food industry until and beyond the turn of the century. The constraints that now exist on production in many areas are likely to be further increased.  In this environment it is imperative that we are fully competitive in world markets.  In Teagasc we are setting in place a single agency geared to provide dynamic support for the farming and food sector in a drive towards maximum competitiveness.</P>
    <P>It must remain our objective to produce primary agricultural products as efficiently as possible but that is not enough.  There is a compelling need for us to get the most from what we already produce.  We must focus directly on the added-value beyond the farmgate, on quality, on sharper market information and on a market-led approach to our agricultural and food development.  Only <Col N="325" /> in this way will we have the best opportunities to maintain and improve farm incomes.  The role of the new authority will be vital in order to ensure positive and constructive commercial development.  In pursuing that role it will be able to call upon the very considerable talent and expertise of the two existing bodies and utilise them to the maximum advantage in a unified organisation.</P>
    <P>Future conditions may well place demands on them to change the focus and direction of their services.  I have little doubt that greater emphasis will be placed on the scope and potential of the newer sciences like biotechnology and information technology for the further development of the industry.  The highly skilled scientific and professional staff of An Foras and ACOT are well equipped to tackle these demands and the aim of the Bill is to weld them into a task-force under strong single-minded direction which will successfully surmount difficulties and exploit available opportunities.</P>
    <P>The new, fitter and leaner authority has a formidable challenge in the years immediately ahead.  Energy, innovative capacity and greater commercial orientation will be required to ensure that this country secures an even stronger place in world markets.  I have the highest confidence that the new organisation can make a crucial indispensable contribution to the achievement of this objective and in addition give good value to the State for the public resources that can be made available to it.</P>
    <P>In summary then the objectives behind the Government's decision to establish a new Authority are to bring together the education, training, advisory and research services under unified management for greater efficiency, to deliver the specific services that are crucial to the success of the agriculture and food industry in the competitive environment in which it will have to operate in the coming years and to get the best value for money for the Exchequer on the resources at the disposal of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, in the Government's view, the most appropriate and effective <Col N="326" /> framework within which these objectives can be realised in a dynamic and cost-effective manner to the future benefit of the agriculture and food industry and consequently to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The essence of the amalgamation is therefore a timely coupling of complementary activities, to replace dispersion with cohesion.  It will be more economical of public finances, more productive of intellectual investment, and more accessible to the industry as a whole.  It will give staff at once an opportunity and a challenge.  We are regrouping our forces to meet the needs not alone of the present but of the future.  This concept indeed has vision as befits this Government.  If we are in a period of revolutionary change we must not confine ourselves to reacting to that change.  We must control and direct it to Ireland maximum advantage.  I am satisfied that the new Authority will be equipped to do just that.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech will come as a total disappointment to those who have the interests of Irish agriculture at heart and indeed to those who understand and appreciate the contribution of agriculture to the overall economy.  It is clear that the Minister is not included among those.  Were the situation not so serious the Minister's speech, full of platitudes and little else, would be regarded as a joke in exceptionally bad taste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has to be dealt with from two points of view.  One aspect concerns the principle of merging ACOT and AFT and the legislative framework to be provided for the new merged farm Authority.  I support the merger.  While I have serious reservations about certain provisions in the Bill, I am broadly in favour of the merger proposal.  I will return at a later stage in my remarks to the reservations I have and I will make some suggestions as to how these might be overcome.  On the other hand, I am literally appalled at the cavalier approach of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government to the funding crisis they have created for the new farm <Col N="327" /> body.  Cutting the budget for the Authority from £35 million to £20 million will involve decimation of the agriculture, research, advisory, education and training services in this country.  The cost to our farmers and to the economy generally in the years and decades ahead will be enormous.  Latest figures confirm that the proposed cuts in agricultural advice and education alone will cost the economy &mdash; I emphasise the economy &mdash; about £40 million in 1988, increasing to £220 million by 1992.  The economic losses resulting from the devastation of our research services are more difficult to quantify but I am advised that they could exceed the figures relating to advice and education. Thus the total loss to the economy from this hasty, ill-timed and ill-planned budgetary decision could be in the order of about £450 million a year by 1992.</P>
    <P>Even more appalling is that the remedy to the problem can be found within the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Minister, because he is simply a pawn of the administrative superstructure within that Department, is either unable or unwilling to provide the remedy.  At present the Minister stands indicted before the Irish people. His legacy to the Irish farmer will be one of lower incomes; to the food industry, one of lack of competitiveness and to the Irish economy generally, a missed opportunity to develop our natural resources in the challenging years ahead. This total mishandling of the merger now stands as a matter of record and clearly calls into question the Minister's competence to hold a portfolio of such major importance to so many of our people and to the economy generally.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recall the past when we are discussing this issue.  There are certain facts which emerge from an examination of the past which perhaps some people would like to brush aside at the moment but it is important to fully understand the situation to date.  We should have a recollection and an understanding of what has happened in relation to AFT and the advisory services in our recent history.  It is very clear that the <Col N="328" /> trauma now being experienced by the staff of AFT and ACOT and the enormous upheaval now in prospect would have been entirely unnecessary were it not for the mistakes of the past by previous Fianna Fáil Administrations.</P>
    <P>Mark Clinton, Minister for Agriculture in the seventies and now one of our distinguished MEPs, resolved the entire problem a dozen years ago.  Were it not for the perverse and misguided attitude of Fianna Fáil at the time we would not now be facing the present difficulties. Mark Clinton, with the vision for which he is now renowned, in the teeth of opposition from Fianna Fáil, provided a framework through the National Agricultural Authority to cover all these services working together only to find that the succeeding Fianna Fáil Government of which the present Minister was a member, for the most spurious of reasons, took the National Agricultural Authority apart again.  It is perhaps poetic justice and the irony of fate that this is the background to the Minister's present misfortunes and difficulties.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is important to have a better understanding of our present situation in the light of what has happened in the recent past.  From that point of view it is important to recall that the question of how we should deal with the research, advisory, education and training services in this country has long lineage.  That question, some would say, has a rather murky past, going back to the heads of a Bill approved by the then Fianna Fáil Administration prior to 1973. I will not delve that far back; I will confine myself to the period when we had legislative proposals before this House.  As I have said, Mark Clinton introduced the National Agricultural Education and Research Authority Bill in 1977.  That provided that the general functions of the National Agricultural Authority would be the provision of education, advisory and research services in agriculture and the making available of the scientific and practical knowledge required by the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Essentially the Bill now before the House, presented with high sounding <Col N="329" /> phrases by the present Minister, includes the same proposals.  The Bill was debated in this House on 9 February 1977 and a few of the comments made are relevant. Deputy Michael Noonan, subsequently Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture and now Minister for Defence in the present Administration said at column 1115:</P>
    <P>I am saddened that the Minister should introduce a Bill of this kind....  The Bill which is being opposed by our party is designed to take from the agricultural advisory service and the agricultural research service &mdash; An Foras Talúntais &mdash; the autonomy that they enjoy.</P>
    <P>Earlier the then Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Gibbons said at column 1087:</P>
    <P>This Bill is dowdy and unimaginative.  It is building on out-of-date and obsolete foundations.  There is no indication of any new thinking in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Later, at column 1088 he said:</P>
    <P>Speaking as a farmer, I reject it out of hand.  It is no good....  Its very hollowness, its vacuousness and its emptiness will underline and draw attention to the total failure of the Minister even to recognise the urgency of the problem that confront the industry at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Denis Gallagher, now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, had this to say at column 1112:</P>
    <P>There are many things to be done, and by taking a good look at the existing services and trying to make more money available to them, we could do a great deal more than we are doing. This centralisation of matters will only hold up the development of agriculture and, in the long run, the farmers and agriculture will suffer as a result. Therefore, I wish to join with my colleagues in opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>That was the position in 1977.  That was <Col N="330" /> the wisdom of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time.</P>

      <P>The then Fianna Fáil Administration introduced a Bill in 1978, entitled Agriculture (An Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill, enacted in 1979, which was discussed in the House on Second Stage on 26 October 1978.  At the time, according to the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, the purpose of its introduction was and I quote him from column 1301.</P>
      <P>.... to detach from the operation of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977, the agricultural research function which that enactment sought to integrate with the agricultural advisory and training and educational services and to give all three services a better basis.</P>
      <P>Having dismissed comments suggesting that his stand in this regard was not a matter of conviction, that he was merely expressing the views of certain elements which were pursuing selfish interests, he said, at the following column:</P>
      <P>I am quite convinced that a dilution of the research effort could not be avoided if research were combined with the advisory and training services.</P>
      <P>There were a few other contributions of interest at that time.  For example, at column 1325, Deputy Joe Walsh, now Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, in welcoming the Bill said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the institute will be allowed to retain its autonomy. I believe that the linking up of the advisory service and the institute would <Col N="331" /> put undue emphasis on production research.</P>
    <P>On 9 November 1978, the Minister of State for Agriculture, Deputy Tom Hussey, had this to say at column 693:</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton is reported as saying that research must relate to production needs.  I agree fully with him in this but I do not agree with his conclusion that this is an overriding reason for amalgamating An Foras with the advisory service.  Quite the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Later, at column 705, Deputy Michael Woods, now also a Minister of the present Administration said:</P>
    <P>However, I think that the previous plan to divorce An Foras Talúntais, or to bring An Foras within this large body would have been disastrous.  It was an ill-conceived and ill-advised plan to abolish and subsume An Foras into this new vast bureaucratic organisation and for that reason I welcome the decision of the Minister to bring forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>Also, at column 808, he made an interesting observation as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some comments in relation to finance and has said that the financial provisions will at least be not less than in the past.  I am very glad to have the assurance from him.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably holds the same view at this stage.  If so, I hope he will come into the House to express it.  Finally, in relation to that Bill, Deputy Mark Clinton, then in Opposition said, at column 808:</P>
    <P>I know that many people will expect me to be very bitter because the Minister, for unworthy reasons, is in this Bill destroying a piece of legislation which in my view would have been of immense benefit to the agricultural industry if it had been allowed to go ahead as planned.  I am not interested in bitterness.  My interest is now, and always has been, to try to ensure that <Col N="332" /> the best possible service is provided for Irish farmers.  I am absolutely convinced now, as I was then, that the way to get this service is through a fully integrated arrangement, which is what the National Agricultural Authority Act was all about.  I am anxious to get the agricultural schools, who provide a basic education, the advisory services, which also have a very important part to play in the education of young farmers, and sometimes not so young farmers, and the research services in An Foras Talúntais to work together as a team and provide a comprehensive service.</P>
    <P>To any of us discussing the Bill before the House today those words can be regarded as visionary, as one would expect from former Deputy Mark Clinton, a man who knew what he was doing, why he was doing it and how he would get it done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked the position carefully and found that at the time &mdash; fortunately for himself &mdash; the Minister was off in foreign parts engaged in the business of the Department of Foreign Affairs, not taking the slightest interest in what was happening in agriculture. Perhaps that was as well then and indeed might be as well now.  However, we shall come to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>However, what is clear is that the mistakes of the past have now surfaced to haunt the present Administration.  In the intervening period ACOT, which was eventually separately established in 1980, survived its growing pains for about two or three years and had become very effective in recent years.  They did important work in the <Col N="333" /> advisory, educational and training area which was fully recognised by the previous Government, fully recognised by the Fine Gael Party, as was also the continuing major role of An Foras Talúntais in the research area.</P>
      <P>The document <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; scoffed at at the time by Fianna Fáil, confirmed the very positive attitude of the previous Government to those services.  It is said at paragraph 2.36 of that document:</P>
      <P>Given the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy in terms of product, trade and employment, significant national growth will be much more difficult to achieve if there is not sustained growth in this sector.</P>
      <P>It is said later in the same document at paragraph 2.37:</P>
      <P>... The adoption of the milk super-levy, combined with likely restrictive price policies and a wider application of guarantee thresholds, emphasise the need for greater efficiency in the industry to ensure that its competitiveness is improved and farm profitability is maximised.  It will require a carefully planned approach by ACOT, in consultation with the other State agencies involved, to operate an adjustment strategy for farm development providing guidelines for farmers on how best to cope with the changed circumstances.</P>
      <P>Later at paragraph 2.44 that document confirms as follows:</P>
      <P>With the progressive raising of the educational and training qualifications of the farming sector, the capacity of farmers to absorb new technology will increase.  Both ACOT and AFT have important roles in helping farmers to increase productivity through the adoption of cost-effective new technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those comments indicate a number of things, first, the total opposition of Fianna Fáil in the past to the proposals of the then Minister, Deputy Mark Clinton, in the seventies, proposals which, had they been allowed remain in place, <Col N="334" /> would not have us in this present mess. They show also the usual absolutely consistent line of Fine Gael right up to date.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I made it clear that I have no problem with the principle of merger.  I believe in the principle of merger, as we believed a dozen years ago, when the then Minister, Deputy Mark Clinton introduced his proposals.  A further small snippet of history should be mentioned, that the most recent decision to provide for a merger was made by the Fine Gael Government in January 1987 and included in the proposals for the budget to the published at that time.  It is highly relevant that when Fine Gael announced that decision, we knew that some economies would result and that very careful planning was needed to ensure a successful amalgamation. Accordingly, even though we announced that decision in January 1987, we did not provide for any reduction in 1987 in the Estimates for the farm bodies which, we believed, would come later as soon as careful planning had taken place.  We made the point that we anticipated savings when this planning approach had achieved its results.  This proposal was violently opposed by Fianna Fáil at the time and it is no harm to mention, that from the point of view of credibility. Fianna Fáil's opposition reached a stage where the most absolute assurances were given that there would never be an amalgamation if they were in power.  This assurance was given to members of the FWU at a meeting attended by the then Fianna Fáil agricultural spokesman, Deputy Noonan, who is now Minister for Defence.  The meeting was also attended by Deputies Kirk, Joe Walsh, Jimmy Leonard, Noel Treacy and Hugh Byrne.</P>
    <P>Following those absolute assurances, we had the Fianna Fáil manifesto for the 1987 general election.  Perhaps that is a document many of that side of the House would like to forget.  The rhetoric in that document seemed to indicate to many people an interest in the development of agriculture.  We were told that agriculture would be central to the Fianna Fáil programme for economic recovery and that their policies would be directed towards <Col N="335" /> restoring confidence and investment in the industry and increasing farm incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Government are doing from the point of view of funding for the advisory and research services is an example, I do not know how anybody, even the most committed supporter of Fianna Fáil, could pretend that those measures are designed to induce confidence in the industry. Promises were made that the key elements of the Fianna Fáil approach would be the promotion of research and development programmes in relation to new by-products in agriculture and so on.  They also said that there would be education and training to provide technical and management skills for profitable operations in modern conditions.  Then we come to a real gem, there was to be a major drive to halt the decline in rural population, including a focus on the development of alternative farm enterprises, such as agritourism and deer farming to produce supplementary incomes.  How in the name of goodness can anyone on the other side of the House stand up and tell us that they have any credibility in relation to the issues I have just mentioned when they totally decimated their research and advisory services?  It goes beyond belief that spokespersons for Fianna Fáil should even attempt to suggest that they have the slightest interest in the development of agriculture in the light of their record.</P>
      <P>Even today the Minister adopted this platitudinous approach which is in total contradiction to the actions and decisions of the Government in cutting so substantially the funding available to enable those kinds of policies to be implemented.  It was obvious in the national wage agreement and in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> There was reference to the fact that the expansion in agriculture and the food industry was a central element in Government economic policy.</P>

      <P>All these facts are trotted out but I do not know if the Minister reads the excellent summaries that come from the CII.  The figures in the food industry for 1987 show that leaving aside the soft drink concentrates, like Coca Cola and Pepsi, the food industry as a whole declined in output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways, the centrepiece of the Minister's speech today is his reference to funding.  It is necessary to spend a long time in convincing the Minister that even at this late stage there is and must be a solution to that problem which does not relate to the Minister's glib comments. Despite all the promises and assurances in regard to AFT and ACOT and the introduction of a Bill in 1979 to dismember Mark Clinton's National Agricultural Authority, one fine day in September in the town of Portlaoise, Minister O'Kennedy slipped the word that there would be a merger after all. All previous bets were off, the promises and assurances were forgotten and we would be back &mdash; or should I say forward &mdash; to where Mark Clinton had left us ten <Col N="337" /> years previously.  He said there would be some redundancies &mdash; voluntary of course &mdash; but did not specify the figure involved.  Indeed he did not seem to know but he did not deny a suggestion that it might be in the order of 500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to that point later.  That was a very interesting comment from the Minister because it touched on the inability of the new farm Authority to fund the remaining staff.  If the Minister tells us he is satisfied with 500, that there will be no further redundancies or redeployment and is now prepared to allow the new organisation get under way with the necessary finance, perhaps we may have the bones of a solution before us.  I notice that the Minister is not jumping in to confirm that that is the inevitable consequences of his remark, that redundancies will be limited to where they are taking place at present and that the remaining 1,600 staff can continue providing an effective service with the necessary funding.</P>
      <P>We have had the rhetoric and high sounding commitments in the <i>Programme</i> for <i>National Recovery</i> published in October but, like the Treaty of Limerick, the ink was hardly dry on the document before the thunderbolt struck.</P>

      <P>I will leave it to the Progressive Democrat Deputy present to focus on the problems of his Leader in his home town while I deal with the broader <Col N="338" /> issues.  I will deal with farming and the economy generally.  When the Estimates for 1988 were published we learned the truth, the Government were proposing to cut almost in half the Exchequer support for research, advice, education and training.  Even at that stage the Minister had no idea how the cuts were to be achieved.  There was no indication of any plan of how there would be an effective merger.  Indeed, the Minister's lack of interest in or knowledge of what was involved was epitomised in his reply to a question on November 12.  When pressed on the question of numbers he replied, as reported at column 579 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The Estimates do not make any reference to a figure of 1,000.  It is very important that that be put on the record of the House.  I did not make any statement of that kind and the Estimates did not...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, two weeks earlier I received, with the compliments of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, a document detailing the estimate of expenditure for 1988 and under the subhead, Amalgamation of AFT and ACOT, I learned that the establishment of the new body would require legislation and would result in a substantial reduction in the order of 1,000 in the current staffing levels of 2,200.  That sequence of events begs the question as to whether the Minister was, to use an in-phrase, economic with the truth or was misleading the House?  Is it that the Minister did not care about the matter to inquire from his civil servants as to what was happening?  The Minister has a case to answer on this issue in that in referring to numbers he envisaged a staff of 1,200 towards the end of October, denied that in November and today patted himself on the back, after I referred to the fact that he mentioned a figure of 500 in Portlaoise, and asked &ldquo;was I not right&rdquo;?  I do not mind the Minister confusing himself but he should give the House and the country some chance.  We need clear and unequivocal answers to those questions. If the Minister is not aware of the position <Col N="339" /> he should say so.  We must have an end to muddle on this point.</P>
    <P>Following the cut from £35 million to £20 million we had what could be loosely termed as a wink and not period in relation to funding during which the Minister, and his cohorts, seemed to convey the impression that everything would be in order on the day.  In fact, in a conversation one of the Minister's aides appears to have used those words&mdash;I am not certain about that because I was not present.  Later we were told of £5 million extra funding and interviews given here and there led <i>The Irish Press</i> to headline on 11 November 1987 that farming cut backs had been reduced.  A very respected agricultural correspondent of that newspaper stated in the course of an article in that issue that severe financial cut backs in the two advisory and research bodies of the Department of Agriculture and Food, ACOT and AFT, announced in the Book of Estimates, were to be reduced.  That article stated that that information had been revealed the previous night by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>While we had the winks and nods outside direct replies in the House from the Minister were not forthcoming.  Accordingly, the worries grew and the criticisms became stronger.  Eventually the Taoiseach intervened.  There followed a number of meetings as a result of that intervention, one of which took place in November, 1987.  That meeting was attended by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern and the general secretaries of the relevant trade unions.  The meeting was arranged through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Taoiseach.  A report given to me by a representative of a union who was in attendance was to the effect that the Minister, Mr. O'Kennedy, gave a firm indication that more money would be provided.  I do not know what the Minister has been at but my information is based on my inquiries and from what I read in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>It may not be necessary, as I will explain.  It clearly indicates a shameful and shameless conduct of affairs by the Fianna Fáil Administration on this issue.  It is important that the steps from 1977 to date be recorded because they clearly indicate a total lack of interest by the members of this Administration in the future of the advisory, research and education service.  The answer was always to give in to pressure or to give the impression that they would give in to pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many of the Minister's colleagues were involved at different stages over the years, the major indictment now is of this Minister.  It is clear from what I have said that if he had deliberately tried to mishandle the situation he could hardly <Col N="341" /> have achieved such a result.  That is an indictment with which I charge him quite deliberately.  I have outlined the historical situation, of which the Minister was a part.  He absolves himself by saying he did not speak in the 1977 and 1979 debates.  He was a member of the Government in 1979.  I touched on the pre-election attitude of the then spokesman for the party, now the Minister's Cabinet colleague.</P>
    <P>I also raised the question of the line which was taken by the present Administration with AFT and ACOT in the period after the election up to the September announcement in Portlaoise.  The understanding I had was that both organisations were told to prepare budgets for 1988 which would provide for a saving of 10 per cent.  This clearly indicates that there was no consultation or planning and that both organisations were totally and completely misled on this issue.  Obviously there was no planning at any level prior to the announcement in Portlaoise on 17 September.  There was no planning on the part of the Minister, who was unable to reply to questions on the issue or provide even the most basic information in relation to the two organisations.  Even worse is the fact that, the decision having been taken, there was still a hiatus, a total absence of any sense of direction or serious approach in the presentation of guidelines.  This continues to the present.  It is compounded by the funding crisis which clearly indicates there will be a massive shortfall in resources for the new organisation.  In the period up to today &mdash; the wink and nod period &mdash; the figure of £5 million extra funding has been floated and at another stage we had the theory of dynamics being extended to cover debts to the bank manager.</P>
    <P>We also had the delay in bringing forward the Bill.  If this matter had been carefully planned the Bill would have been produced in good time to enable reasoned debate so that the legislation could have been in place prior to 1 January.</P>
    <P>Regarding the appointment of a director designate, the Minister tells us he is <Col N="342" /> washing his hands of the matter and that it will be up to the new board to appoint the director when the Bill has been passed.  Even though they will not have a bob and no planning will have been done, things will take off from there. Dynamics will take over.  Let us be practical and reasonable.  If there is to be a boss &mdash; and there must be &mdash; why not go ahead and appoint him?  Give him some chance.  It is quite inevitable that in the present state of muddle and uncertainty the two organisations should be involved in a certain amount of manoeuvering. That is quite normal.  The Minister should give them some chance by appointing a director now.  He may well give the legalistic reply that he cannot appoint a director until such time as the Bill has passed all Stages in the Dáil and Seanad and been duly signed by the President.  I reject that as a waste of time.  Officially the person appointed would be the director designate pending completion of the Bill.  Unless it is done now the present confusion will continue.  The appointment should be made through an open competition, but let us have the arrangements for the appointment put in train now.</P>
    <P>The mishandling of the operation to date is compounded by the attitude taken by the Minister in his speech today.  He tells us it has been a priority for him as Minister to make our partners in the EC sharply aware of the primacy of agriculture in our economy.  Would he not turn his attentions closer to home and advise his colleagues in the Cabinet about the primacy of agriculture in the economy and the need to ensure that it will not be utterly starved of funding to support advisory and research services?  There are ritual compliments to the excellent services provided by both AFT and ACOT, but later in the Minister's speech is the reiteration that the knife which has been put in is being kept in and that the funding which is required for these two bodies to operate properly will not be provided. Let me lay down a challenge.  How can this cut to £20 million be justified?  Not a single argument or justification has been advanced.  This is particularly strange in <Col N="343" /> the light of the Minister's acceptance, even on paper, of the importance of agriculture, not just for those directly involved but for the entire economy.  The Minister accepts that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No justification has been produced.  I am not calling for extra taxation or extra borrowing.  I am calling for a proper reallocation of funding within the Minister's Department to ensure that the frontline services needed in the challenging years ahead are properly provided for.  If, as a consequence, the towering administration of the Department has to take a modest cut &mdash; and it will be a modest cut in the context of the £66.5 million administration budget of the Department &mdash; that has to be the place to provide the first sacrifice. There should not be a cut in the services that will provide benefits to Irish farmers, the food industry and to the economy generally.  Anyone who tries to justify that cut does not have an adequate recognition of the contribution which the agriculture and food industry is making to the national economy.  It is obvious to anybody that the scale of cuts in the agricultural support services is a strategic mistake which could undermine the contribution which the major wealth producing sector of the economy can make to a national recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thankful that research has been done by some of the most senior people in ACOT.  It is important that we should all be aware of this contribution so that we will be prepared to respond in a way which will ensure that that recognition is translated into decisions.  It must be questioned as to whether those responsible for this decision seriously underestimated this contribution to agriculture <Col N="344" /> and the contribution of agriculture to the economy.  The Minister accepts that agriculture is by far our single most important industry in terms of national income, exports and the employment it generates. It also has a vital role in paying for essential imports because of the huge agricultural exports, and earning the foreign exchange needed to repay our massive foreign debts.</P>
    <P>It is important to be clear on the figures.  The gross value of visible exports increased from £4.1 billion in 1980 to about £9.5 billion in 1986.  Over £7 billion comes from the so-called modern industries which were attracted here by our low tax regime for manufacturing industries, and the remaining £2.5 billion came from agricultural exports.  That might seem to indicate that our agricultural exports are relatively unimportant as opposed to the exports from the modern industries such as pharmaceuticals, computers, electronic goods and so on.  The crucial question is the relative contribution to the economy of the £2.5 billion worth of agricultural exports compared to over £7 billion worth of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>To examine that issue account must be taken of the import content and the repatriation of profits which are associated with exports.  Everybody accepts that the import content of much of our modern industry is very substantial.  An IDA survey in 1983 showed that the Irish raw materials used as a proportion of total raw materials amounted to 33 per cent for chemicals, 17 per cent for electronics and 28 per cent for manufacturing industry.  The contrast was that the food industry sourced 87 per cent of its inputs domestically.  In relation to repatriation of profits this was £1.3 billion in 1987, or 17 per cent of the total value of the exports for these industries.  High profit levels are being earned by a limited number of modern industries but some 80 per cent of those are being repatriated. This goes to show that for every £100 of exports generated by manufacturing industry £54 is paid for raw material imports, £17 goes overseas by way of profits being repatriated and that leaves £29 net to the Irish economy.  For every <Col N="345" /> £100 of agricultural exports the import content is £18, profit repatriation is negligible and that leaves £80 in the economy.  If you take into account the import content and the repatriation profits it will be seen that the net export value of agriculture at £2.05 billion is quite close to the net figure for industrial exports at £2.28 billion.  In that context we must recognise the vital role of agriculture in our economy and its even more vital role in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There are also figures available to show that the spending power generated by an industry or firm is what determines its value to the economy.  The 1983 study showed that the agriculture and food industry accounted for more spending power than the rest of the manufacturing sector.  Spending power per employee was highest in the food industry at £75,000 compared with £32,000 for chemicals £22,000 for electronics and £16,000 for mechanical engineering.</P>
    <P>I have never joined the chorus of those who say that foreign industries are not worth anything to the country.  They are worth a lot but they have to be compared to our indigenous industry to find the real net worth.  I have talked about net exports and spending power but there is also the question of employment.  Some of the modern industries have had spectacular growth.  They have given a marvellous performance from the point of view of export growth but they do not contribute that much to employment.  The office machines industry increased the value of its exports from £250 million in 1980 to over £1.8 billion in 1986 and employment increased from 2,000 to 6,400.  By contrast, in the agriculture and food sector exports were valued at £2.5 billion.  In 1985 it provided direct employment for 214,000 people.  These are the kinds of figures that should be recognised generally.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about future prospects, we have to see the merger of ACOT and AFT as providing an opportunity to redirect our resources, our research and advisory programmes to maximise the contribution to recovery.  I <Col N="346" /> emphasised the need for careful planning.  There has not been careful planning to date.  We need careful planning and a recognition of the financial need of the new organisation.  If the agriculture industry is to make its maximum contribution to economic recovery there are certain key elements which the Minister accepts and into which I need not go in detail.  There must be a selective expansion of the beef, sheep and horticultural sectors.  There must be a major effort to improve product quality and there must be a serious commitment to rural development programmes.</P>
    <P>I will talk on another occasion about the beef cow numbers and the consequences of an expected drop of a quarter of a million dairy cows in the next few years.  If we do not replace these with beef cows we will end up with under-used grazing land and idle meat plants with more people on the dole queues.  I will not get into an argument on that; I am saying maybe the Minister will not agree with me as to the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am not in the business of going around counting cows but I have access to the papers published by the various experts. Brendan O'Riordan of AFT projected recently that with a particular series of initiatives the national cow herd could be increased to over two million by 1991 but if no such measures were taken the cow herd would be about 1.8 million.  The difference in national income between the two scenarios is almost £200 million. It is also the difference between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers remaining viable or slipping into the social welfare net.  Also the 1,000 additional jobs projected by the IDA for the beef industry over the 1988-92 period just will not be realised.  On the question of quality, everybody accepts that further restrictions in output are inevitable due to CAP cutbacks, therefore we have to secure the maximum unit price through the production of quality. That becomes of major importance. Quality food production must start on the farm, and everybody accepts there is need for improvement at that level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I go beyond that. There is great need for improvement at that level.  Where are we at the moment? Much investment has been made in food processing, so now we need to capitalise on that investment and have a more market-led approach which should dictate the actions of farmers, processors and the food market.  That will involve much better communication between the different actors in the food marketing chain.  Producers and producer groups are all going to be involved in that communication chain.</P>
      <P>The buzz phrase at the moment is &ldquo;integrated rural development&rdquo;.  Obviously, much attention is focussing on it following the expansion of the EC Structural Fund and the funding of programmes of integrated rural development which, it is hoped that will give rise to.  If these programmes are to have any economic impact the major industry in rural areas, agriculture, must provide the foundation stone for development.  Agri tourism, forestry and small industry development will have their contribution to make to economic activity and employment in rural areas.  If we follow that path the pay-off in economic terms will be high.  Agricultural output could be higher by hundreds of millions of pounds than it would be if no such policy initiatives were taken, and, because this money will be spent predominantly in the economy, it will have a much higher beneficial effect on our GNP.</P>
      <P>Thus the food industry if the proper policies are applied can give higher and faster returns than almost any other economic sector.  If we get the output it will be translated into real wealth and jobs, but if cuts in the agricultural support services on the scale proposed are adhered to the prospect of generating additional wealth and maintaining employment levels in the food sector will be greatly diminished.  Have no doubt about it, these cuts have to be seen as a strategic error in any quest for national recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, must accept that to undermine the future technological base of the major wealth <Col N="348" /> production industry just does not make economic sense.  Is there need to convince the Minister of the beneficial results to date from our investment in research, advisory and education services?  It seems clear from his reaction this morning that he stands by his cut of 44 per cent for these services while being prepared to justify no cut in the general administration budget of his Department.  The figure of 2 per cent was quoted but it was incorrect because increases coming through from Vote 51 will more than compensate for that.  There is no cut in the administration of £66.5 million for his Department, and the Minister has the gall to come in here this morning and tell us how he sees agriculture and the food industry developing in the years ahead while that kind of funding arrangement is likely to continue.  It is indefensible and unacceptable to anybody who has the interest of agriculture and food at heart or wants to avail of the opportunities to generate employment and improve our economy.  No defence or justification has been put forward by the Minister and the questions are continuing and will continue to be asked in this regard.</P>
    <P>Judging by the remarks he made, the Minister must be aware of the huge percentage of our working population involved in agriculture and food which is so much higher than the Community average, the huge contribution to our exports in net export terms, almost 50 per cent, the contribution to GNP and possible further contribution and the huge numbers in our rural areas as opposed to other countries.  Is it now clear that research and development are necessary to any sustainable economic growth and employment expansion?  Our major competitors have realised this.  Is it now quite clear also that in agriculture a strong research and development base is now needed more than ever to increase efficiency, develop new food and other value-added products and develop alternative enterprises?  The international market is far more challenging than ever before.  The research institute made adaptations to meet those challenges, but the fact that they are to be undermined <Col N="349" /> and in some cases decimated to the extent that they will no longer continue prompts me to say in the most civilised tones that the Minister must think again.</P>
    <P>If we are focusing on research, the object of research is to increase efficiency.  Production and food research are quite inseparable.  Quality starts with production.  We have heard a great deal of hype about the promotion of the food industry.  If that hype is to be translated into reality that industry must be kept in tune by research.  We must keep abreast of all the modern scientific advances in technology and biotechnology.  We will be unable to compete with our competitors in Europe or elsewhere otherwise.  We were managing on quite a low allocation, one of the lowest by European standards, in relation to our gross agricultural output and to slash that at this stage nearly in half is tantamount to total obliteration.  We have built up very valuable research contracts over the years and they are in danger of being lost.  We have been able to avail of the research function in the institute to support the kind of cases we have to make to comply with very complicated regulations and directives within the Community.  Apart altogether from the direct contacts which they have with the European Commission, the research institute has been of major benefit in that regard.</P>
    <P>Because of the stubborn attitude of the Minister in refusing to recognise the case made by the most respected economists in the country, and voiced in this House on behalf of the agriculture and food industry, I wish to point out the marvellous improvements and benefits to our economy that they have been made over the years by the research and advisory sector.  Surely the Minister must be aware of these?  He must be aware that if that sector is not funded we are not going to have those benefits in the challenging years ahead.  I have no doubt that my colleagues from the areas where the research centres are situated will present in detail the achievements of such centres and the case both locally and nationally for a continuation of their work.  We have to be blunt about this.  Many of these <Col N="350" /> centres are now at risk.  The effect of this lack of funding will at best mean semi-paralysis and at worst a complete close down of whole areas of research.  The Minister will not be able to do a Pontius Pilate on this one.</P>
    <P>The centre at Oak Park has had a huge involvement in tillage crops.  They have also made major advances in the areas of farm machinery and some of their inventions, if one can call them that, have been handed over for commercial production. The work at Johnstown Castle is in the area of grass production.  I am not going to go into it in detail here but obviously this has been of enormous benefit to the economy over the years.  They have made improvements in relation to input costs, fertilisers and soil sampling, all of which have brought benefits to the country.  I have no doubt that my colleagues from that area will present that case in full detail.  Is the work which is carried on at the centre in Creagh in the West to be abandoned?  The work at the Kinsealy centre has been such that, for example, the mushroom industry is now worth £20 million a year and employs 1,160 people. This is largely related to the research work that has been done at that centre.</P>
    <P>The centre at Moorepark has been involved in advances in so many areas that its worth is not just recognised in this country but internationally also.  Major changes have taken place in farm practices as a result of experiments carried out at the centre in Grange.  The National Food Centre at Dunsinea was launched with a blaze of publicity.  We are told that it will have a marvellous future.  There is no doubt that the centre at Dunsinea has made a marvellous contribution in the past but how is it going to have this marvellous future without funding?  The rural economy centre of AFT has made a significant contribution on a number of fronts to management efficiency and otherwise.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe knows what he wants to say and what needs to be said and if Deputy Sherlock has something to add afterwards he will have adequate time to do so on Second Stage.  However, he should be clear that anything he says should correspond to the truth and suggestions in relation to the £20 million, commented on by the Deputy are not correct.  I would not be spending my time pressing the Minister to the extent that I have on absolutely proving the case beyond all doubt if I was not convinced of the serious and dangerous consequences that will follow from this funding, which is absolutely insufficient, if the Minister holds to the case he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the excellent work of the research centres will be presented in detail by my colleagues during the course of this debate and I am sure Deputy <Col N="352" /> Sherlock might have a thing or two to say about Moorepark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution of the research centres to Irish agriculture, the food industry and the economy generally has been enormous.  It is also important to say that the advisory side have made an enormous contribution over the years and, in particular, during the past number of years since ACOT got their act together and helped farmers to focus their expertise and efficiency on quality marketing and good business management.  It is clear that the work they have done has been substantial.  The efficiency of those services has been improving each year.  Are we going to cast all that aside because of the extraordinary funding decision taken by the Minister?</P>
      <P>I made the point earlier about the projected loss to the economy of the failure of the Minister to recognise the case we are fighting for adequate funding for the new farm body.  It is clear that we should develop our natural resources because they are the ones that will pay the best dividends.  I think even Paul Tansey of <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> who perhaps would have a more urban approach in his economic philosophy, has come around to that way of thinking.  Independent experts are now pressing this point.  You cannot drive a tractor without diesel and you cannot run your advisory services without funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits to date from the advisory and research centres and the prospect of benefits for the future are so clear that I am amazed the Minister does not interrupt me at this stage to tell me that he totally accepts the case made.  I say to the Minister that it can be done, that he should not throw his hands up into the air.  It may mean over-riding the deep seated objections of the civil servants in his Department, I am not talking about them individually, who will not want to see their empire trimmed in any way. However, they will have to make that <Col N="353" /> sacrifice to ensure that the front line services are maintained and to ensure that the challenges and opportunities for the future are fully met and exploited.  If the Minister does not here and now make up his mind to do that, it is throwing in the towel.  We cannot accept that.  Let us be clear about the consequences.  If the Minister is not prepared to follow the line I am advocating what will be the implications of this shortfall?  Let us be clear that there can be no Pontius Pilate action on this and if this happens do not tell me in three, or six months time if you are still occupying that seat, that it was the new farm body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the director, or the board.  There is a clear cause and effect here and if the Minister will not provide the funding the effects at this stage can be clearly envisaged.  What will they be?  We have 12 residential agricultural colleges at present and they will come under severe threat.  Let me state bluntly that it is inevitable that a number will close down.  In 1987 480 scolarships were provided by ACOT.  There is no hope under the present funding arrangements of any scholarships for 1988.  What will happen if there are no scholarships? It is now projected that about half of the 12 colleges would have no students if this were to happen and they would close down.  These are the inevitable consequences of the Minister's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the local centres?  I think it is quite clear that the advisory section of the new body would find it impossible to maintain its local network of training centres.  I can see some scope for rationalisation, particularly where research centres and ACOT centres are located in the same area.  Such rationalisation is fine and is sensible planning.  But what about the situation in the remote or disadvantaged areas?  It is not quite clear that many of these centres will inevitably be closed down?  The Minister has consistently stated that training is the top <Col N="354" /> priority for the new Authority but he simply cannot deliver on that with the proposed level of funding.</P>
    <P>What future has the advisory service? Eighty advisers have already left on voluntary retirement.  In addition a further squeeze will take place because this new farm body will not be able to pay the balance of the advisers who will be employed, or should be employed.  I do not know what is going to happen to them.  The Minister is hinting now that they may be redeployed and off pushing pens in some other office.</P>

      <P>The Minister would let me ease off if he did a little more than admit he has got the message &mdash; it took a while to get that through &mdash; and say he will react to the message because that is the key to all this.  If he does not agricultural colleges will close, there will be <Col N="355" /> no advice available except for those who can pay and there will be an increase in fees.  What about other central issues such as environmental pollution, etc? Who will provide the advice down on the ground to deal with these crucial issues?</P>
      <P>It is clear that in order to stay within the present budget at least 300 staff on the ACOT side will have to go in addition to a similar number from AFT thus bringing the staff numbers of 1,600 down to the 1,000 mark.  The Minister will have to square the circle.  The staff will either stay and be paid to do their job or they will go, where I do not know.  We demand to know what the scenario is because we cannot leave this in limbo.  If we follow through on what the Minister presently proposes, these are the consequences. The same will apply on the other side. How many of our research centres will be closed?  How many of them will be totally trimmed in their operations?  I cannot say, the Minister will decide.  Will Johnstown Castle or Oak Park go?  What will happen to Creagh in the west?  The present indications are that it will be closed.  Kinsealy is gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural economic centre has gone and other operations have been scaled down.  It is important that we put before the Minister here and now that these will be the consequences of his actions.  The Minister must recognise this and tell us his answer to it or that he will take the kind of action that we have been proposing on the funding issue.  We have already seen the cuts on the ground.  Here in Dublin five of the 13 advisory staff have already gone and is the Minister to tell us that more are to go?  Of the five staff who have left four were horticultural advisers.  Leaving aside Dublin's reputation for horticulture and its being the base for An Bord Glas, God help us, four of the five horticultural advisers have already left.  Is the Minister saying he has no answer to the funding <Col N="356" /> situation which may in fact mean that the last person may go.  The same serious problems are developing already in Limerick, Monaghan and Donegal while in my own area, in Cork, six advisers have gone.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister has taken on board my point but what is not clear is whether he is prepared to respond to it.  I demand a response and if the Minister does not provide an effective response he will be the author and proposer of the various consequences I have outlined already.  I want to question one other aspect of funding, that is the farm apprenticeship board.  Again, the Minister must recognise that the board have done excellent work.  Every year 350 young people take part in these schemes and everyone is placed in employment on completion of the course.  The cost to the State through the ACOT grant is £500 per head an average.  This was more than compensated for to the Exchequer by the PAYE - RSI uptake from the payments made.  This is another very important scheme that is seriously under threat if the Minister does not relent on the funding issue.</P>
      <P>I do not want to off load too much on the Minister's conscience.  Let him be quite clear of what the consequences will be if he obstinately and stubbornly digs in on this issue, and if he is not willing to convince his colleagues that a transfer of funding within his own Department is needed and will be effected.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is no need to tell the Minister there was another proposed solution floated &mdash; redeployment.  As I recollect, the Minister did not touch on this point in his speech and I trust that he does not see that as an answer to the funding crisis.  It costs enough and there is a great need for our specialists in these areas to be available to consider the notion of putting them pen pushing and going for the general administrative grades.  Mind you that is what is happening and there is a degree of pressure on staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has committed himself to everything being done by way of voluntary redundancy procedure but there <Col N="357" /> are certain pressures which would make one question the voluntary nature of redundancy and, in particular, redeployment.  Some of these pressures include suggestions that the package may not remain voluntary for too long and that if people want to be considered it is essential that they come forward now.  These pressures would raise an issue as to whether the redundancy package is entirely voluntary.  Be that as it may, it is not the answer.  We need these people out in the field and must pay them out there.  There is no point in continuing to pay them out of the public purse in some slot where they are not needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to my colleagues for having dwelt on that aspect for so long, but I am seriously concerned about the effects of this crisis which the Minister has created.  I absolutely believe in the need for a solution and no effort can be spared in pressing the point.  The Minister is aware of the terms which I proposed of a transfer of £7.5 million from general administration to the new farm body.  It will not be enough in the context of the figures that they themselves quote.  It does not go the full way, but it is a fair and reasonable approach in a tight situation.  It would increase the Exchequer funding from £20 million to £27.5 million; it would reduce the £66.5 million administration of the Department by a similar sum.  It would have some impact on the more than 4,000 employees &mdash; I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not seen the results of this famous audit supposed to be produced quite a while ago.  There is a fairly broad consensus that there is fat in there.  There is also virtually total consensus on the part of every body other than the Minister and his departmental officials that, in any <Col N="358" /> event, the priority has to be the front line service.  I do not propose to go into any detail on this, but have told how further cost-effectiveness and savings can be found.  They should integrate the other services.  They should put the farm development service in with the new farm body, the one stop shop.  The Minister should talk to his colleague in Industry and Commerce.  That is the man who is now presenting that view as being something radical and novel.  It is not radical, new or novel &mdash; it is a good idea and I commend it to the Minister.  Let him put the farm development service and the funding associated with that into the new farm body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>And the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and the funding.  As regards An Bord Glas, I know that amount of money in the Estimate of £168,000 will not make a huge difference, but from the point of view of effectiveness and efficiency &mdash; they should give up that phraseology because it is not just working out &mdash; they should transfer the funding and the functions of An Bord Glas to the new farm body.</P>
      <P>Finally, I come to another area that the Department nicely held on to, the residual research and testing function, with nearly £1.5 million provided in the Estimate to cover that.  That should be given to the new farm body.  In that situation there would be £7.5 million extra funding at the expense of administration, with no extra cost to the Exchequer. There would be a more integrated and effective new farm body.  There would be a much better service to the farmers, much more efficient and with greater swings in the long term.  I believe that that is the answer and I strongly urge the Minister to override bureaucratic objections to that approach.  He should put it into effect straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in opening that there were two aspects to be considered from the point of view of the Bill.  The Minister accepts that I have adequately covered the first part on the question of funding. It is the question of the Bill itself that I <Col N="359" /> want to come to.  On that question, the broad principle of the merger is very acceptable, but there is quite a number of unacceptable provisions in the Bill on which the Minister will have to think again.  We shall need much more detail on this on Committee Stage, but at this stage it is necessary to sketch out in broad outline where the real problems lie.</P>
    <P>There is a major difficulty in relation to the title which, I take it, has some relevance.  It is not just a question of asking what was in a name.  It costs money to promote a name.  The Minister talks about this new farm body having a commercial orientation.  There is an almost universal criticism of the name Teagasc. Various definitions have been put forward as to what it literally means.  I am not a major Gaelic scholar, but an investigation that I have undertaken suggests that the name can be literally translated as doctrine, such as in the phrase christian doctrine &mdash; teagasc Chriosta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the name, there is a number of possibilities.  It is very clear that the name Teagasc has caused a problem and I am not making a political issue about this. Alternative views or proposals should be looked at as to how a better name could be found.  One has to market the name and if it is unmarketable, then there is an additional cost.  I have canvassed people for suggestions and have received a number.  One suggestion was the word &ldquo;forbairt&rdquo; meaning development or growth.  Another was &ldquo;umas&rdquo;, meaning power or ability.  There was the word &ldquo;comhar&rdquo; meaning co-operation and the word &ldquo;abhair&rdquo; meaning assistance.  These are some of the suggestions I got.  I am not suggesting that any of these is a major improvement but they would be some improvement.  One thought that did occur to me was that if the Minister was serious about trawling the brains of the country looking for a suitable name, he should invite the <i>Farmers Journal</i> to hold a competition and get our Gaelic scholars around the country to come up <Col N="361" /> with ideas, The Minister might treat that as a joke, but why not do that?</P>
      <P>Another possibility is that the new farm body would be called An Chomhairle Oiliúna agus Taighde Talmhaíochta or ACOTT for short.  At first glance I am sure our friends in the institute might not be entirely happy with that, but it incorporates the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; in the title.  Another advantage is that the briefer version ACOT has become well known all over the country so there would be no difficulty in market identification of the title.  This would overcome a lot of problems.</P>
      <P>The next point that arises is in relation to the restrictions under the definition of basic veterinary research.  Why is there a need for a statutory restriction whereby the Minister is precluded from even allowing the new farm body to engage in the diagnosis of diseases in livestock or poultry or the investigation or carrying out of tests, trials or inquiries for the purposes of schemes in relation to the eradication of disease in animals or the promotion, enforcement or control of animal hygiene?  Why have these restrictions in the Act?  The Minister may argue that there are 101 different reasons why the new farm body should not have these powers.  We can debate that but why have a statutory exclusion?  I do not want to hear that these restrictions were there throughout history?  I want justification now.  Why the exclusion and, more important, why the statutory exclusion?</P>
      <P>Under section 4 (5) the body will not do certain things unless authorised in writing by the Minister to do so.  It might be a solution to put those functions in there if the Minister feels strongly about it but what I strongly object to is a statutory exclusion.  The Minister will not be there forever.  If for a variety of reasons, a subsequent Minister wanted to change that, his hands would be tied by statute. Is this protecting the situation of his Department again?  If that is the only justification for it it should be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to the question of Ministerial control.  I accept that this farm body will have to be subject, to some degree, to policy directions.  There must <Col N="362" /> be some element of control over its activities but this has gone totally overboard in the compilation of this Bill.  Every page is a series of things which have to be done by direction of the Minister or, more important, things that cannot be done without the approval of the Minister, compounded by a situation where many of these things cannot be done without the approval of two Ministers and, in one extreme example, I found that something could not be done without the involvement of three Ministers.  This is totally extreme example, I found that something could not be done without the involvement of three Ministers.  This is totally unacceptable.  It is putting the damp, cold, bureaucratic hand of the Civil Service around the neck of this farm body and choking it at birth.  This farm body is not going to be a policy arm of the Minister or his Department.  It has to be, at a minimum, semi-autonomous.  I am not saying we should set it off like a satellite into space and let it carry on in its own way but it cannot be totally stifled.  The kind of arrangements at present in place are such that it will have no possibility of any autonomous function at all.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister due notice that he will be pressed on this issue on Committee Stage.  I will just give him a little bit of information on the point, in case he has not focused on it to date.  I went through the sections to see how many instances there were where things had to be done or could not be done without the intervention of at least one Minister, in many instances two and, in one instance, three Ministers.  The total was 45 instances.  That is not a sensible way to run a body.  There will have to some loosening up of that situation.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to the requirement to produce a programme in advance each year.  Let me just plant the idea with the Minister that when talking about research and development we are taking about the medium to long term.  I think it would be far more sensible to have a five year indicative programme with a corresponding commitment to funding by the Government.  A one year programme which can be changed, revoked, amended, added to, substracted from by the Minister, at the instigation of the Minister for Finance at any stage during <Col N="363" /> the year is no way to run a business.  The Minister should take a longer-term view.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the point on subsidiaries included but there is an issue which will arise here in regard to clawing back moneys.  These subsidiaries could have quite a commercial orientation.  If there is an automatic clawback of any funding arising then this could lead to a lack of risk-taking or an innovative approach on the part of the staff.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will not take it as a discourtesy on my part.  I hoped that by now I would have heard the contributions of each of the front bench spokesmen.  I know the Deputy has a right to make his contribution in this fashion but I hope he will understand that, unfortunately, I have made arrangements and have a very important engagement in a few moments so I hope he will understand if I leave now.</P>

      <P>I would ask that a note be taken of any further points and passed on to the Minister.  In the area of subsidiaries there are quite a lot of possibilities but care has to be taken on the question of any funding by subsidiaries.  If it is going to be immediately clawed back it will lead to problems.</P>
      <P>In regard to recruitment a very strong case has been made to me that there would have to be some provision whereby new blood can be injected into the organisation.  In any research it is quite clear that if new blood is not coming in, the whole project will become stagnant. I have mentioned research in particular but this applies also in other areas.  The numbers we are talking about are small but if there is a total embargo on new blood coming in, even to cover natural wastage in the organisation, it spells trouble for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the board will lead to many problems.  The Minister will have difficulty in standing over his proposals. We have had experience of this in the <Col N="364" /> past.  I do not want to touch on any sensitivities as far as the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk is concerned.  Allegations have been made in relation to the composition of the board and the basic requirement of being a card carrying cumann member that the board is of no consequence anyway.  I do not want to see this happening in relation to the board of the new farming authority.  We need a dynamic board that will have qualifications other than a cumann card.  If the Minister has total control over the appointments I fear the inevitable and I have little doubt that the basic credential of the cumann card will surface.  That is not good enough.  I do not necessarily object to somebody who has something to offer the board having some cumann connections in addition to other credentials but if we allowed the present sutuation to continue it would be highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>We do not want a board of party hacks and we can achieve that in a number of ways.  We can ensure that, from the point of view of farm representatives, the farm organisations nominate the members for appointment by the Minister.  That is quite important.  It is far better that an organisation such as the IFA who are representative of 70,000 or 80,000 farmers nominate the person that they consider the most suitable to represent them on the board and also to contribute to the deliberations of the board.  It would also enable the Minister to resist the temptation of putting forward IFA cumann members in Tipperary.  The same applies in the case of the ICMSA, Macra and the ICOS.  Those bodies should be allowed to nominate their members and let them then be appointed by the Minister.  The Minister would need to be positive in his reaction on this point or he will face amendments on Committee Stage.  There are two members of the staff on the present ACOT board. The agricultural advisers have nominations to the AFT board.  There are three staff members on the two boards.</P>
    <P>We are talking about modern industrial <Col N="365" /> relations, worker directors and semiState bodies.  At present the Worker Participation Bill is being discussed in the Seanad, introduced with a lot of hype by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Labour.  Surely it makes sense to provide that the staff shall be entitled to have elections to nominate a staff member to the board.  I would caution the Minister against following the line he is taking at present in relation to the board.  It is absolutely essential that the board be up and running and workable and any question of an inefficient or an ineffective board will add to the already major problems of this foundling which is being launched.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of the director.  Under the terms of the Bill the Minister has power of appointment of the first director.  Someone has to make the appointment but it is a question of when and how.  I made the point earlier to the Minister in another context that we must have a quick appointment and arrangements for that should be put in train straight away.  I would point out the need for a vibrant, dynamic approach on the part of the director-designate and I would caution against any question of having the office tainted by suggestions of political or other intrigue.  The simple answer is to hold an open competition, and I strongly urge that arrangements for such an open competition should be put in train straight away.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill deals with the possible expansion of functions overseas.  The House will be aware of my interest in that area.  There is a provision in the Bill that is quite unwise and that is the reference to any such involvement having to be on a self-financing basis.  Development overseas works on the same basis as development here.  It is a medium to long term operation and it may be necessary in the initial stages of an involvement in a project or programme overseas to provide seed capital, as it were, if there were possibilities that by so doing there would be financing from international organisations or otherwise.  It is an unwise approach to insist on that provision.</P>
    <P>When I read the section on disclosure <Col N="366" /> of information I wondered if the Minister had been reading <i>Spycatcher</i> or following the shenanigans of the British Government in chasing poor Mr. Wright.  I could not believe what was in that section.  The Minister will have to justify a section along those lines before it is acceptable to this House.  The members of ACOT and AFT have a proud and honourable record over the years and I have certainly never heard any suggestion of breaches of confidentiality or otherwise by anybody working for those organisations.  The basic job of these organisations is to disseminate information.  Having a provision such as this lurking in the background will unduly restrict the activities of those people who will be working in the new farm body.  I would caution the Minister about that and suggest to him that he should think again about the matter.</P>
    <P>I made the point earlier that this organisation is not a policy arm of the Department.  There is an independent source of information.  It is said that the creation of an open, helpful atmosphere is important for the research and developmental function.  There has been no problem in the past.  Therefore one may well ask, why the necessity for this provision at this stage?  Is it another weapon in the armoury of the bureaucrats to keep this organisation under their thumb?  It is much too conservative, cautious, entails much too much bowing to the attitude of the bureaucrats.</P>
    <P>If we examine the position within the EC we find that in other countries the institutes or organisations involved in this area are largely autonomous.  We are talking about research and development being market-led but the market will not be interested in a secret society which, in a sense, could be one interpretation of this section and which is quite unacceptable.  In the AFT Act of 1958 there is an explicit reference to the entitlement to public research material.  What we have here, instead, is section 14 which restricts the disclosure of information. What is the linkage between the two? That warrants some explanation.  I am not happy on that point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I come now to the county committees of agriculture.  It is generally accepted that those committees, in their respective areas, made a welcome contribution to the development of agriculture, particularly from the point of view of their serving as a local forum in which people could express their views.  There will be many who will have a sense of nostalgia and regret at their passing.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the new farm body may now establish committees to advise and assist pursuant to section 17. He suggests that will be sufficient to cover the aspect of local advisory input.  I have to disagree with him there.  First, the power is given to the new farm body on a totally discretionary basis, where it is said in section 17 (1) that Teagasc may establish committees to assist and advise it in relation to the performance of its functions.  If we are interested in having a local input, then the provisions of this section will have to be tightened up.  We will have to know at what we are aiming, ensuring that the legislative framework is sufficient to cover that objective.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is committed to his decision to abolish the county committees of agriculture then we should have some form of local consultative structure, some forum for the purpose of providing an advisory input on the part of those involved in the industry, be they farmers, those involved in the food industry, those with a strong interest for one reason or another.  Indeed, let us not forget that there are many public elected representatives who would be interested in having an input.  Thus the shape of things to develop there might be in the form of county advisory fora, representatives of whom might meet with members of the new farm body as often as was thought necessary.  That would ensure a local input or a local two-way exchange.  I believe this could all be done at a cost which would not be substantial, certainly not in the context of the kind of returns that could emanate there from. The Minister might consider that suggestion.  We can revert to the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> I am now merely covering broadly a number of points that needed to be made in regard to various sections.  Indeed under the provisions as they stand there does not seem to be any link between the universities and the proposed new farm body.  It should be remembered that the universities have a strong research function.  It is my opinion that the Minister will have to give some thought to overcoming that vacuum.  For example, in UCD, the faculty of agriculture &mdash; now under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority &mdash; is virtually an orphan, threatened with disintegration.  They have an automatic right of nomination to an Foras Talúntais which will now disappear.  There is also the major food faculty in University College, Cork.  There is also a significant input from the point of view of microbiology on the part of University College, Galway.  There should be some requirement for the establishment and maintenance of close working relationships between the universities and the new farm body. However, I shall revert to these points on Committee Stage when I shall deal with them in great detail.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset there were two main aspects to the Bill.  I spent quite an amount of time speaking about the funding aspect which must be resolved. If it is not the future will be very gloomy for this new farm body and it will have an adverse impact, not just on farmers but on our entire economy.  The whole approach to date has been one of muddle, mishandling and mismanagement, compounded I believe, by Civil Service intrigue and Ministerial incompetence.  It will be seen that the new farm body is commencing its task with a huge handicap.  Unless steps are taken to recover lost ground, to deal with the funding crisis, it is my belief that it will take many years, not just decades, for that body and the industry to recover.  Surely that is a totally undesirable legacy of the present Minister for Agriculture and Food to our farmers and agricultural industry generally?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the evidence of the <Col N="369" /> prosecution the Minister must be found guilty.  I shall endeavour to relate my comments to the future of agriculture.  I do not intend to be as thorough in my examination of the provisions of the Bill before the House as was the Fine Gael spokesman.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the Bill is to amalgamate An Foras TalÚntais and ACOT and transfer their functions to a new single body called Teagasc, the body to be known in English as the Agriculture and Food Development Authority.  The Minister advises us that the word &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; means to teach, whereas my colleague on the Fine Gael benches agrees with my interpretation, that it means &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo;.  If this is to be regarded as the doctrine of the Fianna Fáil Government for the farming community, then the concept of maintaining family farms and keeping people on the land&mdash; embodied in our Constitution&mdash;is dead once and for all.</P>
      <P>The second most important provision of the Bill is the abolition of the county committees of agriculture.  These committees were made up of voluntary bodies and members of farming organisations, Muintir na Tíre, the Land League and local authorities.  They were in the unique position of knowing what was happening on the ground and in their own areas. This link between farming areas and the Department of Agriculture will now be eliminated in this Bill and will be replaced by computer forecasts and economists' views of what is best for agriculture at local level.  We all know what economists' views in relation to agriculture have been before and it is from such economists and like forecasters' past exhortations that European farmers&mdash;and Irish farmers in particular &mdash; responded to encouragement, investment production and indeed doubled their production.  Ireland were only second to Holland in the last 15 years in their response to calls to produce more.  However, they now have land without quotas or hope of future development and capital investment from which they can get no return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there have been abuses in the county committees of agriculture.  I <Col N="370" /> have spoken to a number of people involved in them and one of the main difficulties is that they were platforms for aspiring politicians to make political speeches.  They were too politically-orientated and they often degenerated into political slagging.  The attendances at times were far from satisfactory and very often the political aspirants attended such meetings, made a bit of noise and then left.  The main business proceeded without them and if that was the type of input there was&mdash;it is generally held by farmers and farming bodies that such was the case &mdash; certainly they needed to be changed, if not abolished.  I propose that these committees should be kept in a reduced statutory form whereby those on them would represent the views of farming bodies and organisations.  Those who are not farmers should at least have a qualification in agriculture or food.  After all, if committees are not to be talking shops, they will have to attract those who have a genuine interest in local agricultural development.</P>
    <P>There has been the ridiculous situation where there were 45 members of ACOT in County Dublin.  Such a large number must mean that many of them had no real interest in agriculture and, for that reason, their activities should be curtailed.  However, to do away with them is perhaps throwing out the baby with the bath water because at least they provide a feedback.  I am very disappointed with the feedback and attention which the Department of Agriculture have generally given to these committees.  If they have become talking shops, a great deal of the responsibility must lie with the Department of Agriculture because they did not adequately respond to genuine resolutions sent from members of boards of county committees of agriculture throughout the country.  This is not the time to do away with them, as too many things are being done away with in rural areas, for example, schools which are being rationalised and many services which are now too expensive to run on a widespread basis.  The Progressive Democrats accept that there must be rationalisation but there is not much <Col N="371" /> point in introducing a Bill establishing Teagasc, for the benefit of agriculture if the numbers of people engaging in agriculture are falling daily.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Government have taken almost £100 million per annum out of agriculture in the past 12 months by various levies and refund reductions against the background of falling quotas and opportunities, they are now prepared to allocate from their own resources only 2 per cent of their entire budget for 1988 to agricultural development and training.  I heard the Minister make a most insulting and erroneous remark to the agricultural community, that his Department is dispensing £1,500 million annually to the farming community.  Nothing could be further from the truth and it only serves to cause a division between rural and urban people because there is a feeling that farmers are waiting for the postman to arrive with their share of this money. The Minister should choose his words more carefully in this respect because it is well known that most of this money has gone to intervention, the control of prices, export refunds and many other things which have nothing to do with the everyday life of the farmer.</P>
    <P>The cut in the combined budget for ACOT-AFT in 1988 is the most draconian of all Departments and the Government must now admit that they made a huge mistake.  Indeed, the Minister for Agriculture said it was a team decision but the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Department of Finance were privately amazed at the size of the cuts. They pointed out that they had no input whatever in regard to this decision.  It was taken by the Government and at this stage it is not fair to pressurise the Department of Agriculture and Food by having a witch hunt within it to lop staff when it is not intended to do this in other Departments.  The internal audit promised by the Minister for Agriculture and Food has, so far, not yielded any concrete results nor is it likely to do so.</P>
    <P>How can you justify such huge cuts in <Col N="372" /> the direct support to agriculture and at the same time condone over-manning in the TB eradication scheme which goes on unchecked with no tangible results?  It is not easy for farmers to understand how 84 people employed as land inspectors last year by the Department of Finance and who have had no duties to perform over the last 12 months can continue to be employed at a cost to the Exchequer of approximately £1.5 million when there is such a savage cut in the ACOT-AFT wages bill.  It is no wonder that farm leaders and organisations generally feel that they are in the back seat in relation to the economy.  The general perception of farmers is that they would have been better off to have stayed the way they were as they have got no benefits over the past couple of years from all the investment, hard work and development which went into the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>While recognising that the gross budget Estimate has to stand in view of the appalling national financial situation, it is now well understood that the Minister for Agriculture and Food agreed to a proportionately inordinate cut in the Agriculture Vote.  It is now obvious that that Vote was too small.  Having recognised the blunder made in the ACOT-AFT allocation, the Minister sought to do a refinancing job within his own Department.  It was only when the union representing the professional and technical staff of ACOT and AFT were able to establish that compulsory redundancies were not on that the Minister was obliged to ask the Government to offer the redundancy package to those over 50 years of age in his own Department.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate on this motion last week I was about to turn to the question of financial management as expounded through budgetary measures.  I should like to refer to the decision of the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, to amalgamate three training organisations with effect from 1 January.  The Minister succeeded in amalgamating the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and the National Manpower Service into one organisation FÁS.  It was correct to bring those three organisations together because over the years, while they developed in their own way and their personnel acquired great skills, it became evident that there was a duplication of resources.  Often those organisations operated in the same area.  There was a duplication of effort by the officials with organisations pursuing the same issues on many occasions.  There was a waste of resources and a duplication of experience.  That move, which was in keeping with our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> had been discussed and agreed on with the social partners.</P>
      <P>I hope the amalgamation will mean that we will have a more effective streamlined organisation capable of dealing with the needs of those who require training or retraining.  I hope it can assist those endeavouring to set up a small business and that the expertise in FÁS, with its exceptional management board, will enhance opportunities for people to start their own business and improve training facilities.  I hope the new body will be able to assist those who are searching for jobs.  I wish all concerned with the new body success in the years ahead.  We will be relying on that body to carry out an effective job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Government's decision to establish an interdepartmental committee to examine the various issues arising from the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme <Col N="374" /> under which employers will be responsible for the pay of employees for the first 13 weeks of illness.  A critical examination of that area is long overdue and I am delighted that the Government are taking the first tentative steps to inquire into that issue.  Workers who invest their time and skills in their jobs are entitled to a better return from their employers in terms of support during illness.  It is not correct that if a worker has been sick for two or three days the State should pay him or her sick benefit.  It is right that employers should be asked to provide help for their employees who are sick.  In many cases people spend all their working life with one company.  I hope the Government will be able to produce a set of proposals which, in consultation with employers and the trade unions, will prove beneficial to employers and employees.  Those proposals should be more cost effective in terms of the subvention by the State to people who fall ill at work.  I hope we will hear more about that issue in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Government's decision in the budget not to reduce mortgage interest relief.  In the 1987 budget the Minister reduced that relief by 10 per cent.  I accept that there was a 3 per cent fall in interest rates in 1987 which benefited mortgage holders considerably.  On the average mortgage of £20,000 the reduction in interest rates last year has meant a saving of £530 in a full year.  I accept that the saving is considerable but it is only right to point out that the taking out of a mortgage is the biggest investment a family will be involved in.  Mortgage repayments represent a considerable drain on the resources of families and, for that reason, I was pleased to learn there will not be a further deduction in the mortgage interest relief.  I look forward to a further reduction in interest rates which will result in more savings to mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about the vexed issues of tax administration. We are often bombarded with figures for unpaid tax, uncollected tax and so on. We should bear in mind that many of the <Col N="375" /> figures quoted relate to assessments but we must accept that the administration of our tax system leaves a lot to be desired.  If we embarked on a radical overhaul of our tax collection system the nation's finances, and our taxpayers, would benefit.  It is fair to point out that all businesses are inundated with letters from the Revenue Commissioners about PRSI, PAYE, VAT, corporation tax and so on.  It is a great burden on any enterprise to keep up with the payment of all taxes.  It is true to say that in the case of PAYE and PRSI the money is deducted from employees but employers must meet other taxes such as VAT.  It is difficult for most small industries to meet VAT payments on a bi-monthly basis.  It is often the case that the remittance for VAT to the Revenue Commissioners is the biggest single payment made by small industries.  Many of them have great difficulty accumulating that money in these difficult financial times.</P>
    <P>The system of paying VAT has not altered since it was first introduced.  It is paid on a two-monthly basis where credit is given.  Enterprises can sometimes find themselves in a position of having to pay tax to the Revenue Commissioners before they have been paid by their customers.  In other words, they are lending money to the Revenue Commissioners. This area requires a complete and radical overhaul.  In the case of the television licence or ESB bill, we are encouraged to pay small amounts over a period so that we will not be stretched by having to pay a large sum at any one time.  In considering the reorganisation of tax administration we should try to make it easier for the taxpayer to pay on time.  It is to the benefit of taxpayers to keep their tax payments up to date and it is certainly to the benefit of the nation's finances.  A great deal of time and energy is spent by business enterprises to ensure they have the resources to pay their taxes on time. There are very substantial penalties for failure to do so.  I would hope that the Government in looking at the whole <Col N="376" /> question of tax arrears and administration would try to ensure that whatever system is devised next year or the year after will result from consultation with the representative organisations of employers and employees.</P>
    <P>Any change in tax administration should not stop there but should move on to see if in certain areas employees could take more responsibility for ensuring that their taxes are paid on time, particularly where PRSI is deducted at source.  With the co-operation of employees and employers we could introduce a system where there would be some type of self-regulation in relation to the payment of taxes.  People would be able to see on a weekly basis that their taxes had been paid up to date, particularly where they had been deducted by employers from their wages and salaries. This would benefit both employees and employers because it would prevent them getting into the difficulty of having major payments outstanding, on which interest would accrue.  I hope these matters will be addressed in the reorganisation of tax administration.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal to consider the question of attachment is very interesting.  Having reorganised the tax administration, the Government will give to the Revenue Commissioners stronger powers in relation to outstanding taxes and introduce a system of attachment whereby if an individual or organisation fails to make payments on time the Government can be paid by a third party who owe money to the defaulting company or individual.  This would be a very strong measure which would prove very effective but it cannot be introduced in <i>an ad hoc</i> way and must be part of a major reorganisation.  There is much criticism about archaic methods of tax collection and it is time for a fundamental change. I welcome the Government's approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government have made considerable progress in stabilising the national finances.  Much remains to be done.  I am convinced that there is room in this House for political parties broadly to support the efforts of this Government <Col N="377" /> to deal with the serious issues which confront our country, while at the same time leaving room for those parties to develop and adhere to their own philosophies. Would it not be far better for all parties to contribute to major national progress for all our people during the next few years and thereafter go before the electorate with their own ideas as to how this country can be taken into the twenty-first century?</P>

      <P>In reviewing this year's budget and supporting its broad thrust, I cannot help but reflect on how much better off this country would have been but for the negative and cynical opposition adopted for the past four and a half years by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition.  They opposed every policy document introduced by the previous Government in a display of dog-in-the-manger tactics unequalled in Irish politics.  The clarity with which Fianna Fáil saw and recognised the problems immediately on coming into office contrasted with the shoddy and blind opposition they produced in that four and a half year period.  How many Irish emigrants might be at home today had the Fianna Fáil Party the courage to put Ireland first is a matter for conjecture. There is no doubt that the hardship being experienced by many Irish families might have been alleviated to some extent by a more honest and reasonable form of opposition.  Their stance contrasts starkly with the honesty and courage displayed by Deputy Alan Dukes who has introduced a new style of politics.  He is the leader of the party of responsibility in in Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that the measures in this year's budget are necessary if we are to survive the next decade.  Every Government since 1969 have been turfed out by the electorate and this will be no exception.  Perhaps then the political leaders will heed the call of the nation for a national Government for a period of years to rule in a strong but benevolent fashion without opposition from the street by every vested interest group, the various trade unions, the IFA, the <Col N="378" /> Church and the school children who have been used in a very cynical fashion on more than one occasion.  The present crisis in Irish politics, the question of whether we will have a fifth election in the eighties, illustrates the need for a national Government.  If the Taoiseach goes to the country on the issue of the closure of a hospital it will be a sad day for Irish politics and for all of us who have the responsibility to sit here in Parliament.</P>
    <P>I will refer specifically to the neglected county of Louth and I am renewing my plea for some recognition of the trauma suffered by the people of County Louth and of other Border counties over the past 20 years.  I congratulate the people of County Louth, particularly the people of Dundalk and Ardee, for their forebearance and courage in the face of deprivation, hardship and neglect by all Governments over the past 20 years. They have suffered for two decades with sweet Fanny Adams being done for them. Dundalk has 31 per cent unemployment while the national average is 18 per cent. Ardee is a town virtually without hope. My Government did nothing for this region, but somehow their sin is only a venial sin when contrasted with the cynical neglect and indeed the three card trick employed by Fianna Fáil in the Border regions.  When in Opposition they shed crocodile tears about the region.  They started a Border committee which was dispanded immediately on entering Government.  Michael O'Kennedy, one Saturday afternoon went on a PR mission to Newry and he had more photographers in his circus than Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev.  Mr. O'Kennedy and Dr. O'Hanlon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They and the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, took the trouble to ascertain the problems of the region.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been particularly <Col N="379" /> sympathetic to our plight but, unfortunately, he has not been in a position to help us.  Having ascertained the problems they did nothing.  The people of County Louth sent two Fianna Fáil Deputies to Dáil Éireann to represent them on the basis of promises given for help in that region, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon and the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson.  We also have a Minister of State in the region. They have all disregarded County Louth and have continued to throw the people of the region to the wolves.  My colleague and friend Deputy Ahern referred to this caring Government in his contribution because they gave a social welfare increase of 3 per cent.  I would remind him that the previous Government gave social welfare increases in the region of 25 per cent two years in a row.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies from the Border region should have the courage, as I had, to attack their own Government for the lack of help and recognition, instead of staying mute.

    <P>I have consistently called for the creation of an enterprise zone in the Border region, similar to the survival package produced by the British Government and set up in Belfast in the early seventies when they were in the grip of indiscriminate car bombings and the streets of Belfast were deserted.  That helped the hard-pressed traders in Belfast to survive a very difficult time.  We should have zones similar to that created in the Border regions.  We should have the various grants, incentives and inducements that are available in the Gaeltacht areas. The IDA should give higher priority to the Border region.  It is common knowledge in the Border region that visiting industrialists are in some cases not brought there but to the more glamorous parts of Ireland, such as Kerry, Cork and Galway and so on.  Many industrialists are not brought to Dundalk, and if they are it is as an afterthought.  There should be increased priority in the IDA for a region that has suffered more than any other region in this country as a result of <Col N="380" /> the Ulster troubles.  I want the IDA to produce something of a large-scale investment in an area where skills and qualities are as high as in any part of this country.</P>
    <P>There is a huge burden imposed in protecting the Border and, as a Dundalk Deputy, I have had the opportunity to observe it at close quarters.  A recent figure given was £296 million, an unbearable burden for a country of our size. The huge amounts spent in securing this country from the ravages of the IRA are undoubtedly, along with the social welfare burden, the two main problems confronting us.  I have been consistent in denouncing the IRA as the enemies of Ireland.  In conscience I must also deplore and denounce the atrocious, stupid, indefensible and contemptuous attitude of the British Government in suppressing the Stalker-Sampson report and refusing to prosecute members of the RUC for the public executions carried out on the highway in the Portadown region.  The British say they did it in the national interest, but what about our national interest?  I wonder what is the real story behind that unbelievable refusal to prosecute?  I suspect that had the Stalker report been made public it would have opened a Pandora's box.  It might have shown that the British Government, as they do in other countries, have their agents in this country.  Perhaps it would have shown that they have highly paid agents in the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>You have read me right as usual.  I was just speaking of the economic cost of protecting the Border and I suggest that the suppression of the Stalker report was perhaps because the British did not want to open a Pandora's box.  Their involvement in this country is quite strong.  Both MI5 and the SAS know more than they should about the <Col N="381" /> affairs of this country.  I will leave it at that.  However, as an out-and-out opponent of the IRA and as a person who regards them as the real enemies of this country, I was very disappointed in the British attitude.  No matter what party we are in, there is no way we can accept the public executions that were carried out by the so-called forces of law and order in the North of Ireland.  I must deplore them as equally I deplore tha activities of the IRA.  This decision undoubtedly will serve as a recruiting drive for the IRA mobsters and will add to the continuing death and misery suffered by the Ulster people and to the decline of the Border area as an economic unit.</P>
      <P>The Government, in the budget, allocated £6.5 million for education.  How much of that will be spent in County Louth?  Will the Government honour the approval given by the previous Government to Dundalk vocational school for a much needed extension?  Will they provide money for the necessary extension for Dundalk grammar school?  Will the school in Cooley, also approved and cruelly guillotined, be ignored too?  Will the Christian Brothers in Sunday's Gate, Drogheda, who have provided education for generations of Drogheda people and need a new school badly, be ignored? The go-ahead for these schools has been approved and, in addition to increasing facilities for the pupils, will be a welcome oasis of employment to the building and construction industry in County Louth. Already the loss of the major contract in Dundalk in the vocational school has forced one of Dundalk's foremost builders out of business.  Speaking of the building industry, now in the ashes in the Border region, I remind the Government of the clarion calls of the Fianna Fáil Party who always backed the building industry, or so it is claimed.  I would like to ask the builders now whether the promises given to them were honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the smuggling industry and to remind the Minister that he has given the go-ahead to a continuation of <Col N="382" /> Ireland's haemorrhage in the unascertainable loss of revenue on a horrendous scale to Margarget Thatcher. The petrol business in the region is lost and a diviner would be needed along the Border to find petrol on the southern side.  The Tom and Jerry brothers across the Border have been turned virtually overnight into Irish Saudi Arabian tycoons.  The Government have presented petrol retailers on the northern side with a bonanza similar to the Yukon gold find, and the law of diminishing returns surely exists here.  I appeal to the Government to look at the question of reducing the price of petrol to a realistic figure similar to that in the North to prevent the inestimable amount of money escaping across the Border.</P>
    <P>The road to Jonesboro on a Sunday has to be seen to be believed.  Last year the <i>Sunday Independent</i> published an aerial picture showing the extent of the crocodile formed by the line of cars extending four or five miles.  Smuggling of drink and spirits continues unabated with fortunes made by shady operators. The greatest tragedy of all in recent times is that of the hapless radio and television retailers who, having been led to believe that they would get relief, now have had their worst fears confirmed by the publication of this budget.  In addition they have to suffer the indignity of mail drop by An Post, a State body, advertising to every home in Dundalk the undeniable attractions of a Newry TV firm and callously exhorting the people in the Republic to smuggle.  They are acting as <i>agents provocateurs</i> and turning a blind eye to the fact that no retailer in the North will inform An Post that he has sold a TV or video, as retailers are obliged to do in this State.  Therefore, each set sold can constitute a loss of a £52 licence fee to the State in addition to excise duty. This is hard for a retailer to take when added to the campaign of Ireland's agony aunt, Gay Byrne, telling Irish people where to go for bargains in the North and Liverpool.</P>
    <P>This year saw the frequent appearance of sheriffs in the Border area which could be termed appropriately, in an economic <Col N="383" /> sense, &ldquo;Boot Hill&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that people should not pay taxes, but the businesses that have survived, many of them hard pressed family businesses, should be given medals for endurance and should be treated in a humane fashion and given sympathetic consideration by the Revenue Commissioners.  Arrangements should be made for realistic phased payments of arrears.  Trying to cram years of arrears into one year after a severe recession and depression in the Border area is crazy. Seizing a wife's clothing off the clothes line is insensitive as is seizing her car. Putting people on public assistance is indefensible when they should be helped over their difficulties.  Why should a wife and children be made to pay for business failure?  Many of these small businesses just keep going on pride.  Their owners have not the cuteness of big business people who allow companies get into trouble and wind them up.  Sympathetic consideration should be introduced by the Revenue Commissioners and I ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Mac-Sharry, to ensure that that is so.</P>
    <P>A major initiative should be introduced by the Government to help those businesses that have survived in the Border area.  I suggest the Government pay the rates of business people right along the Border, otherwise a catastrophe will occur in that area.  Such an initiative should have been introduced several years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the tragic sircumstances of the Ashbourne garage owner's untimely death and the circumstances leading to it.  I ask him to ensure there will be no more similar occurrences in this country while he is Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the proposal in the budget to increase anglers' fees.  It is difficult to believe the Government could even contemplate such an unjustifiable impost.  The rivers always ran free and provided many a poor man's dinner. Thousands of young unemployed people spend hours on the river bank when perhaps many of them could be engaged in <Col N="384" /> vandalism or could have turned to crime. The anglers have cared for rivers and provided young fish free of any cost to this State.  The Government should do away with the involvement of the OPW and hand over care of the rivers and locks to the control of responsible anglers' clubs.  Already this year many guest-houses, particularly in the south and west, have taken bookings from anglers from England and the continent and have advertised free fishing.  Again they are hitting a very vulnerable section of the people.  We are scraping the barrel when we charge anglers increased fees.  I have made my points very quickly and said what I wanted to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Smith) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As their first year in office draws towards a conclusion, the Government are entitled to derive considerable satisfaction from their achievements so far.  The success of the co-ordinated actions undertaken last March is proof, if proof were needed, that given purposeful leadership and a resolute determination this country can reverse the headlong trend towards economic stagnation.</P>
      <P>The cornerstone of the set of measures adopted by the Government on taking office was the commitment above all else to put a stop to the rapidly increasing level of State expenditure and Exchequer borrowing.  The Government were under no illusion that this would be an easy task or that its execution would be painless. However, they recognised that this was an essential ingredient of any national programme that has as its aim the concept of national recovery.  It is patently obvious that if the Government had shirked taking the steps necessary to put the national finances in order the country would not now be in the position where, as economic commentators agree, confidence in the future of the Irish economy both at home and abroad has been substantially restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening to record the achievements of the Government, and a minority Government at that, over such a short period of time.  Already we can see a <Col N="385" /> very significant fall in interest rates and inflation which has had the effect of boosting confidence in the commercial sector.  These have fallen as a direct consequence of the Government's determination, implemented via the budget of March 1987, to impose strict discipline on State expenditure levels.  The fall in interest rates in turn led, for the first time in many years, to a substantial growth in investment in plant and equipment, a rise of 10 per cent in manufacturing output and a significant improvement in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>In addition, aided by the Government's agreement with the social partners our industrial cost competitive climate has improved.  The Government are totally committed to a continuation of this policy during 1988.  Further substantial reductions in the level of Exchequer spending and, therefore, borrowing will take place in 1988 as well as further reductions in the current budget deficit. Improvements in the economic outlook are already beginning to show and there is every reason to be confident that at last the economy has turned the corner and that national recovery is in sight.  With, as is confidently expected, further falls in interest rates and the rate of inflation resulting from a continued drive to improve the public finances, the steady growth in the economy will continue. This improvement is the confident prediction of the Government in spite of the slight depressive impact on the economy of the measures designed to put order on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Members opposite must, if they are realistic, find it difficult to seriously criticise the broad thrust and strategy of the budget, given the Government's successes in 1987 following the budget of last March.  How can they realistically question this budget which sets out a comprehensive and integrated strategy designed to reduce current expenditure and Exchequer borrowings, to create a climate which will encourage the creation of sustained employment, to provide significant tax concessions to the hard pressed PAYE workers, to safeguard the <Col N="386" /> position of those depending on social welfare assistance and to actively involve the participation of the social partners, farmers, trade unions and employers in the overall national strategy.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a countrywide recognition that the Government had the insight to recognise the fundamental problems of the economy, that they know precisely what has to be done and they have the political will, the unity of purpose and the ability to remedy the matters.  There is a very full acceptance that former policies adopted by Governments in regard to State spending simply had to be reversed if this nation was to survive a very real threat to its financial and economic sovereignty.  The Government, in tackling the very worrying economic situation, have shown commendable courage, common sense and cohesiveness and displayed a sense of imaginative leadership and decisiveness which had not been very apparent in Irish politics in recent years.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to State forestry which has passed the difficult development years of estate formation, planting and species experimentation, etc. and has reached the stage where its production can now sustain indigenous wood industries with the potential and capacity for growth, jobs, import substitution and exports, all of which greatly contribute to domestic and foreign currency earnings. Forestry is one of the great economic and social achievements of this country.  Its success and achievements to date are reflected by the establishment of a scarce renewable resource on an estate of one million acres; the development of indigenous wood-using industries; employment levels in forestry, industry, harvesting and transport of the order of 6,500; the attainment of an import substitution level of 50 per cent of the constructional timber market with a potential to achieve 100 per cent substitution before the end of this century; the development of lucrative outlets; the creation of a national pool of considerable expertise in all aspects of silvaculture development and management; the development of private <Col N="387" /> forestry and forestry management companies and the creation of some of the finest amenity forestry in Europe which consists of 12 forest parks, a forest chalet holiday complex and some 400 other open amenities for the enjoyment, education and appreciation of the public.</P>
    <P>The Government attach great importance to maximising the potential of the country's resources, the greatest of which is our land.  However, to achieve this we must ensure that our produce is geared to market needs.  I mention this specifically because much of our agricultural production is now in over-supply and to some degree alternative forms of land use are now required in order to arrest this trend. Therefore, an obvious worthwhile alternative is forestry.  The State has to by its initiative over the years shown that timber production is a real and practical commercial venture and an attractive alternative use particularly on marginal agricultural land.  It is also a haven for a wider variety of wild life and an attraction to tourists for its walking and shooting. This is not to suggest that forestry should replace agriculture as the major industry of this country.  However, it has a complimentary role to play in some areas in diverting land from subsistence farming to profitable timber production, and there is at least a further one million acres of marginal land producing precious little at this time which could be easily diverted to forest production.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office they soon realised that the way forward lay in creating a national confidence in our ability to further develop this resource and thereby contribute to a resolution of our difficult economic and social problems.  As part of this problem and in view of our strategic location, close to one of the world's great markets, namely Europe, I developed a broad strategy aimed at ensuring that the many advantages this country has for forestry development are exploited to the full so that the benefits of Irish forestry in terms of employment and wood industries are realised as soon as possible.  This entailed the following measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> It became clear to me that the enthusiasm for afforestation which formed much of the national development policy of the fifties and sixties and which saw annual acquisition and planting levels of 10,000 hectares achieved had dissipated to a point where little more than half of these levels were being achieved.  This reflected a national disinterest in a resource which, if properly developed, could become the green gold of the country.  I was determined to arrest this trend so as to ensure that the obvious benefits of forestry are secured for future generations.  To achieve this estate planting was increased immediately from a mere 7,000 hectates to 8,000 hectares.  This, together with private planting of 3,200 hectares, gave a national planting record in 1987 of 11,200 hectares, a figure never previously achieved in the history of this State.  This record will be further increased this year by an additional 2,000 hectares of State planting to give us an overall national planting target for 1988 of over 13,000 hectares or almost 33,000 acres.  This surely reflects the Government's zeal and commitment to forestry development and the importance they attach to their overall development programme.  These targets are realistic and there is every indication that they will be met despite the financial constraints which exist. Forest extension and wood industry expansion are now an essential element of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>A striking aspect of forestry in Ireland, as compared with other European countries, is the dominant position of the State in forest development.  The State planting programme has far exceeded that of the private sector for many years.  As a matter of fact the percentage of forest in the country <i>vis-à-vis</i> State and private is 85 per cent in favour of the State.  This is unique in the world and requires change. It is in direct contrast to developments in the UK at present, where the ratio is approximately one to one.  The potential of forestry as an investment, however, is being recognised now by the private sector.  The planting rate which averaged only 250 hectares per annum up to the early eighties exceeded 2,500 hectares in <Col N="389" /> 1986 and 3,200 hectares last year.  While the Government will be pressing ahead with the expansion of the State afforestation estate they will also be taking more positive steps to secure a significant and sizeable expansion of the private forestry sector.</P>
    <P>There has been an expansion in this area in recent years but there is still considerable scope for further expansion. The Government will encourage expansion of the private forestry sector to the maximum extent possible in harmony with the State afforestation programme. For many years the high capital cost of afforestation has been a disincentive for those considering forestry as an investment.  This, however, is no longer the case.  The grants available under the forestry element of the western package, for example, are such that a forest crop can be established at a very much reduced cost, when allowance is made for the very sizeable grants.  While these are available at present only in the western region, a proposal is now with the Commission in Brussels for the extension of the scheme to the disadvantaged areas of the eastern region and the Government are confident that these proposals will find favour with the Commission.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to extend the western package to areas outside the western area, to an area which will comprise approximately 635,000 hectares of land east of the Shannon.  Hopefully these will qualify for much higher afforestation grants in the future.  Farmers in this region will benefit, as those in the western region are eligible for grants of 85 per cent of their afforestation cost, subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare.  Non-farmers will qualify for 70 per cent of the grants which will also be subject to £800 maximum per hectare.  Approval is also being sought from the European Commission for a scheme of afforestation grants for full time farmers outside the disadvantaged areas.  Effectively there will be considerably higher afforestation grants available throughout the country than heretofore.  Farmers who afforest even part of the land will continue to be eligible for headage payments.  A free <Col N="390" /> technical advisory service will be available for all those who are considering afforestation of all or part of their holding.  It is very important that there is a substantial take up of these grants as up to 50 per cent of the cost is recoupable from the EC.  EC funds will be available for publicising and promoting these schemes.  In addition to the foregoing, the Government have increased domestic grants for private conifer planting from £300 to £500 per hectare.  In the hope of restoring hard woods to a more realistic level they have also increased the grants for broad leaf planting to £800 per hectare.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Tree Council of Ireland, organisations such as Crann, many local authorities, tidy town organisations and other voluntary groups throught the country who are promoting the re-establishment of broad leaf trees in their home areas.  The establishment of broad leaf trees is an act of faith in the future.  It also beautifies the environment and forms part of our heritage.  In this connection, we are also anxious to promote and to encourage GAA clubs to become involved in the planting of ash trees.  My Department, despite the limited resources of ash available, will try to have as even handed an approach as possible to meet the needs of the various hurley makers throughout the country. But it will be necessary and it is obviously clear at present that we have to expand this area if we are to maintain supplies for our great traditional games.</P>
    <P>Any substantial increase in private afforestation will require the co-operation and involvement of the farming sector and need not, as I said earlier, be at the expense of agriculture.  About 1 million hectares of marginal agricultural land, principally west mineral upland and blanket bog soils of low productivity and consequently low profit for agriculture is ideal for forestry.  For example, Leitrim gives an average yield for forestry of 22 cubic metres per hectare compared with the national average of 16 cubic metres, although not all the marginal land would have such a spectacular yield.  It is no harm to put that type of yield class into <Col N="391" /> a European and world context.  It is up to five times the yield class which would be possible in a country like Finland and two and a half times the potential yield class in the UK.  This is an indication therefore of the capacity of marginal agricultural land in Ireland to produce much faster growing trees than in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>Forestry can also be considered as an alternative land use to the production of traditional commodities which are in over supply.  This is not to say that forestry is the answer to agricultural problems, but rather that the land use can be devised so that both sectors will complement each other.  In order that the private sector in forestry can develop it will be necessary that we would have a much more significant contribution from the farming community, from the dairy co-ops and the various agricultural interests. Already it is quite significant that co-ops in West Cork like Barryroe, the Western Forest Co-op in the western counties and the rural ventures which were organised by Macra na Feirme in the west Limerick and Kerry area are involved.  The potential for private forestry development can be greatly enhanced by the involvement of co-operative movement.  I would like to encourage this development as much as possible throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As a first step to ensuring the maintenance of the expanded programme of forestry development the Government have decided that Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which are suitable for forestry will be transferred in future to the forest service.  This will apply to any cutaway lands which are at present available for planting and also to those areas which will become available in the future as Bord na Móna bogs are exhausted for turf production purposes.  The mechanism for the orderly transfer of these lands from Bord na Móna has now been established.  This decision is designed to ensure that the increasing momentum in forestry development which is envisaged in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be systematically achieved. It will also ensure that such lands no <Col N="392" /> longer lie fallow, but are used to generate further wealth.  This is a milestone in the lengthy discussions which had been going on for many years about the possible uses that might be identified for this resource. In the consideration of this matter the Government were conscious of the fact that the peat potential of these bogs is a wasting asset and that this has serious employment implications for the midlands and other areas in which Bord na Móna operate.  The Government decision will ensure that replacement employment in forestry activities will now become available as peat production in the individual bogs approaches exhaustion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the serious problem of housebreaking and vandalism in the Kilmount, Swansnest, Donaghmede and Kilbarrack areas of Dublin, he will provide a Garda station there as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals at present for the provision of a new Garda station to serve the areas referred to in the question.  However, the policing arrangements for the Donaghmede area have been improved by the establishment <Col N="394" /> of a police &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; there in December last.  The other areas referred to are covered by the community policing schemes recently introduced on a pilot basis in eight areas of the Garda Northern Division of the Dublin metropolitan area, including Kilbarrack East and Kilbarrack West.  Four extra gardaí have been allocated to Coolock station and six extra gardaí to Raheny station to facilitate the introduction of the pilot community policing schemes.</P>
      <P>Essentially, what is involved in these schemes is the assignment of particular gardaí to full-time patrol duties in a specific area.  The intention is that these gardaí will provide a visible Garda presence in their assigned area and will form close links with the local community.  The Garda authorities consider that these special measures, which will be kept under continuing review, should have the effect of reducing the incidence of crime and vandalism in the areas concerned.</P>

There have been good developments in policing in the constituency.  However, as Deputy Cosgrave has indicated, there are two stations, at Coolock and Raheny, serving the greater part of the constituency, single stations serving towns of comparable size with Limerick.  The Minister <Col N="395" /> is only too well aware of that fact.  This is a matter that must be reviewed and while the Minister has said that there are no proposals at present I would ask him to consider a review of the matter in time.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of warrants which have been sought for the extradition of persons to (a) Britain and (b) Northern Ireland since the coming into effect of the Extradition Amendment Act; the number of persons so extradited; and the number of directives given by the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether the Attorney-General has exercised the functions conferred on him with the implementation of the Extradition (Amendment) Act on 1 December 1987; and the total number of extradition warrants filed by the British authorities since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, came into force on 14 December 1987, not on 1 December as suggested in Deputy Kennedy's question and the figures given in this reply relate to the period from December 14.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Attorney General that the position, so far as he is concerned, regarding warrants received by the Garda Commissioner from Great Britain and Northern Ireland since that date, all of which have been furnished to the Attorney General under that Act, is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In two cases from Britain, involving a total of three warrants, he has informed the British Attorney General of what he will require in order to be in a position to discharge his functions under the new <Col N="396" /> Act.  No material concerning the evidence has been supplied in response so far.</P>
    <P>In two cases, both from Northern Ireland, involving a total of six warrants, the Attorney General has decided that the warrants which have been furnished do not come within the scope of the 1987 Act.  He has so informed the Garda Commissioner and has advised that they are in order for endorsement.  In one other case, from Northern Ireland, a total of ten warrants have been received and are under consideration by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>In a further two cases, one from Britain and one from Northern Ireland, involving one warrant each, the warrants were withdrawn by the requesting authorities before consideration of them had been completed (in one case because the person concerned was arrested in Britain and in the other because the Northern Ireland authorities considered that there was a possibility that there might be a flaw in their warrant).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that since this new Act came into effect nobody has been extradited to Britain or Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the particular details that I have given to the Deputy, everything else has been backed.  There was a number of warrants backed before the new legislation came into being.  It is quite likely that those warrants were executed from that time up to the present.  The only hold-up occurred in the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two persons, involving a total of three warrants, from the UK and the Attorney General informed the British Attorney General of his requirements there.  That has not been sorted out as yet.  In two cases from Northern Ireland, involving a total of six warrants, there was no difficulty there because they did not come under the 1987 Act.  The commissioner was advised that those two cases were in order.  In one case there is a total of ten warrants which have been <Col N="397" /> received and they are under consideration by the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the two cases from Northern Ireland, why did the Minister say that these did not come under the 1987 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Because sections 44A and 44B of the Extradition Act of 1965 with the insertion of section 2 (1) of the Extradition Act of 1987, provide for specific cases, as the Deputy knows.  The Deputy also knows that section 44A applies only to warrants in respect of persons accused of offences.  This means that the new procedure has no application to requests where persons have been convicted of offences.  The majority of warrants received by the commissioner since 14 December are in respect of persons convicted of offences and therefore are outside the scope of section 44A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put my original question this way.  In view of the information the Minister has helpfully given, that nobody in respect of whom there were charges preferred has been extradited, would the Minister not agree that it is desirable that the extradition process would work reasonably smoothly and that this country could not become in any sense, a haven for people who were fleeing after allegedly committing a crime?  Would he not agree that since it is more than two months now since the coming into operation of this legislation, that the technicalities of it should have been sorted out with the British at the very start to ensure that they would be in a position to comply with the requirements of the 1987 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the British are now about to settle the technicalities as described by Deputy O'Malley.  With regard to the first part of his question, the answer is in the negative.  Again I should say there are only two cases involving a total of three warrants where a difficulty arises at present.  But the Deputy can rest assured that nobody would want to see this country being <Col N="398" /> regarded as a haven for terrorists of any description from anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with what Deputy O'Malley was saying, would the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need for the British Attorney General and our Attorney General to meet to discuss the technicalities of this?  I noticed yesterday during the Taoiseach's contribution in winding up the debate that the correspondence is on the file.  But in an issue like this surely it would be better if both of them met together with the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland?  The Minister will agree that during the course of the debate on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill it was pointed out that the Bill could bring about a situation where an interpretation of the wording could lead to a delay in extradition proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy would agree that this matter was aired fully and answered fully in the course of the debate yesterday.  I believe that in a very short period, a matter of days, efforts will be made by the British side to ensure that they will be able to comply with what is required by us in our legislation to see to it that this extradition process can be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that procedures are necessary to ensure that this country does not become a haven for terrorists, and I am glad to know the Minister takes a strong view on that. Arising from the discussions yesterday in relation to the role of the Attorneys General, have the Government made a decision that our Attorney General should seek a meeting with his counterpart?  Has the Minister in his brief details of the requirements set out by the Irish Attorney General to his counterpart?  If he has, perhaps he would inform the House so that we will all have a better understanding of the requirements.  I am sure that this information will become public knowledge as soon as there is the first test case on the new Extradition Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> If the Minister has the information, will he give us the outline of it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, our Attorney General wrote to the British Attorney General in December asking that the necessary steps be got under way as quickly as possible with a view to allowing this new legislation to be effective.  The response was not very positive but I now understand that measures are under way to ensure that the matter will be sorted out.  It is a matter for the Attorney General to decide what information he requires in order to discharge his functions under sections 44A and 44B, and section 44B of the Act provides specifically that a direction shall be given unless the Attorney General &ldquo;having considered such information as he deems appropriate is of the required opinion.&rdquo; Therefore, the Attorney General will decide on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated yesterday that the Irish Attorney General was informed by the British Attorney General that he would not provide any material relating to the evidence forming the basis for the British prosecuting authority's intention to prosecute?  Is the Minister now stating that he has been informed in the last few days by the British Attorney General or the British Government that they have changed their view on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I do not want to say any more than I have already said, that is, that I understand that steps are now under way to see to it that our Attorney General's requirements under this Act will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of effective implementation of the legislation, can the Minister tell us when the warrants in respect of the two cases from the United Kingdom involving three warrants were received here by the Garda authorities or by the Attorney General for execution and when the Attorney General wrote back in each of the cases <Col N="400" /> to the British Attorney General setting out the material he required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister see that the information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the Deputy might contact the Office of the Attorney General who might be in a position to give him the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would accept that if the House is to be advised about the effective implementation of this legislation a time span is crucial.  The time it takes for a warrant to be received and considered by the Attorney General and how quickly his requirements for information are responded to is important.  It is not satisfactory for the Minister to say that he does not have the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that particulars as to information that is being sought and what has been furnished are matters that are within the realm of the Attorney General's statutory functions under the recent legislation.  The Deputy must appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably agree that the Act is very vague in regard to the information which our Attorney General is entitled to or which he might require.  If this information has been given today, I am sorry to ask the question again.  But has the British Attorney General been told by our Attorney General what type of evidence he would require in each particular case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Attorney General was in touch with his opposite number in the United Kingdom letting him know what his requirements were.  I further understand that his requirements were not met in relation to the two cases we are talking about.  Again <Col N="401" /> I understand that steps are now being undertaken to ensure that there is no misunderstanding between the two sides as to what is required so that this Bill can be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in a situation where the British Attorney General has refused to give our Attorney General the information he has sought, the only way of solving that is for the two men to meet rather than getting into a lengthy correspondence that will go on for months or maybe years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no secret that our Attorney General sought a meeting and was not granted that meeting.  I understand that he will meet the British Attorney General whenever he gets an opportunity of so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would our Attorney General not consider saying that if the British Attorney General is not prepared to give the information he wants we can make no progress and ask for a meeting to talk it out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is exactly what our Attorney General has done and I hope he will get a very favourable response to that request in the near future.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice his views on whether a review of the entire criminal law code is due; and the plans he has in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While undoubtedly a general review of the criminal law would be desirable it would be a very time-consuming exercise which it is not feasible to undertake at present as it would necessitate a substantial re-allocation of both resources and staff within my Department away from existing high priority projects.  Instead my approach is to deal with those areas of the criminal <Col N="402" /> law most in need of review on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Law Reform Commission have been asked to review, as a matter of urgency, such matters as the law on rape, the Larceny Acts, the Malicious Damage to Property Acts, the Offences Against the Person Act, sentencing policy, indexation of fines, confiscating the proceeds of crime and other offences which are still governed by 19th century legislation and which it considers need updating.  There are specific questions down to me on the Order Paper in relation to a report from the commission on the law concerning receiving stolen goods and to a consultation paper published by it on the law on rape which I will deal with in my replies to those questions.  Immediate consideration will be given to the commission's reports on the other areas mentioned as soon as they are received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the detailed reply which is based on the assumption that the question intended that the Minister's Department should carry out such a review of the criminal code.  Will the Minister not agree that a Dáil committee on criminal law could very easily do the job?  With regard to many of the things the Minister has mentioned in relation, for instance, to indexation of fines and to sentencing policy, is the Minister aware that the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism in the last Dáil have already made observations and reports on these matters and that in many of these areas the reports are now ready for translation into legislation which could easily be done by a criminal law committee of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that any general review of our criminal law would be a major undertaking.  I believe that codification would involve not just consolidating or restating the existing criminal law but reform of that law as a whole. This would be an enormous and very complex task and it would be very difficult to achieve consensus about the <Col N="403" /> detailed contents of a comprehensive code.  The only viable approach would seem to be to tackle the task in a piecemeal fashion.  That is an approach that has been adopted in the UK.  While one can object to that, to judge by the British experience a piecemeal approach would mean that codification would take a long time.  It does not seem to be appropriate at present to attempt a comprehensive codification all at once.  The piecemeal approach which we are adopting has the benefit that important areas of the criminal law are codified in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the Dublin Metropolitan Police Act, the 19th century Act which he has referred to, contains a whole series of offences, the fine for which is £2.  I understand that includes the offence of prostitution.  I do not know how much the fine is in keeping with the fee.  This is an area that needs to be considered urgently.  Will the Minister agree that the area of loitering, which he did not mention, is also one which is in need of urgent examination?  There is a serious problem in parts of Dublin city in particular, where large gangs of youths are gathering and causing many problems. Will he agree that the area of loitering needs to be considered again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the legitimate concern being expressed by Deputy Mitchell in this area.  As I have said, we are tackling the problem in the only way open to us at present.  I would welcome any help or suggestions from Members of this House on how we might speed up this process or make it more effective.  I look forward to a debate on this matter in this House when I can hear the views of the Members and I will then give them the consideration they merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>One suggestion would be to form a criminal law committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Following from what Deputy Mitchell has said, I am sure the Minister will agree that there is a need <Col N="404" /> for a review of the entire criminal law code.  I suggest to him that perhaps this matter could be discussed with the President of the Law Reform Commission who may have suggestions as to the best way to proceed in this area, in conjunction with what Deputy Mitchell has suggested in regard to a committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly give consideration to the views of Deputy Barrett and Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House what law reform measures in the area of criminal law are likely to come before the House, with approximate dates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can give the Deputy that information in the way he wants it.  I understand the commission have given priority to the question of handling stolen goods and they have recently published a report on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the commission.  I am asking what legislation is the Minister proposing to bring before the House in the area of reform of criminal law?  What Bills on what subjects does he propose to introduce and what approximate timescale can he give?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that if he puts down a separate question on that matter I will give him the information he is looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree and take into account that criminal law, particularly the law relating to evidence and trial procedures, was enacted in the last century when suspected criminals were by and large illiterate people with very little, if any, money who had no means of defence and when movement <Col N="405" /> from one part of the country to another was very slow?  The whole position has now changed and we are dealing with clever, well-educated criminals who have the best brains available to defend them at public expense and who can move quickly from one part of the island to another and indeed from one part of the world to another.  The law badly needs to be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the report recently published by the Law Reform Commission on the issue of receiving stolen property in which they produced the heads of a Bill, will the Minister and his Department take that on board and bring it before the House in the form of legislation?  Secondly, will the Minister agree to the setting up of an all-party committee of this House to work in conjunction with the Law Reform Commission with a view to dealing with a certain number of the priorities listed by <Col N="406" /> the Minister, to having our criminal law updated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>New legislation which will take account of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations on receiving stolen goods is in the course of preparation.  Other aspects of our dishonesty laws and the question of confiscation of assets are due to be reviewed by the Law Reform Commission.  We will have to wait and see what the commission recommend before we introduce legislation in this area.  The main thrust of the Deputy's question deals with legislation on receiving stolen goods and that matter is well in hand at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will now review as a matter of urgency the present security arrangements in place in Portlaoise prison, County Laois, to ensure that they are adequate to deal with the high security risk persons being held there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Security in Portlaoise prison is kept under review by the relevant authorities and it would not be appropriate for me to publicly comment on such matters.  If the Deputy has any specific concern in mind perhaps she would communicate privately with me and I will have the matter examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments.  I would certainly like to take up his invitation to communicate with him privately.  I have spoken to some prison officers in Portlaoise Prison and I have reason to be concerned about what is going on there.  It seems that in recent times a number of disruptive prisoners are being moved around the country and spend a couple of weeks in each place. Recently in Portlaoise Prison two prison officers were assaulted, one badly, and they had to be taken to hospital.  I understand there is total chaos in the prison.

      <P>I would be glad to meet Deputy Harney and hear whatever she has to say, if she is satisfied that it affects the general security of the prison.  I am satisfied that with the system that is in operation, a system involving the Garda, the prison service and the Army, all of whom have a specific task with regard to the provision of security, that the security at this maximum security prison is as effective as we would hope it to be.  I am satisfied from reports of those charged with responsibility for security there that everything is in order.  However, in the event of there being any suggestions that may be helpful to those with responsibility for security, I welcome the opportunity of hearing from Deputy Harney.</P>

      <P>In common with the Minister and Deputy Harney, I am concerned about the problems obtaining in Portlaoise prison which have been highlighted in local papers.  I realise it is a high security prison with a large number of prison officers, Garda and Army.  Will the Minister say if he is satisfied with the catering facilities provided for the prison staff and the other people who work there?  For example, is he aware that the present catering facilities for the prison staff are provided in a prefab unit designed to cater for approximately 20 people?  Furthermore, is he aware that with the additional numbers of staff on duty this is totally unacceptable, causing <Col N="408" /> staff to eat their meals standing and, on occasions, outside the prefab?  Is he aware also that, on occasion, staff have to leave the prison to get food?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that records are not maintained in a way that would enable this information to be readily provided. Compilation of this information would require the diversion of gardaí from more <Col N="410" /> pressing duties, for a disproportionate amount of time, which would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised the Minister has not got this type of information available to him.  Meaning no disrespect to any other county, but if there is a preponderance of Dublin men with accents like mine operating as gardaí in Cork, it might cause some alienation. Will the Minister ensure, as best he can, that gardaí located in the Dublin Metropolitan Area can relate to the people they serve and that, by and large, they come from that region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to the difficulties the Deputy foresees in regard to gardaí with Dublin accents in Cork I can assure the Deputy and the House that it is ever so easy to become familiar with the Cork accent; indeed it is ever so easy to acquire a Cork accent.  With regard to who decides who goes where, the Deputy knows that is a matter entirely for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána but I will convey the Deputy's views on the subject to the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure there is no prejudice against Garda personnel from the country operating in Dublin?  In view of the fact that this is Millennium year in Dublin, is the &ldquo;Are you there, Moriarty?&rdquo; concept to be struck from Deputy Mitchell's remarks?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The serious intent of the question is this, to ensure that the Garda force relate to the community. There is a serious community relations problem in many areas, not merely in relation to the region from which members of the Garda emanate, but is the Minister aware also that there are very few gardaí operating in Dublin who have come from lower socio-economic groups?  For example, I do not believe that in the whole of the 600 flats at St. Teresa's Gardens, the 600 at Fatima <Col N="411" /> Mansions &mdash; indeed one could throw in Dolphin House in Bridgefoot Street &mdash; out of probably a total of 2,000 flat units there has ever been one garda recruit or staff member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than satisfied that the Garda experience little or no difficulty in operating successfully among the people they protect in the different parts of the city of Dublin.  Indeed, looking around this House at the number of Deputies who are not from Dublin but who represent Dublin people, proves what I am saying.  With regard to other matters, particularly in relation to persons being admitted for trainee garda, I should say there is the Civil Service Commission competition organised for people who want to enter the Garda Síochána.  There are minimum requirements laid down and we will be dealing with that in a later question today.  There is no ban on anybody from any section of society from membership of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am examining these matters in connection with commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>As regards the publication of a book of quantum of damages, I have arranged to have this matter discussed by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland, on which I am officially represented, to ascertain how such a project could be undertaken.  While I am, of course, prepared to give what assistance I can, it is likely that this matter will be found to be more appropriate to be done by publishers of existing legal journals and textbooks.</P>
      <P>A provision to facilitate the introduction of a system of pre-trial procedures in the High Court is among proposals that I am considering in connection with a proposed Court and Court Officers Bill.  Preparation of the Bill is at an advanced stage.  I hope to be in a position to bring any proposals before the House soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the level of legal representation in the superior courts, the position is that the Government have decided that an amendment should be proposed to the Courts Bill, 1986, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil, to empower me to make regulations to limit the number of counsel whose costs may be recovered by a successful litigant in a personal injury or fatal accident damages case.  The Deputy will be aware that the Bar Council decided recently to abandon the practice of requiring that three counsel should be briefed in these types of cases in the High Court.  However, I should mention that the general question of the number of legal representatives required in a case is the subject of a <Col N="413" /> current study of the legal profession by the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce proposed this.  Will the Minister be surprised to hear that I am somewhat disappointed with his answer which indicated that this matter is seemingly to be handed over to a private firm who will do it, presumably, for commercial gain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A book of quantum damages is a collection of reports on decisions by the courts on the assessment of damages in personal injury and fatal accident cases.  It would provide a guide to lawyers for valuing, settling or pleading these cases.  It could be cited in court and its preparation is a matter of law reporting which could be undertaken by any of the private agencies involved in this area such as the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting which publishes the <i>Irish Reports</i> and other legal texts.  It could also be published by the <i>Irish Law Times</i> or the <i>Irish Reports Monthly.</i> The book of quantum damages published in Britain was published privately by Kemp and Kemp and when civil injuries are abolished in personal injury cases, judges will be expected to give reasoned judgments in deciding these cases &mdash; juries do not. Reports on these cases would then have to cover the facts and issues relevant to the assessment of damages by judges as well as the amounts of damages awarded. <Col N="414" /> Such reports are traditionally prepared by barristers who are present during the cases.  The Chief Registrar of the High Court who was consulted, indicated that the production of any information for a book of quantum damages from court records and files would be beyond their financial and staff resources.  He suggested that even court records would be inadequate for proper case reporting purposes.  The publication of the book of quantum damages should be economically an attractive project for legal publishers when judges start deciding personal injury cases.  I, as Minister with responsibility in this area, did not at any time say that the Government would be responsible for the production of such a book.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give a time prediction as to when he expects the new system of pre-trial procedures and the regulations he proposes to make in respect of legal representation to come into effect?  Will it be one year or six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the enactment of the Courts Act, 1986, is expected to result in some improvement in the pre-trial stage in personal injury cases, particularly in regard to their listing.  With regard to further improvements, the proposed courts and court officers Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation in the Department and it contains provisions which will increase the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court to enable him to deal with a range of matters which must be dealt with at present by High Court judges in court.  It is also proposed that further jurisdiction may be conferred on the Master by rules of court and one effect of this will be that a system of pre-trial procedures may be introduced by rules of court.  These would provide that, before a case could be put down for trial, the Master would conduct a preliminary hearing with a view to having subsidiary issues arising in the case settled which would result in a shortening <Col N="415" /> of trials.  Rules of court for pre-trial procedures could be expected to make provision also for automatic discovery between parties of certain documents in personal injury cases, the exchange of reports of expert evidence and for procedures to ensure that as much agreement as possible in expert evidence is arrived at before the case comes to trial. The sooner the legislation is under way the better, as far as I am concerned, because it would all fall into place fairly rapidly.  I would appreciate help from other parties to get this legislation to the House as soon as possible.</P>

If the Minister abolishes the two seniors system <Col N="416" /> and juries, insurance companies will bash the small litigant about from court to court and from judge to judge with the result that one senior will not tie himself in court for weeks and weeks in a case. Nearly everybody is a poor man when it comes to going to court and it will be very difficult to afford the fees involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 23, 29 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The details of the revised management structure of the Garda Síochána are at present the subject of consultation between the Commissioner and his senior officers and the Commissioner will shortly be in a position to submit his proposals to me.  It is my intention that there will be an announcement at an early date of the changes introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced last month a Garda recruitment competition will be held this year from which a total of 1,000 appointments will be made over the three year period 1989, 1990 and 1991.  New recruitment qualifications and procedures will apply to the competition.  Candidates will be required to have achieved an educational standard of at least grade D in <Col N="419" /> five subjects, including Irish, English and Mathematics, in the leaving certificate, or an equivalent examination.  The competition will include an intelligence test to be administered by the Civil Service Commission followed by a interview of selected candidates.  Costs associated with the running of the competition this year will be met from the Garda Vote.</P>
    <P>Recruits appointed from this recruitment competition will undergo a new training programme which has been approved by the Government.  This programme takes account of the recommendations of the Walsh Committee, which is conducting a review of all aspects of Garda training, in particular the recommendation that training should be ongoing over a period of two years.  In that time recruits will spend 42 weeks in the Garda Training Centre in Templemore and the balance of their time undergoing a form of on-the-job training at selected Garda stations.</P>
    <P>There will be an emphasis during training on the development of practical policing skills and recruits will also be given some gounding in the basics of criminology, behavioural science, psychology, public relations, communications, social science and management skills.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Walsh Committee, the position is that the new training system, and also the new recruitment qualifications and procedures which are being introduced, are very much on the lines recommended by the Walsh Committee.  The action that has been or is being taken covers all the major recommendations of the Walsh Committee &mdash; some other recommendations contained in their report are being examined further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to enthusiastically support what the Minister is doing.  It is long overdue and I should like to congratulate him, and the new Garda Commissioner, on the initiatives they have taken in regard to the management structure and training procedures for Garda recruits.  I presume the Minister <Col N="420" /> will take into account not just the recommendations of the Walsh Committee but those of the Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism whose report was published two years ago.  I should like to ask the Minister, in relation to the proposed changes in the management structure, if it is envisaged that the appointment of senior officers within the force will be as heretofore or if there will be a different method of appointing senior officers.  In regard to recruitment procedures I suggest to the Minister that the only matter that should be taken into account is the aptitude test and the psychological ability of recruits.  I am disappointed that a psychological test for recruits is not included, as recommended in many reports.  It would be a pity if the Minister did not take that on board.  I disagree with Deputy Gay Mitchell in that I do not think the origin of Garda recruits is as important as other matters, particularly the question of suitability of the individuals for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Harney in welcoming the proposals on Garda training.  Is it wise to proceed with the new recruitment policy prior to deciding on a management structure for the force for the future because one is linked to the other?  If we are to proceed along traditional lines, as Deputy Harney suggested, there is no need for change but if it is the intention to make changes at management level surely we should recruit a certain type of candidate.  Will the two year training period be considered probationary?  Will it be open to the Garda authorities to say that a certain individual is not considered suitable after he or she has been observed on duty during a trial period in a station? Are there any proposals to move the training centre from Templemore to a centre close to a third level college so that recruits can avail of the education facilities in them?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking of Carysfort College which is adjacent to a number of third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would County Limerick which is close to NIHE not be more attractive to the Minister?  We could get a Private Members' motion going on that if the Deputy would support me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new proposals but I should like to point out that because of the exclusion of women up to recently the number of banghardaí in the force is very low.  Under employment equality legislation there is power to recruit more women in areas where they are not well represented.  There may be some debate about the origin of recruits but I do not think there can be any debate about the need for more banghardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with the supplementaries raised.  I am grateful to the Members who expressed support for our efforts to implement as many of the recommendations of the Walsh Committee as possible.  I should like to say, on behalf of the Members of the House, a sincere word of thanks to the members of that committee for the work they are doing.  I should like to thank my predecessor, Deputy Dukes, and his party, for establishing that committee when in Government.  We are all anxious to see the Garda force properly equipped so as to be able to look after our interests.  I issued a public statement on my proposals in regard to the Garda Síochána about a month ago and I shall circulate a copy of it to interested Members.  That statement spells out our proposals.  I should like to tell Deputy Barrett that in my announcement I stressed that the Garda training centre will remain in Templemore, that it will be updated, as is necessary, and that we will have available to us, as we have already, staff from the education centres to ensure that our education programmes are worth while.  I should like to tell Deputy Barrett that a new recruit will not be attested until he has completed 62 weeks training.  He must return for a <Col N="422" /> further 42 weeks before he finally qualifies.  I should like to tell Deputies Barnes and Harney that we are conscious of the need for banghardaí in the force.  We are satisfied that they serve a useful purpose and are very effective members of the force.  It will continue to be our policy to recruit women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney asked if there would be any changes in appointments.  The answer is that the present system is working quite well and I have no proposals to change it.  Deputy Barrett asked whether this is the time to take in recruits on the new training system.  I believe it is the time.  If we do not make a start now we will never do it.  I take cognisance of his concern that we may not have the management structure to deal with it.  I am satisfied, however, that we will have the management structure. We have appointed three new assistant commissioners &mdash; all very skilled persons &mdash; to help in restructuring the management of the Garda Síochána.  The Government decided to make available to me, as the person with the ultimate responsibility to this House for Garda affairs, a committee of eminent persons from the private sector to advise on management procedures, under the chairmanship of the chief executive of the ESB, Mr. Moriarty.  Other persons are being sought and when the required group of five or six is available I will make a further announcement.  It is envisaged that this group will operate in the same way as the committee which dealt so successfully with the problem of the communications system which the Garda required.  This committee worked under <Col N="423" /> the chairmanship of Professor Seán Scanlon of UCD and they gave powerful service to the public, the taxpayers and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a brief supplementary.  Will any of the extra 1,000 gardaí be recruited in 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Please do not tie me to exact dates as yet.  I will be in a position within a short time to make a full announcement.  We would hope that the Civil Service Commission are already putting together the organisation required to get the competition under way and as soon as that has been done we will start bringing them in.  We have to do a major job at Templemore to make sure we have the necessary accommodation and we hope to start on that work immediately.  It will probably be towards the end of the year before trainee recruits are actually in position.  I say that from my knowledge and experience of what has taken place in relation to other competitions.  It is in the interest of all of us to get his matter moving as fast as we can and it is my intention to see to it that this is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the origin of the arms, ammunition and explosives recently found at Five Fingers Strand, Malin, County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by <Col N="424" /> the Garda authorities that while there is information about the places of manufacture of some of the weapons found, there is no firm indication of their more recent origin.</P>
      <P>I am informed, for example, that the kalashnikov rifles were manufactured in Rumania, the machine-guns and some ammunition in Belguim, other ammunition in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and that the plastic explosives are of Czechoslovak manufacture.</P>
      <P>There are obvious similarities between the arms found most recently and those found in a number of other locations in recent times and Garda inquiries aimed at establishing the origin of all of these arms are still in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it known if this was part of a consignment or is it big enough to suggest that it was brought in in its entirety?  Is there any connection between this find and the two recent finds in Northern Ireland?  Has the Minister any indication as to whether this consignment was brought in during 1985 or 1986?  Is it true that there is strong evidence that these arms, ammunition and explosives had their origin in Libya?  If that is the case, will the Minister confirm or deny the rumour that very recently a Libyan Minister or very senior official from the Libyan Department of Information arrived in Dublin Airport under very strange circumstances, stayed a short period and then disappeared?  Has this anything to do with all these rumours regarding the origin of these arms, ammunition and explosives?  If there is sufficient evidence, would the Minister not agree that it is about time this country formally broke off diplomatic relations with that country and made it quite clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have five questions with which to deal within the presecribed period of time.  I have no chance of dealing with those questions if Members dwell unduly on them by way of a large number of supplementary questions.  I would ask for the co-operation of the Members because at 3.45 p.m.  I shall <Col N="425" /> be going on to other business and it may well transpire that some of these questions will not have been dealt with.  It is a matter for Deputies themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had to say to the Deputy on a number of occasions that I am not in the business of confirming or denying rumours.  I was asked to confirm or deny a rumour and I will not do so. Deputy Barrett asked whether this consignment was part of a larger consignment.  It is my opinion from what I have been told by the Garda that it is part of consignments that arrived in 1985 or 1986.  I have said previously in this House that it is believed that the total volume of the four consignments &mdash; two in 1985 and two in 1986 &mdash; would approximate to that on the <i>Eksund,</i> which would be in excess of 100 tonnes of weaponry. I named the countries in which the items were manufactured.  There is a similarity between the arms found recently but there is a difference between the arms found here and those found in Northern Ireland.  The Kalashnikovs recently found in Northern Ireland, supposedly for the use of the UDA, had clear markings, whereas the marking on the guns found here had been removed.  The Garda are trying to bring up the markings so as to learn more about them but they are not in a position to give me a report as to the origin of the weapons.  I say that very specifically.  When I have that information it will be made available to the House.  The House can then discuss the matter and make recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most certainly not.  The House will remember that it is believed that the <i>Eksund</i> contained anything up to 1,000 AK47 Kalashnikov rifles and if the other four shipments that got in in 1985 and 1986 contain similar to what was on the <i>Eksund,</i> Deputies will see that we have approximately 200 or 250 rifles recovered out of a possible total oaf 4,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 16 and Priority Question No. 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements to the House about the progress of specific Garda operations except in singular instances where the circumstances of an operation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate.  In general terms, I can say that the Garda authorities have informed me that a number of measures have been introduced to counter the problems of armed crime.  These involve the redeployment of certain Garda resources and a continual review of the levels of protection to be provided at particular times and places, as well as other matters.  I do not intend to go into any further detail about these measures. Garda efforts might well be adversely affected were I to do so.  There are indications that the measures being taken by the Garda are proving to be effective. The Garda authorities have informed me that the provisional crime figures for 1987 indicate a significant decrease in the <Col N="428" /> number of armed raids in that year as compared with the figures for 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the material shown on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme was a matter of exceptional importance to the House? Will the Minister comment on what appears to be a new development in which a sort of preventive action is being taken with a massive input of Garda resources in surveillance for preventive purposes rather than remedial purposes? Is that not something which should be considered by the Minister and the House, as to whether that is the best possible use of massive resources to prevent crime rather than to track down crime already committed?  Will the Minister comment on the question of why, if there is evidence against this man he is not prosecuted, rather than absorbing such a huge amount of Garda resources?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that Deputy Taylor is suggesting that because the subject matter of these questions has received so much publicity in the media, I should depart from the normal practice and be somewhat more specific about certain Garda operations, I must say that I have thought about the matter very carefully and I have taken a considered decision that the interests of the prevention and detection of serious crime would not be served by making a statement to the House about the nature, extent and progress of any particular Garda operation being conducted at present to deal with armed crime.  There appears to be no good reason the practice referred to in my reply should be departed from.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned this debate I had outlined the Government's plans in relation to the acquisition of cutaway bogland for forestry purposes.  I will now turn to our efforts to increase the level of EC funding <Col N="456" /> for forestry.  I have, through visits to the Heads of Structural Funds, initiated a major drive to increase the level of direct financial support from the European Community for forestry development. An active Irish forestry development programme has major advantages for the European Community in terms of meeting the Community's economic needs such as in the area of timber and timber products import substitution where the Community's annual import bill is £15 billion and in terms of fulfilling Community policies in the areas of job creation, regional and social development, land use, etc.  It is important, therefore, that the Community give the maximum possible financial support for this development.  No longer can we accept the crumbs from the table in relation to forestry.</P>
      <P>Already the result of my initiation can be seen in the recent decision to allocate some £8.1 million from the European Regional Development Fund for our forestry roads programme.  This is the initial injection of resources from this fund for mainstream forestry activities and I intend to press for further funding to facilitate maximisation to the full the potential of Irish forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a particular advantage in forestry in that, on average, our forests yield a third more timber than British forests, and up to four times as much as those in other European countries.  More importantly, we are also very close to the largest timber market in the EC, namely the United Kingdom, which imports some 90 per cent of its requirements. Annual imports of timber and timber products by the European Economic Community as a whole runs at £15 billion, the second highest valued commodity import after oil.  The future market potential for Irish timber is, therefore, very considerable.  At this stage about 50 per cent of the Irish forest estate is producing saleable timber.  Last year the forest service marketed 1.3 million cubic metres of timber and this year will produce 1.4 million cubic metres.  By 1993 this will have reached 2 million cubic <Col N="457" /> metres and by the year 2000 it will be 3 million cubic metres.</P>
    <P>During that period the percentage increase in the output of large sawlog will be 178.  During the same period small sawlog will increase by 125 per cent and pulpwood by over 50 per cent.  Forest produce is typically of two types, the early thinnings from plantations and later trimmings from matured felled trees.  The early thinnings are used in the manufacture of pulp, paper, particle board and fibreboard while the larger diameter timber is used in construction, furniture and a range of other wood products.</P>
    <P>The timber processing industry in Ireland, as the House will be aware, was affected by the economic recession in the seventies to the extent that three pulpwood processing plants eventually closed down.  Today, however, new pulpwood industries have been established by Medite at Clonmel to manufacture fibreboard of medium density and have improved export market facility considerably, and by Finsa at Scarriff who manufacture chipboard and have gained a significant foothold in the UK market as well as substituting considerable imports of chipboard into this country. Besides processing thinnings from both State and private forests, these plants utilise wood residues from the sawmills, thus increasing the raw material base and contributing to a reduction in exports of unprocessed pulpwood.  A recent report on the potential for new pulpwood industries commissioned by the Government and the IDA confirms that on the basis of increasing supplies of thinnings and greater domestic utilisation of sawmill residues, the next decade will provide significant opportunities for new industry.  The establishment of a third pulpwood processing plant is, therefore, a real possibility.  I have signalled to the IDA that the Government will want to ensure that this industry is a high added value employment creating industry.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the pulpwood sector, the capacity in the sawmill sector greatly exceeds supply and competition for sawlog is keen.  There are over 150 sawmills in the country, ranging from small, <Col N="458" /> part-time operations which form the majority of plants to the largest mills which have full facilities for drying, preserving and mechanical stress grading of timber.  Good marketing by the industry has resulted in Irish timber accounting for over 50 per cent of the domestic construction market, and I expect that within ten years this country will be able to satisfy its own needs in this area from domestic supplies, with excess volumes of sawnwood available for the lucrative export market.</P>
    <P>In addition to sales of sawlog and pulpwood which are the principal revenue earners, the forest service have developed profitable outlets for other forest produce such as transmission poles and I am glad to recall that during 1987 they had record sales of transmission poles to the ESB.  We have also concentrated on this market as far as BTE are concerned and, indeed, any of the State organisations who use timber resources will be asked continually to use as far as possible Irish produce to meet their needs.  We have also profitable outlets for other produce in decorative foliage, Christmas trees, furniture, picnic furniture and firewood.  I am happy to tell the House that variations in marketing methods such as auctions &mdash; one is being held today &mdash; and improved quota schemes for large and small sawlog have been introduced.  These, together with arrangements made between the sawmills and pulpwood sectors for exchanges of material, have maximised supply requirements in each sector and greatly improved relations between our forest service and the timber industry.  The fruits of this can be seen in the level of increased revenue generated by the forest service last year &mdash; £20 million compared with £17 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the House is aware, decided last year to sell off a small proportion of State forests in order to generate additional funding for the expanded planting programme.  While the overall response to this was disappointing, it has, nevertheless, given some hope for optimism in so far as that where sales were successful the amounts <Col N="459" /> tendered were realistic and in line with the Department's valuation expectations.  This shows that there is a market for medium to long-term investment of funds in forestry, and with the development of a greater awareness by the fund managers of this investment medium the feasibility of attracting a greater allocation of funding for this is worth pursuing further.  For this reason, I will be offering more lots of forest for sale again this year.  However, I would like to advise intending companies or individuals not to waste their time or mine by making derisory offers because the only sales that will go through will be those which represent a reasonable value to the taxpayer for the investment already made in forestry.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a second dimension to this proposition of semi-mature sales. As the House will be aware, there is considerable reluctance on the part of the farming community and land owners generally to become involved in forestry because of the long timelag between the early investment and the maturing crop and little or no income in the intervening period.  Therefore, I have set out to try to establish an intermediate market, as it were, whereby individuals could dispose of properties at earlier stages.  If we are successful in developing this intermediary market it will be clear to people who invest in forestry that it would not be necessary to retain the full crop until the maturing stage.</P>
    <P>The most exciting development this year, however, will be the setting up of a semi-State company to manage the commercial activities of State forestry.  Preparation for this is well advanced and the necessary legislation to give effect to this will be introduced in the Dáil soon.  While the company will, understandably, require sizeable State funding in their early years, the Government's intention is to reduce and eliminate such dependence as quickly as possible by setting for the company challenging targets and objectives.</P>
    <P>Forestry is one of the great economic achievements of modern times.  The tiny <Col N="460" /> seedlings which dotted our countryside in the fifties and sixties have since grown into large forestry tracts capable of sustaining worthwhile employment and economic activity in forest development, sawmilling and pulpwood industries.  I am happy to say that in all these sectors there is a common spirit and desire to see the continued development of forestry and a common resolve to see Irish timber maximising its share of the domestic and European markets.  This co-operative drive, from grower to processor to market distributor, is an indication of the spirit required if we, as a nation are to overcome our difficult financial, economic and social problems.  I have no doubt that this approach has contributed to the successful achievements of our forest service in the past year with record planting, record wood production and record revenue earnings.  This augurs well for their ability as a new semi-State company to meet successfully the challenges of the commercial world and justify the Government's faith in their future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to make a brief contribution on the budget, partly to deal with problems in my constituency and partly to say a few things I have wanted an opportunity to say for some time.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a budget to look after the running of a country for 12 months is an enormous task and an enormous responsibility.  Over the years we have provided ourselves with services and undertaken liability for expenditure that we, as a nation, really cannot afford.  We have been living beyond our means since the sixties.  Indeed, that spending spree seemed to take off in the sixties and has not been brought under control since then.  It is harder to correct an economy that has gone wrong in a democracy than it is in countries which are governed by other forms of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is no doubt in my mind that the democratic system of governing a country is by far the best that has yet been found and before we consider getting rid of it or endangering it we should be <Col N="461" /> sure that we have something better to put in its place.  A democratic system of government can be lost by military coups and a left wing administration can take over completely but a country can also endanger its democratic system by losing control of its finances as a result of getting into the hands of international bankers and lending agencies of one sort or another.  When we have got to this stage and when our economy needs to be corrected and got on the rails again a stable and strong government is essential. Numerically speaking, we do not have a Government at present.  I am not casting any reflections on the individual members of the Government or the Taoiseach because it is not necessary to do so for the purpose of this argument.  However, recent events have demonstrated that, numerically speaking, we have no Government.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have any immediate way of getting a stable Government.  If there was a general election in the morning or in a month's time, 166 Deputies would come back to this House but we still would not have a Government.  That does not mean that the people of the country do not know what they want. They certainly do know what they want; they do not want a left wing administration and they have said so in no uncertain terms.  As a matter of fact, about 146 of the 166 Deputies in the House broadly agree on how the country should be run.  However, when they come back here after an election they split almost down the centre and the balance of power is handed over to the remaining 20 or so Deputies who have no mandate from anybody to run the country.  During my time in public life I have never seen more necessity for a stable, strong and fair Government than there is at present. But we do not have one and we are not likely to get one.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on my own behalf and not on behalf of my party.  On many occasions over the years we have heard calls for a national Government.  Some people who do not like national governments say that they are necessary or desirable only in times of war or armed <Col N="462" /> conflict or when there is an emergency. We are not involved in a war in the real sense of the word although we have the affliction of terrorism and armed activities in the northern part of our country.</P>
    <P>The people have said clearly that they want a centre or right of centre administration and they have voted accordingly.  About 90 per cent of them have voted for parties who represent the right or right of centre.  In the interests of the country the three right wing parties should take steps to give this country a stable Government for the next three years.  That is the duty of the people who have got a mandate for policies which largely agree with each other.  It is their duty to the people and to those who will come after them to provide a stable, firm and fair Government for the next three years, a Government which would not be subject to pressure groups who would be against this policy, that policy or the other policy.</P>
    <P>The next point I should like to refer to is the taxation of farmers.  I come from a farming background and I take a certain pride in agriculture and in the land of Ireland.  I detect that the good relationship there used to be between urban dwellers and rural dwellers no longer exists.  A rift is developing between urban dwellers and the agricultural community. Sons and grandsons of the land are attacking farmers and the farming community from which they came and this is due to the fact that farmers are not seen to be making what is regarded as a fair contribution towards taxation.  People are jealous of them and this bad blood is developing.</P>
    <P>Farming as an occupation is carried out on a very different basis from a strict business activity.  For example, a farmer, his wife and children play their part on the farm and work has to be done during the weekends and the summer when other people are on holidays, and it is not possible to tax farmers on a bookkeeping basis as one would tax a manufacturing or distributing business.  The result of efforts to impose taxation on farmers on the basis of profit earned and books kept will <Col N="463" /> not work.  Farmers are spending substantial sums of money in fees to accountants to show that they are not liable for tax.  They are paying the accountants nearly as much money in fees as they would if they were liable for tax.</P>
    <P>I do not altogether blame the Government for the bookkeeping system of taxing farmers.  A minority of people within the IFA demanded that system and campaigned for it but I believe that a majority within the IFA have found out that they were wrong.  Farmers must be taxed on a simple basis.  When the late George Colley was Minister for Finance he introduced a system of a 2 per cent tax on all sales from farms.  That did not work because it had no regard at all for the element of profit.  The man who was making no profit would have to pay the same 2 per cent on his sales as the man who had a good income.  Nevertheless, that system had a lot going for it.  I think it would have got a better reaction if it had been properly researched.  It will get a better reception now than it did when it was first introduced and had to be dropped straightaway.</P>
    <P>In later years the last Government introduced the land tax, which was really, and there is no use in trying to pretend otherwise, another name for rates.  It was another great valuation system under which the old rating was operated.  The land was valued back in 1850 under a man named Griffith and the valuations continued on until 1865.  The Coalition system of land tax was based on adjusted acres.  For the record 20 adjusted acres means, of course, the equivalent of 20 acres of reasonably good land and of course 20 acres could be 40 or 50 acres. I think that was a good system.</P>
    <P>The present Government in response to a campaign against that land tax and in favour of the bookkeeping system, yielded to the bookkeeping system.  Now nobody is happy.  The farmers &mdash; I would say 75 per cent of them at least &mdash; are crying out now for the land tax which they opposed and which the present Government, because it was popular to do so unfortunately, and very foolishly I <Col N="464" /> think, gave in to them.  I say therefore that the land tax should be reintroduced. The present Government went to absurd lengths: the staff were taken off the Land Commission and I understand the present Government are going to leave them off it because although they denounced the proposals to wind up the Land Commission when it was introduced by Mark Clinton I think they have now come around to it and they themselves are going to abolish the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>They took approximately 100 people or thereabouts from the Land Commission and put them on land tax work, adjusting acres.  As I have said, after the last Government these people were sacked, or relieved of their jobs anyway.  I understand that something like 90 of these inspectors have not even to report to their offices, but receive their salary cheque through the post.  That is not good economics according to any standards.  It was done for political purposes, and things that are done solely for political purposes in order to attract votes in the run-up to an election are very often not sound. I think the present Government should have another think about this.  Anybody can make a mistake and the Government should get back to the system of land tax. It is simple and will bring in a reasonable amount of money.  The farmers will be seen to be paying some reasonable amount of tax and the argument against them by their city and town cousins will be taken away.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the Border counties.  It is an understatement to say that business is at a very low level all along the Border areas.  The towns are like ghost towns.  The sheriff visiting the many shops along the Border is going away as he came because there is very little that can be seized.  Do not all rush &mdash; there are not many present &mdash; to tell me that a 48-hour rule was introduced to prevent smuggling across the Border.  It was a good thing it was introduced and I said that immediately it was introduced, but it has done no good for the Border towns.  It has done no good for the chain of shops right along from Dowra, Swanlinbar, Ballyconnell, Clones, Emyvale or <Col N="465" /> Scotstown, Monaghan and on up into Louth, Cavan and Belturbet.  It has done not one bit of good because it only prevents people coming from Deputy O'Donoghue's county and neighbouring counties in busloads up for the day's crack and to see what is going on in Northern Ireland and to make some purchases and bring them home.  They are not coming back.  There is no money being spent in the Border towns, which are as badly off as ever they were.</P>
    <P>Professional smuggling is going on.  I am told there are travellers going around and offering electrical goods, television sets, radios, etc. right along the Border. It is no wonder that this is going on.</P>
    <P>A business man in Clones, Belturbet or Cootehill can in no way compete in the electrical field &mdash; which is one trade that I have picked out &mdash; with his neighbours across the Border.  I am going to quote authentic figures.  In Northern Ireland, a 14 inch standard colour television set costs £175 and included in that amount is £26 in respect of VAT.  The same set in the very same currency costs £299 in Cootehill, Clones and Belturbet and that amount includes £114 tax.  That is a difference in taxation between £26 and £114.  In Northern Ireland, a 20 inch standard colour television set costs £275, of which £41 is tax.  In this part of the island the cost is £450, of which £161.50 is tax.  How can the unfortunate business people here trade successfully against those conditions?</P>
    <P>I am told that it is not now a case of one going North and smuggling a set into this country but of a professional traveller calling to the door.  He would be called a rep, but call him what you will, he undercuts the recognised trader here by a very large amount, by £160 in the case of the larger set.  Something will have to be done about that.  I know that it may be said that the last Government, with which I was associated, did not do much in this regard.  However, as my friend, Deputy McGahon, said this morning, those parties at least did not promise that they would rectify the situation, but the present Government did, in the run-up to <Col N="466" /> the last General Election.  They promised that all this would be rectified.</P>
    <P>These people of whom I speak are in a very bad way.  One cannot mention names here and one should not.  I know a large television business which has operated successfully for the last 25 years.  It is well run and the proprietor is a sensible man, not extravagant in his ways.  He told me, virtually in tears, before the Budget that there was nothing he could do about it, his business would disappear.  I communicated with the Minister for Finance about this.  He did not give me the figures that I have quoted. I got these from another concern in Monaghan town.  I am appealing to the Minister to do something about this situation.</P>
    <P>It is simply not possible to detect smuggling along the long land frontier from Dundalk right across into Leitrim and Sligo.  One would literally want an army to do so.  The only way in which smuggling can be stopped is by trying to make the cost competitive here as against Northern Ireland.  Compensation could be paid also.  If you start reducing VAT for ten miles across the Border then there would be a creeping paralysis in the business for ten miles further along.  However, it would be possible to deal with business premises in these terms.  They cannot be changed about; they are static and remain where they are.  These could be treated the same as the severely handicapped areas and people living or farming in these areas get special treatment.  That could be done along the Border.  This is something which will have to be treated seriously.</P>
    <P>The increase in this Budget of 8 pence on the price of a gallon of petrol was a nasty surprise to these people.  Right along the Border there are huge petrol filling stations; between Cavan and Clones there are probably six to eight of these, with one built quite recently.  Such matters must be attended to if these business people are to survive.</P>
    <P>The budget is said to have introduced equity into taxation, but I do not think that it did.  I would say that introducing equity would mean bringing more people into the net so that the man at or near <Col N="467" /> the bottom would get some ease, but that is not so.  I came in at short notice &mdash; nobody asked me to come in &mdash; and I have tried to get exact figures.  I think I am right in saying that a man on a salary of £25,000 or £30,000 per annum on PAYE gets relief in this budget to the extent of £596.  A man earning from £8,000 to £14,000 gets relief to the extent of £70.  That is not equity.  That happens because the relief is operated on a percentage basis, just like increases in salary.</P>
    <P>When salaries used to be increased by the year, there was a flat percentage rate applied right across the board which led, in certain times of recession and when the economy needed to be straightened out, to all sorts of injustices.  The man who is already on a very good salary gets quite a big increase but the man who can hardly live gets practically nothing.  A few years ago I suggested, when pay had got a little out of control, that the man at the bottom who finds it very hard to live should get a comparatively decent increase and the increase in respect of the man at the top should be scaled down. I was told that the trade unions would not tolerate that under any circumstances.  I think it would be equitable that in a difficult time for the country and the people, those at the top could afford to do with less and the people at the bottom should get more but I was told that the trade unions would not entertain that for a minute.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and some of the Ministers said something about the extension of the severely handicapped areas.  This is of particular interest in Monaghan and Cavan because the two counties are scheduled for complete inclusion in the severely handicapped areas scheme.  It is true that the previous Government lodged an application to include several counties, including Monaghan and Cavan, shortly before they went out of office but at least the application was made.  When the new Government came in, the Minister for Agriculture and Food made a speech very early on from which it was clear that he was anything but enthusiastic about pressing forward with <Col N="468" /> the application for an extension of the area classified as severely handicapped. First, he said there was no money.  Then he found out that the application was wrong and needed to be revised.  His Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, is reported to have said later on that they were not pressing ahead with the application because there was no money.  That was again corrected.  At any rate the application was made by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The extra headage payment that would be brought in is badly wanted by the counties concerned.  I put down a question asking the up-to-date position.  I think perhaps recent negotiations in Brussels will result in some money being made available.  I trust that whatever the difficulty it will be surmounted and that the areas will be reclassified.  I speak particularly on behalf of Monaghan and Cavan and what applies to them will apply to several other counties as well.</P>
    <P>I was not present for the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Smith.  He devoted much of it to forestry. At the foundation of the State in 1922 there was practically no forestry here and whatever land was under forestry then was in the possession of the big land-owners.  The State had done nothing about encouraging forestry.  The Government of the infant State set about encouraging State forestries.  By 1948 the forestry drive had taken off in a big way and a lot of land was planted, around one million acres.  There is a lot more land available and suitable for afforestation all over the country.  There are some millions of acres available.  If only a fraction of what is available were planted it would mean that by the end of this century we would be self-sufficient and would have timber to export.  That would be very important because in or about that time Europe will not have sufficient timber to meet its own needs.  Indeed, there will be a world shortage of timber.</P>
    <P>We are well suited here to afforestation.  There is a very big area of land available for planting.  The climate suits tree growing.  There is one thing that I am convinced of and that is that the only <Col N="469" /> way to get trees growing quickly is for the State to do it.  If it is left to private enterprise it will take a very long time to get anything worthwhile done.  That is because one must have a big block of land to encourage afforestation successfully. Only a State agency could get that together over a long period of time.  Furthermore, it is not an attractive proposition for a man to plant trees in the knowledge that it will be at least 35 years before he gets any return.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister referred to it, but what I am going to complain about now is that the State planting programme has dried up.  No land has been acquired by the State in recent times. While it used to be the invariable practice to have two, three or four year's supply of land for planting, there is not even one year's supply now.  The whole thing has dried up and grants are being given to private enterprise to encourage farmers to plant trees.  That will not work in the short or medium term.  It will take a very long time to do that.</P>
    <P>New Zealand resembles our country in many ways.  It goes in for agriculture, cattle production, milk production.  They have bigger farms admittedly, but there they engage in cattle and milk production and timber on the same farm.  One brother takes charge of the livestock and another the forestry.  The fields are much bigger than here but the trees are planted around the fields.  They act as a shelter belt and, at the same time, produce a lot of timber.  That is a valuable national resource.  It is a long-term operation but people who run countries should be thinking of the long term.  I hear people talking about getting the economy right through afforestation.  That is not being realistic.  It simply cannot be done in the short term.  It is a very long term operation.  That is all I want to say so I will give Deputy O'Donoghue the opportunity to say something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Most economic experts in the country, and those in the media, accept that this Government is the best Government the country has had <Col N="470" /> in more than 20 years.  Their achievements in one short year have been little short of astounding.  The national debt, as we know, was reduced by over 3.5 per cent in 1987 and it will be reduced by 2.4 per cent in 1988.  Other parties who professed the correct theory that we would have to deal urgently with the public finances promised in their election manifestos that they would reduce the national debt even more.  There have been development policies on financial services, food, tourism, forestry, marine and science which contrast greatly with the performance of the previous Government who did not have any development policies, as we all know to our cost.</P>
      <P>An attempt has been made to reform the tax system and there have been improvements in social equity.  There have been reductions in costs to industry. Few would have believed 14 months ago, prior to the last election, that interest rates would have come down in one year by 5 per cent.  Petrol prices have been reduced and there has been increased competition among airlines which has resulted in reduced air fares.  Social welfare increases were brought forward from November to July.  This year there will be a 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments with special help for the long term unemployed and there will be an 11 per cent increase for urban long term unemployed.  We have provided £3 million for the homeless.  This shows that the Government never forgot, nor could they ever forget, the less well of in society.</P>

    <P>The decentralisation plan of the Government will help to bring life back to many parts of rural Ireland, including Killarney in my own constituency.  In contrast I can recall that the previous Government sold off the site which had been purchased by a Fianna Fáil Government to locate Government offices in Killarney.  The economic performance of this Government has been outstanding. Growth has been at the rate of 3.5 per cent; inflation came down 3 per cent; the balance of trade surplus stood at £1,500 million and there was a balance of payments surplus for the first time since 1967. Exports exceeded £10 billion for the first <Col N="471" /> time; industrial exports went up 18 per cent; industrial production went up 10 per cent and, for the first time since 1979 there was no increase in unemployment between December 1986 and December 1987.  In the tourism area, and in this regard I would like to compliment both the Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, who is present, revenue exceeded £1 billion.  This was a record. Agricultural incomes went up by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats set sail on a wind of hope and said they had the high ground on every economic issue facing this country.  When the crunch came &mdash; it came in this House last night &mdash; the Progressive Democrats forgot about standing by the Republic and went local. A famous American cynic said that all politics are local but of course that is not, and should not be, the way of statesmen. Last night was the night that the Left went Right and the Right went Left in a remarkable convoluted and complicated proposal.  One cannot, on the one hand, speak about financial rectitude, public expenditure cutbacks and the need to restore order to the public finances and at the same time become purely local when the issue is clearly national.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have now been exposed for what they are.  The Irish people are entitled to be made aware of the fact the the Progressive Democrats' Leader, Deputy O'Malley, was personally euphoric not for the sake of the country, not for the sake of financial rectitude, not for the sake of the unemployed and our emigrating youth, not for the sake of those whom this Government have their greatest duty to, but for the sake of himself.  All the principles, the dogmas and the theories went out the window in one fell blow.  It is difficult then to have any confidence in that kind of a party because a party who put an individual before the nation, a party who profess to have the high ground on public finances and whose leader is allowed to manipulate its policies to suit himself has nothing to offer this country.  Perhaps the problem really is that this Government <Col N="472" /> were going too well, and I have no doubt they will continue to go well.</P>
    <P>In the last year there were pronouncements from the Left that under no circumstances would they ever allow privatisation of the health services, that under no circumstances could they allow such a thing to happen.  Then for no apparent reason, other than selfish interests, the Left decided to privatise a hospital in Limerick city.  That should not be forgotten and I have no doubt it will not be forgotten.  All of this can bring one to only one conclusion, that without a single party Government in this country there is convoluted thinking and economic depression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's achievement at last week's Summit in having Regional Fund money doubled for this country by 1992 is of tremendous significance.  I might refer to a plan presented to Brussels in 1982 known as the south west Kerry development plan, the first integrated development plan presented to Brussels. Its proposals were discussed by the European Commission where it was favourably received.  It was discussed also by the European Parliament and referred to by Mr. John Hume in his report on regionalisation when he mentioned south west Kerry first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for such development in that region is very evident on the ground today.  Since 1911 the population of south west Kerry has decreased by 51 per cent, deaths continue to outnumber births despite the fact that the population of the remainder of the country has continued to rise.  It is quite clear that no part of the country deserves <Col N="473" /> or needs Regional Fund money more &mdash; with a view to developing its infrastructures &mdash; than does south west Kerry. I should stress that I am not speaking merely of development but rather of survival.  I have watched our youth emigrate, unemployment soar and one of the most beautiful parts of our country begin to wither over the last 20 years.  I cannot make a sufficiently strong appeal for south west Kerry.  In having the Regional Fund moneys doubled for Ireland by 1992 the Taoiseach has done the country an outstanding service.</P>
      <P>However, I might continue on a more local or parochial vein for the moment. One of major problems in County Kerry today is its housing shortage with over 600 applicants for single-roomed cottages and group houses in the county.  There is urgent need for additional moneys to house these people.  Another matter of tremendous concern is the state of the county roads in Kerry.  This presents a major problem in the county because, in previous years, Kerry County Council took over responsibility for as many roads as possible within their area.  There are more miles of county roads in County Kerry than in any other county.  To restore those roads to their 1980 standard Kerry County Council would require a staggering £17 million.  I would appeal to the Minister for the Environment to allocate as much finance as possible to Kerry County Council to help them in their efforts to rectify that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must give immediate detailed attention to the question of our youth who are emigrating in ever greater numbers.  There are now thousands of young Irish men and women in the United States who live in fear of becoming ill or of being found.  It should be remembered that Irish men and women contributed more than most other countrymen to the development of the United States.  It has been said on many an occasion that there would be no railways in the United States were it not for the Irish.  Irish men and women are to be found in the forefront of economic and political life in the United States at every level.  Therefore it is only right that the United States President and <Col N="474" /> Congress remember the Irish contribution to the development of their nation and help us with this temporary problem by documenting these young Irish immigrants.  I have no doubt but that there are sufficient politicians there with an interest in Ireland and things Irish who would listen to this plea.  Congressman Brian Donnelly is to be congratulated and thanked for his attempts in this regard.  But it has to be said that his statement to the effect that those undocumented immigrants in the United States today would not be documented was most disappointing.  It should be remembered that most of those immigrants are there not of their own volition but rather because they could not find employment at home as unemployment soared during the period of office of the previous Government.  I say the problem is temporary advisedly because this country has shown considerable signs of recovery and hopefully will in the near future.</P>
    <P>A growing problem being experienced in rural Ireland today is that of hawkers setting up in towns in side streets selling goods sold also by local shopkeepers. This trend is beginning to drive small businesses to the wall.  It should be remembered that small businessmen must pay rates and taxes.  Very often local authorities might wish to assist rate-payers, to whom they are duty bound but find that because of the old law, which, traditionally emanated from the common law, an area deemed to be a marketplace can continue to function as a marketplace and there is nothing a local authority can do about it.  Hawkers are utilising any town where there is a market place to extend those boundaries to any corner they like.  It is quite apparent that this is in breach of the law.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity of raising this very serious and important matter in relation to damage to the Clare coastline as a result of the recent storms.  I am particularly pleased that he has afforded me the opportunity here this evening because it is a matter of great concern in County Clare and something that needs corrective action immediately, as otherwise we will have a much more serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the storms the weekend before last, major havoc has been wreaked along the Clare coastline and the county is absolutely devastated.  Fortunately, the Clare County Council engineer, Mr. Pat Gleeson and the assistant engineer, Mr. John Coyne, with the area engineers, very promptly put together a report and submitted it to the Department of the Environment which gives a preliminary detail of the damage done.  The situation is so bad that you <Col N="476" /> would really have to see what has happened there to believe how devastated the area is and the seriousness of the damage.  Where the Shannon meets the sea at Rynvilla Bay, which is open to the south-west winds, there was particularly serious damage.  About 200 metres of the sea wall and 700 metres of the road were damaged and the estimated cost of repairing them alone is £250,000.  As you move back towards Kilbaha, which is near Loop Head, the sea wall has also been damaged and the estimated cost of repair is about £30,000.  As you move around the tip of Loop Head, where the famous bridges of Ross are situated, thousands of seashore pebbles have been thrown on to the roadway which means that the road is totally cut off and the estimated cost of clearing it is roughly £5,000.</P>
    <P>In the very important tourist resort of Kilkee &mdash; which is totally dependent on tourism &mdash; the damage is particularly serious for the economy of the town.  The promenade has been seriously damaged and its wall has been broken and knocked in a number of places.  The bathing shelters and toilets have all been knocked down and the very nice seating arrangement around the area has also been damaged.  In addition, the road going back towards the cliffs and around the front of Kilkee has suffered badly.  The foundations of the wall have been eroded and, if corrective action is not taken, within a short time the road will cave in and it will be impossible to pass.</P>
    <P>Various damage has also been done to a walk of a mile along the west end.  The path and the steps leading to beautiful scenic areas and rock formation are inaccessible because of the damage.  This needs to be properly repaired before Easter because, otherwise there will be no tourist facilities for those who come here at that time, which will mean that the people of the town will lose their livelihood.  When you move up the coast you come to Seafield and Quilty in which there has been more erosion of the public road which, it is estimated will cost about £100,000 to repair.</P>
    <P>The initial estimate for repairs in <Col N="477" /> Kilkee was about £150,000 but this would merely be a cosmetic exercise, the real estimate is nearer £250,000 because the degree of damage to the foundations is very extensive.  The estimate for repairing damage to Seafield and Quilty is about £100,000.  In the home territory of the President, the bridge and sea wall have been damaged in Spanish Point, stones and litter have fallen on the roads and a clean up job is needed, which is estimated to cost about £10,000; in Whitestrand and Miltown Malbay, there is also damage caused by stones on the road and the estimated cost of clearing and repairing the area is about £5,000.</P>
    <P>In the very important holiday and golfing resort of Lahinch, the inner sea wall has been knocked for about 40 metres and the capping on the wall has been washed off.  In addition, a great deal of rubble is causing problems.  At the northern end of the promenade walk, major erosion has taken place at the fourth tee of the golf course.  This is very serious because it affects the whole fabric of the tourism attraction in Lahinch.  The estimated cost of repairs there is roughly £80,000.</P>
    <P>Two miles north of that area, Clahanes and Liscannor face south westerly winds and there has been extensive damage in the area.  For about 600 metres there has been coastal erosion along a protective wall and the estimated cost of repairs is roughly £250,000.  In Liscannor harbour there is about 50 metres of coastal erosion and the estimated cost of repairing it is £30,000.  Doolin has become a very popular resort, particularly for continentals, and many German, French and Dutch people have used it extensively in recent years.  There have been major rock disturbance and coastal erosion there which it is estimated will cost £20,000 to repair.</P>
    <P>When you go round Blackhead and into Galway Bay you come to Finnavarra which is near Kinvara but still in County Clare.  The area has suffered more coastal erosion, and there is need for a major clean-up, and the estimated cost is £30,000.  In addition, extensive damage has been caused throughout the county <Col N="478" /> by falling trees and the cost to Clare County Council of clearing them is estimated at £18,000.  Overall we are talking about a figure of £978,000 for remedial work and so on.  The cost of the work at Kilkee was under-estimated and I understand that we should add a further £100,000 to that figure.  Therefore, we are talking about a sum of £1,078,000. That is an indication of the amount of damage caused by the storm.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment the county engineer, the assistant county engineer, and their staff, for preparing the preliminary report on the extent of the damage so efficiently and speedily.  In asking the Minister to give serious consideration to the proposals I have outlined I must point out that it is imperative in the interests of the economy of north west Clare that restoration work is carried out immediately.  If that is not done the economic fabric of the area will be in jeopardy and there will be little future for the people who live there.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the proposals as a matter of urgency and allocate the necessary finance to Clare County Council.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Chair how much time I have left.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's offer and I will yield to my colleague in a few moments.  I accept that the Department of the Environment have financial problems but I suggest to the Minister that he should seek assistance from the European Community.  I urge the Department to act quickly and secure the necessary funds to carry out remedial work.  We are talking about a major disaster in that area.  In my lifetime I have never seen a storm cause so much havoc <Col N="479" /> to the coast of Clare.  I would appreciate the support of the Minister in regard to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleague in appealing to the Minister to instruct his Department to deal with the problems that have arisen following the destruction by the storm last week. Deputy Taylor-Quinn has given details of the areas most affected by the storm. I accept that there is a lack of finance in the Department and that they will have great difficulty in raising the £1 million to carry out restoration work but I must point out that there is a precedent for such emergency assistance in that when Hurricane Charlie hit Dublin and the east coast the previous Government made money available to deal with the flooding along the banks of the Dodder and in Bray.  Fianna Fáil, who were then in Opposition, supported the application by the Government to the EC for funds to help those who suffered loss during that storm.</P>
      <P>The letter from the county manager and county engineer of Clare County Council details the extent of the damage caused by the storm.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the popularity of the west Clare coastline with tourists and that many Members spend their holidays in that area.  I hope the Minister can assure us that remedial work in Kilkee, Lahinch and Doolin will be carried out immediately.  The Department should respond positively to our pleas and provide the necessary finance.</P>

      <P>In the course of my contribution I omitted to ask for funds to carry out repair work at Farihy Bay, two and a half miles north of Kilkee.  A lot of damage has been done to the sluice gate there with the result that 600 or 700 acres of land have been flooded with salt water.  Needless to say that will damage the soil.  The flooding is causing a lot of worry to local farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to co-operate with the Chair and Deputies Taylor-Quinn and Carey.  Before responding to this evening's debate I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the excellent work which local authorities throughout the country did during the recent storm.  It is clear that the authorities were alert to the impending storm and responded well in maintaining services and keeping roads open to traffic.</P>
      <P>The information available in my Department about the damage caused during the storm is still somewhat sketchy and is based on information provided by the local authorities in advance of carrying out detailed assessments of the full extent of the damage and the cost of remedial work.</P>
      <P>In the case of Clare County Council, a report on the storm damage has been received in the Department together with preliminary estimates of the cost of restoration work.  A preliminary examination of the report would suggest the most significant problems relate to coast erosion and damage to sea walls and public buildings.  Some damage was also done to the public road network but this appears to be a relatively small part of the overall problem.</P>
      <P>While I recognise fully the difficulties which have arisen in Clare, and in other areas of the country, due to the storm, I have to say that primary responsibility for remedial works rests with the local authorities concerned.  Any assistance that may be available from my Department can only come from existing sources of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of remedial work to sea walls and public buildings, it will be appreciated that there is no system of grant assistance available in my Department for this type of work.  However, I am prepared, within the existing limits of my Department's Vote, to give sympathetic consideration to any applications <Col N="481" /> submitted to the Department for treasurer loans to finance suitable remedial works.</P>
    <P>In the case of damage to public roads, it is likely that a high proportion of any necessary remedial work would qualify for assistance from the funds already allocated for 1988 in respect of national road maintenance, county road strengthening and block grant.  The grants notified to Clare County Council under these headings for 1988 total over £2 million.  Any road repairs which do not qualify for grant aid will fall to be financed from the local authority's own resources.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the explanation of the position.  I do not want to lecture anybody, but Deputies will understand that the Vote for my Department was approved in the Estimates last autumn.  The Minister will have to live within that Estimate and there cannot be any overrun in expenditure.  If there is to be any assistance for Clare or any other part of the country it will have to come from the overall financial package as put forward in the budget and the Estimates. When a full examination has been carried out by the county engineer and the county manager with the officials from my Department, we will see what can be done.  Road repairs will have to be funded from local resources.  I do not want to mislead anybody.  I have always been truthful in the House and I want to be frank.  I do not want to build up hopes.</P>

      <P>When we have a complete assessment we will see what further can be done.  I cannot give any definite undertaking but I am sympathetically disposed.  If the Department can be of help in easing the problem we will be only too glad to do so.  Preliminary estimates suggest that damage to roads is in the <Col N="482" /> region of £150,000.  Other damage amounts to £850,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply I gave to a Parliamentary Question on this subject on 14 October last (Dáil Debates, Vol. 374, Cols. 111 and 112). As I anticipated in that reply, the Law Reform Commission have since published a Consultation Paper on Rape.</P>
      <P>That paper does not embody the Commission's final proposals.  Its object, as the introduction to the paper states, is to &ldquo;stimulate reaction among interested sections of the public to the Commission's initial and tentative conclusions&rdquo; prior to the preparation of their final Report.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, I would wish to have the benefit of the Commission's final views and recommendations before considering what changes, if any, there should be in the law on rape.  When the Commission's Report is received it will be considered by my Department as a matter of urgency.</P>

Unfortunately, the position is that there is no scope in present circumstances for increased funding of the Association by my Department in the way referred to in the Question or otherwise.  The IAVS received a grant of £8,000 from my Department in 1987 and a similar provision has been made in the Estimates for 1988.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for introducing a revised roster arises from the fact that last year the Government sanctioned the recruitment of up to 200 additional staff to enable a new roster to be introduced which would eliminate the existing dependency on overtime for the staffing of the evening recreation period in the <Col N="437" /> closed institutions.  On the basis that such a roster would be introduced, the Government allocated £6.3 million for prisons' overtime for 1988.</P>
    <P>Discussions in regard to prisons' rostering have been taking place with the Prison Officers' Association under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service over the last 3 years. Unfortunately, it did not prove possible at these discussions to reach agreement on the introduction of a revised roster which would eliminate the existing inbuilt overtime.  In these circumstances and having regard to the 1988 prisons overtime allocation it has been necessary for my Department to proceed with the introduction of the new roster this month in the absence of agreement.</P>

      <P>There are in fact no definitive published figures for crime in 1987.  The Garda Commissioner's Report on Crime for 1987 will not be available until later in the year.  However, the Garda authorities inform me that provisional figures indicate that the level of recorded indictable crime decreased in 1987 by approximately 1.5 per cent.</P>

    <P>The allocation of manpower and other <Col N="440" /> resources to specialised units like the Drugs Squad is a matter for the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.</P>
    <P>The Garda strategy for dealing with the drugs problem is to have a number of specialised units assigned exclusively to anti-drugs work and to provide specialised training in such work for a substantial number of members in all Garda Divisions.  It is the considered opinion of the Garda authorities &mdash; and this view is in line with current thinking in many police forces &mdash; that while specialised drugs units have a valuable contribution to make, there is a limit to the extent to which available resources ought to be allocated to them, rather than to the provision of specialised anti-drugs training for a much larger number of members of the Garda Síochána who use this training while also carrying out other police duties.  To date, some 3,000 members of the Force have undergone specialised training in anti-drugs work.

      <P>Testing for the AIDS virus is available on a voluntary basis to all prisoners.</P>
      <P>Prisoners who are found to be HIV positive are segregated from the general prison population.  At present they are held in three separate areas in Mountjoy Prison.  The decision in early 1986 to segregate such prisoners was taken to facilitate appropriate medical precautions and for operational reasons relating to good order in the institutions.</P>
      <P>Additional medical officers have been appointed at the prison since the identification of offenders as HIV positive and these attend regularly and are on call at all times.  In addition, arrangements are made for the offenders to attend hospital for tests, treatment etc. when required. A wide range of services are made available to offenders such as psychiatric and psychological, welfare, chaplaincy and educational.  In addition, representatives of a number of community-based agencies involved with drug addiction visit the prison to counsel offenders.  The Deputy will appreciate that members of the prison service itself have a key role to play in the provision of an appropriate regime for these offenders.</P>
      <P>I am not clear what the Deputy may have in mind by a special detention unit beyond the arrangements already in place.  It should be borne in mind that the medical requirements can vary greatly in relation to individual offenders at different stages.  For example, some require little more than monitoring of their condition whereas others can require intensive medical intervention which can only be met in a hospital setting.  Because of the nature of the infections to which the offenders are prone it can also be the case that attendance at several hospitals specialising in various illnesses is necessary.</P>

      <P>I have read the report mentioned by the Deputy in his question.</P>
      <P>Information and education about primary vaccination and immunisation is provided to the public in a number of ways.  The health boards promote vaccination through the community care services and through general practitioners, who advise parents on a one to one basis about vaccination and immunisation. Promotional materials such as leaflets and media advertising are also used at both national and local levels.</P>
      <P>Boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and polio are provided at school entry and parents are advised through the school authorities about the relevant vaccinations.</P>
      <P>The effectiveness of vaccination programmes is monitored by the Department of Health, <i>inter alia,</i> through discussions with the directors of the community care and medical officers of health.  Local problems, such as that referred to by the Deputy, are investigated with a view to increasing the levels of uptake of the vaccination.</P>
      <P>The Department will be meeting with the directors of community care and medical officers of health shortly and I have asked that the vaccination and immunisation programme be discussed as a priority.</P>
      <P>In addition I have asked the health promotion unit of my Department to promote the vaccination and immunisation programme comprehensively.</P>
      <P>However, it is primarily the responsibility of parents to ensure that their children are brought forward for vaccination and immunisation and I would urge all parents to ensure that their children are fully protected in this respect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education, in as much as Circular 24/82 setting out standards for accommodation and amenities in national schools specify the minimum requirement of 600 square feet per classroom, and rule 31 of her Department's Rules for National Schools states that 15 square feet per child is the required classroom area necessary to accommodate each pupil, if she will undertake that in the case of St. John's national school, Ballyvaughan, County Clare, the present allocation of three teachers and a third classroom which is prefabricated, added to the school in 1984, will be retained as long as enrolments remain above 50 pupils, i.e. the number which can be accommodated under rule 31, in the two permanent classrooms totalling 840 square feet; and if not, if she will specify the grounds on which the allocation of teachers or the number of classrooms will be reduced.</P>

      <P>Applications of schools for remedial teaching posts are processed in the Department and posts are allocated in accordance with a priority of educational need.  The number of remedial <Col N="452" /> posts to be sanctioned in any school year depends on the financial resources available to the Department.</P>
      <P>Thirty additional remedial posts at primary level were sanctioned for the entire country in the school year ending 31 August 1987 as follows:&mdash; Co. Dublin, 12; Co. Longford, 3; Co. Meath/Westmeath, 3; Co. Mayo, 2; Co. Limerick, 2; Co. Tipperary, 2; Co. Cork, 1; Co. Donegal, 1; Co. Galway, 1; Co. Kildare/Wicklow 1; Co. Kerry, 1; Co. Waterford, 1.</P>
      <P>Some of these posts were allocated on a shared basis between a number of schools.</P>
      <P>Further posts have not been allocated in the school year 1987/88.</P>
      <P>Fifty-five additional remedial/guidance teacher posts were allocated for the 1986/87 school year to post-primary schools catering for disadvantaged pupils in accordance with the terms of my Department's Circular Letter 23/86.  A copy of the circular together with a list of the schools involved is being circulated in the Official Report.  It was left to the school management authority to decide whether each post should be remedial or guidance.  No additional remedial teacher posts were allocated to post-primary schools for the 1987/88 school year.</P>

      </P>
      <P>Establishment of Additional Remedial/ Guidance Posts in Post-Primary Schools catering for Disadvantaged Pupils</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Education to inform you that, in accordance with the provisions in the National Plan, it is proposed to allocate additional remedial and guidance posts in 1986/87 to post-primary schools catering for disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>Sanction in respect of such posts will, in general, be conditional, inter alia, on</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister being satisfied that there is a need in the school which cannot be met satisfactorily by any alternative means;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> (b)  the availability of a teacher who not only satisfies the appropriate qualification requirements for a post-primary teacher but also already possesses an acceptable qualification in Remedial Education or in Guidance.</P>
    <P>In allocating the posts, priority will be given to schools making specific educational proposals in relation to pupils having special learning needs.</P>
    <P>Management authorities seeking approval for such a post should make application to the Department (Post-Primary Teachers' Section, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1) not later than Friday 13th June 1986. The application should be accompanied by evidence of the need for the additional post in the school.  This evidence would ideally take the form of the results of tests of attainments and of skills (e.g. language skills) carried out recently and information should be provided on the type of test used.  This information could be supplemented by other background data considered relevant.</P>
