      <P>You are no doubt aware, Sir, that I corresponded with you last night in relation to my desire to have Standing Orders of the House suspended today to discuss a certain matter of public importance, that matter being that this House deplores the situation which has arisen whereby Members of the House are debarred by the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule from discussing the urgent matter of the conflict over new taxes on angling which have given rise to increasing turmoil and damage to one of our most important industries, tourism.  This House also notes that the precedent exists where a debate on a matter of great public interest was allowed not-withstanding the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  Accordingly, this House resolves to debate and decide the motion on the Order Paper dealing with the subject together with any appropriate amendments.  I served <Col N="2414" /> you notice last night and I have to say to you that it is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I now propose to reply to the Deputy.  Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it is one contemplated by Standing Order 30.  I cannot, therefore, grant leave to move the motion.  Normally I do not elaborate on the reasons for my rulings but in the circumstances of this case I feel I should do so.</P>
      <P>The <i>sub judice</i> rule has been in operation in this House for more than 60 years and could not, therefore, be regarded as a matter which has arisen suddenly. Furthermore, the rule does not come within the current responsibility of the Government.  It is a matter for the House itself.  On 22 October 1986 my predecessor set out in some detail the <i>sub judice</i> rule and the background to it.  I would refer Deputies to the Official Report, columns 13 and 14, Volume 369. I do not propose to repeat what he said. In that case my predecessor based his rule on a plenary summons issued on 28 August 1986, almost two months previously. In the rod licence case I base my rule on a plenary summons issued on 26 February last.</P>
      <P>I cannot, as Ceann Comhairle, unilaterally change the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  As I stated last Tuesday, this would be a matter for the House itself or for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the first instance.  The House, of course, can abolish the rule or modify it if it so wishes and I, as Ceann Comhairle, will faithfully implement any such change.  In the meantime I intend to apply the existing rule in accordance with long standing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion a debate took place relating to a matter which was <i>sub judice.</i> This was permitted by Order of the House and not by a decision of the Chair.  The Deputy is, of course, enabled to table a motion in Private Members' <Col N="2415" /> time providing for the abolition or modification of the rule in question.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for your detailed statement on this matter and I know that is breaking with tradition.  I appreciate that.  However, it is absolutely riddled with inconsistencies in relation to the present problem and on that basis I will give you notice as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that I will ask for an immediate and emergency meeting of that body to consider this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cause of great regret to me that this House is still debating this measure because every week that has gone by since this Bill was first published has seen a further deterioration in the morale of the staff both in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  There is no doubt that it must be an immediate priority of this House to expedite this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of offers of voluntary redundancy and early retirement has greatly depleted the ranks, particularly of ACOT.  Last Monday I attended a meeting of the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture and heard at first hand from the acting CAO of the skeleton, hand-to-mouth services they are having to provide because of the level of early retirements and redundancies among district managers.  County Wexford is without a CAO and the acting CAO is not even being paid an extra allowance.  ACOT and An Foras Talúntais are in a state of limbo and total <Col N="2419" /> demoralisation because of the Minister's handling of this matter.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is this country's single most important sector.  There are some 150,000 farmers and agriculture accounts for 46 per cent of net exports and 30 per cent of the total workforce.  In any line of business, whether it is manufacturing industry or the food industry, there is a simple rule of operation which now applies that change in the marketplace and in processing is such that any product has a life cycle of only five years at best. If an industry is to keep pace with a rapidly changing marketplace it must invest in research.  Their approach to research must be unambiguous.  In every other European country and among all our competitors there is a minimum level of expenditure of 1 per cent of GDP on research.  It is a great source of disappointment to me that nationally speaking we have ignored research.  It is something considered as an optional extra as opposed to necessity, which of course it is.</P>
    <P>With this Government's treatment of research in terms of priority and the rationalisation of personnel and resources in that area under the proposed merger, I fear that the Irish food industry will lag further behind.  The originally proposed cut from £34 million to £20 million between the 1987 and 1988 Books of Estimates shows quite clearly that the original intentions of the Minister were unworkable.  To get rid of 1,000 jobs out of 2,200 would have devastating effects on an irreplaceable infrastructure of skill in the areas of research and advice which had been built up over many years.  I fear this will be lost.  There is also no doubt that the maximum number of voluntary redundancies that could have been obtained within ACOT and An Foras Talúntais was far short of the original figure.  It seems there was not proper consultation prior to decisions being taken.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais have played a major role in the Wexford area.  There is the excellent research station at Johnstown Castle and the soft fruit and <Col N="2420" /> research centre at Clonroche, Enniscorthy. The big question so far as the people of Wexford, the clients of the service provided by the State and those working in the service are concerned is which of these institutions is to be rationalised. There are many rumours.  It could be Johnstown Castle because it has a poor ratio of operatives to research and there are rumours about overheads.  There are conflicting rumours in relation to Moorepark, Oakpark, Dunsaney, Kinsealy and Grange.  Whether there are three wise men appointed to preside over the rationalisation or it is the Minister's own political decision, there is an urgent need to clear the air as to which facilities will be retained and which will go.  I would like to make a particular plea for Johnstown Castle, and I will go into some detail about this later on.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the handling of this matter there must be direct and blunt criticism of the way the Government have proceeded to cut only 2 per cent in administration expenditure in the Department itself and to cut up to 43 per cent in the service on the ground in the research, advisory and education areas.  This party wholeheartedly underwrites the cutting of expenditure but it strikes me that if there is an overall superstructure of State services, the last thing that should be cut is what goes over the counter to the public.  What must be cut is the superstructure itself.  I am glad that the redundancy scheme was extended to the Civil Service itself and hope we will see effective redeployment because, among the farming community and the public at large there is general dissatisfaction at the cost and level of administration in the Department of Agriculture and Food of schemes such as the TB eradication scheme and other schemes.</P>
    <P>The origins of this legislation obviously lie in the Cashman report which involved many people who made a very constructive input.  While there were mixed views about it, I think going back to Mark Clinton's time, there has always been a case for integrating the advisory and research services.  I welcome the fact that there is such a merger, although I would <Col N="2421" /> have reservations about some aspects of the Cashman report.  However, one thing we do not want to see in any merger is an enlargement of the likes of Frascati House in Blackrock and a restriction and dilution of services on the ground.  All too often we are even better at producing larger nameplates on southside city offices that are adequately carpeted and centrally heated and we are all too quick to cut the front line of advisory workers on the ground.  I fear that in one big organisation we may set up a bigger quango in terms of administration and that must be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>There is one major criticism of the Cashman report, that is in regard to their proposed abolition of the county committees of agriculture.  Like many Members of this House in rural constituencies I am a member of the county committee of agriculture but I am not totally lacking in objectivity about their usefulness.  To some extent they have been talking shops; they have called on Ministers, usually the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, to do this, that or the other and have received back at the next monthly meeting an acknowledgement from the Private Sectetary to say that their views are noted and it can seem a very frustrating exercise. However, they do provide one level of input into the whole State agricultural area that is irreplaceable, and for that reason they should be retained in some form or another.  I refer to the fact that at district committee level they have practical farmers, practical ACOT advisers, different representatives on the ground inputting directly to the district managers of the ACOT service.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party, when our party was in Government, used the county committee of agriculture as a political platform which I thought was regrettable, and we have seen many inconsistencies at local level since.  However, there was a level of consultation which involved public representatives, farmers and the grassroots representatives of farm organisations, and basically that was a pool of knowledge that was worthwhile pursuing. If it is abolished the money saved will be <Col N="2422" /> spent on consultants' reports in Dublin, and I believe it is practical knowledge that is required and thus can be got for very small money.  For this year to retain the county committee of agriculture would cost under £7,000, an absolute pittance, and that is just for them to retain the minimal level of service.</P>
    <P>They also filled other roles in terms of helping ACOT to spread word of different seminars and, in terms of the local provincial press they had an immediate platform that ACOT would never have. ACOT would have to spend a lot more than £7,000 a year on agricultural supplements to local provincial papers alone to get the type of airing of agricultural matters that county committees of agriculture could get.  Let us take the recent topical example of ACOT's drive to advise farmers in relation to pollution matters.  A couple of meetings of a county committee of agriculture to have a solid debate on that, with an opportunity for the local ACOT expert on pollution to talk, and the media recording, gets far more coverage than anything else.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in simple practical terms there is an unanswerable case for the retention of county committees of agriculture in some form or other.  It is the Minister's loss, the Department's loss and farmers' loss that it is proposed in this Bill to simply scrap them and I very much regret it.  I hope the Minister, on Committee Stage, will think again on this matter, because I know many members of his own party share this concern and would like to see the decision reversed.</P>
    <P>I have always taken the view that the proposed voluntary redundancy scheme offered by the Government was far too generous.  I said that at the outset and I think that view has been vindicated right across the board, from teachers to local authority members to foresters and people in the agricultural service who are availing of the redundancy scheme. When one looks at the potential cost in this instance of rationalisation, a cost of £17.5 million plus an annual payment of £7.5 million, it is money not well spent. I certainly have reservations about going to the Central Bank for this money, <Col N="2423" /> because I feel we could have got the same level of redundancies with less money. Also, in some instances the best people in the service have got out.  Take the example of people who are not going on early retirement, but who are taking voluntary redundancy &mdash; people in their thirties &mdash; among those the best people will go because they will have the best opportunities outside the service.  The people with the least opportunities will be the last to avail of it.  There will be a huge brain drain from the organisation because of this.</P>
    <P>Between 1982 and 1987 we have already seen a drop from 1,223 people in the ACOT service down to 1,030, people. That is a 16 per cent drop already, and I feel the embargo was the best way to proceed with such a slimming down of the organisation.  Maybe the embargo could have been accelerated somewhat by moving from one in three to one in five instead of having a total embargo.  That would, over a period of time, have brought about an orderly and reasonable rationalisation instead of a once-off massive brain drain haemorrhaging from the service.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as far as farm incomes are concerned, that competition in the agricultural and food sectors is becoming more intense each year.  If we look at it on a global scale we see countries like China and other far eastern countries becoming self sufficient in food. This has drastic implications for the competitiveness of Irish food because we must pick out particular market niches for our products, whether meat products or dairy products.  This, coupled with the US surplus of food, will mean that in the nineties there will be no soft option of commodity trading or intervention as in the past.  I fear that unless there is a further integration of the food element of the IDA into the new body we will lose further ground.  There is no doubt that farm incomes in the future will almost solely depend on what happens in a post-farm gate situation.  In other words the ability of the Irish food processing <Col N="2424" /> industry to present, market and process their products &mdash; and they being new technology related products &mdash; will be the key to Irish success.  Unless we obtain premium prices there is simply no future for Irish agriculture even at present levels of income.  The rate of return on capital employed in agriculture at present is in low single figures in net terms.  That cannot be good for an industry that requires a lot of capital to develop at the rate at which Ireland needs to develop.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall level of expenditure I made the point earlier that other countries considered research to be absolutely vital.  Ireland's percentage expenditure on research and education in Europe is now at the lowest level of all EC countries.  At 0.73 per cent of the gross agricultural output figure it is shockingly low and is one-sixteenth of the Dutch figure.  That is a very poor reflection of the commitment of this House and this Government to research.  That must be seen in a context where 71 per cent of farmers' incomes are less than £100 per week or £5,000 per year.  At a time when there is a crying need, because of limited land resources, the small to medium sized farmers are not in a position to buy more land no matter what land structure policies are in place.  The only thing that can be done is to make them more productive, efficient and profitable and that requires research and advice.  To spend one-sixteenth of what the Dutch are spending or 0.73 of the gross agricultural output is simply reprehensible. I would be in favour of a redeployment of most other forms of agricultural expenditure in favour of research because that is what the market dictates.  I wish to turn now to Johnstown Castle.  I am sure many Members of this House have visited Johnstown Castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that my concern for Johnstown Castle goes beyond any lipservice or any local PR considerations.  Johnstown Castle has taken 40 years to develop and there is now an irreplaceable facility there.  There are 1,000 acres of land and an excellent complex of laboratories, buildings and equipment.  They are one of the largest employers in Wexford and have 170 employees.  One can imagine the devastation to the local economy should £4.1 million be taken out of it.  Something that has impressed me regarding the case made by the staff, unions, researchers and scientists of Johnstown Castle is their willingness and their flexibility to cooperate with change and to take a commercial approach.  It is very sad that it has taken the threat of closure to bring about this type of reality into many of our State organisations.  I fear that we may be throwing out the bath water with the baby in relation to this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last two weeks they had a major seminar in relation to the thoroughbred industry: a very successful innovation whereby they can provide, because of their facilities, unique advice that is urgently required and will be paid for by the thoroughbred industry, the breeding industry, the racing industry and the horse industry generally.  This type of development is essentially geared towards a self-financing base.  They will charge commercial fees for a commercial <Col N="2426" /> service.  That must be retained.  If that service is lost to this country it is a national loss.  It goes way beyond any pluses or minuses in Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>I also believe that Johnstown Castle apart from all the facilities which AFT have is uniquely placed to do environmental work.  There is no doubt that over the past few years we have seen a growing significance attached to the pollutant and environmental factors relating to agriculture. They have already proved their worth in relation to soil testing.  They are providing a national service on a commercial basis in that regard.  This service has now been extended to water testing. This is the one growth sector where there was an identifiable need for such a service, as An Foras Forbartha have been abolished and because of cutbacks in domestic support grants to local authorities and because of restrictions, staff are not able to provide that service.  There is a national need for a centre to provide this type of environmental work and to give advice to farmers on the different pollutant factors of spreading fertilisers, manure and all silo-effluents.  It is very important that Johnstown Castle be given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>In 1945 Johnstown Castle was a gift to the State.  The terms of the gift was that it was not to be sold or let go other than for State use.  I would consider it unbelievable that the State should contemplate any situation whereby they would renege on any commitments given at that time.  Moreover, from the terms of that gift it is obvious that the State has an obligation to maintain Johnstown Castle.  That means whether you have it as a research centre, the Office of Public Works or somebody else must pick up the tab for looking after Johnstown Castle. Therefore, we may as well get the full value from it.  Its agricultural facilities are excellent.  It has a slatted unit for 900 cattle.  It has new silo pans and the amount of recent investment that has gone into it over the past few years would dictate that it must be retained.  They can do work for the bloodstock industry, the Nuclear Energy Board and they can also obtain overseas revenues on consultancy <Col N="2427" /> work.  They have already done this from such countries as Zimbabwe and the Azores and they can also provide training for overseas science workers.  It should also be pointed out that they are carrying out tests on 100,000 soil samples per annum and 30,000 plant samples per annum.  They have an excellent track record which anyone in the ACOT or AFT service can verify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I have no interest in prolonging this debate.  It is a very important matter to my constituency.  If there was a factory where there would be a loss of 170 jobs there would be a lot of concern in my constituency.</P>
      <P>There is an agricultural museum in Johnstown Castle, which brings in 20,000 visitors per annum and the overall park area has up to 60,000 visitors per annum. I believe the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy McCarty, indicated in his proposals for setting up a natural infrastructure for science and technology that there would be a regional cantre in the south east.  There is no doubt that Johnstown Castle fits into his regional plans.  It would seem totally out of line with those plans that the Minister should have any proposals to diminish the role of that establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clonroche Research Station is a smaller station, but is also very important. The Government party, prior to coming into office, made very solemn commitments on what they were going to do about the fruit and vegetable industry and set up a State board with that role in mind.  Whatever about quangos, there is no doubt that Clonroche Research Station has provided invaluable facilities on a very low budget.  It works in conjunction with the soft fruit growers and 90 per cent of the country's soft fruit, <Col N="2428" /> including most of the strawberries, raspberries and blackcurrants are grown in Wexford.  It has built up an excellent reputation for co-operation, advice on disease, on plant breeding and so on.  It would seem hypocritical, in relation to Bord Glas, that an industry which has such a high export content should be adversely affected by the closure of Clonroche Research Station.  That station is availing of EC contracts in relation also to biomass, although there has been a curtailment there because of some voluntary redundancies.  I would ask for a commitment from the Minister, at the conclusion of Second Stage, in relation to Johnstown Castle and Clonroche Research Station and, specifically, that Johnstown Castle be written into the Bill as it was in previous legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with some points of detail in the Bill.  I hope that the principles retained in the 1958 AFT Act will be retained, guaranteeing independence to the board, independence to initiate and conduct research and to report independently on this.  It is absolutely vital that the legislation enshrine the independence of the new organisation. I should also like to see a separate research management structure so that there will be clearly delineated functions within the new organisation and a separate budget for research so that there is not across-the-board cutting.  I ask the Minister to ensure some staff representation on the board.</P>
    <P>I have received, as I am sure has every other Deputy, a submission from the Agricultural Science Association showing that only one in five farmers, totalling 30,000 farmers, is fully competitive and efficient, and that potentially 55,000 farmers, another third, are capable, with the right type of research, of becoming fully viable.  I hope that the first target of this organisation will be to make those 55,000 farmers fully competitive, efficient and up to EC standards.  I ask the Minister to do everything humanly possible to expedite the legislation and ensure that staff morale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The botched attempts of this Minister to merge the two agricultural organisations have caused a degree of concern on this side of the House which has led, perhaps, to a more prolonged debate than would otherwise have been necessary.  In relation to the operation of the new organisation, they should try to evolve what has been done in the industrial sphere, a one-stop-shop at local level whereby a farmer could obtain the different types of services available at one contact point.  I should like to see the work of the Farmer Apprenticeship Board incorporated into the new organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the IDA being involved in the food processing industry.  I see no reason why we should continue to perpetuate bureaucracy and red tape in relation to farm grants, the farm improvement programme and other capital grants, with ACOT handling the <Col N="2430" /> applications and subsequently the paperwork being done by the Farm Development Service.  These must be integrated. If the IDA in the industrial sphere can give advice, handle capital grants and make decisions on them, there is no reason all that work should not be done for agriculture by this one organisation and the Farm Development Service and their staff should be integrated into the organisation.  I hope that an early five year plan will be drawn up with a solid programme of activity and a commitment that 35 per cent minimum of expenditure by the new organisation would be spent on the delivery of service on the ground. That is an urgent priority the Minister should lay down to the board.</P>
    <P>I hope that any fees generated by this new organisation through the new commercial orientation would be allowed to be their life blood.  That would regenerate investment in the organisation, as opposed to its being clawed back by the central Exchequer.  I make a plea for an extension of veterinary research.  I know our party spokesman at Question Time last week asked the Minister, in relation to his welcome proposals regarding the eradication of TB to give a clear commitment in relation to research.  I heard the Minister stating that research was not something you could parcel away into one particular compartment.  While that is true, there is need to extend veterinary research and this organisation should be charged with that role, along with further work in relation to the testing of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be as brief as possible. I hope that when the Minister has the opportunity to conclude on Second Stage he will give a commitment that this is not just an exercise in book-keeping and rationalisation, that it is not just an exercise of implementing a report.  It must be a new beginning to allow a new dynamic to enter State agricultural research and advisory services, to provide comprehensive education to meet the singular and specific commitments to which I have referred and, in relation to my local situation, a solid commitment must be given in relation to the future viability, survival, <Col N="2431" /> extension and growth of Johnstown Castle and Clonroche Research Station. If all those requests are met, I shall be only too happy, with my colleagues in my party, to ensure a speedy passage of this legislation through the House.</P>

      <P>The Members on the Opposition benches have had quite a considerable time to talk and I would appreciate the opportunity to say my little piece in relation to this Bill.  Despite what has been said, I am pleased to note that there has been a general welcome in the House for the main provisions of the Bill, that is, the bringing together of agricultural advisory, training, education and <Col N="2432" /> research services.  It is only natural that all these facets of agriculture should be together as one entity.  I cannot envisage a situation in which anyone would seek to separate these functions.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation makes sense not just because it will do away with a tendency to duplicate services but because it also provides us with the potential for increasing the efficiency with which the results of vital research can be disseminated to the end users, the primary producers and processors.  The fact that we are the first in Europe to take such a step is inspiring, it reflects the fact that agriculture is that much more important to us than to any other European country. For that reason it is only fitting that we, after due thought and consideration, have the courage and foresight to take this step which we all agree is necessary. It is not the first time that Ireland has led Europe in agricultural terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to some local institutions and I also take some pride in the fact that I live less than six miles from Grange, a townland and an institution that is synonymous throughout Europe for its innovative thinking and down to earth no-nonsense approach to cattle production and silage management.  The AFT institute there has a worldwide reputation.  Grange is the section of AFT with which I am most familiar and it is the centre about which I can speak with most conviction, but even if I lived in the furthermost constituency from Grange I would be familiar to some extent with its work among cattle farmers including calf producers, store cattle, new and finished beef producers.  Grange occupies a very special place in their whole approach to their livelihood.  When Grange hold one of their open days once every two years, cattle producers from all parts of the country are to be found among the thousands who come to this mecca for beef production.  Some might think that calling it a mecca is an over-generous use of the word but they should consider that regularly, British agriculture journalists, technical journalists with top qualifications in farming techniques, many of whom are farmers, make a pilgrimage to <Col N="2433" /> Grange to see for themselves the latest advances in beef and silage technology. They want to know what the scientists at Grange are doing so that they can report back to their readers.  These journalists write with great respect about what is going on here because they know they are dealing with the world's top class research that is being applied in a practical and commercial manner.  While Britain is akin to us in climate, farming is very different, mainly due to the scale of the individual enterprises, the far higher level of mechanisation and the more commercial approach to farming generally as a business.  These people, in spite of computer driven tractors and advanced techniques, look to Grange for advice and help when it comes to the feeding of cattle of all ages and to producing silage for these animals.</P>
    <P>The same holds true for Moorepark, the AFT's dairy research centre.  Only recently I saw a two page article on research into milking machine liners carried out at Moorepark, in one of the foremost dairying publications in Britain. The writer of the article faithfully and almost with reverence quoted the results and opinions of the Moorepark scientists because similar research is not being carried out in Britain.  It has not even occurred to the British to carry out basic research into milking machine liners.  The main body of advanced thinking on this important subject now seems to be centred at Moorepark.</P>
    <P>Headline research such as I have mentioned has been carried out for many years by AFT, giving independent results.  In the Moorepark research centre the scientists involved are dealing with commercial products on which individuals and companies are depending for their livelihoods.  In instances like this it is critical that research is independent and is seen to be independent.  Research cannot afford to be tainted with any hint of something that is not absolutely independent. This is a hallmark of all successful research.  It is a tribute to the independent status of AFT researchers that their findings on the liners and all <Col N="2434" /> their other research is accepted for what it is.</P>
    <P>Many millions of pounds are spent on various aspects of agriculture research in Britain but the bulk of that money is spent by commercial companies with a stake in the results and farmers therefore are purely deprived due to the tied nature of these results.  That is partly why British farmers show such an interest in the research results from Ireland.  They know them to be completely independent.  It would be a pity if there was anything in this Bill that would dilute this independence because it would defeat the whole purpose of research.  I have examined the Bill carefully and I find no grounds for any fears in this regard.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest single visible advance in farming in Ireland in recent years has been the growth in the number of silage pits and silage slabs in all parts of the country.  AFT have been largely responsible for initiating the basic research that has proved beyond all doubt that silage can be made economically and that when fed to cattle gives the optimum weight gain.</P>
    <P>Farmers have been able to save money and indeed the country saves approximately £12 million per annum by having been reassured by the people at Grange that sulphuric acid can be used equally effectively in the preservation of grass as silage instead of the much dearer formic acid which had to be imported.  Some of the sulphuric acid can now be produced locally and most farmers now use it in preference to formic acid.</P>
    <P>In the same area, I note that practical work at Grange now includes research towards the development of a simple instrument that will help the farmer decide how much acid he should apply to grass or silage.  This should not only save the farmer money but it will also have the direct effect of generally raising the standard and quality of silage made here. The farmer will be able to decide with a much greater degree of accuracy the exact quantity of acid his silage needs at any given time rather than having to depend totally on past experience and guesswork.  This instrument is not an <Col N="2435" /> invention of Grange.  There are several of them on the market, but it is a measure of the esteem in which farmers hold Grange research that they will not move <i>en masse</i> towards this idea until Grange gives its imprimatur after a couple of years of research.</P>
    <P>The fact that about 70 per cent of winter feed is saved as silage is a major tribute to the work of ACOT which has done detailed and convincing work on the ground to convince more and more farmers that silage is the only way to get optimum results from cattle.  Their national campaigns in the last few years are a classic example of effective communication to a mass audience.  Radio advertising has been used to the optimum effect in conjunction with thousands of meetings with farmers at parish level all over the country.  Here we saw a national cohesive unit in operation, putting all its resources into the sort of single minded effort it takes to change old habits in what after all is a rather traditional section of our community.  It is a particularly good example of the co-operation that can and will exist under the measures being introduced today.  Even in my own county where farming would be regarded in general as being pretty well advanced, I have noticed the growth in the amount of land being closed off for silage, for the building of second pits, on a great many farms. That is noticeable no matter where you travel around the country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is perhaps in the area of silage making that we have seen how well co-operation between AFT and ACOT has worked.  The institute proved that silage was best and ACOT then carried this message to the farmers.  They complemented each other's work and all that is happening under this Bill is that this arrangement is being formalised so that it can be brought to bear in all areas in the future.  As I have said, it is a matter of common sense.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to ACOT and their educational role.  As a teacher I have taken a particular interest in their work.  The traditional approach in too many farming families, and perhaps in many schools <Col N="2436" /> also, was that the young men destined to inherit the farm did not need any education and the attitude was, why would he need an education when he was going to take over the farm.  It was often with a sense of frustration that I tried to deal with some of these youngsters.  They never bothered to work in school because of the attitude which prevailed at home. If many farmers realised the changes which were going to take place, particularly during the past five to seven years, their attitude would have changed. Thankfully, the attitude has now changed and many of these farmers' sons are leading the way in schools, taking in a wide and extensive range of subjects because they know knowledge will be necessary to handle the great variety of skills they will need as a modern farmer in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a guidance counsellor I am pleased to see how these young men and women are being taken in hand and taught the necessary basics in farming through the Green Cert courses.  From a position of almost total neglect and lack of interest, to which I referred earlier, suddenly formal education is a necessary and basic requirement for the farmer of the future and this is only as it should be.  As has been mentioned by other Deputies in an industry which is so vital to the entire nation, those involved must have a thorough foundation in the education needed to be able to handle all of the intricacies involved in becoming in a professional manner what is effectively a managing director of a medium-sized business.  There are farmers, and I am not referring to the elite few with big estates but fairly ordinary farmers, who have turnovers in excees of £100,000 annually.  In business terms their operations are very large especially when you consider that they are basically owner-operated by a single person.  I do not think many of us in this House would have the courage to undertake such a massive operation without having a back-up service such as the one provided by ACOT.</P>
    <P>Education in agriculture more than in any other section of the community is an ongoing process to such an extent that <Col N="2437" /> the farmers of this generation will not even recognise the techniques used by those of the next generation.  In this context I was pleased to see recently that the IFA, in conjunction with the FBD Trust, have continued their investment in the future of farming in a very concrete manner by renewing their programme of scholarships to our agricultural colleges.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons this Bill is getting a general welcome is because it eliminates the wasteful duplication of effort which can arise through various means in the work of ACOT and AFT. If there is anything we need less of it is the type of bureaucracy which leads to two or more people doing the same essential work.  Is there any need, therefore, for the kind of bureaucracy represented in a document such as the one I have before me, which I think would form a good basis from which to produce a black comedy for stage or television?  It is an IFA document and its sets out the steps which a farmer must take in order to obtain a grant under the farm improvement scheme.  There are 16 steps in all, many of which overlap, and taking into account what I said earlier about not delaying the House I will not quote from it.  Anything which will get rid of this type of bureaucracy is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Speaking of change, I would like to put it on record that I firmly believe that change if it is to be effective can be, and in most cases is, painful.  I believe that in years to come people will look back on 1988, the year ACOT and AFT were amalgamated, as being the year when a Government faced up to the realities of the future of agriculture, took the bull by the horns and did something about a situation which had been talked about for many years.  It will also be looked on as the time when new blood was introduced to our agricultural research services and this can only be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Although, arguably, we have the best agricultural research in Europe, and I hope that that will continue to be the case, it is a bit crazy that some basic back-up services are sometimes not provided. I have heard it said that agricultural institute people are notorious for going <Col N="2438" /> out to borrow even the simplest pieces of equipment, such as a bailer at hay-making time, simply because their own machinery is so old that it is always breaking down.  If you employ a skilled workman, the least that you should do is make sure that he has the working tools.  It also seems crazy that universities, who often duplicate their research being carried out by the Agricultural Institute, are often better equipped and have more money for specific projects than the body with the statutory obligation to do that research work.  I hope steps will be taken to rectify this under the new authority.</P>
    <P>There is one area which I would like to see the new authority get more deeply involved in and that is the area of family farm budgeting.  Greater emphasis has been put lately on financial management in farming.  ACOT have been training specialists in this area mainly because financial management has been a weakness on too many farms.  Indeed, the same could be said about some of our smaller industrial enterprises.  Without getting involved in any controversy as to who was responsible for the rush to borrow or lend money in the seventies, it is clear that many farmers have had to learn the hard way that managing money in these one-person businesses is not an easy matter.  In fact, I notice in an article in the monthly magazine, <i>The Practical Farmer,</i> financial management is described as being the best second enterprise on the farm.</P>
    <P>An integral part of farm finance is the family budget.  I know from speaking to friends of mine in farming, who have invariably drawn up detailed plans for their enterprises, that the family budgeting element is frequently under-estimated by them and they invariably are surprised by the size of the allocation needed in this area.  I know that ACOT have material on this matter but because it is not directly related to husbandry matters it tends to be pushed down the list of priorities in terms of advice.  As experts in their own right farmers, as well as their ACOT advisers, tend to know down to the nearest £10 how much <Col N="2439" /> income can be expected from any enterprise before the variables such as weather, disease and interest rates are taken into account but not as much scientific effort has been put into the human resource side of farming.  More information is needed on this matter so that household expenses and the general cost of running a family as well as a farm can be formally budgeted into plans for any enterprise.  Most of us would agree that we could do with this sort of advice and help at times.  Because of the nature of farming in this country, where agriculture is still, thankfully, dominated by the concept of the family farm, the family consistently get involved in the farm enterprise more so than in other businesses.</P>
    <P>In relation to the make-up of the Authority, I am confident that the Minister will give the nation an indication of his confidence and trust in the new Authority by the calibre of the people he appoints to the board.  Long gone, I hope, are the days when appointments to such boards could be seen as personal rewards for political faithfulness.  The Minister has an opportunity, and I have no doubt that he will rise to it, of confirming the conviction that this is so.  Dare I suggest that there are several dozen people among those who have taken advantage of the redundancy package, which was referred to earlier by Deputy Yates, both in ACOT and AFT, who could and should be considered for membership of the new Authority? I do not mean that as a kind of sop to the way we were, a gesture or a tacit acknowledgement that maybe the old ways were best but we should draw on the best resources and the best people that we have, the people with the experience of showing others what to do, the people who will have the difficult task of carrying out the functions of the new board on a day to day basis.  There are also many eminent scientists and people with practical vision who have decided for their own reasons to take advantage of redundancy and redeployment and to leave the public service.  These people should not and will not be lost to Irish <Col N="2440" /> farming because many of them are taking up positions in private commercial companies involved in the agricultural industry or even setting up as private consultants to farmers or in the agri-business. These people should be considered for membership of the board.</P>
    <P>By the same token I hope the Minister will agree with me when I put forward the idea that local involvement through our local public representatives is important, not necessarily on the board of the Authority which is limited, as it should be, but through a committee or committees as set out in section 17 of the Bill. Without such a provision local representatives will be denied, for the first time in the history of the State, direct involvement in our largest industry, due to the abolition of the committees of agriculture. No longer have our local representatives got a forum where they can bring to public attention agricultural matters raised by the people they represent. I would have to agree and re-emphasise what has been said here by a variety of speakers, that the effectiveness of the committees of agriculture was blunted almost completely over the past five years through a purposeful determination to starve them of funds.  I am concerned that the views of many will not now be heard. The Minister has an opportunity, under section 17 of the Bill, of going some way towards rectifying this situation.</P>
    <P>Granted, it can be argued that local views will get a hearing in the new authority through the Irish Farmers Association and through the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  However, both of these organisations are special interest groups and do not necessarily reflect the views of all farmers.  They certainly do not reflect the views of the substantial number of non-farming people who make up our rural communities. Local councillors, by definition, are in constant touch with the people and the potential of their capabilities needs to be recognised formally through representation on at least one of the proposed committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> This ties in very much with the Minister's plans to have a comprehensive programme of integrated rural development and I am glad to see that he has broadened the definition of agriculture in the Bill to include rural development.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends bringing plans for this programme before the House at an early date, and I would urge that he give strong consideration to making this programme a community-based one.  Let us take this opportunity of getting away from the empire building that has been the curse of many well-meant and, indeed, inspired moves in the past, to enable us to pull ourselves up to the boot-straps.  These empires have been built on sand because the vital element, that is the people, have been ignored.  People involved with each other and working together in their own communities are the people who accomplish anything worthwhile in this country, with the physical help and encouragement of a strong Government.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of Canon Hayes, it is the local community groups who know where the sandy soil is.  It is the local community groups who will succeed, where others have failed in providing employment, be it through conventional agriculture or through rural development in other spheres.  Here I am thinking of small industry development, tourism and agri-tourism, forestry, the formation of small local co-operatives.  The potential is endless if we supply the leadership that can make people once more believe in themselves and their own abilities.</P>
    <P>Encouragement and leadership are needed, just as much as funds are if our vision of the future, as represented by the steps outlined in this Bill, are to be realised.  While on the subject of funds, it is somewhat disappointing that the main thrust of the speeches in this debate, from critics of the Bill, seems to be in relation to funds.  All we hear is money, more money and yet more money.  The Minister has given an assurance that the new Authority will not lack for funds.  Need I remind Deputies that plentiful funds have not solved the vexed question of bovine tuberculosis and never will.  What is <Col N="2442" /> needed there is an integrated plan with a clear direction where the scheme is going. I am glad to see that this has now been provided by the Minister, to the clear satisfaction of all parties involved, the farmers, the vets and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the same way, this clear direction is now being given in respect of agricultural research and education.  Exciting times are ahead of us all.  There is no doubt about it, in facing up to the new reality we have to have all our wits about us. Farming worldwide is beset with uncertainty. Alternative enterprises are being introduced at a very fast rate and although land use in Ireland will continue to be dominated by the conventional enterprises, areas devoted to other activities will increase and this must be done in a planned manner in line, with technical, financial and marketing realities.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I thoroughly agree with Dr. Pierce Ryan, the Director of An Foras Talúntais, who has said that we are in an era of radical change in the agricultural industry.  Writing in the February 1987 issue of <i>Farm and Food Research</i> he says:</P>
    <P>Change always bring uncertainty and a demand for sound information on which to base decisions about the future.  Many farmers and food processors are now being faced with these decisions, as a period of rapid development in conventional farm enterprises comes to an end.  People are asking: Where do we go from here?  What does this new situation demand?  What are the opportunities for the future?</P>
    <P>Research produces soundly based information on which reliable decisions can be based, it develops new techniques and processes, it highlights probable future trends &mdash; in short, its products are the basic facts, figures, know-how and informed views which are the essential ingredients of progress. It has served agriculture and the food industry well in the expansion phase.  Now, more than ever, it has a key role to play in changing the direction of these vital industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2443" /> I believe that this Bill will go a long way towards doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am delighted to have this opportunity of speaking on this Bill and in particular on the proposed merger between ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  If I ever heard a veiled criticism of what one's own Minister is doing I have certainly heard it from Deputy Dempsey.  Of all the things Deputy Dempsey, or the agricultural community, would aspire to, they are unlikely to get it with a 42 per cent cut in expenditure provided for the various agencies, that is if the Government believe those agencies have any role to play in the future.</P>
      <P>This merger has exercised the minds of politicians, agriculturalists and farmers for many years.  The House is aware of the general consensus of opinion that was around ten years ago.  At that time a former Minister for Agriculture, Mark Clinton, put through the House a Bill to amalgamate research, education and the advisory services.  Everybody welcomed it.  Everybody thought that was the way we should go &mdash; everybody except Fianna Fáil and even to this day, nobody can understand why the then Minister Gibbons decided not to go through with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have a rehash of that legislation. I want to go on record as saying that I welcome the principle involved because I have always believed we should have that tie up to ensure that farmers benefit from the best new techniques and technology which can be brought to them by the people they have come to trust down the years, the advisory service, who understand all the problems facing the farming community.  As I said, I never knew why Fianna Fáil abolished that Bill but Minister Gibbons got a lot of blame, although I understood it was a full Cabinet decision.  In keeping with all the magnificent U-turns this Government have made over the last 12 months, we have this new Bill which is presented as the ultimate in the areas of advice, research and education.  We are told there is nothing more useful or important for the <Col N="2444" /> future of Irish agriculture than this legislation.</P>
    <P>Because of this merger £20 million is literally being taken out of Irish agriculture because of staff reductions.  Let the House be in no doubt about what is happening.  The research, advisory and educational legs of our farming industry are being paralysed and it appears that all attempts at physiotherapy are being denied to the patient.  I acknowledge that the national debt must be tackled.  My party stood, won and lost at various times on this issue, but we are consistent in our efforts to control the spiral of national borrowing for day-to-day spending.  This approach means that whatever Government are in power, we must have better utilisation of our resources.  That goes without saying.</P>
    <P>I charge this Government with serious neglect and ineptitude in regard to this Bill.  How can a national organisation whose two predecessors consistently pleaded shortage of resources to carry out their mandate now be expected to operate with their budget cut by 40 per cent while still having responsibilities remarkably similar in content to their predecessors? I cannot see how those sums add up.  I remember a Bill coming through the House a few years ago giving ACOT authority to charge a fee for their advice under certain conditions.  There was absolute uproar from Fianna Fáil who were on this side of the House, with Deputy after Deputy denouncing the Bill as scandalous, irresponsible and, above all, a slap in the face for rural Ireland. Every county committee of agriculture denounced the move a treachery and volumes were written to have the decision rescinded.</P>
    <P>This Government decided to decimate the entire body of advisory work, research and education in agriculture and I have no doubt that very little thought was given to any rational cutbacks taking place in the Department of Agriculture <i>vis-à-vis</i> ACOT and An Foras Talúntais, or maybe the Government were more devious than I suspected and a lot of thought went into this.  My views on this subject are reinforced by the Minister's <Col N="2445" /> decision not to make public the results of the so-called staff audit into all aspects of manning levels in the Department.  How can one rationally explain a reduction of 40 per cent in AFT and ACOT and argue that the Department needed all their staff where they had them, even the 100 former Land Commission inspectors &mdash; who were given something to do recently after sitting around for 12 months at a cost to the taxpayer of £1 million to £1.5 million?  I cannot understand why all these things have been let drift while at the same time we are led to believe there can be no change in the manning levels in the Department but that the ACOT and AFT budgets can be cut by almost 50 per cent.  I believe the cuts were agreed in a hurry to placate the Department of Finance and that no thought was given to what was going to happen, not alone this year but in 20 years time.</P>
    <P>I notice there is a serious ill-informed notion circulating in rural Ireland that because of the quota restrictions on many farming enterprises there is no need for professional agricultural advice or research into matters related to production agriculture.  This is very short-sighted and extremely dangerous.  We will be forever primary exporters of dairy products, beef and sheep meat.  Let us remember that even our products under quota restrictions must be of a standard to sit side by side on supermarket shelves anywhere in the world against all competitors. There will be changes in production methods to reduce input costs, to increase rates of prolificacy in cows and ewes and to produce a product that is market orientated and can be sold against competitors anywhere.  It is against that background that we view the remarkable curtailment in activity in research and advisory sections.</P>
    <P>Let us come to a more basic assessment. How many people need help in the agricultural area?  Leading economists tell us we are likely to have approximately 25,000 to 30,000 of what I describe as &ldquo;self-propelled farmers&rdquo; in ten years time.  If we were to confine ourselves to the demands of these 30,000 farmers, we would need to have a very efficient highly <Col N="2446" /> motivated advisory service with great linkage to modern research technology and even then this group will be at severe risk with the proposals we have before us.  Granted an argument can be made that advice and research should be partially paid for by this group, and that is what my Government tried to do a couple of years ago, but because of the small size of the group, the cost to each farmer could be prohibitive and this, in turn, could do untold harm to a section which has great potential to produce both quality and quantity quickly.  That is the great selling factor the top 20 per cent to 25 per cent of our farmers have.  If the advisory service cannot supply the agricultural advice at a competitive price, private agricultural consultancy firms will blossom and they will prosper with the same enthusiasm and vigour as accountancy firms have done recently.  The question must be asked, &ldquo;Is that good for Irish agriculture&rdquo;?  In my view it represents a retrograde step because the farmer with money will develop but the developing farmer will be unable to compete.  There is a parallel for this in our health services. A two-tier system of agricultural advice will be disastrous.  Private consultancy firms will attract the more active graduates from the service and that will cause more trouble for the existing service.</P>
    <P>Even with maximum financial support for the farmer in the £30,000 bracket, I cannot see the new organisation having the personnel or the financial resources to meet the needs of this group.  Most farmers understand what I am getting at. However, we have another 125,000 farming families and I should like to know where they come in.  The outlook for them is bleak and very depressing.  Many of them want specialised advice and back-up research but I wonder if they will get it.  In my view they will not and for one simple reason, they will be unable to pay for it.  That is the bottom line as far as the Bill is concerned.  Farmers who are able to pay for advice and research have some hope but those who cannot are at the wrong game.</P>
    <P>I can see vast areas of the country <Col N="2447" /> getting no more than token advisory cover, a resemblance of the parish agent concept of the thirties and forties.  We still have many small farmers who need a lot of persuasion to convince them that changes are necessary for themselves and the country.  All available evidence shows that irrespective of the methodology used to dispense agricultural advice &mdash; I am referring to group participation and producer groups &mdash; there is and always will be great need for personal contact between the agricultural adviser and the farmer and his wife.  Despite all the modern advances in communication by television, radio and newspapers, that special relationship and bond that developed between the farmer and the adviser, particularly on matters relating to management and finance, is as important today as it was 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Bill, with its implications for staffing, heralds the beginning of the end for this most fruitful type of advisory work.  I should like to warn the House that an area from Clare to Donegal will be decimated by the provisions of the Bill.  Some Deputies may heave a sigh of relief and, indeed, it is obvious that the Minister has little understanding or time for the position of small farmers.  We accept that many small farmers will have to leave the land and that is nothing new in Ireland.  However, what makes a mockery of these proposals is the decision to withdraw the advisory service on matters related to alternative farming trends. I am referring to the other ways that farming families, particularly those living on small holdings, have of earning additional income for themselves in years to come.</P>
    <P>The population voted overwhelmingly for the Single European Act and, as a result, we will qualify for a doubling in real terms of regional and structural funds by 1992.  However, the people we would expect to be showing leadership and ensuring that we have the type of programmes that Brussels will accept will be gone by 1992.  In fact, many of them have left the service.  It is obvious that if the rural integrated programmes are to mean <Col N="2448" /> anything they must incorporate the farming community as a principal participant. Irrespective of what plans are conceived and presented to the EC for funding, their success or failure will depend on the calibre and motivation of the people concerned.  I would have thought that the advisory service would be to the fore in this development.  Indeed, it is my belief that members of the advisory service should be the natural co-ordinators in any integrated programme.  I am critical of the fact that the advisory services did not involve themselves more in other lines of activity such as farm guesthouse promotion, tourism, forestry and other aspects of community life that could lead to an increased income for small farmers. I accept that the advisory service commenced a number of pilot schemes that have proved successful but we will not have the personnel on the ground to continue them.</P>
    <P>If the financial arrangements are not changed I do not think we will have a major research station in the west of Ireland.  I see a cloud hanging over the Belclare station.  Those who know anything about farm research will accept that that station has played a vital role in many aspects of western agriculture.  We regard the Belclare station as the flagship of the west.  However, the staff at that station see the writing on the wall.  The demonstration farms at Creagh, Blindwell and Ballinamore have a cloud hanging over them.  I recall that when the institute decided some years ago to close the sheep demonstration farm at Maam Cross, Connemara, there was uproar in the House.  Fianna Fáil Members described it as the greatest disaster to hit Irish farming. On that occasion Ministers of State, Deputies Treacy, Geoghegan-Quinn and Fahey in a chorus said that the Government responsible for that decision should be kicked out of office immediately.  I wonder what they will say when seven or eight of the stations under their noses are closed.  It will be difficult to explain to the electorate in Galway what went wrong this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer the Minister is in charge the worse it will be for Irish farming.  The Bill provides for the abolition of county committees of agriculture.  As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture I had occasion to attend meetings of most of the county committees in the past four years.  I have my own views on the role they should play.  I accept that before we permitted farming organisations to participate they did not have that much to offer but they have proved to be a useful forum for voicing opinions in the counties.  I hope it will not be the case of there being a prospect of advisory groups in each county but that there will be such groups.  I hope the Bill is amended accordingly.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on all of us to bring together those who have to make a living from farming and get them to present their views in a formal way.  We should provide a forum for discussion on agricultural topics in each county.  That is the least we can expect from the Minister.  If he does not do that he is, in effect, saying there is not room or time for the people who have to make a living from farming. The Minister's decision amounts to no more than an insult to the farmers.  In my view they would seek the minimum of compensation if asked to give the benefit of their experiences to others.  A great case can be made for the introduction of such a forum in each county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard on the rounds recently that the Minister has suggested, for some reasons best known to himself, that Fine Gael are responsible for the delay in the passing of this Bill.  I should like to point out that there has been at least six months of messing in the Department or in the office of the parliamentary draftsman. The delay did not have anything to do with Fine Gael.  In fact, in the past we expressed a willingness to sit on Fridays, if necessary, to deal with this legislation. There is pressure on the Minister from the farming organisations about the delay.  There is a more devious reason for <Col N="2450" /> the delay.  I was told six months ago by people in the system that we were unlikely to see the Bill passed until almost the last day before the summer recess. That appears to be the case today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wants to make sure that he will have the system in place by 1989 when he hopes to get money from somewhere.  He should not try to be codding the farmers because they will not take it.  We have now arrived at the stage where we will be looking for a few million pounds from the national lottery to keep our advisory service going.  The Minister knows that the best people in the two organisations have taken voluntary redundancy and the remaining staff are depressed and demoralised.  The Minister merely wants to ensure that the numbers have decreased to meet his budget targets. That is a mean approach to people who have given a wonderful service.</P>
      <P>Of course, everybody knows that the best brains have gone but I appeal to the Minister to ask the Minister for Finance for financial support so that we will have the best people in the right place to run this organisation, even though it is run down.  Anything less is an insult to agriculture. The Minister should also ensure that agricultural advice and research is available to people who cannot pay for them.  There are exciting times ahead as far as integrated pilot areas are concerned but the only people who understand those in rural areas are those who have been involved in the advisory service. Please do not get rid of the good ones before the system is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The importance of agriculture to Ireland has been well aired in this House and at other fora.  When we joined the EC it was on the basis of the benefits that a common market would bring to the improvement of our agricultural industry as well as the overall <Col N="2451" /> benefits to the economy and the population in general.</P>
      <P>The size of the new market for agricultural produce was one of the areas continually promoted by those seeking acceptance of our entry terms to the EC. Since our entry, little has changed in so far as the importance of the EC market to Ireland is concerned and the importance of agriculture to our country.  The proportion of total exports represented by agriculture and food exports at 27.6 per cent is the highest in the European Community.  Our external trade is 62 per cent as a percentage of GNP which represents one of the highest in Europe.</P>
      <P>If our agricultural development is to continue to prosper, it is vital that this country meets the changes in a constructive and developmental way.  I welcome the Government's decision to amalgamate An Foras Talúntais and ACOT and to transfer the existing functions of the two bodies to a new, single authority with responsibility for agriculture advisory services, training, education and research services.  It is important to every sector of industry to periodically step back from and examine the systems and bodies in place which service that particular industry.  Agriculture should be no exception.</P>
      <P>The new body should be reviewed after about eight to ten years to see what changes or improvements might be made.  The new Authority will have a very daunting task in co-ordinating all aspects of training, research and advice to the agricultural industry.  In the current climate, with funding for every sector of industry being carefully monitored, it is particularly important that the Minister gets every aspect of the new Authority correct from the very start.  The professional services provided by the new Authority will have the unique responsibility of enhancing Ireland's reputation as an agricultural country with an agricultural industry which has been brought into the 20th century.  This is no easy task and I wish the new Authority every success in the work ahead of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer of the eighties and nineties <Col N="2452" /> has to be much more than the image of the farmer in the past.  He must be a successful manager, an enterpreneur and be in a position to compete successfully with the best competition from our neighbours in the EC.  The farmer of the future must have an absolute knowledge of his industry, be a specialist in the product he is producing and be knowledgeable in the marketing of his produce in so far as he can avail of the best use of his product.</P>
    <P>The Government have a mandate to make the best possible use of scarce resources and, in doing so, they are to be commended for their efforts since taking office last year.  They have set out the priorities required for agriculture by introducing this Bill.  The future needs of agriculture have been identified and this Bill is tangible evidence that they are concerned and doing something about the future needs of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to set in place a strong, organisational structure where the effective delivery of support service is vital to the successful development of agriculture and the food industry. This is being done by combining the considerable resources of the existing organisations and using them in the best way possible to effect a powerful aid to the agricultural industry.  The rapidly changing agricultural development brings new opportunities every year to our farmers and it is important that we have the back-up structures in place to ensure that farmers avail of the opportunities which the changing developments might bring.</P>
    <P>In deciding to bring together An Foras Taluntais and ACOT, it is important that we commend both these bodies for their excellent service to farmers and the invaluable contribution made by both organisations over the past number of years.  The development of agriculture and the economy as a whole owes a lot to the work carried out by the dedicated employees of these two bodies.  An Foras Talúntais have earned an international reputation for the excellence of the research work they carried out in a number of stations around the country. The improvement in the production and quality of our primary farm products, <Col N="2453" /> such as dairying, crop husbandry, horticulture and pig production over the past few years has been dramatic.  ACOT have been to the forefront in bringing young farmers, in particular, through their certification in farming courses, up to date with the most modern farm practices.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to a specific area of the new Bill, the importance of providing and identifying proper centres for the new body.  I should also like to stress the importance of tillage in the agricultural industry.  It is well known that, over the last few years, with decreasing markets for some of our farm produce tillage has also suffered.  While only about 10 per cent of our arable acreage is in tillage, the lowest in any Community country, tillage is a very important component in the Irish economy.  The area of all our cereal crops is approximately 400,000 hectares and the area of all our root crops is about 100,000 hectares.  Because of the declining profitability of tillage in the past three years, mainly because of EC policies, there has been a further reduction in the area but it is highly desirable to hold our tillage acreage at something in the region of 500,000 hectares to have a viable tillage sector.</P>
    <P>The value of tillage crops to the economy in 1985, the last year for which we have returns, is something in the order of £213 million, a significant amount.  With increasing mechanisation and specialisation, tillage has become more concentrated in the south eastern counties. When you look at the soil suitability maps prepared by An Foras Talúntais, there are good reasons for this movement, the south east being the area where most of it is carried out.  The employment arising from the handling and processing of our tillage crops is also highly significant.  Proportionate to their total value tillage crops give high downstream employment and this Government have identified this as growth area where more jobs can be created.  The appointment of a Minister with special responsibility for horticulture is evidence of the seriousness with which the Government regard that area.</P>
    <P>In servicing the research and advisory <Col N="2454" /> needs of the tillage farmer, the Oak Park Centre in Carlow is ideally located.  Considerable scientific and technical assessment went into the selection of Oak Park in 1961 as the national tillage research centre for the country.  The soils of Oak Park are very typical of a large proportion of the good tillage soils of the south-east. No other institute or ACOT centre can make the same claim.  In Oak Park are two main types of soil, one a light textured, gravelly soil derived from limestone gravels typical of the light soils of the Barrow Valley and parts of Kilkenny, Laois, Kildare and Offaly.  The second is a heavy textured soil derived from boulder clay, typical of the good heavy tillage soils of Meath, Kildare, Laois and Carlow.  The selection of Oak Park for the 1988 ploughing championships in October was no accident.  It is a first-class tillage centre.</P>
    <P>In the context of a tillage research, a good example is Oak Park's contribution to the introduction of winter barley in the south-east.  There was no commercial winter barley in Ireland before 1975.  A ten-year research programme mounted in 1977 and completed in 1987 with the publication of a production manual set the headline for advisers and producers in assessing the potential of winter barley for particular soil types and tillage systems. Adopting the recommendations as a result of this ten-year programme is now putting an additional £7 million annually into growers' pockets based on a winter barley area of about 32,000 hectares. Oak Park are now initiating a new programme on malting barley because of the new opportunities for exporting quality malting barley to the Continent. They back the husbandry programmes of all cereals with the most up-to-date laboratory and engineering support. Currently they can identify the variety of cereals for specific markets with absolute certainty on single grains and they can detect the presence of unwanted varieties to an accuracy of 0.1 of 1 per cent.  This is the kind of back-up farmers will need if they are entering an international marketplace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2455" /> The people in Oak Park are to be commended on their speciality in this area. They are at present demonstrating how cereals can be upgraded qualitywise to specific physical measurements and density. The marketplace will demand quality and Oak Park can demonstrate how growers can compete.  For successful cereal production you must have first-class crop protection back-up programmes ready to advise on the most efficient and economical chemicals and techniques to meet any threat to the crop. The back-up given by Oak Park experts over the past two decades is acknowledged by advisers, growers and chemical companies alike as being first-class.</P>
    <P>If you look at the changed scene for sugar beet you will see the effect of the combination of the skills of the sugar company with the science of An Foras Talúntais.  AFT breeders with the financial support of the sugar company gave mono germ beet seed the best quality seed ever produced.  The pathologists prescribed seed dressings for the pelleted seeds to protect it when sown to a stand.</P>
    <P>On the potato front Oak Park have found a new export variety, Cara, and this is to be commended to the experts who are dealing with the potato crops in Oak Park.  They have a new variety for the home trade, Glenroe, which in time will take over from Kerr's Pinks.  They believe there are considerable opportunities to expand seed potato exports from the intensive tillage areas without in any way reducing the production of high class, elite seed in Donegal.  They will have to have the most up-to-date information for growers who want to move into seed potato production with new varieties.  They have started a cooperative programme with their colleagues in ACOT and the Department of Agriculture and Food on the seed potato potential for the south-east tillage soils, and the new information will be passed to growers in due course.</P>
    <P>Many people will be aware of the significant contribution Oak Park has made in the area of agricultural engineering. The machinery input into tillage farming <Col N="2456" /> is very expensive and research information from other countries is of a limited value unless adapted to our own needs.  Machinery costing for the different tillage operations has received special study and the findings in Oak Park have always been published.  Irish agriculture is especially vulnerable to the vagaries of international energy markets.  We are 60 per cent dependent on imported fuels. Oak Park has an intensive EC-supported programme examining the importance of forest biomass as an energy source for both industrial and domestic purposes. We have an environment which is ideal for the growing of conventional forest trees or short rotation species and we should be able to provide a low priced biomass fuel as an energy source.  The energy research programme in Oak Park is linked to an international research programme examining the utilisation of biomass products such as straw and forestry for energy purposes.</P>
    <P>I am merely outlining these points because I feel it is important that the Oak Park Institute, because of their geographical location, the work carried out there over a number of years and because of the expertise they have acquired, should be identified as the new tillage and dissemination centre for the country. They should be joined by the specialist colleagues they have in the new organisation to provide a fully integrated service to growers, processors, and consumers.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts the need for cuts in the cost of the public service, but we should not lose sight of the expertise that has been built up over the years.  It would be regrettable to everybody concerned if we were to lose any of it.  In a research study of expenditure on agricultural research and extension services in 104 countries including Ireland, it has been shown that Ireland has fallen behind most other countries of northern Europe when investment as a percentage of agricultural output is taken as a base.  The new body being set up should be a step forward and some people who have been criticising the Government and the Minister in particular for the delay in pushing this Bill <Col N="2457" /> through the House should take account of what is being done.  It is the biggest shake-up in the agricultural industry in a number of years.  The Minister and the Government need everybody's support in this.  It is a move in the right direction, and I ask that they do not lose sight of what we have built up over a number of years with this expertise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage in a protracted debate a person in my position is picking up the crumbs from the rich man's table.  It is very difficult towards the conclusion of a debate where the issues have been thoroughly analysed to say something new which is of significance to the Bill.  I will confine my remarks to the contents of the Bill and its relevance to agriculture in the west.</P>
      <P>For years we were led to believe through text books in schools and so on that agriculture was our primary source of income.  Irrespective of upward and downward movements in the graph relating to segmental developments in the economy, there is no doubt that agriculture will always have a pivotal role. Agriculture in its full sense has suffered a decline in terms of employment content but, on the other hand, there have been multifaceted developments in diversification and downstream products in the food industry.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food for the manner he has undertaken his task in relation to the development of the food sector and added-value products.  I have heard him speak in the Seanad over a number of years and I know his expertise on a professional level.  He has the determination to tackle with vigour the development of this sector which hitherto has not received the necessary thrust to generate its full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate to have been blessed with the indigenous source of wealth in our land.  Even before the scientific development of agriculture we managed by using traditional methods to outstrip our competitors.  Very much part and parcel of the new dynamism in agriculture has been the success story of the <Col N="2458" /> advisory service.  A certain amount of scepticism and cynicism greeted this service in the early days.  Agriculture had been extremely conservative and old traditions die hard.  Old practices had worked for centuries and the average farmer could see no valid reason for welcoming into his farmyard a person who might be seen as an interloper, an official spy, a person who carried about him an aura of officialdom.  The farmer traditionally knew what was best for his holding.  It is a remarkable tribute to the advisory service and to the tact and diplomacy of the instructors that they managed over the years to build up from that very small beginning a reputation which totally obliterated the seeds of doubt and established a remarkably warm and personal instructor/farmer relationship which has been central to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Having been advised by successive administrations and successive teams of instructors to diversify, to go into milk production, to invest in slatted houses and to borrow money, which is totally alien to the very nature of Irish farmers, they suddenly find that there are mountains, lakes and gluts in the market and they are being induced to close down particular enterprises.  They are being told to go in an opposite direction and leave obsolete the equipment they bought some years ago.  It is a daunting prospect for farmers.  Quotas are now being imposed on the areas of development which until some years ago were vital to the growth of agriculture.  Is it any wonder that farmers are bewildered and perplexed and do not know exactly where they are going?</P>
    <P>It is at this crossroads that we see the introduction of a new measure designed to merge two of the key nut and bolt areas in the agricultural sector, the advisory service and the research service.  This side of the House has given an open and profuse welcome to the merger.  Everybody accepts that rationalisation must take place and it is generally agreed that both services should be under the one management structure.  It is generally <Col N="2459" /> assumed that if one is to launch something new, bring about an amalgamation, engender goodwill from the start and give the necessary propulsion to launch it with a dynamic forward thrust, then one must provide the necessary fuel for the tank to make sure the rocket takes off and does not crash land before it gets into orbit.</P>
    <P>Not alone are we not providing the necessary priming finance for this merger but we are cutting back drastically on the amount of finance provided for the two organisations.  In 1987 ACOT and AFT jointly had a budget of £35 million but this year the budget is £20 million.  One cannot slice £15 million from the budget of any organisation without devastating and horrendous consequences.  While it is generally acknowledged that the cuts are inevitable, surely when a new child is being baptised it is not the time to take the christening money from the child's hand.  That is what is happening in this case.  Is it any wonder there is bewilderment, bafflement and demoralisation among all sectors in regard to this measure? If oxygen is not provided for the child it will not survive, particularly in the initial stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a false assumption initially.  The joint organisations had a staff of 2,100 and he assumed there would be an enormous influx of applications for redundancy.  My information is that only 460 applications for redundancy have been received, 300 short of the anticipated number.  We accept that the public service across the board is overstaffed and there is need for pruning.  For a number of years one of the silliest methods of generating the impression that jobs were being created was to overburden the Civil Service with staff and officials.  Surely the area which should not be cut is that where there are experts used to working in the field, particularly when a new organisation is being brought into being which is to play a vital role in the development of Irish agriculture in the next decade and beyond.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays heavy but well merited emphasis on research.  There has been a phenomenal growth in Irish agriculture <Col N="2460" /> from 1916 to 1980.  Next to the Dutch, Irish agriculture has seen the greatest level of growth within the European Community, and we are in a very tough club; we are a member of the Northern European community of countries. During that time the enormous strides and higher productivity levels were brought about by improved land, improved stock, improved farm buildings, the updating of equipment and the application of scientific knowledge in relation to manuring and fertilisation of land etc.  If we are to survive in this very tough competitive club, if we are to exploit the niches already referred to in this House this morning by Deputy Yates, we have to be vigilant and alert, we have to be ahead of the posse in relation to research.  We have to stop the gaps in the market which are not many but present us with opportunities, particularly in relation to the development of sheep which was referred to by my colleague the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Austin Deasy.  Sheep and horticulture are the areas of exploitation for the future.</P>
    <P>We are part of the Northern European Community, but we will not maintain our paramount positions in that league unless we devote greater resources to research and unless we can compete on two fronts, quality and price.  In relation to the achievement of both of those, research is of paramount importance.  It is strange that while in terms of productivity we have managed, over the past 20 years to put ourselves in the top league in Europe we are now, in terms of research, spending half of what the average European country devotes to research and agriculture, and that is a sad indictment on our foresight and priorities.  We must change that.</P>
    <P>In fairness to AFT they have done a thoroughly professional job.  Every experiment controlled by AFT is quality controlled.  Its integrity is absolutely assured.  The results of their research are never published until it has been independently vetted and proven to be valid. Thanks to the research carried out by <Col N="2461" /> AFT we have now managed the development of value-added products with a greater emphasis on food research and 900 firms are playing a vital role in relation to harnessing within this country the agricultural potential which was, in the past, exported overseas on the hoof.</P>
    <P>Acknowledging the fact that AFT have played a central role in relation to food research in particular, we ask, how many food technologists are in AFT?  What is the present state of play and what does the Minister envisage it will be under the newly defined structure?</P>
    <P>It has been said by people on both sides of the House that the membership and structure of the board have given cause for some anxiety.  I fail to see why the Minister cannot delegate directly to the various interested bodies, why he cannot ask them to nominate the members they want on this board.  There are five places and while Deputy Dempsey voiced the forlorn aspiration that these people should be people of high technical skill with an in-depth professional knowledge of the minutiae of the agricultural scene, I am afraid, the nature of politics being as it is, we will see appointed to this board people who are probably well intentioned but who are, at the end of the day, ministerial lackeys.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the Order Paper for today carries on it a reference to the Worker Participation Bill which is going through the Seanad now.  We espouse the Vredeling Directive in relation to worker participation.  If we are paying such tribute to workers in theory as a result of EC Directives why not practically apply those directives in regard to this measure here by allowing the various interested professional sectors to direct or second on to the board their nominees rather than having a need for the ministerial imprimatur to be applied to them.</P>
    <P>The area of pollution has been alluded to but despite the Minister's verbosity nothing practical has been done by way of providing grants for farmers, and this area will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency because if the penalties begin to bite there will be a furore that will make the angling row seem like a storm <Col N="2462" /> in a tea cup by comparison.  We are on the brink of that now.</P>
    <P>Approximately four weeks ago the Government ministerial jet touched down at Horan International Airport with seven Ministers, between Ministers and Ministers of State.  Sitting in the front seat beside the pilot was the Minister for Agriculture accompanied by the Minister Deputy Flynn, Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and Minister of State Deputy Smith, etc.  There was a hastily convened press conference in Michael Davitt House in Castlebar.  The great western package had arrived &mdash; £133 million over three years for the west.  Unfortunately it seems to have been a hastily arranged conference because, for some reason or other, the cameras were not there.  Reading the text afterwards and the hastily issued scripts I got the impression that what happened was that MEP, Mr. Killilea would have liked to give the impression to everybody that he, single handedly piloted the measure through the European Community, and that there was a last minute attempt to snatch the laurels back from the good Deputy from Galway East.</P>
    <P>Since then it has emerged, as a result of a series of meetings held throughout the length and breadth of the Connaught-Ulster constituency, that, despite the fact that the £133 million is there, if and when it comes in it will save the national Exchequer £43 million and that we would actually be cutting back on the input by the national Exchequer because of the 70:30 funding ratio.  It has also emerged that the various submissions in relation to developmental areas have not even gone to the Commission yet.  Therefore what we saw in fact was the delivery of a premature baby. Three years is not a very long time in any span of life.</P>
    <P>The weeks are ticking by.  The Commission is still waiting for the proposals, the farmers in the west are still waiting and we still do not know where we are going.  People are beginning to ask if the <i>Farmers Journal</i> article of a number of weeks ago which said that there would be massive grants for the development <Col N="2463" /> of farm houses, for the development of granny flats to encourage farmers to hand over their holdings and to move out to an adjacent dwelling is true.  We honestly do not know whether or not it is true.  We do not even know the direction in which to signpost those people.  But if and when this measure comes in I would say that central to its success will be the agricultural advisory service.  How can we adequately support the schemes if we are not going to man them on the ground with the agricultural advisers.  What we have seen in the past period of time is a shedding of staff, an inducement to staff to leave and, on the whole, a scaling down of the level of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; has become one of the most abused in the modern political vocabulary.  Everything is to be integrated now.  In the Minister for Finance's budget speech we heard a reference to an integrated plan for Dublin and to another integrated plan for the west.  Again we are still waiting for the final details as to whether or not this plan will go ahead, if it is going to emerge as a result of a feasibility study.  If we are going to have an integrated plan we must work on the assumption that it will have a whole series of balanced components.  We are still waiting for the final details as to whether this plan can go ahead.  Will it emerge as a result of a feasibility study, etc?  We are working on the assumption that there will be a whole series of balanced components where there will be emphasis on tourism, fishing and agriculture and, the new one, agri-tourism.  If we are to give practical expression to agri-tourism who are the people on the ground who will advise in relation to this aspect of development in the west?  We all agree that there are exciting and challenging times ahead but if we do not have the staff on the ground to advise, those challenges and those opportunities will be lost.  I would make a special plea once again.  It is not a case of everybody looking after their own constituency because the institute for which I am now advocating, funds or additional funds or, indeed retention, is <Col N="2464" /> not in my constituency or in Deputy Kenny's constituency but by the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Creagh has played a very central and pivotal role in relation to the development of agriculture in the west, particularly since the closure of Maam.  In two areas it has been one of the flag bearers, or the pioneers, that is, in relation to upland and lowland sheep development and in regard to the consequences of pollution and drainage.  If we are to have this western package and an integrated programme for the west it is obvious that we will retain geographically and, in terms of the facilities which it provides, an institute like Creagh.  I urge and exhort the Minister that whatever body emerges from this Bill, he make a ministerial directive &mdash; and this is a matter of political decision &mdash; that Creagh be retained at all costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey in his longwinded contribution mentioned that there was a need to bring in this measure because there was duplication.  I have not heard of one single instance of duplication between An Foras Talúntais and the agricultural advisory service.  They have been until now two mutually exclusive areas. It is obvious that there is a link or a continuity between the two and that the advisory service is the conduit to ferry the information from the research wing to the farmers.  The Deputy also mentioned that change is painful.  Change is never painful provided it is brought about with the necessary sensitivity but in this case <Col N="2465" /> that has not happened.  It is being brought in, accompanied by the subtlety of somebody wielding a chainsaw.</P>
    <P>This chainsaw has been wielded particularly in relation to the decision by the Minister to terminate the county committees of agriculture.  Everybody accepts that county committees of agriculture had, to some degree, a certain amount of deficiency in relation to the manner in which they operated but there was absolutely no need to abolish them. They comprised a considerable cross section and fund of experience and could have been re-jigged without annihilating them and throwing in some softer measure as is contained in this Bill.  So far as I am aware section 17 of the Bill makes reference to the possible substitution of the committees of agriculture by some other committees.</P>
    <P>What I notice about the wording in the Bill is that it says that Teagasc may establish committees to assist and advise it in relation to the performance of its functions, that a committee may include persons who are not members of Teagasc, that Teagasc may appoint a person to be chairman of a committee established under this section and that there may be paid out of the income of Teagasc to members of a committee established under this section such allowances or expenses incurred by them as Teagasc may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, determine.  There are five &ldquo;mays&rdquo; where there should be five &ldquo;shalls&rdquo;.  That is why I seriously doubt the intent of the Minister in relation to this matter.  I believe it is a sop to the local authority members of his own part, to the council of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, that in the Bill somewhere there is a provision that, when the Bill is well in place and things are going well, we will reinstitute or reincarnate in some shape or form the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>If this measure goes through and if section 17 goes through that is it.  The county committees of agriculture are gone.  We have more centralisation and we have the scaling down of the level of <Col N="2466" /> democratic participation of members of local authorities, farmers etc., in the day to day workings of agriculture.  It is a very unfair measure.  I think there is enough scope within the county committees of agriculture to retain them but the responsibilities could be redefined, the membership could be reconstituted and we could bring in additional expertise if the Minister feels there is a paucity or a scarcity of professional expertise in relation to the workings of the committees but he should not obliterate them in one fell swoop as this measure is designed to do.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I make one plea to the Minister.  A number of years ago we were on the brink of accession to the European Community and the theories of Mansholt were very much in vogue.  A well known journalist who is now with <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; with whom I do not always agree in relation to his political views &mdash; asked, who is Mansholt.  He advocated an idea which was subsequently taken up by a former Minister of the Minister of State's party &mdash; and now a member of the European Parliament &mdash; Mr. Seán Flanagan. That idea was that if the west of Ireland was to retain its demographic and population structure the long term prospect or the only hope for the west of Ireland was part time farming.  It has emerged subsequently that as statistics emerge each year from the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Agriculture, the number of full time farmers is on the decrease while the number of part time farmers is on the increase because the viability of holdings, and the threshold in relation to viability, is being pushed up.</P>
    <P>No Government on either side of the House has ever given adequate cognisance to this fact.  We have failed between the lot of us to produce a small farm development plan or a part time development plan.  Indeed, we have done more than that.  We have specifically set out to exclude part time farmers from benefiting from grants, the most obvious being the headage grant.  The most recent decision by the Minister was to reduce the off farm income requirement from <Col N="2467" /> £6,400 to £5,200 per annum.  That means that if any farmer, his wife or any member of the family earns more than £100 per week the farmer is precluded from receiving a headage payment.  One can have no off-farm employment other than a social employment scheme to qualify for headage.  This is a most unfair and short-sighted approach.  It fails to take cognisance of the year in, year out valid, convincing, compulsory statistics which show that the level of farm incomes in the west is declining.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to redress the population imbalance.  Recently I was down at Horan International Airport to where the remains of a friend were being brought from England.  I saw a Ryanair plane arriving which was 60 per cent full. I saw the same plane going out 100 per cent full.  I saw grieving fathers and mothers.  I saw a waiting list for tickets. I saw people who, a number of years ago, thought that they were assured a living in Ireland.  I saw people going out, not as the uncut nuggets or diamonds of the past but as computer programmers, teachers, nurses, plumbers, carpenters and plasterers, all being exported abroad.  God be good to Monsignor Horan, who, when he founded that airport saw it as being a beacon of hope, as the conduit for the development of the west.  It was to lead to a revival, a resuscitation or a renaissance in the west but sadly &mdash; even though it has managed to reach viability &mdash; it is being used primarily for the repetition of the greatest human tradgedy since the famine, the escalation of emigration. The only way we can put an end to that is by the development of an integrated programme, within the scope of the western package, and by harnessing all our resources.  We have the untapped resources in the west.  In the east of the country and in Dublin there are the people but in the west we have the tourist potential, the cleanest beaches and the most unpolluted environment.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have the forestry potential.  It has been proved time and time again that the west has the highest potential in terms of production of Canadian <Col N="2468" /> larch, Sitka spruce, pine, etc.  Last year, we imported £600 million worth of coniferous trees.  Yet, we have places like Counties Leitrim and Clare, and north Mayo which has approved potential in relation to forestry.  We must get our act together pretty soon.  If we are to wean people away from the traditional farming methods, to signpost them in a new direction, to develop the other dimensions or alternative enterprises to which we all pay lip service, fundamental to that is, first, research and, secondly, an advisory service.  Unfortunately, we do not have an adequate advisory service and this measure envisages the scaling down of that service, which is a very retrograde step indeed.</P>
    <P>The measure is welcome, having received the broad support of both sides of the House.  However, if resources are not provided, then this is all in vain.  I sincerely hope that when people look at this measure in ten years' time they will not look on the last week of April 1988 as the beginning of the end of the advisory and research services or the scaling down of agriculture which has played such a vital role in our economy and in Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Higgins, one would think that there is no eastern side to this country.  While I respect his right to speak for and defend the west, we can also conclude that there are just as many problems in agriculture in the east and south-east as anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation, if not the most important, to be discussed in the Dáil at any time.  This is because agriculture is still the country's major industry.  It is still the biggest employer, still the greatest earner and the industry, undoubtedly, with the greatest potential, even with the introduction of quotas.  Any Bill that will help agriculture to develop its potential must be regarded as extremely important.  The Bill will be successful if the body incorporating research, training, advice and education focuses on areas which in the past have <Col N="2469" /> not received the deserved attention. Mainly, we must produce and sell, rather than produce and hope to sell.  The two main areas for attention must be the marketer and the producer.  Both of these must have back-up services second to none.  We have the opportunity of providing that back-up service.  The focus of the Bill must always be on those two areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill must not be regarded as a new source for creating useless jobs for faceless people who are snowed under with paperwork.  It must have proper practical structures, to seek out the opportunities that are available in agriculture, to take advantage of that great potential and to ensure that those in the marketplace, looking for markets on our behalf and selling on our behalf, or those in the field, will not be impeded or hindered by bureaucracy, red tape or paperwork.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice recently that those involved in the advisory service of the Department of Agriculture and Food which service has been administered by ACOT, were being rewarded more for the amount of paperwork produced than for the advice given to farmers.  Many excellent agricultural instructors who are doing far more beneficial work in advising farmers at their farms were being penalised because they were not keeping up with the paperwork.  Reports for the Department of Agriculture and Food it would seem, are more important than advice to or results from producers.  The Minister must keep this in his mind when finalising the Bill.  We do not want a continuation of that from the Department of Agriculture and Food in Kildare Street or from Europe.  The agricultural advisers, the few who are left, must advise the farmers and forget about the paperwork.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that the Bill has its priorities right.  Its emphasis must be to locate markets and sell what we produce and are good at producing.  I was quite upset that the emphasis in a recent letter to me from the Department appeared to be on the cost-effectiveness of the amalgamation of the agricultural bodies rather <Col N="2470" /> than the great good that such amalgamation could do for the agricultural industry.  In this letter dated 8 February of this year I was told that the position was that the amalgamation of AFT and ACOT was designed to meet the Government's objective in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of ensuring greater coordination and cost-effectiveness in the services.  That is acceptable, provided that nothing is lost to the primary producer in the process.  The letter continued that this could be achieved through eliminating duplication or overlap, minimising resources absorbed in central management and administration and shedding low priority activities.  It stated that the new authority will have increased commercial orientation and will be required to secure greater financial participation from agricultural and food processing sectors.  It said that the amalgamation would, of course, involve a considerable degree of rationalisation, necessitating a substantial reduction in staff numbers and a restructuring of the services which might involve some redeployment.</P>
    <P>I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the elimination of duplication or overlap, as I am sure is every other Deputy. However, this must not involve the wrong area.  I repeat the view I held since this Bill was first suggested, that the advisory services must be maintained on the ground and that if there are to be reductions in the overall services, then it must be in Kildare Street.  I do not wish to see anybody lose his or her job but I am firmly of the belief that agriculture is our greatest industry, the industry with the greatest potential, which can only succeed if farmers are given the proper advisory services and those who are selling are given all the back up required.  So many untapped markets are out there, markets for which milk could be a base, excellent examples of which are Yoplait yoghurt and Waterford Cream.  Those have been great earners for our economy. They are well located, with a little bit of initiative.  There must not be any tampering with the advisory service or with the research area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2471" /> It is absolutely essential that the county committee structures should be retained in some form, as has been suggested from across the floor.  Those county committees have been very beneficial, combined with the advisory services, particularly in regard to research.  If we had not had such committees in the past the problems in agriculture would now be far greater.  I have not read in the Bill of any such proposed structure and I am asking the Minister of State to ensure that this matter is given proper consideration. For about five years an attempt has been made to kill off these committees of agriculture. The real attack came five years ago and since then the committees have been wound down.</P>
    <P>From 1977 to 1980 were the great years in farming when the sky was the limit and some farmers went wild especially in the south east.  When a parcel of land became available, the ACC, the Bank of Ireland and the AIB competed with each other to finance the purchase of the land.  They were almost prepared to force farmers into paying in excess of £3,000 per acre for land that we all know now was worth no more than £1,200 at best.  When the pressure came on, the financial institutions ran for cover.  They certainly did not share the burden.  I contend that they are responsible in part for the sad situation of farmers today, many of whom are in severe financial difficulties.  The lending institutions have been responsible for breaking up families and putting farmers into mental institutions.  The financial institutions have sent in receivers and have kicked people out onto the roadsides, farmers who worked day and night to build the ACC from an organisation housed in mobile homes and pre-fab offices, to its present size where they now own the biggest buildings in each of our rural towns.  The farmers whose sweat built those big offices are now being treated as semi-criminals. How much real interest do the lending institutions have in our economy?  In times of trouble they run for cover and protect themselves.  I know that farmers have the ultimate responsibility for their <Col N="2472" /> actions but we all know that the banks and the ACC showed no responsibility towards the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Department in Kildare Street through the farm advisory service encouraged farmers to buy and to invest. I shudder to think where we would find ourselves now if the county committees of agriculture who applied the brakes at that time had not operated then.  The farmers on those committees advised caution.  God help us if Kildare Street had had it all their own way at that time. It is no bother to milk cows in Kildare Street if one does not get dirty but out on the ground it is a different scene.  The county commitees comprised farmers and farm representatives.  In County Wexford some of the best farmers in the country sat on those committees.  We had Michael Synott, present chairman of the county council, and Jimmy Curtis, a former chairman of the county council, and Mr. Tom Kent, representative of the IFA, all of whom in their own right are probably the best farmers in Wexford. These men were prepared to give their time for £10 each month to come in for an afternoon to the county hall and give advice for the advisory services.  If it were a profession other than farming those three people would have been charging massive fees.  Now it seems that the Minister is intent on casting aside that excellent free advice based on groundwork. Will the Minister, for God's sake, retain the county committee structure?  The Minister suggested to me that this is a money saving exercise.  The county committee of agriculture in Wexford costs about £7,000 per annum, that is about one-third of the cost of a civil servant in Kildare Street.  Which is the more valuable? I will leave it to the Minister to answer that.  The county committee structure has worked well in the past.  Now, more than ever, there is a need for common sense at a time when common sense is not very common.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that local democracy has been kicked out the door.  Let us not pay lip service to its retention, let us do something positive and retain the <Col N="2473" /> county committees of agriculture in the interests of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a short while ago my agreement to the elimination of duplication and overlapping.  This reminds me that from the agricultural purse which is being squeezed every day, the Irish Sugar Company and Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, have been funded to carry out soil analysis.  It is well known that Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, is world famous for this work and many nations have sent representatives to Johnstown to avail of the expertise there when setting up their own soil analysis centres in their own country.  Yet in the early eighties the Sugar Company decided to do soil analysis.  It is strange that the Government should fund analysis at Johnstown and for the Sugar Company at Carlow.  Also, the results from Carlow are not acceptable as the soil analysis system adopted by the Sugar Company at Carlow is flawed.  If the Minister of State is serious about eliminating duplication he will forthwith withdraw funding from the service at Carlow.  It is very disturbing that in the past few weeks UCD have asked for funding for soil analysis.  If we are serious about eliminating duplication something must be done immediately.  I will be obliged if the Minister refers to this aspect, as I mentioned it in the House before now and got no response.</P>
    <P>While I have been harsh about departmental officials, I accept that there is a necessity for them, but the proportions and the priorities must be right.  This is not the case.  When the advisory service or the researchers who are closest to the producers, who are the most important people in agriculture, collect the money it is anticipated they will collect, will it be put into central funds or into research, training and advice?  If this were to be the case I believe it would lead to improved productivity and improved innovativeness on the part of such staff whereas if they are to be just tax collectors I feel that they will just do the job they will be asked to do.  In this day and age we must get the very best out of <Col N="2474" /> our professionals and we must encourage them to be innovative.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the groups who will be involved in this new structure seem, from reading their submissions, to regard their jobs as being far more important than the end result and while this may be understandable to a degree the end result is all important.  I have gone through the submissions in detail and while they do mention the primary producer and the seller of the end product they seem to be far more concerned with how they themselves will fare within this new structure.  As a nation we have gone off the rails in that we seem to have our priorities wrong.  Let this Bill act as the first crowbar in getting us back on the rails and back to where our priorities are, in the areas most beneficial to the economy and not of small interest groups.</P>
    <P>If they are to survive farmers must focus all of their expertise on efficiency, quality, good business management and particularly marketing.  They must examine alternative sources of income and I understand from a submission received from the Agricultural Science Association that there are now only 30,000 or one in five farmers who are capable of competing in the present hostile market environment.  They also claim, and I am inclined to agree with them, that there are a further 55,000 or one in three farmers who are capable of competing if the support services are adequate and freely available.  They say it is absolutely vital that advice and research are maintained and well funded in order to help farmers to adjust.</P>
    <P>Farmers in this country are good at producing milk and meat, but they are not adventurous and they find it difficult to adjust.  If they are to succeed they must look beyond convention and incentives must be provided to encourage initiative, adventure and innovativeness if we are to compete with our EC partners.  Almost all of these countries are less dependent on agriculture yet their support services are being increased.  Spending money on helping farmers to become self efficient makes better economic sense than spending money on income supports.  How <Col N="2475" /> many times have our missionaries, both lay and cleric, said, &ldquo;give a person a fish and they will live for a day but teach them to fish and they will have food for a lifetime&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Another interesting suggestion I fully agree with is the suggestion of the Agricultural Science Association that all EC farm development schemes be administered by a new body.  This would require the incorporation of the farm development service and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This one-stop shop concept would ensure a far more effective utilisation of scarce resources. The procedure of having to telephone four different offices, one higher than the next, to obtain a decision on any particular aspect is not acceptable. Bureaucracy must be minimised.</P>
    <P>Since it appears to be the order of the day I would now like to refer to an Foras Talúntais, in particular Johnstown Castle which is their mother house.  An Foras Talúntais are very concerned about the loss of jobs within Johnstown Castle. Since 1985 the number of staff has been reduced from 220 to 114.  Extraordinary work has been done at that centre and the EC has recognised this work by asking Johnstown Castle to carry out surveys and undertake consultancy work for it. The Government of the Azores have also employed their services and are paying substantial fees in the process.  The Government of Zimbabwe are also using the resources of Johnstown Castle.  Those Governments and the EC recognise the great work being done at Johnstown Castle but I have to beg the question, are our own Government recognising that work?  An Foras Talúntas are involved in every aspect of the agricultural scene.  I have had the benefit of their expertise just like every other farmer in the country and I have gained from it.  I am certain that I speak on behalf of all those in An Foras Talúntais and when I say that I would hate to see their role being minimised.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais have never had a good public relations office and I suppose they had hoped that the farmers would <Col N="2476" /> do that job for them.  Because they have never spoken about the results they have achieved they are now suffering.  Let us remember that their mother house has seen a reduction in staff of over 100 out of a total staff of 220 over the past three years and I think that is a scandal and a waste of great resources.  They have now gone to other countries to give them the benefit of their expertise.</P>
    <P>Recently much attention has focused on the Chernobyl disaster.  Who did the Government turn to at that time for advice but Johnstown Castle.  Since that time they have been monitoring the nuclear fall-out and this is work which an organisation which was set up for that very purpose should be doing.  Because of their expertise Johnstown Castle have been asked to do this work and will continue to do so as long as the experts remain there.  I do not think there is anybody in this House who would like to see the level of nuclear fall-out monitoring being reduced.  As we all know, we face many dangers and here I am speaking about Great Britain which appears to think that this country is a dump, should act as a dump and should do precisely what it says.  If we did not have that expertise available at Johnstown Castle, what would we do?</P>
    <P>Our environment has been receiving great attention over the past few years. As Members of this House who are members of local authorities will be aware, local authority officials are now visiting farmers who for one reason or another are polluting rivers and causing a major threat to them.  I do not want to see any river polluted or fish killed but this pollution has been caused as a result of ignorance on the part of farmers and I mean this in the kindness sense.  This problem has been getting worse in recent years but An Foras Talúntais are doing good work in this area.</P>
    <P>It is an old wives' tale that silage effluent is poisonous.  There are many farmers who still regard silage effluent as being poisonous because it poisons fish in our rivers.  It should be made quite clear that because of the work carried out at Johnstown Castle it has now been discovered <Col N="2477" /> that silage effluent can be used as cattle feed.  If the people there have done nothing else except convince farmers that they should collect silage effluent and use it to their advantage as a food supplement for cattle then they will have done a great day's work.</P>
    <P>Another way of polluting our rivers is by spreading farmyard manure.  Obviously there is a big wash-off of such manure into our streams and this causes problems.  Johnstown Castle has now discovered a method of spreading farmyard manure in such a way that it will not wash off.  They seed it into the ground as they would plant anything else and the run-off is far less.  Even while I am talking there is a seminar in progress in Johnstown and the people there have newer, more modern techniques in mind.  We cannot interfere with this kind of situation. I am appealing to the Minister of State to retain Johnstown for those two reasons, even though they are not directly related.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about all of An Foras Talúntais.  Johnstown Castle, as you know, is the mother house; Oak Park is a small boy but an effective small boy.  On the question of fertiliser usage in this country, Johnstown has done great work.  The fertiliser industry is worth £300 million each year.  When that much money is being spent by the farmers obviously they want to get the best value for money.  They want to ensure that when manure is spread it is spread to the greatest effect.  Johnstown Castle, and indeed Oak Park and other centres, carry out tests constantly on the analysis of the fertilisers.  They also give advice as to the amount that should be spread.  As £300 million is being spent each year on fertilisers we must continue to ensure that this monitoring is continued by Johnstown and by the other centres around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Johnstown Castle engages in soil sampling to the tune of 100,000 samples per year.  They do plant analysis, soil analysis and so on.  Their consultancy services <Col N="2478" /> must also be continued.  As I have said, they are engaged in about 80 consultancy services at present from near and far.  I am asking the Minister not to reduce any of the work that is being done by Johnstown Castle or indeed by any of the centres.  I think all of us will accept that we were not getting full value for our money from all the people working in all these centres and that we can do without some of them but when the hatchet falls in such a way that the necessary services will continue to be provided.  I compliment the people in Johnstown who, for many years, have done tremendous work.  I hope that when I speak here again on this matter, whenever it might be, I will be able to say the same thing.</P>
    <P>In the south-east we have the good fortune to be great producers of soft fruit. The Clonroche centre in County Wexford has done great work for that industry which is worth about £4 million annually to the small farmers of Clonroche, Wexford and even Kilkenny.  There are talks of the centre at Clonroche being closed and I ask the Minister of State &mdash; I am delighted it is the Minister for Horticulture who is present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy but unfortunately very few others did. The centre in Clonroche earns £4 million for that part of the country.  I have no doubt that the soft fruit industry can grow and, therefore, it is essential that the service at Clonroche be retained.  We know of the tremendous work that is being done there.  I have been told that if that centre was to close at this stage &mdash; I sincerely hope it will not &mdash; the soft fruit industry would live for about four years and that is hardly acceptable.  We have an industry that is capable of growing.  I <Col N="2479" /> say to the Minister, let us ensure that it can continue to grow.  People in Waterford might even decide to grow a few strawberries.  It is essential that any industry that is growing be retained. There are 16 people working in the centre in Clonroche.  Anyone who has visited that centre &mdash; I am delighted the Minister present has visited it &mdash; will have noted that it does great work.  The people there often go beyond the call of duty to help people in the area.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister to ensure that in the amalgamation of ACOT and An Foras Talúntais, which is essential, necessary and good, the farmers will not be affected and will not have a lessening of services.  As I have said earlier, the agricultural industry is still our greatest employer, our industry with the greatest potential.  It has a long way to go and I ask the Minister not to impede its progress in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate.  I am amazed at the Government's disregard for agriculture at present.  A most essential and important ingredient in a prosperous and vibrant agricultural industry is to have a first-class advisory and research service.  It appears the Government are prepared to sacrifice the advice and training given to the entire agricultural business over the years.  The issue here is not about research and advice; the issue is that a further attempt is being made to decimate the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We rely heavily on agriculture.  One would imagine we should not cut back in these two important areas but should encourage specialisation because of the uncertainty created in the past few months.  Many of our best researchers and advisers have chosen to leave the country and this is something the Government cannot be proud of.  It is very sad to see some of the finest brains in the agricultural advisory service suddenly finding themselves without jobs and having to emigrate to the Third World or perhaps to America or Australia to find <Col N="2480" /> employment for the remainder of their working lives.</P>
    <P>Farmers demonstrated the value they put on the advisory services last year. When asked to pay for advice, ACOT did not appear to have any difficulty getting the money.  The Minister said in this debate that the amalgamation, when carried out, would increase efficiency and provide a better service.  If we are to make ACOT/AFT more efficient, I would suggest we aim for efficiency at administrative level rather than affecting the people who provide the service on the ground.  Is the Minister aware that we are the only country in Europe to amalgamate the advisory and research services?  The work carried out in all our research stations has been well documented &mdash; the trace element trials carried out in Johnstown Castle, the tests on the different herbicides, fungicides and agricultural programmes in Moorepark and cereal production, root crops and the excellent work done in beef production at Grange and in Moorepark, County Cork.</P>
    <P>Last night at Private Members' time we discussed a very important issue which, as far as I am concerned, only highlighted the difficulties that exist so far as our national herd is concerned.  From the Minister's remarks it would appear there is general recognition of the magnitude of the problem but the Government are not prepared to take corrective action before it is too late.  This is further evidence of the Government abandoning agriculture.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that in agriculture today we have sections which face major problems &mdash; in the potato and vegetable areas, in beef and in tillage where the profit in root crops is dropping drastically annually.  The industry is now faced with a 43 per cent cut in the ACOT/AFT budget which is nothing short of scandalous.  Advisory services are needed if the farmers are to get the highest return possible for their investment.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is being decimated even more quickly and farmers are faced with levies and being <Col N="2481" /> pushed into milk quotas.  This is a time when farming must be as efficient as possible. It will be recalled that some years ago when the EC agricultural budget was much more generous, the farming community gave a remarkable performance. Now, many of them have specialised college training and a good advisory service is vital for them.</P>
    <P>It is strange to compare the neglect of agriculture as shown by the Government's amalgamation of AFT and ACOT with all the ballyhoo we had about the Custom House Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  At best we are expecting 800 jobs in the Dublin centre, whereas in agriculture, our main industry, there will be employment for up to 400,000 people on the land, in the processing industry, supplying services, in the co-operatives, selling farm machinery and other spin-off industries.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the chief executive was not appointed to cover more areas and have the services running smoothly in the shortest time possible.  The agricultural industry is in the dark about what the future advisory service will be able to provide.  I urge all parties to realise that we are not talking about increasing public expenditure, as expressed by some Government Deputies today, we are talking about maintaining the skeleton services we already have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that because of its tremendous economic importance this Bill is among the most important to come before the House.  The merger of AFT and ACOT has been sought by many people interested in agriculture for several years and is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are the only country in Europe with this kind of merger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There will have to be greater emphasis on advisory services. It has been noted that, for a number of years, a great deal of research has taken place and much of that research was never, or could never, be implemented owing to a shortage of finance.  Any <Col N="2482" /> farmer will say the most important factor so far as his education is concerned is the local advisory service.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the advisory service is not just kept in place but even improved because it is absolutely essential to farmers.</P>
      <P>I greatly welcome the proposal of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to send a submission to Brussels with a view to extending the severely handicapped areas.  There is a grave anomaly in the country where small farmers situated outside the severely handicapped areas receive no headage payments while larger farmers living in severely handicapped areas receive those payments. This is illogical.  It makes no sense, and one could go so far as to say it is unconstitutional. The Minister's submission to Brussels is to be greatly welcomed.  I sincerely hope the farmers who are, in terms of land and herd sizes, entitled to headage payments but cannot receive them because of the geographic and illthought-out divide, will receive the headage payments to which in all equity they are entitled.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the new body Teagasc will be in a position to form committees.  The new board should take the initiative and form committees at local level.  The committees of agriculture have played, and in many cases are playing, a tremendous role in the development of agriculture.  They are representative of local opinion, local needs and local objectives.  The new board of Teagasc should form the local committees immediately so that they will hear the voice of local representatives in this very important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merger of AFT and ACOT provides an opportunity to redirect agricultural research and advisory programmes in order to maximise their contribution to the recovery of the country. Agriculture is uniquely important to us because its import and profit repatriation content is so low.  I understand that 87 per cent of raw materials used in the agriculture and food industry here is produced domestically.  In other words, £80 of every £100 spent on agriculture is left <Col N="2483" /> in the economy.  That compares very favourably with other industries.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for several years that the horticultural industry has not taken off.  It has to be said, however, that since the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, took over responsibility for this sector there has been a vast improvement and that initiatives which should have been taken several years ago have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to justify to any rational person why we have to import potatoes and other vegetables.  It is clear that one of the major problems has been the marketing and presentation of the Irish product.  The establishment of An Bord Glas has improved things greatly and I look forward to the day when we will see an end to the massive importation of vegetables which is taking place.</P>
    <P>To be honest, it is scandalous that with our climate and land that is so suitable for the growth of vegetables we have to import vegetables.  In a free market Community it is not possible to ban imports but there is no doubt that they are causing tremendous difficulty to those involved in the horticultural industry. Just a year ago the manager of Jury's Hotel in Cork said he would be delighted to be able to buy Irish vegetables but the problem was he could not get a supply on a consistent basis.  In a country that is facing such severe financial difficulties it is hard to understand why the agricultural sector has not risen to the challenge of horticulture and why we have to continue to import so many of our needs.  It is time that we made a big drive to get Irish farmers more involved in the horticultural industry.  Many farmers will justly say that it is extremely difficult for them to get involved because it would not pay.  We must examine the reasons why it will not pay them to grow horticultural produce.  We must investigate why Irish farmers cannot produce at the same cost and present them in the same way as Cypriot or Dutch farmers.  We should not be importing vegetables; in all justice to our land and our traditions we should be exporting them.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister of State, <Col N="2484" /> Deputy Kirk, is tackling this problem but he should accelerate the tremendous drives he has made in an effort to improve the horticultural industry to such an extent that it can hold its own on world markets.  We must carry out an in-depth examination of that industry.  This is not a country rich in minerals, as far as we know, and countries like us must look to our own resources if our people are to prosper.  We must see how the horticultural industry succeeds in other countries and, by comparison, why it has failed here.  We should base the development of our horticultural industry on the experiences gained from the activities in other countries.  We should implement such a programme without delay.  An Bord Glas are making great strides but we must examine our problems in the context of the success of the horticultural industry in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that there is a great layer of bureaucracy in the Department of Agriculture.  If one examines the method of applying for a grant under the farm improvement programme one will be baffled at the amount of bureaucracy involved.  In the first instance, a farmer must make contact with his adviser.  The latter will fill up the application form which is processed at the district ACOT office in consultation with the farm development office.  Following that the adviser visits the farm and gives his views. The adviser will then prepare a farm plan. The file will then be stamped by the district ACOT manager and two copies sent to the farmer.  One of these copies will be sent by the farmer to the farm development service office and later an officer from the FDS will visit the farm on three occasions in all.  A farmer will then be given permission to proceed and an official of the FDS will visit the farmer in the course of the implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>When the work is completed the officer will return again to inspect it.  Depending on the scale of work involved, a senior inspector from FDS may also visit the farm and, in some cases, an FDS officer may deliver account books to the farmer for completion.  When the FDS approve <Col N="2485" /> payment the file is sent to Dublin for sanction and, wait for it, the grant is paid.  The average amount of grant paid is £1,400.  I often wonder if that very expensive bureaucratic procedure does not cost more than the value of the grant paid to the farmer.  That procedure reads like something in a fairy story and it is impossible to justify it.</P>
    <P>That type of running around the country should be stopped and the procedure should be greatly simplified in the interests of the agricultural industry, those working in the Department, but most certainly in the interests of the farmer.  There is such a layer of bureaucracy involved that farmers could be forgiven for not applying at all for a grant. They could be forgiven for trying to avoid having to go through what I can only describe as nonsense.  Something will have to be done about that because I do not believe it can be tolerated any longer. The Department will have to produce a simpler system.  In other words, when applying for a grant under the farm improvement programme there are 16 steps to be taken before the grant is paid. We should put an end to that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to implement rural development programmes.  Over many years decisions in regard to rural Ireland were made at central level and very often they were not appropriate to the area concerned.  In other words, local communities would have done better.  In the implementation of rural development programmes it should be stressed that the community should take the lead.  The local community should specify what precisely is required.</P>
    <P>What kind of development is needed? What approach should be taken?  The appointment of a liaison officer in these areas will be of tremendous benefit.  All too often in disadvantaged areas there has been a flight from the land.  Indeed, it has been estimated that this flight has increased by about 5 per cent.  This has been going on for several years.  The flight from the land has also meant flight from the central towns in the region and has <Col N="2486" /> meant the depletion of resources which would otherwise have been built up.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the direction was wrong and that the approach was not correct. This must now change and I greatly welcome the proposals by the Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; his Department deserve great credit in this regard &mdash; to change the approach.  With local communities giving a lead, rather than being led, there will be a possibility of development in regions throughout the length and breadth of the country which would not otherwise have been achieved.  All too often, on the west coast resources and infrastructure are lying dormant when they could have provided tremendous economic opportunities for people who are today in London or New York. Too often, the centralised method of deciding what was good for a rural community failed miserably.  Along the west coast and other parts of the country, communities are willing to contribute to the growth of their local economy.  They have ideas and are willing to help people to implement them.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that a liaison officer will be appointed to each of the regions which are to be designated as pilot areas for rural development and that he will cut through the red tape which has been such a feature throughout the country.  I hope he will listen to what the community say and implement those views as far as possible.  There is nothing to be lost because everything else has clearly failed. The flight from the west over the last 50 years is ample evidence that everything has failed.  The Minister is taking a brave new step, on which he is to be congratulated, and I have no doubt that this will be a resounding success because it deserves to be.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest concerns expressed by farmers in the west relate to the method of identification and licensing of beef bulls.  The proposal to allow only registered pure bred bulls, thereby giving a total monopoly, has been criticised at local level up and down the west coast. There are those who take the view that there is no justification for the creation of a total monopoly for pure bred registered <Col N="2487" /> bulls and that such a monopoly would almost certainly have damaging effects on the beef industry due to the scarcity and prohibitive price of registered pure bred bulls of a continental breed.</P>
    <P>Many farmers along the west coast have expressed the view that this would certainly prove a major obstacle in the drive to increase the numbers and the quality of the country's suckler herds and their offspring.  They point out that the future of the farming industry and the economy must, to a certain extent, rely for growth on this area of agriculture.  It has been said that the very best breeding male stock are top quality pure bred bulls and top quality non-pure bred bulls.  It is clear that the farmers, especially along the west coast, will experience great difficulty if this proposal comes into force. It means that they will be obliged to get a registered pure bred bull for breeding purposes.  That is all very well when a farmer has 100 acres in the Golden Vale but it is clearly not appropriate for small farms and small farmers in the west and other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the need to improve the quality of our beef and I welcome anything that will do that.  However, the smaller farmer should not be penalised by this provision.  There is a considerable amount of opposition to it and I ask the Minister to reconsider this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The work being done by An Bord Bainne is second to none and has proved to be one of the great innovative bodies in the country.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will lead to even greater strides forward in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The merger of ACOT and AFT is a perfectly logical evolution in the agricultural advisory and research development scene.  However, it is a pity that it has taken so long to finalise the necessary legislation.  The merger has become somewhat of a saga and the vast majority of Members of the House were not even in active politics when it was first mooted in the mid-seventies.  We probably would have advanced further <Col N="2488" /> and more quickly in those two key areas if the proposed merger had taken place in the mid-seventies.</P>
      <P>The National Agricultural Council was disbanded because of what can only be described as electioneering and petty politicking in 1977 on the change of Government.  That was a great pity.  A personality clash as well as petty politics seem to have been involved.  I wish the Minister the best of good luck with his legislation and I wish the people involved in the new body, Teagasc, the best of goodwill and success in their endeavours. I appreciate the scale of the operation will be at a reduced level but that does not mean they cannot be successful.  Of course they can.</P>
      <P>I add to the historical factors involved by saying that as Minister I set up a review body about four years ago &mdash; I am not precise as regards the dates &mdash; known as the Cashman Review Body.  This group represented some very influential figures in the agricultural industry.  They came forward after prolonged deliberations with the view that there should be a common board for the two bodies in question and that there should be just one common chairman.  While they did not say so much in words, it was evident that their thinking was that there should be a merger sooner rather than later. They may not have wished at that time to become involved in the politics of merging two very powerful groups in agriculture. They felt probably that was a political decision &mdash; and they were right &mdash; that that was where the buck stopped. It was a Government decision, a ministerial decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I started the movement of that process in a small way be appointing a joint chairman of the two bodies.  The individual concerned was originally Chairman of AFT, Matt Dempsey, and when the vacancy arose for Chairman of ACOT I duly appointed Mr. Dempsey to that position as well.  The natural process would have been that when vacancies occurred on the individual boards they would be left vacant until we could see fit to pool the two sides and make them into one coherent body.  That did not <Col N="2489" /> happen as quickly as I would have wished, but I suppose politicking again was involved here.  One thing you do when you are Minister &mdash; or you feel you have to do it, right or wrong, and maybe you are wrong to do it &mdash; is to look after your own patch.  If you are too forthcoming when it comes to abolishing or amalgamating bodies or getting rid of staff you are going to be slated by all the interest groups involved in that area.  If other Ministers are holding out or threatening to veto or bring down the Government if something similar happens in their area, then I am sure you are not going to allow it happen in your area.</P>

      <P>Yes, fighting your own corner.  One could see ludicrous situations where bodies which one knew had no function or usefulness whatsoever were being retained while bodies over whom one had control were proposed to be demolished or disbanded or merged, and you had to go and see to it that you looked after that interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further aspect to this legislation and to the historical background, that has implications for the years ahead. It is the very unwise and at times a dangerous situation whereby the Department of Finance exert far too much control over decisions involving other Departments and the autonomy and wisdom of the people in those individual Departments can be overlooked and ignored by hardheaded and oftentimes ill-advised financial decisions.  I would <Col N="2490" /> advise the present Minister for Agriculture and Food to bear that very much in mind.  Without wishing to be critical of the Minister, looking at it from the outside at present, I feel he is being led up a number of <i>cul-de-sacs</i> which people attempted to lead or drive me up from time to time, some of which I resisted and others which I could not resist, very much to my regret and disappointment.</P>
    <P>The most vivid of all was the bovine TB scheme where &mdash; I will not be excused for saying this &mdash; having outwitted the veterinary unions and got them into good shape so they were going to do what we told them to do, when we told them to do it and if they did not they were out of the scheme completely and we were defeated at the end of the day because of lack of sufficient finance.  The amount of finance in that case as I remember it was as little as £6 million.</P>

      <P>Wait and see.  In one year we got the full whack of money we needed, having resolved a dispute with the veterinary unions, and the progress made that year on the elimination of bovine TB was quite extraordinary.  Then we fell foul of the Department of Finance, our resources were somewhat limited and we were struggling on one wing thereafter.  Perhaps the Minister will find the Department of Finance will wield the axe again.</P>

      <P>I do not think that will happen and I hope it does not.  I think the present Government have learned from what I regard as a mistake by the previous Government by making that cut.  The Minister can quote me on that but it was a mistake and should not be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the scheme as drawn up at present is operated we can reduce the incidence of bovine TB to tolerable levels.  We will never eliminate it.  Let me mention what is probably the minor part of the Bill with <Col N="2491" /> regard to institutions, the abolition of committees of agriculture.  I do not think it a good idea.  I do not say that just because it emanates from the Department of Finance, which it does.  Local representatives are entitled to express their views on what is the largest industry in this country.  This measure is a bad mistake inspired by penny-pinching on the part of the Department of Finance and it should be resisted.  We know the opinion the commentators have of urban councils, county councils and committees; it is not very good, but people are entitled to a public expression of opinion on their own industry.  It is foolish to abolish those committees.  Let them meet less often, perhaps once every two months, let their numbers be restricted and let the overall costs be considerably less but let them continue to operate. You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would not be familiar with the operations of committees of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The committees of agriculture were founded on a statutory basis, whereas sheep dipping committees do not have the same status.  An unfortunate consequence of the non-statutory standing of the sheep dipping committees is that county councils have been allowed to retain them and to amalgamate them over several counties.  The result is that money which is badly needed to run <Col N="2492" /> organisations such as the committees of agriculture is being blatantly wasted on running committees such as sheep dipping committees.  It is an abuse of public funds.  It is outrageous that while it is being proposed to abolish something worthwhile we do not have any control over the spending of money on something which is quite superfluous.  Any activities carried out by a sheep dipping committee could be done under the aegis of a committee of agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing the attention of the House to this anomaly.  It would be a function of the Minister for the Environment.  It just shows how ridiculous the situation is.  We have sheep dipping committees which are costing a considerable amount of money while at the same time we are abolishing worth-while committees of agriculture.  This does not make sense.  I suggest that the Minister and his colleague at the Department of the Environment should bring some sanity into the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong with charging for services.  I have not gone into the nuts and bolts of this Bill, leaving that to our spokesman.  When you are a child you are led along by the hand but you come to a point where you have to make your own way.  Being in the European Community gives us the best of all worlds, particularly since agriculture is so heavily subsidised by the richer member states.  People should be able to capitalise on our membership of the EC and should be in a position to pay for the services which help them to make a reasonable living.  A person who lives in a disadvantaged area does not pay for anything, just as the medical card holder gets everything he needs from the health services.  A person who does not live in a disadvantaged area pays through the nose.  It is often the case that progressive young farmers in non-disadvantaged <Col N="2493" /> areas are under much more financial pressure than people who are enjoying generous subsidies and headage payments. It is a concept that should not be entertained.  There should not be discrimination depending on whether one lives on one side of a line or the other. People who are classified as disadvantaged may be considerably better off than those who are not so classified. Many of the toughest cases I came across during my term as Minister for Agriculture involved progressive farmers who tried to do something for themselves by investing heavily but who, by misfortune or mismanagement, fell into debt from which they could not recover due to factors such as bad weather, interest payments and trading difficulties.  This is an age in which we have to pay for services if we can afford to do so.  People must pay taxation if they are earning enough to be liable.  A person who depends on the Government to look after him displays a feeble attitude of mind.  People will have to become self-dependent, managing their own affairs and getting away from the mentality where they expect to get a grant for everything and do not expect to pay for anything.</P>
    <P>I do not necessarily want to fire a broadside at the farming organisations but they have done a disservice to the agriculture industry by continually looking for the maximum price for their products without any reference to re-investing some of the money they receive into research and development.  There have been a number of failings in the agricultural sector, the greatest of which has been lack of foresight regarding reinvestment in the products farmers are producing.  That is why we have had such lamentable difficulty in recent years because of the milk super-levy, beef intervention prices and the over-production of grain within the Community. All those problems have been magnified here because we were depending too much on the safe market, otherwise known as intervention.  A meat plant in my part of the country which went broke about four years ago once advertised for <Col N="2494" /> a sales representative experienced in selling meat into intervention.  To the ordinary layman that does not mean much. In fact, commodities are not sold into intervention.  They are merely placed in intervention.  One just puts them in there and EC pays for them and not alone does it pay for them but for their storage.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations have been very shortsighted in demanding the highest price for their product.  When we were getting 80p for a gallon of milk there should have been a deliberate and considered decision made by all interested in agriculture here to allocate 5p or 6p of that for research and development to get us out of the horrible cycle of converting milk into nothing more than butter and skim milk powder which one cannot give away for nothing.</P>

Does he consider An Post to be no longer a public service and that decisions to close rural post offices can be made on the basis of profit and loss? Is the Minister happy with a situation where post offices are allowed close without any warning to local communities, where deputations may be refused without any reason being given?

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's view.  Representing a rural constituency myself I can appreciate the torment that can be experienced when there is a disruption of traditional services.  However, when the users' council was in force the number of complaints which were transmitted was quite small.  Since that time the remit of the Ombudsman has been extended to take account of complaints of this nature against the board of An Post.  That would be the proper course of action for members of the public who are dissatisfied with the service to take.  I would also point out that the obligation on An Post to operate on a commercial basis has distinct advantages for the community as a whole.  We would always try, once the service was breaking even or making a profit, to take more account of areas the Deputy has in mind and progress could then be made.</P>

Does he not think that £85,000 is not much to spend on a consumer watchdog for two bodies spending <Col N="2498" /> £700 million a year?  When he says there was not a significant volume of complaints coming to these bodies, does he not recognise that with 2,000 complaints coming to the users's council and 5,000 going to the Ombudsman, the present Government's decision to axe the Ombudsman's budget and to abolish these two councils is abandoning the consumer who has had significant complaints?</P>

Every Deputy in the House would say that money should be provided for this or that particular service but decisions must be taken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the contention that the proposed MMDS system is not capable of giving service to rural areas or that it is an obsolete technology.  In fact this country is the first European country to adopt MMDS.  Other European countries are actively examining its potential and I see no reason to delay its introduction here.  Interested parties, who have done extensive investigations into this system and who are prepared to invest considerable sums of money in MMDS are quite satisfied that the system is capable of serving rural areas.  My policy regarding the issue of MMDS licences has been reinforced by the confidence shown by private sector investors. The whole concept behind this system is to provide legitimate access to a wider choice of television services, including UK terrestrial and satellite delivered services to viewers in rural and other areas not served or unlikely to be served by cable systems.  The MMDS system will be capable of carrying up to 11 channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be making statutory regulations shortly under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts governing the issue of licences for MMDS systems.  These regulations will be broadly along the lines of the Wired Broadcast Relay Licence Regulations, 1974, which govern the issue of licences for cable television systems.  It is envisaged that an initial licence fee of £20,000 and an annual fee of 5 per cent of net <Col N="2500" /> revenue, thereafter, will be payable by MMDS licensees.  The charges which will apply to subscribers to MMDS systems will be a matter for the licensees in the first place and will depend on a range of factors.  The expectation is that charges will be of the order of those applying in the more modern and recently built cable systems, about £100 per annum.  It is expected that a once off installation charge of about the same amount will be payable.</P>
    <P>I will be inviting applications for licences by way of public notice in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>I never questioned the technical ability of the system.  That is a subsequent question which the Minister has before him.

I have had repeatedly to ask this question and on each occasion I find that the Minister goes public on the issue either the day before or on the day the question is answered.  What the Minister has read out is in today's <i>Irish Times</i> almost verbatim.  Can the Minister give us a clear indication as to when the system will come into operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the technical suitability or otherwise of the MMDS system.  In terms of terrestrial transmission of TV signals what is proposed by MMDS is new technology.  It has not been fully developed.  It has not been tried elsewhere in the way it is intended to be tried here, in a blanket coverage of the country which is what is proposed.  It is a line of sites system.  I am curious as to whether the topographical conditions that exist in many parts of rural Ireland will prevent it from being used efficiently and effectively and <Col N="2501" /> whether it will result in many people in rural areas not being able to receive it. There is also the question of the expense of the system.  It is not produced in mass volume anywhere.  Will the system not become completely obsolete anyway when direct broadcasting satellite services come onstream?  Why should we go to the trouble of installing a system which, even though it could be defective while we have it &mdash; would become obsolete when DBS services come onstream in any event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the most careful consideration will have to be given to the selection of transmitter sites.  Taking account of the geography, the mountain regions and the problems that would emerge with this or, indeed, with any system, I can assure the Deputy that account is being taken of this matter.  In relation to the technology, this system, as the Deputy is aware, is in operation in Canada and in the US though I would be the first to admit that we are talking about different terrain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be necessary, even after the introduction of this system, to have interposers to cater for some of the areas about which the Deputy is concerned but, overall, the balance of advantage at this time is to introduce this particular system.  It is being investigated very thoroughly.  A number of feasibility studies have been carried out on the use of this technology, not only here, but abroad.  A number of other European Governments are considering introducing this facility.  I cannot say if there is information available regarding the satellite systems to indicate how soon these systems would be available.  The level and extension of service to the public generally by use of this system is one of its great advantages.  We should bear in mind that we have a number of illegal systems operating in Ireland which create considerable interruption and difficulty <Col N="2502" /> in the provision of service.  The Government must take account of the legal situation there also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not take note fully of the point I made in relation to DBS, the impact that will have on this country when it comes into being in a few short years and the whole question of installing a system that is likely to be made obsolete.  Concern is being expressed from a radiation health hazard point of view in relation to microwave transmission systems.  I understand that planning permission will be required for the provision of transmitters.  I am asking the Minister to give a categorical assurance to the House that no health hazard of any kind will emanate from these transmitters so that people adjacent to where the transmitters will be sited can be relieved of their anxiety in this regard. Otherwise, I presume there will be a flood of objections when planning permission is sought for these transmitters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be necessary for the private companies who are successful in obtaining licences from the Department of Communications to obtain planning permission before they proceed with this development.  As the Deputy is aware the radiation in radio transmission in that context is different from nuclear radiation. There has been a certain amount of publicity attending to this question and all the available evidence suggests that there is no danger or hazard and that the levels &mdash; even at the base transmitter level &mdash; are extremely low and are considerably below the maximum standards allowable under EC and other governing regulations.  In that general area the Deputy can be happy that there is no health hazard or danger to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the regulations will require Dáil approval?  Does he accept the view of the cable authority in the UK that MMDS should only be used where there is no alternative system?  The deflector system in use in the UK appears to be much more cost effective.  Does he accept the <Col N="2503" /> view that the MMDS system, even with interposers, will still only cover 70 per cent of target areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention of interfering with the established cable systems. In fact, this proposal should be seen as complementary to them.  With regard to the question of the investigations carried out abroad in relation to this technology, I am extremely happy that it is workable.  As I said, statutory regulations have to be introduced and they must be brought into the Dáil so it will be a matter for Dáil debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the provision of this new initiative could cause some controversy in rural areas, particularly in the west? This goes back to the growth of cable distribution systems in the seventies, which was mainly confined to urban areas.  People in rural Ireland, particularly in the west, had to take the initiative and provide their own deflectors to get foreign channels, particularly the UK channels.  What role does the Minister see in this new system for such people? Is there any role that they can play in the provision of the new system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment very much on that possibility, beyond saying that there is clear evidence that a number of people involved in the provision of the services referred to by the Deputy have indicated their interest in forming conglomerates or groups to apply for these licences.  In some cases a number of the personnel so involved will be interested in this new system.  Beyond that, I cannot gauge what the future holds for them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications whether, under section 33 (2) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 he has sought to have included in the annual report of An Post, information on the cost-effectiveness and speed of delivery <Col N="2504" /> of letter and parcel post; whether he has sought information from An Post regarding their method of surveying speed of delivery since their independent surveys; and whether he has sought information from the company on the target to be achieved during the course of their current corporate plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications whether, in the light of the annual report of An Post he will be seeking further information regarding cost-effectiveness or in relation to policy bearing on any of the company's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 5 and Priority Question No. 57 together.</P>
      <P>The annual report of An Post is a comprehensive document which gives a wide range of information about their business and performance.</P>
      <P>An Post employ the service of a market research company to conduct regular independent surveys of the effectiveness of the postal service.  The results of these surveys are made available on request to my Department.  The board of An Post are considering the advisability of incorporating performance targets in their corporate plan and of publishing the results of the surveys of the effectiveness of the postal system.</P>
      <P>The company's annual report for 1986 indicated that An Post had delivered 90 per cent of letters on the working day after posting and that 80 per cent next-day delivery of parcels had been achieved. The 1987 annual report stated that implementation of productivity arrangements during the past year brought some teething problems, with the result that the improvement in service, achieved by An Post in recent years in some areas of its business was not fully maintained.  The company are tackling the problems and are determined to raise standards still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of discussions between the Department of Communications and An Post, I am satisfied that the company are giving the highest priority to the provision <Col N="2505" /> of high service standards in their mail services.  I will be seeking progress reports from the company from time to time.</P>
    <P>As regards parcel mail, the improvement in quality of service achieved in 1986 was maintained in 1987 and an independent study reported 85 per cent next-day delivery for internal parcels.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider it necessary at this stage to direct An Post to include specific information regarding cost-effectiveness in their annual report, pursuant to section 33 (2) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  I will, however, keep the position under review in the light of the progress reports on service standards, the effects of the company's productivity scheme and material furnished in the company's corporate plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, is it somewhat not in order to link a priority question with this specific question relating to speed of delivery of post?  That is rather unfair of the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle.  In relation to speed of delivery, in view of the fact that this has deteriorated from last year to this year, would the Minister not reconsider his decision not to impose requirements that targets be set for the company?  Is he satisfied with the fact that third parties who have carried out surveys of postal deliveries have found that the performance on postal delivery on the following day has deviated quite considerably from what is reported by An Post?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that I could say that I am satisfied with what would appear to be a deterioration in the service. Obviously, the progress which had been made in the first two years after the establishment of An Post in relation to this aspect of their affairs has not been maintained.  There is some public disquiet <Col N="2506" /> about that.  On the question of insisting on targets, very often this and various Governments are accused of interfering too much in the day-to-day operations of companies and that the companies would require greater flexibility to adapt to new situations.  That is the best course of action.  I am extremely conscious of the public disquiet in this area and very anxious to ensure that satisfactory progress is made at the very earliest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has abolished the users' council, he is the sole overseer of the consumers' interests in this area.  Does what he has said in eloquent terms not amount to saying that he is not going to do anything about this problem?  At the very minimum, he should require quarterly reporting from the board on the speed of delivery of different items and independent, noncommissioned studies of speed of delivery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this deterioration, which is evident to anybody who uses the postal services on a frequent basis, would the Minister not seek from the board monthly reports until they get back to their objective of having at least 95 per cent of letters delivered the next day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We can certainly consider that proposition, or perhaps others asking for not as frequent as monthly reporting.  One way or other, I hope the concern of Deputies will be allayed very soon when we see an improvement in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to performance in the semi-State and State sector over the past five or six years, there has been a very profound improvement. Almost all of these companies are now <Col N="2507" /> profit-making instead of loss-making. The level of the service has been monitored by the Departments under the regime of the previous Government. Would the Minister not accept that one of those innovations was that where there was a deviation from target, whether at service level or in profits, the Government would seek more frequent reports and take corrective action in order to see that the targets were reached?  This would ensure that we do not have the mess that we had in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated already the difficulties sometimes imposed on any organisation where constant demands for reports have become more important than the actual delivery of the service. This should be appreciated by the Deputy, as a former Minister.  I do not want to create that kind of situation.  I am, however, conscious of the deterioration to which I have referred and many of the Deputies are also concerned about this.  It arose mainly out of the new system's productivity arrangements which produced many teething problems. The time for solving those problems is long since over and the indications are that they are over and the progress can be made in this area.  I am prepared to review the situation as quickly as possible but not to set an agenda of continuous interference in day-to-day operations which could only exacerbate the very problems that we are trying to solve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Chair to bear in mind that this is my priority question.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the situation that postal charges here are currently 25 per cent dearer than in the EC?  Is he further satisfied that there has been no commitment from An Post to <Col N="2508" /> do anything about correcting that beyond the end of 1988?  Would he set for that company a target of moving to average European charges within a reasonable period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to make exact comparisons between this country and other European countries. There is no argument about the fact that our postal services are considerably dearer.  We have a low density population and a wide dispersal of those services around the country.  If we had a higher population some of those problems would be solved.  There has been no increase in these services since 1986 and we want to see a continual downward trend in this aspect of the services.  It may not be possible to compete on a cost comparative basis with the European mainland but it is fair to say that the cost of our services is still too high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will confirm the report that the Norwegian-backed fish farm, currently operating on Whiddy Island, County Cork, is to cease operations as a result of the proposed deal between the Government and the Nigerian State Oil Company with regard to the Whiddy oil terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2509" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fish farm operating on Whiddy Island.  A pilot project, to investigate the possibility of a full-scale fish farming operation was launched last year by a joint venture operation between INPC and Interaqua AS, a Norwegian company.  The pilot project was conducted in one of the crude oil storage tanks at the Whiddy Island oil terminal.  It is difficult to understand how discussions about the reactivation of Whiddy could lead to a cessation of the fish project as it has always been our intention to have Whiddy functioning again as an oil depot.</P>
      <P>I understand that the experience of the pilot project is being studied by both parties at present and I would expect to receive a report shortly from INPC concerning the viability or otherwise of a commercial fish farming project at the terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it has been publicly indicated by the entrepreneurs behind the pilot project that they cannot go ahead because of the uncertainty about the future use of the Whiddy oil terminal?  Is it not true that they were encouraged to go in there last year to start this pilot project, the intention being to provide a full fish farm to provide employment in the region, and that that is not now going to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that the notion behind having this pilot scheme was that if it proved to be successful it would develop into an industrial and employment creating opportunity. The problem is that we are awaiting a report from Interaqua in relation to this whole activity.  We were told that this report would be available in March.  So far it has not come to hand.  As soon as it does it will be considered and we will see where we can go from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that because of the way in which the Government have hyped up this proposal for the use of Whiddy Island, they have in effect chased away what would have been a worthwhile project for fish farming and that the probability is that the <Col N="2510" /> Nigerian oil proposal for Whiddy will not go ahead and that because the Government were seeking to get publicity for individual Ministers, they have now killed any possibility of establishing a fish farm on the island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  One way or the other, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not necessarily a fact that the Whiddy oil development and the fishery development should be in conflict.  It will be up to the local authority in carrying out their duties in relation to planning permission and so on to ensure that any development that takes place takes account of other natural facilities and resources there.  The Deputy should be more hopeful and confident that the two possibilities can be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the 48/18-1 gas find is that the discovery has not yet been declared commercial. However, I understand that it might be possible to establish commerciality by the successful drilling of further exploration wells in the vicinity of the discovery.</P>
      <P>In order to secure the drilling of these walls, I have outlined to the licence consortia concerned, through their operator BP, certain terms relating to production of gas in the event of a successful drilling programme leading to a development in the licensed area.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to me to release details of these terms which have been negotiated on a strictly confidential basis.</P>
      <P>There have been no oil or gas finds since September 1987, but this is hardly surprising in view of the fact that the 1988 drilling season has only just commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate why he considers it necessary to keep secret the arrangement being offered to the companies who are drilling and who will be extracting whatever gas or oil finds they make?  After all, the resources which they are being asked to locate and bring ashore are owned by the <Col N="2513" /> people of the State.  Surely we are entitled to know the terms on which these finds will be sold or given away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the context of contracts of this kind, going back over a long number of years, negotiations between Governments and private companies not just in this area but in others, confidentiality has always been upheld for good sound commercial reasons and in order to attract private companies into this whole area.  It seems that very often in breaking away from that tradition we would militate considerably against the potential development of that resource.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the new licensing arrangements which have been offered to companies have resulted in increased activity in relation to the search for gas and oil and that the terms being offered will encourage the bringing ashore of whatever finds are made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole purpose of the exercise &mdash; to be able to develop this resource for the country.  The indications are that there has been a considerable upsurge in interest and that upsurge in interest should ultimately lead on to the point where development of these resources can take place.  While there has been an upsurge in interest, it will be a long time before we see any real developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the state of the market for oil and gas at present and of the fact that it is highly unlikely that the commercial companies, the multinationals in particular, will be keen to bring ashore any finds unless they are extremely large, will the Minister of State agree that some new approach needs to be found which would lead to bringing ashore the oil and gas that has already been found which would be to the benefit of the country and not necessarily the huge multinationals carrying out the searches?</P>

That is what we hope will be achieved.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State not agree that an opportunity now exists to further improve the rate of planting in severely disadvantaged areas?  As the EC is now funding 70 per cent of the assistance, this should be encouraged by way of giving an increased grant.

      <P>I agree that an opportunity now exists to encourage private forestry developments throughout the country and, as I have said, we announced a number of initiatives in this regard which are bearing fruit.  The increase in applications over the past 12 months has been quite phenomenal and that is the reason for the delay in the payment of the grants.  The acceleration of the scheme has been such that the total amount of money paid in 1987 was the equivalent to that paid out under that scheme for the previous six years.  This increase has led to some delays and if the Deputy has one case in mind I will be glad to see that it is investigated and dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that at present we are trying to get as much international support as possible for the Government stance in relation to the closure of Sellafield.  We have been able to make some progress, though not sufficient, in relation to that matter.  We have to bear in mind that while the levels of emissions from Sellafield have been reduced they are still unacceptable.  The only satisfactory conclusion from an Irish point of view would be total closure.  That <Col N="2519" /> is a difficult task and we have to face up to considerable intransigence on the part of the British in relation to this matter.

      <P>What hopes has the Minister for a worthwhile outcome of the meeting of the Paris Commission this year?  I recall that last year the Minister, Deputy Burke, stated that that meeting would be of crucial importance to the people of Ireland and a significant milestone in the history of the State.  The outcome that we achieved last year was that the main proposal we put forward &mdash; the closure of Sellafield &mdash; was supported by only one delegation.  The other nine delegations voted against it.  Does the <Col N="2520" /> Minister think that the position this time will be any different as presumably it will be the same delegates who will be at the Commission this time around?  As the Minister knows, we have talked about Sellafield on many occasions in this House.  Will he not agree that we need to take much more effective action than going to these conventions?  While they are worthwhile, all we seem to get from them is sympathy.  Will the Minister agree that we must, as I have said before, take legal action against the offenders?  Unfortunately, my priority question on this subject was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle today.  The Minister has said in this House that he has referred to the Attorney General the matter of the legal options that are available to us.  The Minister confirmed in this House three months ago that he would be in a position very shortly to make a decision about legal action.  Will the Minister not agree now that until such time as we do that we will make no effective progress in relation to pollution from Sellafield and other nuclear plants in the UK?</P>

Surely the Minister could invite INPC to come before the committee and to be subject to whatever examination the committee wish to carry out <i>in camera.</i> This would not have an adverse effect on the payment of legal fees, which is the reason they did not come before the committee since 1983.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy when he expects that the ESB, Bord Gáis Éireann and their urban gas subsidiaries will supply energy to consumers at or below average EC levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that when the latest material on electricity prices is published by the International Union of Produceres and Distributors of Electrical Energy, it will reveal that, on average, Irish electricity prices compare favourably with those in other European countries. Continued monitoring and continued pressure will be maintained in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Natural gas will continue to be supplied at prices competitive with the cost of alternative fuels on the Irish market. Recent surveys have suggested that Irish industrial gas prices are now among the lowest in Europe.  In relation to the domestic sector, the customer profile and appliance density is quite different from that in Europe and, accordingly, avearge European prices are not an appropriate yardstick for domestic gas prices here. <Col N="2525" /> However, I undestand that domestic gas customers with higher than average consumption, i.e., in the range of 600.- 1,000 therms per annum, are getting gas at approximately the European average price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the situation where the normal Dublin gas consumer is paying about £60 a year more for gas than he would pay in Europe?  In relation to electricity prices, when the Minister mentions averages, does he mean that we will no longer have the situation that 99 per cent of industry is paying 13 per cent in excess of the European averages and only a very small proportion of large users are competitive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the fist part of the Deputy's question, I cannot say I would be happy with that situation.  As I indicated, the customer profile here is very different from that in the United Kingdom.  Looking at the figures here we see the average UK consumer uses as much as five times that of the Irish consumer. This in itself creates an economy of scale problem.  Maybe that can be remedied in time but I am happy everything possible is being done to provide this service at an economic rate.</P>
      <P>Looking at the position in Europe, we are about middle of the league.  That is not the best position to be in, the charges in half the Community countries are higher, including Germany.  We have made some improvement in this area but there is scope for further advancement.</P>

Does the Minister expect the House to believe he is happy that everything possible is being done when we look at these figures? Will he not set targets for parity to be achieved within a reasonable period by these two State companies?</P>

      <P>The Government are continually monitoring the position.  The ESB have a number of proposals for further rationalisation and ultimately they will have to be considered in the context of their impact on communities throughout the country.  There has been a considerable reduction in ESB prices in recent years.  Progress is being made.  I am not saying it is entirely satisfactory but we will press to ensure that this downward trend in energy prices, in association with the drop in oil prices, will be reflected more and more as the services are rationalised and improved?</P>

      <P>The NBST Investory of Energy Research, Development and Demonstration projects shows a total expenditure of £2,864 million under these headings by a variety of agencies in 1986. A significant part of that expenditure was undertaken by my Department and the agencies with which they are associated. <Col N="2527" /> While the expenditure by the Department, as provided for in their Vote, has declined in recent years, I am satisfied that it is adequate in a time of budgetary constraints.  It should be noted that the benefit of these expenditures is not confined to any one year; their contribution to the economy is cumulative over a long period of time.  We are concentrating on activities which can show real tangible results.  The primary purpose is to provide expert advice and assistance to energy users in all sectors of the economy to guide them in the optimum use of energy resources most appropriate to their particular circumstances.</P>

I do not have the figures available but we can assume that as a percentage of our gross national product the investment in conservation is quite low.  Nevertheless, quite a lot of study has been carried out.  If in industry and at domestic level we were to implement recommendations already put forward we would be making considerable progress, as has been indicated in a number of other areas in the economy.  It is not simply a question of continuing research. We have to put into effect recommendations that have been made in regard to this.  We will continue to invest as much as we can in areas of potential within budgetary constraints.</P>

The figures he quoted do not only deal with research. They also concern application and that is <Col N="2528" /> the only way such recommendations will get into operation.  Is it not the case that we are 20 per cent more intensive users of energy per £1 of income than the rest of the EC and that we have only a tiny fraction, about one-seventh, of the effort to do something about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was referring to the shortsighted policies of the farming organisations in not promoting reinvestment in product diversification, particularly in the milk sector.  This lack of diversification has created all sorts of problems for the dairy sector.  Over-supply of milk, not just in Europe but throughout the world, has meant that the traditional products we produce are not wanted in the market place.  The only way that one can sell products is to have a market for them and, certainly, there has not been a buoyant market in the past seven or eight years for butter and skimmed milk powder.  I accept it is difficult to advocate that people should take less and that many farmers could not afford to take much less than they are getting for their milk. However, in the interests of long term investment and, therefore, in the interests of their future, and their childrens' future, farmers and farming organisations should have had as their first priority a campaign of reinvestment. They should not have been thinking of <Col N="2573" /> creaming off the maximum profit, taking the highest possible price.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that dairy farmers in Holland and Denmark, two countries which are comparable to ours, have done so well because they were prepared to reinvest.  They did not demand the highest price for their products.  In fact, they were prepared to take a little less and use the amount deducted for research and development.  I should like to emphasise the point by recalling a conversation I had with the Danish Minister for Agriculture shortly after the super-levy was introduced three years ago.  He told me farmers and milk processors in his country had been complaining bitterly that their milk quotas were not high enough not because they wanted to produce more butter and skimmed milk powder but because they could not fulfil their orders for soft cheeses on the American market. They did not have sufficient milk to make products which were in demand on world markets.  That is the key to the success of the Dutch and the Danes.  They converted their milk into something which could be sold freely.  They did not have to push their milk into intervention as butter or skimmed milk powders.  As a result they were not getting 75p per gallon for their milk but about £1 per gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are other contributory factors besides the fact that they were producing a product which was very saleable, such as collection costs.  Our overhead costs are high compared with the same services in those countries in relation to electricity and transport charges. Our economy is expensive in relation to producing commodities.  Other countries invested money in making sure that they produced something which they could sell.  The people in the forefront of the agricultural industry in this country should have had, as their primary concern, the production of goods which could be sold.  If anyone wants a short answer as to why we have had considerable difficulty in regard to our low milk prices, it is because we have adopted the wrong approach.  We have not been business-like, taken hard decisons and invested in something which will sell. <Col N="2574" /> After a long time, it has been recognised that our policy has been foolish and short-sighted.</P>
    <P>Rather than hammering the Minister for Agriculture and the Government and complaining bitterly about how bad things are, some of those people would be better advised to face up to reality and to conduct their affairs in a business-like manner.  I do not mind being bashed by the farming organisations and I am sure the Minister does not mind either. Indeed, sometimes it is enjoyable and some blood-letting every now and then does no harm even if it is your own blood that is being spilt.  The main thing is to tell the truth and let them like it or lump it.  We should not pander to irresponsible and unreasonable people.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for research, which was the overriding responsibility of An Foras Talúntais, one of the bodies which is to be amalgamated into the new super organisation, Teagasc.  We certainly need research and development but we must question whether the money is spent in the wisest possible manner.  The fact that you might be reducing the amount of money spent does not necessarily mean that you are doing a bad day's work for the country.  Money can be spent in smaller amounts if it is spent more wisely and prudently and I have no doubt that there is room for curtailing services and economising in certain sectors.</P>
    <P>I have a fairly pungent point of view so far as research and development are concerned.  I do not wish to be offensive to anyone in research organisations but, as I have scientific qualifications, I know that the zeal for research and development diminishes rapidly when you reach the age of 35 or 40.  In the old days, they used to tell us we were over the top when we were 40 but a lot of us do not like to be reminded of that, especially when we are over 50 years of age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on having reached the age of 50 the other day.  The zest <Col N="2575" /> and zeal for research and development diminishes as one gets on in years.  People got older together in An Foras Talúntais and there should be a system whereby people work on contract instead of getting pensionable jobs.  When they are taken in from universities, regional technical colleges or higher institutions of technology it should be on a contract basis and strictly laid down that they work until the age of 35 or 40 at that particular assignment.  However, they should be paid extraordinarily well because those are the years when people have the energy, courage and imagination to do what is necessary.  Experimental physicists and scientists in any field are a diminishing force &mdash; there are exceptions &mdash; once they get on in years and there should be other avenues open to them, primarily in an administrative capacity, when they get past that age.  I know I am generalising but I hope the point is taken. People are good at that type of job when they are young but their powers diminish as the years go by.</P>
      <P>It might be worth considering a reorganisation of the whole area and the energies of young people coming out of college should be used.  There should be a continuous infusion of young people and new ideas to research units so that their ambitions are not stultified as happens at present.  There is not sufficient inflow and movement out.  If we want creativity and new ideas, we must have new blood in large quantities.  Perhaps some people will be offended by my remarks but it is a fact of life.  For instance, in the area of research and development, a vast amount of money was spent about eight years ago in University College, Cork, in building a huge new research and development unit for the dairy and meat processing industries. I do not know if the Minister visited the unit but, if not, it would be worth his while to do so because it is alarming to see under-utilisation of that resource.  It is not being used as it should be or to its maximum potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Varying reasons have been given for <Col N="2576" /> this and the one advanced most frequently was that the six big co-operatives and the meat processors were afraid that their secrets would become known if they were to use a freely accessible facility like that.  That argument is not very convincing and the reason it is under-utilised is that a lazy attitude prevails.  People wanted to continue producing butter and skimmed milk powder and to export car-case beef instead of processing.  It is alarming to think that our research and development effort has been sadly lacking in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to see some co-operatives diversifying into the type of products which the Dutch and the Danes do so well, for instance, the manufacture of soft cheeses which sell on continental Europe and Britain.  Indeed, they sell particularly well in the United States.  I know the Minister attended a ceremony in my constituency a few weeks ago where such a project, a partnership between Waterford Co-operative and a Dutch concern, Wiessan, got off the ground. The soft white cheese manufactured there will be sold for export in the US. That is the type of enterprise we need in the dairy industry.  It is only a drop in the ocean in comparison to what we need overall but at least it is heading in the right direction.  Waterford Co-operative now will be in a position to convert something like 33 per cent of all their milk into cheese, and if we had a national average of 33 per cent milk conversion into cheese we would not be doing too badly.  We would still be miles behind the Dutch and the Danes but we would make a significant impact.  We should be setting goals and targets for four or five years hence such as 50 per cent of all milk into cheese and ten years hence 65 per cent. We had reached a stage where we were not dependent on storage or intervention for any of these milk products and we should be setting such targets.</P>
    <P>We are instinctively a conservative race.  We never get great change in a short time whether in methods of producing products or in voting for political parties. You will not get a massive swing.  You <Col N="2577" /> might get it from Fine Gael to Fianna Fáil or <i>vice versa</i> or to the Progressive Democrats but you will not get it to the left.  We do not shift so easily, but that is a handicap when it comes to product development and innovation.  One thing we have been preaching for years that is taking on only very slowly is the necessity to move into areas where there is not over-production within the EC.  The obvious area for the past five or six years where there should have been massive increased production was sheep.  Only very slowly have people come to accept that there is a future in that area.  It is very aggravating to find that you almost have to drag people along to get them to change from systems of over-production into areas where there is under-production.</P>
    <P>An interesting comparison is to be drawn if one looks at the systems of farming not just in Holland or Denmark but with our next door neighbour, Britain, and England particularly.  About 25 years ago if you drove through the southern counties of Britain you would have seen the primary system of farming was beef production.  When they entered the EC and the prices for grain was guaranteed, away went the hedgerows, ditches and fences and mass production of grain came about.  They milked that system to the utmost and the result is now there is to be a restriction on the production of grain because not just the British but the French have produced so much grain that we cannot get rid of it, just as we have a surplus of milk.  The British also got on the milk train because of the guaranteed prices.  They changed from store cattle and beef into milk and grain and caused a great number of problems, but they were using a system which was readymade for abuse, if you can call it abuse &mdash; exploitation perhaps would be a more correct expression.  We did not do that. We were too slow to change and it has cost us dearly.  With all the advisory services in the world and all the research and development you can bring people only so far.  The bulk of the effort must come from themselves.  That is why one often wonders whether the money we <Col N="2578" /> spend on advisory, research and development services is well spent.  That is debatable.</P>
    <P>Invariably the people the adviser goes to are the good farmers because it is a pleasure to go to them.  There is not much point in going to a fellow 20 times when he seems to agree with one and then turns round and does nothing.  It is very difficult to haul somebody like that into the 20th or 21st century.  The advisory services, as I suppose is only natural, concentrate on the better farmers, the younger ones who are prepared to change, but that large group who are not prepared to change can make life so difficult and make our agriculture and industry drag so much.</P>
    <P>In my period as Minister I visited most of the research centres in the country. Johnstown Castle was one I never got around to.  I recommend that the Minister does not cut back on Grange, which is the beef station.  I saw two very interesting projects emanating from Grange, or perhaps it was at Tully; I am not sure &mdash; my lips are sealed on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Grange. However, one of the projects is the fast fattening beef project where finished beef can be produced in as little as 18 months to two years.  That has attractions in this country.  The second project is twin calving. I was told three or four years ago that the twin calving concept was a success experimentally and that within a very short time it should be successful on the farm, but I do not know if that has happened. The name &ldquo;twin calving&rdquo; speaks for itself; you get two instead of one.  I would like the Minister to inquire if that has ever been translated to activity on the farm.  I have my doubts.  Is it just not feasible?  Can it be done only under experimental conditions or are some producers adopting that practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oak Park and Johnstown between them deal with grass and cereal products. So many better projects or advancements <Col N="2579" /> I have seen have arisen not because of initiatives taken by research units but because of the ingenuity of individual farmers.  Winter cereals were pioneered, as far as I remember, some years ago by some of the better tillage farmers and reclamation of mountain areas was pioneered by people who became involved in a new method of ploughing called deep ploughing which has brought land which heretofore was only fit for grazing into use as top quality grassland.  Quite often these advancements have been made not because of innovation in the institutions but because of the ability of individuals.</P>

      <P>I hope we can advance a common cause here.  This morning I was strongly criticised by a member of Fine Gael for not getting this legislation through the House.  I remind the House that the Bill was introduced on 3 February.  It is quite clear that despite requests from all the farm organisations and all interested bodies, the Opposition intend not to allow this legislation through.  They know that in the weeks ahead I will be engaged in negotiations on prices and will be unable to be here. They should at least be honest and acknowledge that the delay is due entirely to their obstructionist tactics.  Let them communicate with the farm organisations, ACOT and the Agricultural Institute and tell them why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reference earlier to the horticulture industry.  Of all the misinformed and ill-informed comment which we hear about the agricultural industry, the balderdash which is spewed out repeatedly about the disastrous state of the horticultural industry is the worst. With a population of 3.5 million we do not have a great home market for horticultural produce.  The continentals have on their doorstep within the Community, without considering the neutral countries or the eastern bloc, a market of 260 million. Britain has a population of 60 million. Obviously mass production methods will succeed in those areas but they will not necessarily succeed here because the domestic market is the primary market for any system of bulk production of that nature.</P>
      <P>In addition to the limited home market we have a very serious problem as regards climate.  About two years ago the Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture referred to the marvellous climatic advantage we have for producing various products.  I have never heard a more misinformed statement.  We suffer a tremendous disadvantage in regard to most products in the horticulture sector.  That is a serious limiting factor.  The effects of mass production on the Continent have serious implications here when dumping takes place as a result of over-supply on continental and British markets.  It is very difficult for commercial growers here to produce apples, potatoes or some of the more common vegetables when refrigerated meat lorries, having brought their loads to Britain or the Continent, can return with produce obtained at give-away prices, thereby undermining the domestic market.  It is a real problem but it is totally unreasonable to complain that we should not have to import this or that commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We export 80 per cent of our agricultural produce.  If we cannot tolerate the fact that some agricultural produce is <Col N="2582" /> coming into the country, we deserve to be ridiculed.  Competition is a two-way process.  We have a problem with horticultural produce because of the small home market and the climatic conditions which it is not easy to overcome.  I wish the best of luck to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food who has responsibility for horticulture.  It is a very difficult area.  We will always have the Dutch and other efficient producers to deal with.</P>
    <P>In hindsight, I do not agree with the method of appointment of the new board of Teagasc.  I learned from hard experience that it is not a good idea to give what are called representative bodies the entitlement to nominate a member to a board.  It leads to poor, dreary boards, quite often made up of people who are over the top.  It would be far better if all ten members of the board were nominated by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I am proposing.  What is being contested is that the farm organisations say they should nominate their people.  I am proposing the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read it in the Bill five members are nominated by the Minister and five are nominated by the Minister following consultation with representatives of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I call upon the Minister to make sure that he does not have foisted upon him people who are being rewarded for turns done over the years because that has been my experience in the past. Boards tend to be cluttered up with people who are being rewarded under the old pals act and that does not make for good management.  It would be far better for the Minister to go in there and pick his ten people on a totally objective basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will then take the consequences.  If the board is a success nobody will thank him but if it is a failure he will take the rap anyway.  I know Deputy Nealon has to make a long trek back to the west which he does now and again, so with that I wish the board the best of luck.  Even with reduced financing, if the whole thing is carried out with goodwill and with the best interests of agriculture at heart, it can succeed even with reduced financing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking a quick passage to this Bill and I am certainly not going to hold it up.  I never wish to speak beyond giving the absolute essentials of what I have to say.  Indeed I am one of the people in favour of the American system whereby one can write one's speech into the records of the House and have it read by anyone interested afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should use his powers to repair some of the damage and the chaos he has caused by the total lack of preparation for the introduction of this Bill. There are grounds for rationalisation and there are areas where economies can be made.  There is no doubt about that.  But this idea of the amalgamation was produced without any preparatory work.  It was done in the Rambo days of the Government when they were slashing at any institution who seemed to provide <Col N="2584" /> some sort of a saving, including An Foras Forbartha and some other excellent bodies as Ministers vied with each other to see who could cut the most and come back to their Taoiseach to tell him what good boys they were.</P>
    <P>My concern is in a very specific area. All the general areas have been covered very well in a long speech with points made very cogently by our spokesman on Agriculture, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and now in an excellent speech by the former Minister, Deputy Deasy.  So I will confine myself to the question of research in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any objection to that?  Is there any objection to me going out and defending the sole centre of research work in my constituency?  There will be none when the Minister is finished and that is the problem because it is the Minister's intention, and I believe the decision has already been made, to get rid of the Ballinamore station and the Creagh station, thereby wiping out the entire research facilities in the west with this Bill.  That is the reason I am here now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am continuing and I am continuing very effectively, rebutting the Minister who is trying to make a petty, cheap point.  There is not a man who defends his own constituency better than the Minister does in Tipperary North. We saw that when he was extending the disadvantaged areas across the Shannon for the first time &mdash; he is the man who claimed credit for that &mdash; and now he is seeking to gag me as I seek to make a point for my constituency.  I will make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My belief is that as soon as this Bill <Col N="2585" /> goes through it will mark the dead end of research in the west.  My concern here, and I make absolutely no apologies for it, is mainly the Ballinamore Research Centre in County Leitrim.  I defend it primarily because it is in my own constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, as my constituents would expect me to do and as the farmers in the west would expect me to do.  I defend it also because of the jobs &mdash; not as many as at Johnstown Castle at Oak Park or at Creagh but jobs nonetheless where jobs are very badly needed. I defend it most of all because of the impact and the contribution Ballinamore has made towards research for a particular part of the country where research was badly needed and was not being duplicated in any other part of this country or in any other country abroad.  The Ballinmore Research Station was established in 1959 to investigate the agricultural use of heavy clay soil and the drumlins of north central Ireland.  I first came in contact with it myself in the late sixties when I did a television programme on it.  I was greatly impressed, not only with the expertise which I knew existed within An Foras Talúntais, but with the utter and total dedication of the people working there to their jobs.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister seeks to interrupt me.  There was no interruption when his own back benchers spoke and spoke long but very often not to the point.</P>
    <P>To get back to my theme, the original objectives of the Ballinamore station was to investigate the role of drainage and fertiliser practice in soil improvement. This in turn was subsequently expanded to cover most aspects of farming of heavy land.  Heavy land, or the type of land with which this is involved, comprises 4,000 square miles or 20 per cent of the land of Ireland and if that is not relevant to this debate I would like the Minister to tell me what is.  This type of land is chiefly in Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and parts of Mayo, Clare and west Galway. Also relevant are all marginal lands in this country and they comprise 49 per cent or virtually half the entire land of the country.  The Ballinamore station is working for that, has been working very <Col N="2586" /> successfully over many years, yet the Minister objects to me talking about it and calls it a parochial issue.</P>
    <P>The past activities of this organisation in Ballinamore were in dairying where they were particularly active, increasing the stocking rate of their own activities from a level of one livestock unit per five acres to one livestock unit per one and a half acres.  All aspects of dairy husbandry were investigated with emphasis on breeding, nutrition and disease control, particularly as regards the marginal land or the less favoured land, perhaps not including the valleys and the good parts of Tipperary but including parts of north Tipperary in the Minister's own constituency. Yet the Minister objects to me talking about the research centre which is working hard and hardest for them.</P>
    <P>Drainage in particular is the area in which Ballinamore made its name and for which it became famous not only nationally but internationally.  The gravel tunnel drainage system was developed at Ballinamore.  This was a breakthrough in effective drainage of unstable clay soils. There were also intensive studies carried out of conventional moor drainage to determine all the relevant factors for effective and economic use of these systems. Surface drainage studies were also carried out.  Developments pioneered, developed and researched there are now being used all over the country so far as drainage is concerned, but not as much as I would like to see.</P>
    <P>The people across the Border in Fermanagh, Tyrone and in other parts of the North in similar types of soil took up the result of the research work at Ballinamore more enthusiastically than many of our own farmers and we wish them luck.  It is another example of the type of work which is being done there and is not duplicated anywhere else on the Continent or elsewhere.  It is a particular type of research for that type of soil.  Ballinamore were involved in grassland improvements, trials to study appropriate grass species for heavy land, together with the optimum use of lime and fertilisers for silage in pasture levels. <Col N="2587" /> Simple cheap systems of re-seeding were also studied.</P>
    <P>As far as the environment is concerned, and this is becoming a major issue at present &mdash; and is the concern of the Minister for the Environment &mdash; studies were carried out on pollution in Counties Leitrim and Cavan, through the Ballinamore centre, to formulate appropriate rates and times of application of artificial fertilisers so as to avoid pollution. New emphasis is being put on pollution and rightly so.  I give due credit to the Minister for the Environment for the work that is being done and has been done and which they are capable of doing in the future in Ballinamore.  It is now of even greater significance and it is not a parochial issue.  It is a national issue and is of national importance to our tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ballinamore they have developed a modification of conventional farm machinery so as to operate effectively on soft hilly ground with minimum surface damage.  The fruits of these studies, as we all know, were most apparent during the bad years of 1985 and 1986 when Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture, unlike the benevolent sunshine which so far has favoured the present Minister for Agriculture and Food.  With the fine weather which we have at present he should not be so testy in the Dáil on this day when Deputies are making a routine contribution to an important Bill and which is very important as far as my area is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballinamore has also worked on the amenity studies and the highly successful sand carpet all-weather playing field design was developed.  This <Col N="2588" /> system is widely used at present.  That is a fact that is not widely known.  As far as contract work is concerned, they are now getting contracts from many outside bodies in the sphere of drug testing, arterial drainage, dairy effluent disposal and Third World development.  The latter was referred to earlier by Deputy Jim Higgins.  They are also involved in studies of alternative energy and in the evaluation of wind energy.  This has been conducted very successfully at the station.</P>
      <P>What are the present activities?  What is happening on the ground?  What is envisaged for the future?  As far as dairying is concerned, the emphasis is on quality and quantity of grass produced both for silage and pasture so as to obtain maximum output with minimum use of concentrates.  Attention to breeding and disease control is also being given priority.</P>
      <P>Various systems of drainage, from which they made their name and for which they continue to be famous are being investigated.  Particular emphasis is put on shallow mooring as a routine amelioration technique for surface compaction. These studies are part of an EC-funded national project and as such are drawing money from outside and are not a burden on the State to any great extent.</P>
      <P>Studies are being carried out on grassland to establish the optimum rates and times of application of fertilisers for grassland in drumlin areas, to determine grass species most suitable to drumlin soils and climate, to evaluate a new source of fertiliser nitrogen, to formulate climatic-soil model for use in determining rate of grass growth and to establish an economic and effective technique of grassland reseeding.</P>
      <P>In the area of mixed stocking, they are very active to establish an economic return from a mixed stocking enterprise of sheep and cattle.  With new emphasis on sheep over the entire western area, on which I am sure Deputy Kenny and, indeed, Deputy Higgins will be speaking later when they are dealing with Creagh, it is very valuable to have this study on mixed stocking performance.</P>

      <P>The performance of both these species was very satisfactory during 1987 and can be a basis for the expansion of output and the expansion of income in these difficult times for farmers in the west.  In relation to biomass, different species of trees and sedge are being studied as a possible alternative energy source.  Areas such as Leitrim and Sligo are very suitable for afforestation and are becoming a great centre of afforestation with parts of Mayo.  I hope that in due course our area will be rewarded for this development with the setting up there of the new headquarters of the semi-State body which will be in charge of forestry.</P>
      <P>In relation to farm machinery, further studies on the modification of conventional farm machines and the development of new ones suitable to drumlin soils are in progress.  Particular stress is being laid on cutting costs when effecting any such modification.  There is also a sheep and cattle policy.  Coming from a farming background and having watched farming over the years, I think that in the area of housing cattle and sheep we are far behind.  This is an area in which there should be concentration and I am sure we will be helped out in the western package, whenever we find the details which are so mysterious at present &mdash; which as far as I can find out are non-existent &mdash; and are awaiting submission by the Government to Brussels. When they come we hope there will be some advantages.  Much of this has to do with funding and with a saving of money as far as the joint operation of ACOT and An Foras Talúntais is concerned. I praise that particular aim because we should be saving money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Ballinamore station, substantial receipts are being generated from the farm enterprises.  Additional funding comes from the EC and from the commercial and dairying industry.  In addition &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; the dairy co-operatives in the north-west have expressed a willingness to augment the dairy levy with a special fund for dairying-related work at Ballinamore. <Col N="2590" /> The North Connacht farmers, and the other co-operatives in this area, are concerned about the fate of Ballinamore which, unless there is a special order by the Minister, will be a victim of this amalgamation. The dairy co-operatives are very concerned about this because to a great extent their future as well as the future of the small dairy farmers of the west, depends on the continuing work of research and the increasing output from limited resources and limited lands.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  There have been a number of recommended projects for investigation, for example, the establishment of a suckler cow trial and alternative farm enterprises which would fit into an integrated rural development programme.  Both of those are in line with the Minister's own ideas as expressed by him recently and at the famous press conference in Castlebar. Another project is the forestry programme which was recommended in the County Leitrim Resource Survey published by An Foras Talúntais in 1972 and the development of a farmyard system to eliminate water pollution.  Down through <Col N="2591" /> the years Ballinamore station has become an institution in the area.  It has become part of the fabric of farming throughout the entire west.</P>

      <P>Good results have flowed from it catering for a specific kind of soil, a specific kind of farm and a specific type of small farmer which the Minister may disregard as being insignificant in his macro-plan but are of great importance to us in retaining the farming population of the west which is decreasing at such an alarming rate.  It would be tantamount to cutting off the future progress of large tracts of land and adversely affecting the future of many young people in the west who would be forced to emigrate if the research station were to go.  It is doing a type of work which is not done in any other part of the country.  It cannot be done in any other part of the country because of the type of soil.  Ballinamore is also doing a type of work which is not duplicated anywhere, as instanced by the fact that the Fermanagh farmers rely on the Ballinamore work as far as their drainage is concerned.  This work is not duplicated in Britain, on the Continent or anywhere else.  I would like the Minister, who has interrupted me so frequently, to give a guarantee concerning the future of Ballinamore.</P>
      <P>Also on a different and less contentious matter I hope he will make adequate provision, if not directly, in some other source for the funding and the continuation of the agricultural folk farm at Johnstown Castle if that is in any danger of being a victim of this amalgamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am not in the least interested in obstructing the passage of a Bill relating to agriculture, or indulging in any kind of filibustering.  I am the second speaker for the Labour Party, the first having been Deputy Stagg, our agricultural spokesman.  I have a particular interest in this Bill because of my meetings with the trade unions involved and with the IFA and because of a personal <Col N="2592" /> interest in the regionalised impact of research in agriculture in the 12 western counties.  This is an interest that goes back to the published work of Dr. John Scully and many later scholars.</P>
      <P>It would be wise to have as careful a debate as possible because of the implications of what we are deciding.  My main interest is in relation to the implications of the proposed legislation for the research and advisory functions in Irish agriculture.  It is important when considering such an aim that we draw a distinction between the maximum number of people whom we see in the future as living on farms &mdash; the farm family projected population, if you like &mdash; towards the end of the century and the prospects in agriculture as a sector.  There is a great difference, indeed.  For example, since our entry into the European Community, we have &mdash; and I would be willing to be corrected on this figure if it is inaccurate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;approximately 40,000 fewer farm families living off the land than we had before our entry.  At the same time, there has been growth in particular sections of the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>What is at stake, in terms of the legislation in the broadest sense, is the question whether the new agency first, will be adequately funded and, secondly, will have within its structure a sufficient research corps and advisory dissemination possibility as to be able to address the widest possible number of farmers who might want to make a living from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other element of the effect of the legislation on farm incomes.  It seems, for example, that given the reaction to the proposals so far and looking at the pattern of redundancies, many people who are in possession of special skills are leaving the semi-State or State sector in which they found themselves and now preparing to set up in consultancy services to sell their services <Col N="2593" /> back to a section of the farm population which they previously served.  There is no doubt that the purchase of these services makes economic sense for those in a position to purchase skills which have been developed over a very long period of time and often in the research setting created, purchased and developed by the State.  It is equally true to speak of the manner in which such services will not be available for those who are unable to purchase them on the market.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture last summer and was prepared to speak on the last occasion on which this Bill came before the Dáil and have some sympathy for the Minister who would like to see some resolution of this matter, I am sure.  We are dealing with the operation of the Dáil and certainly I would agree with the Minister in thinking that we should have had this Bill discussed before now, that the delay has been inordinate.  However, I am not in charge of the ordering of Dáil business, any more than the Minister or spokespersons over here are.</P>
    <P>The other side of this Bill, a knock-on effect from the consequences on jobs, the actual manner in which research will be carried out and information disseminated and the effect on incomes, is the effect on productivity.  Productivity falls into two broad sections within the agricultural community at present.  I would in many ways welcome the emphasis that the present Government have put on the employment potential of the food industry.  That is simply harnessing the value-added element from primary agricultural purpose in a way that will create jobs and economic activity give a valuable boost to our exports and so forth.</P>
    <P>There are again two sides to this argument. You need to have a research base to develop new products, a research base that deals with propagation to actual marketing. Also, you must ask what section of the farming community and agricultural community will benefit in terms of income enhancement and so on.  I got the impression, from looking for a very <Col N="2594" /> long time at the debate about the structure of farm income which goes back to Dr. Atwood's work and the work of such others, that there are two special and separate arguments going on.  One is an argument on the commercial side of agriculture and the other deals with what is very often little beyond the subsistence side of Irish agriculture.  Certainly, the concerns of those involved in innovative products within an expanding agricultural sector who address the questions such as adequate capital provision are very different from the concerns of others who are interested very often simply in survival.</P>
    <P>It is not a criticism of any one Government but of several that very often people involved in that second category of survival have found themselves in great difficulty as the emphasis has swung from one agricultural product to another, almost without any policy determination. They and the people who have advised them, the agricultural advisers, have asked for longer term planning.  It is difficult to predict and supply this in many ways, given the present state of the European market.  It would have been, and is, possible to have some kind of indicative product targets which would have assisted such farmers and such advisers. I do not want to talk only of Galway, but I live there and have had meetings with agricultural officers, with staff of institutes involved and with farmers.  The point that was borne home to me from all these meetings was that the agricultural adviser will find himself or herself more and more gathering money to justify his or her activities.  I asked one person how this worked out on the ground.  They more or less had one rule of thumb that you would make one call and if the charge was not forthcoming you would not go back.  The fact of the matter is that the projected impact of the cuts, for example, affecting the new merged body and the changed nature of the delivery of services will be that an enormous number of people will be deprived of services that they were previously getting.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what our responsibility is as legislators in this <Col N="2595" /> regard.  There has been a plethora of studies, particularly in relation to the 12 western counties.  That is one of the reasons for my rising to speak in this debate.  That consistent research has pointed to three separate sets of factors that change the nature of agricultural production in such countries and make them different from the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The first of these is in relation to soils. We have heard something of this from the previous speaker.  The second is in relation to the structural manner in which farms are held.  The farms are fragmented and parts are often remote from each other and so on.  The third is in relation to economic factors &mdash; production on a scale that does not make possible economies of scale.  Production is very often in low volumes, not bringing benefit as does for example large scale milk production in Munster.  The fourth and perhaps most important point in relation to the 12 western counties is that Professor Scully, in his day, drew attention to such matters as the educational take-up of those registered as owners of farms. Thankfully that has changed quite dramatically in recent times, but what has not changed is the basic age structure.</P>
    <P>In the 12 western counties there are a number of very elderly people in whom the farms are registered and there are also people who have particular difficulties in relation to handing on their farms.  There have been several attempts at addressing the question of the social structure of agriculture in the west of Ireland, but the measures have not been successful.  No less than three provisions implementing different European funding, addressed these problems, trying to assist transition in farm ownership from those who were elderly to those who might be more productive but those have not been successful, by and large.  There is a definitive work in this regard, that of Professor Michael Cuddy on the operation of the structural directives of the Community and their impact on west of Ireland agriculture.</P>
    <P>If we are going to talk about enhancing incomes, about a revised regional policy <Col N="2596" /> and about integrated rural development programmes and off-farm opportunities, it is a time for more advice rather than less, for more research and for more social research supplementing the basic physical research and so on.  Let us be in no doubt about what is taking place. There have been immense cuts in what has been proposed for agriculture.  The cuts are devastating in terms of their effects.  What we are dealing with in many cases is a new agency which is taking over the functions of two others but which is shedding 50 per cent of its staff.  It is also operating on a very considerable cut budget.  How can we meet the demand for new products at the top end of the consumer of agricultural research services, be it in terms of the conditions in which the product will emerge or in terms of marketing or of the infrastructural divisions for market access and so forth in that commercial centre for which I have expressed goodwill, if we are not going to supply many tens of thousands more people from farms at the survival end of agriculture?  How can we justify a massive cut in the research budget, a massive reduction in the number of research workers, a contraction in advisory services, and the removal of advisory and research services from any farmers other than those who can afford to pay them?</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that this is an argument I made before on the Estimates. The effect of conducting the dissemination of agricultural research and information on a market model has meant that it will be skewed in relation to the consumption of such services. Many people working within the service, faced with redundancies, see this already and they have decided to leave and sell their services privately to the more commercialised end of agriculture.  That is little less than tragic.  While it is possible in the short term to see some sectoral advantages if such displacement of resources resulted in innovations that were successfully marketed, it would mean a net employment impact on agriculture at farming level, at advisory level and at research level that would be little less than disastrous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2597" /> The most contentious statement made by a Minister for Agriculture in the history of this House was probably that of the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Paddy Hogan who said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you were going to say Deputy Austin Deasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I prefer to be very ecumenical and go right back.  Mr. Paddy Hogan said he would help the man who helped himself, more or less, and that the devil could take the other fellow.  He put the emphasis on the strong farmer and the potentially strong farmer.  Every Minister for Agriculture since then has been paying lip service to the notion of the potentially viable small farmer.</P>
      <P>An absolute furore was created in the country when there were various definitions as to the size of a viable farm.  I remember them clearly but the fact is that the impact of this proposed legislation is effective abandonment of many thousands of small farmers.  That is their fear and it is well based.  It is also the fear of those who work in the services.  Their remarks to me have been very clear.  At a meeting in Athenry I was asked if I could imagine what would happen and how many calls advisers would make compared to what they made now if they had to collect between £5,000 and £7,000 a year in charges.  The advisers were clearly of one mind.  There would be many thousands of farmers, perhaps one-third of all the farmers of County Galway who would now be deprived of services. It is not correct to use research and advice funded by the public purse in a way that is entirely determined by one part of the market.  It would be much better, rather than having charges, to bring farmers up to the level of productivity so that when they passed an income threshold they could be taxed fairly like everybody else who earns an income.  That would be a much more equitable and acceptable way of addressing the question of taxing farm incomes for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the reaction to the proposed legislation that has been communicated to us from farming <Col N="2598" /> organisations, from the staff, from their trade unions, I was impressed by one aspect of the argument which was that people wanted to retain research and saw the merit of there being an increasing allocation for research.  It is said in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that we are hoping to gain employment from the food industry.  I support that strategy. For far too long we have, in losing value-added, lost the employment potential from many of our primary products in agriculture.  For example, taking the 12 western counties, only a few years ago close to 70 per cent of total production was being exported without any value-added gains whatsoever.  In other words the 12 counties that were contributing most to emigration were exporting the capacity for job creation in the food industry.</P>
    <P>I warn that there is no possibility for a food industry to which all farmers might contribute and which would not be limited to the top end of commercial farmers, if the Bill goes ahead in its present form.  A way out for the Minister in relation to the merged bodies would have been to say that he was protecting the research and advisory functions in a very definite way within the new organisation. The Minister might reply that he has done this, but all I can say is that the practitioners and the consumers of the services feel that he has not done so.  On looking at the case I feel it is difficult to see how the Minister can say that that function has been protected, when there will be only half the number of staff and so much less public provision made for it.  It is very interesting to think of the other counties.</P>
    <P>There are positive aspects which should also be referred to.  Too often I listen to people in this House attacking public servants. I want to place on record my admiration for public servants, particularly the agricultural advisers and researchers.  The advisory service in County Mayo have trained 1,066 farmers through the 100 hour EC programmes; 2,000 are receiving an intensive advisory <Col N="2599" /> service and 6,000 are receiving specialised advisory services while 4,700 young farmers are currently being trained in ACOT's certificate in farming programme nationally.  Young people who want to look forward to a future in farming, who want to live in rural Ireland and who are interested in getting advice in relation to agriculture are the very people we will be building our integrated rural development programmes around because they have shown themselves to be open to the kind of skills, preparation and professionalism that will be required in agricultural production in a new era.</P>
    <P>To be very specific on a general point I made, the allocation to the new advisory and research service is, on paper, 44 per cent of last year's allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of being able to raise this issue.  I intend to ask a number of serious questions and I hope the response of the Government will be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Government launch an international diplomatic offensive to bring to an end the wanton dumping of waste, both toxic and radioactive, in the waters around this country. I understand that a recent proposal of the Spanish authorities to burn toxic waste off the south-west coast of Ireland is to be refused by the Government but I am not assured that attempts to discourage this form of dumping are successful, and I am not so assured for two reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there continue to be persistent reports of illegal dumping of such wastes <Col N="2600" /> into the seas off our coasts.  Secondly, there was a very anaemic, lack lustre and unsatisfactory submission made by the Government to the Second International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea earlier this year.  It was a submission which for some extraordinary reason received very little public attention in this country.  There continue to be reports that there is widescale dumping of various forms of refuse, some toxic and some radioactive, into the seas around this country.  Apparently, the Spanish intended to incinerate waste at a point some 300 nautical miles off our coast.  Being in the course of the Gulf Stream this would have inevitably resulted in some of its repulsive spin-off being deposited at some time or another along the west coast.  That is only one example of the international attitude towards Irish waters in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is now the most radioactive stretch of water in the world.  There are regular emissions from the Sellafield plant of contaminated water into the Irish Sea and, needless to say, this plant is the depository for refuse from all over the world.  Reports regularly come through from various organisations, including the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, who should know a little about these things which indicate that the seas off the south west coast are the regular dumping ground of such refuse.</P>
    <P>The Government on behalf of all the people of this country, with the unstinted and unqualified support of every party in this House, should say to everybody who is interested in listening and at every international forum possible that we are not interested in having anyone's refuse, toxic or radioactive, deposited in the seas off our coasts.  I admit that this may be a little difficult to assert because we do a little bit of that ourselves but the Government should not be weak-kneed in their objections to it.  Let me quote from the statement submitted by the Government to the Second International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea:</P>
    <P>In relation to the disposal of wastes at sea, Ireland believes that for certain <Col N="2601" /> substances this option should be discontinued entirely bearing in mind the risks involved and the principle of precautionary action.  In the case of other substances, disposal at sea may still be regarded as the best environmental option, taking account of the implications for other environmental media; prior authorisation and appropriate environmental monitoring is, of course, essential in these cases, with uniform emission standards and/or the environmental quality objective approach being used, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is naive to think that such an approach could be monitored.  To think that countries who employ shipping contractors to get rid of waste from their own doorsteps at all costs are going to be concerned about the fine print of the kind referred to is so naive as to be totally unreal.  As a response to this issue it is inadequate. What is of even greater concern is the obvious implication in another part of that submission that the Government are out of tune with the wishes of the people and are not convinced that the seas around this country should not be used in this way.  I refer to the following:</P>
    <P>Ireland allows dumping at sea only where this option is considered environmentally acceptable and is the only practical solution available for disposing of the materials involved.</P>
    <P>I suggest that dumping at sea is not acceptable under any circumstances as it betrays a Philistine attitude to the environment and a cavalier attitude to resources which we all hold dear, not just on our own behalf but on behalf of generations yet unborn.  They are not ours to despoil or denigrate in any way. The attitude to which I have referred facilitates that kind of easy thinking.  There is a responsibility on those who create waste to ensure that a mechanism of ridding such waste is provided.  The statement also went on to state:</P>
    <P>In the case of industrial waste and sewage sludge, every application to dump at sea must give details of the consideration given to alternative <Col N="2602" /> methods of disposal and each dump site is monitored to ensure that there are no harmful effects on the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could tell us the number of such applications which have been received by his Department and the nature of the monitoring.  It is hard enough for us to monitor essential needs within the health services and other areas without pretending that on the high seas where we cannot deal with people marauding for fish, we are going to be able to deal with people who come like thieves in the night and dump their thrash.  The statement went on to say:</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, a cessation of sea dumping of those substances could lead to an increase in illegal discharges to the marine environment from land based sources...</P>
    <P>How can the Minister explain that one-third of all toxic wastes created in our own society have no explainable destination at present?  In the literature on this subject, there is ample evidence to indicate that the ultimate destination of something in the order of one-third of toxic waste created in our society is a mystery.  Of course it is not a mystery to those of us who are out and about in the world; it is simply dumped into rivers, sewers, drains, coastal areas and anywhere that is far removed from the home base of the person who has generated that kind of obnoxious refuse.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most upsetting part of the submission was the statement: &ldquo;In relation to incineration at sea&rdquo;, which is the precise subject of the Spanish application, &ldquo;Ireland considers that, on the basis of the data presented to date, there is insufficient evidence either to permit, or to justify, the termination of this disposal option for the limited quantities and types of wastes involved.&rdquo;  Leaving aside for a moment the impossibility of this Government or any Irish Government to be able to be specific about the types and nature of the wastes involved &mdash; we cannot even do that in the context <Col N="2603" /> of incineration in our own communities &mdash; I want to strongly state to the Minister that he and the Government are not representing public concern and the public view in this regard if he says that it is Government policy, as apparently it is according to this statement, that there is insufficient evidence to justify the termination of this disposal option.  That is not what the public believe and it is not in accordance with the facts.  The reason our coastal areas are being used by international conglomerates and other Governments to deposit their waste is because they know it is harmful and deleterious to their own communities and they do not want it near them.  Apparently anything is good enough for a Government who are not willing to take a stand against this kind of international dumping.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest that the work of people such as the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, the various national and international conservation groups such as Greenpeace and others who have a very good track record in some of these areas and the work of many right-minded thinking people, along with the available literature and scientific evidence, is proof of there being an immediate need for the Government to address the problem of dumping and incineration at sea within the general precincts of this country.  I include in that ambit any area within a range of hundreds of miles.  Personally, I would go out further.  It does not really matter whether it is the coast of Japan or the coast of Ireland that is involved, dumping at sea is obnoxious to all right-minded people.  It is an offence to all of us when wastes, toxic and radioactive, are dumped into the seas.  We are all citizens of one small planet and actions committed by any State or any Government in one part of it in this context have long-lasting effects and in some cases have genetic implications and certainly transcend the generations and the nationalities involved.  It affects all of us because we are neighbours on this small planet.</P>
    <P>Ireland in economic terms, specifically <Col N="2604" /> has, a marketing and an environmental edge.  It is still perceived to be a green clean land despite our best efforts to undo some of those perceptions.  Even from a selfish motive, which is not the one I predominantly advance, we should not succumb to the temptation to simply turn our backs on something and stay quite about it because we feel that somehow we will not be playing the international game.  I am saying to the Minister there is nothing more important to the future of this country than the quality of our environment and the quality of our environment is being undermined by the ease with which this Government are facilitating the international attitude that it is all right to dump rubbish in Ireland. That attitude has to be addressed.  The Minister will have the support of every Member in this House if he takes a hard stand against such a philistine and destructive philosophy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to formally commence a campaign of diplomatic offensive tactics to bring home to Governments all over the world that we are not to be the repository of the dirt of other nations, that we will simply not tolerate it, that we will raise objections at every conceivable diplomatic level and that we will work with other similar minded partners in Europe and around the world to ensure that these practices come to an end so that anyone who sees Ireland as a soft option in that regard will know that it is no longer the soft option it is now preceived to be.</P>
    <P>I am particularly upset by the submission to the Conference on the Protection of the North Sea.  Representing Government view, it is at best very weak-kneed and very half-baked.  It in no way shows a trenchant attitude to environmental defence.  It does not indicate the genuine concern that exists, the kind of concern that was voiced earlier this week by responsible doctors who told us precisely the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster or the kind of concern of many people about the fragile envelope that covers us environmentally.  I ask the Minister to commence such a campaign, <Col N="2605" /> to seek the active support and co-operation of other parties in this House and to launch that campaign at every forum, nationally and internationally.  It is simply intolerable that the Government, on behalf of the people, should allow it to be voiced abroad that in their view there is insufficient evidence to justify the termination of this disposal option.  That is not acceptable.  I say to the Minister, with absolute conviction and with the belief that 99 per cent of the people agree with my view on this, we want to say to people who are engaged in international despoliation that it is fundamentally wrong wherever it happens and, as far as we are concerned, we will not tolerate it.</P>
    <P>The response to the Spanish incineration at sea proposal has been reported at third hand in the media and is not even the subject of what I would call a broadside from the Government.  If it was not leaked, it certainly limped its way out of a Government Department.  It is not the kind of response that is called for in these circumstances.  This country and its immediate environment is not to be used in this way and we should not be apologetic or half-willed about it.  According to last evening's <i>Evening Press</i> the Government are to refuse permission to the Spanish authorities to burn toxic waste of the south-west coast of Ireland. I want to know whether the Government have refused such permission already, whether they are going to refuse it, how that refusal mechanism is to be put in place and how it is to be insisted upon.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that under the Oslo Convention there is a need to get permission, and presumably that permission will not be forthcoming, the truth is that the Spanish authorities and interests of various kinds have been engaged in pirating of one kind or another in the seas around our coast even though it is illegal. Indeed, the Minister present was one of the most vocal Members about this when in Opposition.  Our mere abhorrence or objection formally to such a practice has not stopped it.  I want to know what effective action the Government are going to take to stop this obnoxious proposal, to <Col N="2606" /> investigate fully the reports from organisations such as the IFO and others of serious dumpings in the seas around our coast and, above all, to communicate once and for all to governments around the world and to other international conglomerate interests that we are fed up of being used as the world's dumping ground, that it is going to stop and that we will take every measure necessary to ensure that it stops.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to reply to this debate in relation to the dumping of toxic waste off our coast, not necessarily just the south-west coast.  At the outset it is important to remind Deputy Keating of our commitment to the marine environment.  One would get the impression from Deputy Keating that we have no interest whatsoever in this matter or that we would not even have considered the dangers attached to the pollution of the marine if he had not raised it today.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in this House I dealt with the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill which is vitally important legislation.  It was discussed in the Seanad, it will go back there for a few minor amendments and will be enacted in the near future.  On assuming office the Minister, Deputy Daly, and I saw the need for this.  The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster was not handled very well until we assumed office on 10 March and we mopped up that operation in a very short time.  We will be bringing in a sea pollution Bill dealing with discharges from vessels.  I wanted to make these few general remarks to reassure the Deputy.  Maybe he is not aware of this because when we were discussing the Bills yesterday, the Deputy's party were not vocal.  I wonder if they were even involved in the discussions of this matter over the last few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;  The Deputy might learn a few <Col N="2608" /> more facts now.  The Spanish authorities have notified the Oslo Commission of their proposal to designate a new marine incineration site in the Atlantic some 300 miles south/south-west of the Irish coast. The commission, in turn, notified Ireland under their prior consultation procedure. The site proposed is a circular one some 60 miles in diameter centred on co-ordinates 51º north and 18º25' west.  The Spanish do not need our approval because this is outside our territorial limits.</P>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I am concerned at this proposal as it is my view that incineration of wastes at sea should only be allowed where there is no environmentally better option available, and, even then, the incineration site would need to be carefully chosen to avoid damage to the marine environment.  I am particularly interested in the marine environment because I realise its importance to this island.  In this case, my Department are asking the Spanish authorities for additional information on the alternative land based disposal methods considered by them.  We are also asking them to consider alternative sites on their own doorstep rather than 300 miles south/south-west of the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>My Department will consider the Spanish response in consultation with the Departments of the Environment, Energy and Industry and Commerce. There will also be a full technical evaluation by my Department's own technical experts.  It would be my intention not to agree to any proposal which would harm the marine environment around Ireland. If necessary, I will also arrange to have this matter raised at the next meeting of the Oslo Commission in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that Ireland was represented at the Second International North Sea Ministers' Conference which was held in London on 24 and 25 November last year by a senior official of the Department of the Marine.  The meeting discussed <i>inter alia</i> the phasing out of marine incineration operations in the North Sea.  The North Sea states agreed at the conference <Col N="2609" /> to phase out marine incineration operations on the North Sea by 31 December 1994 and a further proviso was agreed, at our request, not to export the wastes involved for incineration in marine waters outside the North Sea nor to allow their disposal in other ways harmful to the marine environment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the IFO and conservation groups.  At all times I am open to discuss these matters with the groups concerned, particularly the IFO. My officials meet with them each month. I am not being factitious when I say this, but I am not aware of the reports of illegal dumping to which the Deputy refers but if he has such information, I would be only too pleased to discuss the matter with him in private or in public and I would be glad to receive the details so that I can take appropriate action.  The Minister, the Government and I are anxious to resolve such problems, that there will be no dumping and that no other country will use the waters off our coast to dump toxic waste.  Another indication of our commitment is the fact that my colleague, the Minister for Energy, raised the question of the radioactive discharges from Sellafield.  His action has led to a reduction of these discharges.</P>
    <P>Each contracting party to the Oslo Convention has a policing régime similar to our Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, for the control of dumping at sea.  This ensures illegal dumping is kept to a minimum and that it is monitored to ensure the marine environment is not harmed.  Our Dumping at Sea Act covers waste dumped in Irish territorial waters or dumped by Irish vessels anywhere at sea.  We will do everything in our power to ensure that international conglomerates do not use our seas for the purpose of dumping waste off our coast.</P>
    <P>While the Deputy and I may be at variance on some points, we both agree that every opportunity should be taken to highlight this problem and to ensure that our waters are not used for dumping toxic wastes.  As I said earlier, our seas are vital to those living around our coast who depend on the sea for their livelihood. In my capacity as Minister of State <Col N="2610" /> at the Department of the Marine, I shall do everything in my power to ensure that waste is not dumped around our shores. The dumping of waste, particularly industrial and sewerage waste, is monitored to ensure that the marine environment is unharmed.  There is a further safeguard. Tests are carried out to see if the waste is toxic.  If necessary I will arrange to have the application by the Spanish authorities to designate a new marine incineration site in the Atlantic some 300 miles south/south-west of the Irish coast raised at the next meeting of the Oslo Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate my Government's commitment that no country will do anything to adversely affect the waters of our coast.  It is our intention to ensure that no area around Ireland is used as an alternative to the North Sea incineration site.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy I have taken on board the points he raised and I will be only too pleased if he will give me any information which will be of assistance to me.  If the IFO or any other body have information which will be of assistance, I will be only too pleased to take it on board and to investigate it fully.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on this subject on 15 March 1988, there has been no increase in Irish postal charges since March, 1986 and that, as a result, those charges now compare more favourably with the postal charges of other EC countries.  In real terms our postal charges have been reduced by 8 per cent over the past four years.  In addition, I am in a postion to state that <Col N="2530" /> Irish postal charges will be maintained at existing level at least to the end of 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is possible in certain circumstances to overhear conversations being transmitted by means of Eircell, the public cellular radio telephone system.  The position is that any radio system is liable to the overhearing &mdash; deliberate or accidental &mdash; of messages passed.  Overhearing on the Eircell system generally requires the use of frequency scanners.  Such equipment is expensive and only specialists would tend to have it.  Even with the use of a scanner, individual Eircell sets or conversations cannot be targeted for listening in to because of the nature of the Eircell system and I do not accept that eaves-dropping can be carried out with ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is illegal under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, for anyone to intercept, without the agreement of both parties concerned, telephone calls being made over the public mobile radio telephone system or to disclose the existence or content of any telephone call which has been intercepted. Listening in to or acquiring by any means the substances or purport of an Eircell telephone call without the consent of both parties to the call would constitute interception.  Offenders are liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of £800 and/or a maximum of 12 months <Col N="2533" /> imprisonment or on conviction on indictment to a fine of up to £50,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years.</P>
    <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Acts provide that no person shall improperly divulge the contents of radio transmissions.  The penalties for this offence are a fine of up to £10 and/or imprisonment for up to one month upon summary conviction.  Conviction on indictment carries a penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment. However, since, unlike interception of telephone calls on a wired system, interception of calls on a radio system is a passive activity, detection of such offences is difficult.</P>
    <P>In the light of these existing legislative provisions I have no plans to introduce new legislation to deal with eaves-dropping on car telephone conversations.</P>
    <P>One solution to the problem of overhearing is encryption of the conversation. Encryption requires the use of special equipment by both the person making the call and the person being called and the decision to use such equipment is a matter for individual users of Eircell. However encryption devices vary in effectiveness and would require each end of the call to have identical devices. Another solution of course is the use of discretion when security or sensitive matters are being discussed over any radio system particularly when there is a general awareness that radio conversations can be overheard.</P>

Telecom Éireann, in their current corporate plan, are engaged on a programme of rebalancing the charge structure which they inherited in 1984 with a view to reducing international charges and so improving their competitiveness on key routes.  However, the company are required, under section 15(1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1983, to keep their charges for services at the minimum rates consistent with meeting approved financial targets and to generate sufficient revenue to meet all charges properly chargeable to revenue account, generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs, remunerate capital and repay borrowings.</P>

    <P>On 15 April 1988, a scheme of compensatory allowances (headage payments) in respect of forestry was approved by the EC.  The scheme applies to land afforested in the disadvantaged areas on or after 1 October 1986.  Compensatory allowances for forestry will only be available to farmers who were in receipt of headage payments for livestock before afforesting their land.  The rate of payment is £74.13 per hectare.  This is payable each year for 15 years from the date of afforestation, thereby providing an annual income in recognition of the forest plantation.  Farmers are required to afforest at least two hectares under the scheme.  However, in the case of areas adjoining existing forests, a minimum of one hectare would be acceptable.  If broadleaves are planted, 0.25 hectares <Col N="2536" /> would qualify.  The compensatory allowances for forestry are payable in addition to the appropriate planting grants.</P>
    <P>With regard to the small farmers of south-west County Cork, these will, of course, qualify for compensatory allowances in respect of forestry if they are currently in receipt of headage payments for livestock.</P>

    <P>My Department will continue to provide the fullest possible information and support to prospecting and mining interests operating in the coalfield.

I am aiming to have the vesting day later this year.</P>
    <P>There are no firm decisions as yet on the planting programmes for the company in the years 1988 to 1991.  These will be embraced within the targets which I will be setting for the company on a year to year basis and subject to overall financial considerations.</P>
    <P>The funds for such programmes will be provided through Exchequer financing, guaranteed borrowings by the company, or a combination of both.  The details in relation to such funding are set out in the relevant sections of the Bill and are appropriate for discussion following its introduction.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to encourage private planting and hopes to at least maintain the annual level at the 1987 figure of 3,200 hectares.  Obviously we will be making the most of EC funds to finance both public and private planting.</P>
    <P>The administration of the private planting grants schemes will remain within the Department but it will be open to me to avail of the services of the company for some executive aspects relating to these schemes, as appropriate, on an agency basis.</P>

      <P>The 12 per cent specified rate mentioned by the Deputy is used for assessing the benefit-in-kind from both mortgage and non-mortgage loans given by some employers to their employees at preferential rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Finance Act, 1982, this rate has been lower than commercial rates charged for non-mortgage personal finance such as term loans.  That is still the <Col N="2553" /> position.  On the other hand while commercial mortgage rates have from time to time been above 12 per cent since 1982, they have also stood at less than 12 per cent, as they do at present.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in calculating the amount of interest paid for the purposes of mortgage interest tax relief the same rate of interest is used (subject to the normal conditions attaching to the relief) as applies in calculating the benefit-in-kind.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am not convinced that a change in the specified rate <Col N="2554" /> would be warranted.  I am, however, considering the matter at present.</P>

The companies are Gandon Securities Ltd, an Irish company backed by 25 major domestic and foreign institutions which will trade in financial instruments, the KB Financial Services Ltd, a subsidiary of Kredietbank N. V. of Belgium which will engage primarily in asset-financing activities.</P>
      <P>A further 20 projects have been approved in principle.  Since negotiations with the companies in question on the terms of their certificates have not yet been finalised, it would be inappropriate to give the House details of these companies at this stage.  Public statements will be made, however, when the certificates are given.</P>

      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by another medical referee who found him to be incapable of work from 25 January 1988.  Accordingly payment of benefit was restored on 28 March 1988 with effect from 25 January 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy to use the resources available to me for employment and training programmes in such a way as to assist to the maximum disadvantaged groups in the labour market.  In this connection, it is necessary to ensure that the deadweight and displacement effects of employment programmes such as the employment incentive scheme are minimised. Deadweight takes place when the subsidised recruitment would have taken place without the subsidy.  Displacement takes place when the subsidised recruitment displaces non-subsidised jobs elsewhere. It is also necessary in the interests of minimising Exchequer expenditure to target employment subsidies, as far as possible, on those on the live register.</P>
      <P>In the above circumstances, I regret that I have not the resources at my disposal to expand the employment schemes on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should add that with my colleague, the Minister for Education, I will be shortly announcing an integrated package of employment and training for early school leavers who have no or inadequate formal qualifications.</P>
