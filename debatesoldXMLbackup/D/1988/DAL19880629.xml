      <P>My party do not agree to this item being taken without debate.  It is a matter of some considerable importance and the House is entitled to debate the Convention on Extradition 31 years after it was signed. This goes to the whole root of all our extradition law.  It should have been ratified and apparently it was thought to have been ratified in 1964 or 1965 when the then Extradition Bill was going through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a song and dance about nothing.  This extradition treaty or convention has been in operation for a long period of years.  The procedure in regard to it was upset, I think, by the Trimbole case.  This motion is simply technically putting things right.  It is as simple as that, nothing sinister, nothing world-shaking about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the Trimbole case.  This relates to the European Convention on Extradition. Trimbole was in Australia.  The <Col N="2122" /> Trimbole case gave rise to our Extradition Treaty with Australia, not with Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not have a debate as to whether or not something can be run through without debate, where there is no agreement with the Whips to do so?  It is riding rough-shod over democracy for the majority of this House to say this cannot even be debated, that the minority cannot even voice their <Col N="2123" /> views on this issue.  Again I ask the Taoiseach, what is the urgency?  I contend there is no urgency about this and there are fundamental issues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is urgency about this, a Cheann Comhairle.  First of all, I must ask you to put the question but, out of courtesy, I would say there is urgency about this. We are under pressure from a number of countries to have these two conventions put in order.  They have been there for a long time, everybody thought they were in order but technicalities have arisen in regard to both of them and these procedures are necessary to put the matter right.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete line 32, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;data&rsquo; means information in a form in which it can be processed;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments to the definition of &ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;processing&rdquo; are the only amendments of significance in this group. The other two amendments are consequential. As I mentioned in introducing <Col N="2137" /> the Bill on Second Stage, these are key definitions and they have to be expressed in very technical terms so that they will remain valid irrespective of continuing technological changes.  Also we do not want to bring within the scope of the Bill any personal information that poses no threat to privacy even if it has been automatically recorded.</P>
    <P>To take some examples, with the equipment now available typewritten documents can be recorded automatically and the information in them is then capable of being automatically processed.  Therefore, we must make it clear that typewritten information will be covered by the Bill only if it has been inputted into an automated system.  Also we must exclude word processing operations. The existing definitions cover both these points, as do the revised definitions now being proposed.</P>
    <P>However, the existing definitions would have the effect that personal information recorded on an ordinary dictation tape or even on a gramophone record would be caught by the Bill and this would not be justified as these tapes or records pose no threat to privacy comparable to that of even the humblest micro-computer.  The new definitions exclude such recordings.  This is the effect of defining &ldquo;processing&rdquo; as meaning the automatic performance of logical arithmetical operations on data.  In less technical language that means it must be possible to rearrange, manipulate, amend or add to the data and that these operations can be carried out automatically.</P>
    <P>It is this power of a computer &mdash; the power to sort data into numerical order, alphabetical order or any other desired order, to merge two or more sets of data together, to update data, in fact to manipulate data in any conceivable way that can be reduced to a set of written instructions &mdash; that can endanger the privacy of individuals, and that is why it is being emphasised in the revised definition. Dictation tapes, records and the like cannot be processed in this way and are therefore being excluded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> I propose a further change in the existing definition of &ldquo;processing&rdquo;.  The present text confines it to &ldquo;processing by reference to individual data subjects or categories of data subjects&rdquo;.  This means that unless an individual can be searched for automatically by name or other identifying particulars the data about him or her would not come within the scope of the Bill.  On further consideration it appears to me that this restriction is not justified and that the safeguards of the Bill should apply to personal data irrespective of whether the data can be retrieved by reference to the individual or not.  Otherwise the test as to whether personal data is covered by the Bill would often depend on the degree of sophistication of the equipment and the software. The revised definition, therefore, deletes the reference to processing by reference to individual data subjects so that the safeguards in the Bill will apply to personal data even if the data cannot be retrieved automatically by reference to the individual's name.</P>
    <P>Amendment No.9 also makes it clear that a data processor who lends equipment to a data controller for processing purposes will be covered by the Bill only if the equipment remains in his possession.</P>
    <P>It was represented, rightly, that a data processor should not be made liable for ensuring the security of the data if he had parted with possession of the equipment.  Then that leaves from the group amendments Nos. 3 and 4 which are purely technical and as I have said, consequential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could answer a question with regard to amendment No. 1 in his name.  I see the definition of &ldquo;data&rdquo; is now &ldquo;information in a form in which it can be processed&rdquo;. Should that include data that would be capable of being processed automatically in new and developing systems?  For instance, there is a developing system whereby typescript can be read by processors of certain types and these, while not in general use at the moment, will undoubtedly be so in the future.  Does the Minister consider that that type of <Col N="2139" /> information, apparently now in typescript, would be included?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain the thinking behind amendment No. 2.  The amendment seeks to expand the definition of the information that will be subject to the provisions of the Bill and recognises that there is a large volume of secondary information &mdash; perhaps I am wrong in the use of the word &ldquo;secondary&rdquo;&mdash; or primary information from which the data processor or controller draws the information that finds its way on to the processing machine, and this can be in a cross-reference on other banks of information or held in manual files.  It is important that when a person comes to challenge or seeks to correct an entry on any information that is kept he or she has the right of access to the information behind so that the error will not be repeated, or what is there can be corrected and the matter put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> I accept the general drift of the Minister's amendments in seeking to keep matters precise and to ensure that only information capable of being processed is covered, but the Bill is very narrow in the area of information to which the subject is entitled to have access to know what is there and the right to seek to have it corrected.  For that reason we propose at line 32 on page 4 to extend the definition of &ldquo;data&rdquo; by suggesting that &ldquo;data&rdquo; is to mean information undergoing automatic &ldquo;processing, and includes all information cross-referenced, which is accessible and undergoing automatic processing or maintained in manual form;&rdquo;. The amendment to a great extent speaks for itself.  I have given the reasons we seek to extend that definition and I hope the Minister's response will be favourable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason for the Minister's amendment but I wonder if it achieves his purpose.  The amendment reads that &ldquo;&lsquo;data&rsquo; means information in a form which can be processed;&rdquo;. If one moves from the technical jargon of computers it appears that all information is in a form in which it can be processed.  If I write out information, if I type out information, it is all convertible into being processed on a computer. The Minister says he is trying to exempt word processors &mdash; whether they should not be exempt is something we could come back to &mdash; but it could be that, without realising it, this amendment is incorporating what Deputy McCartan is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had a file in my office containing a lot of information which could be described as being in manual form, all that information would be in a form in which it could be processed.  There is no reason a computer operator could not feed this information into the computer. This Bill is trying to adapt itself to the technical jargon dealing with computers and computerisation, but we must step outside that and deal with the legal jargon.  This definition of data is even broader than the definition it is seeking to replace &mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;data&rsquo; means information <Col N="2141" /> undergoing automatic processing;&rdquo;.  That would clearly be information in the computer or being put into the computer that is undergoing automatic processing.  This is information in a form in which it can be processed.</P>
    <P>I know that, technically speaking, one can talk about information on a hard disc or a floppy disc which can be fed into a computer, but the definition section does not talk about hard discs or floppy discs or the retention of information on such a device.  I am raising this as a query because at a future date a court could interpret &ldquo;data&rdquo; as including all data stored by any person for any purpose be it manual storage, or on floppy or hard disc, because there would be nothing to prevent such data being put into a computer by a computer operator.  All information has the capacity of being processed by a computer or to be put into a computer.  I am raising this issue in the context of the amendment, the Minister's intent in that amendment and Deputy McCartan's amendment, which, if I was right, would effect a substantive change to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other aspect I did not draw attention to and that is the definition on page 5 of &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo;. That definition seems to suggest that the Bill contemplates drawing in data that is not, in the strict sense, on computer, if we want to use the parlance.  If I understand the Minister, he was seeking to confine the concept of data to that which can be found on a computer.  The definition of &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; on page 5 is wider than the Minister contemplates.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;disclosure&rdquo;, in relation to personal data, includes the disclosure of information extracted from such data and the transfer of such data;....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That definition allows for the prospect of cross-references to other computer banks and information that can be extracted from computers.  It does not say &ldquo;in processed form&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to clarify exactly where the Bill is going and whether there is a need to allow for the right of a person to the data, and to have <Col N="2142" /> knowledge of the back-up information, the cross-reference information or the manual information upon which the computer entry was constructed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of what is proposed on behalf of The Workers' Party by Deputy McCartan would have the effect of bringing manual files within the scope of the Bill.  During the Second Stage debate I stated that manual files are excluded for a number of reasons. First, they do not pose any threat to privacy comparable to that caused by computers.  Secondly, the administrative problems and costs involved in extending the Bill to cover them would be colossal. Thirdly, the inclusion would delay the bringing into force of the legislation and the ratification of the Convention.  I am sure the House is aware that the majority of countries with data protection legislation do not include manual files and the Convention does not require contracting parties to do so.  These are very valid and practical reasons why I cannot go along with what is being proposed by Deputy McCartan.</P>
      <P>Computerised data of every kind is covered.  The question was raised if type written documents which were capable of being automatically recorded were covered in the Bill.  The answer is that such documents will only be covered if they are first actually recorded in a form in which they can be automatically processed. Once a document has been recorded in that form, the information is covered by the Bill.  To come within the scope of the Bill, personal data must be recorded in a form in which such data are capable of being processed automatically, that is, information recorded in a form in which logical or arithmetical operations can be found on it without the need for any preparatory steps.  For example, information inputted into the main memory of a computer or information stored in the main memory, or on a floppy disc, are data because the information is automatically processable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information prepared in a form in which it can be directly inputted into automated processing equipment by <Col N="2143" /> means of an optical character recognition device &mdash; OCR &mdash; or a text character recognition device &mdash; TCR &mdash; are not data as they cannot be directly processed in their manual form.  Similarily, ordinary audio cassette tapes on which information is recorded are not data because the information cannot be processed automatically.  Printouts or information extracted from a computer and displayed on a visual display unit are not data as such.  They are only regarded as data for the purposes of disclosure.  Information on microfilm or microfiche is not data but it can become data if it is located and displayed through an automatic retrieval system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The intent of our amendment is to make this legislation more effective.  It is not a question of whether information is a threat to privacy. The Bill is establishing the right of the data subject to have disclosed to him or her information retained and then to have it corrected where it is inaccurate. We argue that manually retained information or cross-referenced information is an integral part of what is on the computer. The amendment is seeking to give the right to the person, if an error or misstatement of fact is established in the computer data, to insist on seeing the source information or cross-referenced information and to correct it.  The Minister's response is that the cost would be colossal.  There is a mechanism for a charge to be made on the data subject who seeks to have information pursued. If a person feels strongly enough to pursue the matter to the source information, be it manual or cross-referenced he or she should be prepared to pay, within reason.  The Minister's concern should not be a major worry.  The point about delay escapes me.  Administrative arrangements will have to be made in various quarters for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said that in the majority of countries where this type of legislation is in existence this kind of amendment is not included.  This suggests <Col N="2144" /> that there are some countries &mdash; a minority &mdash; who have the type of provision we are seeking in our amendment.  That makes me believe that there is a more comprehensive form of legislation than is being suggested.  An important factor must be the recognition of an integral link between the source information and what is ultimately put on the computer. They cannot be divorced.  If we are to have effective legislation giving people the right to correct information retained, there should be the right to go back to the source and correct errors there, if that is what the subject wants.  For that reason I am pressing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the point I made earlier.  Having looked once more at the wording of the Minister's amendment I am not convinced that in the fairly near future the OCR and TCR machines will have reached the stage of development where any manual files or typescript will be capable of being processed directly through the machines.  It may not be possible now but technology will move and we will find that the Bill when in force will in future include all manual files, which the Minister indicated earlier he did not want to include.  Does the Minister have any views on this as a possibility in the future and will he be happy to have all manual files included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection in principle to dealing with manual files but the practical problems are very great.  We are trying to learn from the experience of others who have been through the process of preparing this type of legislation. We have decided that manual files should be excluded as of now, but that does not mean that consideration cannot be given to including them at a later stage.  I am advised that to deal with manual files now would put an extremely heavy burden on industry and that the costs would be considerable.  It is not a requirement of the Convention.  The majority of countries have done what we are doing but some certainly have gone <Col N="2145" /> further.  If we decide to go further at a later stage, we can do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley and I have come to the same conclusion in regard to this matter.  I appreciate the Minister's point regarding the information being inputted.  The Minister has given the reasons for excluding manual files but it would seem that inevitably manual files could and will be included in the new definition the Minister is providing, due to the way technology is developing.  I would suggest seriously to the Minister's officials that they should have another look at this definition.  We are effectively having a Committee Stage and a Report Stage in one and we may not have an opportunity in this House to come back to this issue.  Before the Bill goes to the Seanad the Minister should look at the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment deals with files maintained in a manual form. There is a problem in principle relating to the Convention.  The Bill is implementing the Convention and to that extent we are meeting our international obligations, but there is a tremendous artificiality about maintaining a difference in approach to information retained on computer and information retained on manual files.  Leaving aside the difficulties of industry, let us approach this from the position of the rights of the individual, the right of every individual to privacy and the right to ensure that wrong information is not being disseminated about him.  There is also the right of the individual to ensure that when major organisations, be they Government bodies, State-sponsored bodies or major public or private corporations, make decisions with regard to that individual, he should have some means of knowing whether <Col N="2146" /> the decisions made are based on accurate information held by the decision-maker.</P>
    <P>The principle of this Bill, and it relates to the different types of data, is to ensure that where wrong information is held about an individual, the individual can have access to that information and can require that that information be corrected. There is a tremendous artificiality about maintaining a different legal position in regard to computer held information as against manually held information.  The artificiality of that comes out very clearly in the definition of disclosure that one of the previous speakers has already drawn attention to. It is possible for major organisations to hold information on a computer bank.  It is possible for that information not to contain the name of the person to whom it relates but to have some sort of cross reference system.  The identity of the person could be discovered by checking some form of manual record.  If ever someone wants to make use of information about that individual they would look up the manual record, discover what the key is into the computer to get access to information about that individual, and then extract it.  The problems created by denying people access to information that is held about them are partly recognised in the context of the definition of disclosure, but a major body that wants to ensure that individuals do not discover what information is held about them will be able to use an amalgam of computer stored information and manual records to prevent individuals gaining access to information.  Indeed some bodies could very well defeat the entire purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>We have not had any legislation in this area and this Bill is a welcome contribution to extending some rights to individuals who are faced with major corporations or financial institutions or State bodies making fundamental decisions that effect their livelihoods, their wellbeing and their welfare.  Nevertheless it is my own belief that if the Minister's own definition is not interpreted as including manual information we will inevitably come back into this <Col N="2147" /> House within the next couple of years to provide for amendments to this Bill to extend the rights of access to information to manual information held by major bodies.  Businesses, Government Departments, State bodies and corporations are going to have to come to terms with the reality of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the context of the new definition he is tabling &mdash; and I think it might be appropriate to raise this now rather than coming back to it later on &mdash; could deal with the definition of disclosure because that definition says disclosure in relation to personal data includes the disclosure of information extracted from such data and the transfer of such data; then it goes on to say that where the identification of a data subject depends partly on the data and partly on other information in the possession of the data controller the data shall not be regarded as disclosed unless the other information is also disclosed.  Perhaps the Minister could explain how this is going to work in the context of the assumption that, generally speaking, this legislation does not apply to manually held information. In the context of data, as the Minister now wishes to define it, in circumstances where there is this mix of information whose disclosure is dependent on something that is not held on computer, when will that information be regarded as data which is disclosed?  I have tabled an amendment to that and I do not want to pre-empt discussion on it, but it does seem to me that there is an interlinking in this area.  There is a danger in all of this that in excluding manual information as a matter of principle at this stage, we could partially defeat the purpose of the Bill and be forced to look at this legislation again in a very short time to expressly include manual information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Shatter has said.  Let me come back to the manual files versus what is held on computer.  With regard to manual files, as long as they remain manual files they do not come within the scope of the Bill, but if they are inputted they are covered <Col N="2148" /> by the Bill.  This particular input can be done automatically with the modern technology that is available and then the provisions of the Bill would apply.  It is important, having regard to the prodigious manipulative power of the computer, to deal with the computer first and then, at a later stage, to deal with the manual files, bearing in mind that somebody can get from a computer in ten seconds what one person might spend a long time getting from manual files.  It is certainly an area that we have given a lot of thought to.  The manual files are not excluded.  They are covered when they are inputted.  I would say to Deputy McCartan that we are not ruling out the main thrust of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 comes back to what I was talking about a few moments ago dealing with when a disclosure takes place.  The definition in the Bill is that disclosure in relation to personal data includes disclosure of information extracted from such data and the transfer of such data.  That is a disclosure and presumably then a disclosure takes place at the time the information is extracted and transferred.  It goes on to say that where the identification of a data subject depends partly on the data and partly on other information in the possession of the data controller, the data shall not be regarded as disclosed unless the other information is also disclosed. In other words, if the data that is held on computer is, in effect, disclosed, the other information which is not on the computer is not regarded as being disclosed. I have tabled a technical amendment to that which would add the words at the end of that definition section &ldquo;at the time the data is disclosed or at some later time&rdquo;.  It is necessary to clarify this. One has to determine exactly what is a disclosure and when it takes place.  Information that is held on computer and which does not fully identify the data subject could be released and, at the same time, the information that is not <Col N="2150" /> held on computer that confirms or assists with the identification of the data subject could be released, and there would be no doubt in those circumstances that the disclosure takes place at that time.  It is possible to release the information held on a computer and, some weeks later, to release the other information.  This amendment is designed to determine that the disclosure takes place, and is regarded as having taken place, at the time when the latter information, the information not held on computer, is released.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on when exactly it is regarded that a disclosure takes place.  In the context of manual held information, the Minister might also clarify exactly how he perceives the definition of disclosure operating and interacting with manual held information which is used, not by putting it on computer, but as a tool to identify a data subject, with regard to information held on computer about that data subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with amendment No. 6 in the name of the Minister and to inquire of him the purpose and intent behind the amendment. I think it is designed to clear up far more than drafting errors because the definition of the transfer of data is being restricted to such an extent that it defeats the whole purpose of including the word &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; in the definition of disclosure as contained in the definition section of the Bill.  The original definition of disclosure was to include the transfer of any data from one source to another.  It did not indicate whether that was by way of automatic transfer or manual transfer or the circumstances in which it would take place but in this case the Minister seeks to restrict the definition to exclude the transfer of information from the data controller to an employee or agent of his for the purpose of enabling that person to carry out his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his earlier remarks Deputy Shatter indicated correctly that the three main interests we are trying to protect here in this legislation are the right to privacy, the right to ensure that correct information is held and the right to ensure <Col N="2151" /> that fair decisions are taken on foot of accurate information whether by multinational corporations or by departmental officials.  I am concerned about this restriction of the definition to exclude data being passed from the data controller onto an employee or an agent who may then make a decision on it.  Let us take the position in a Department, where the person who has control of information, the data controller or processor, passes the information down the line, and on foot of that information a decision may be taken which adversely affects the data subject but that information may not be disclosed to the data subject who comes in to find out why it was that credit was refused or a particular decision was taken by a Department against his or her interests.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that a person can establish that fair decisions were taken on foot of accurate information, the data subject must know how information passes within a corporation or Department and must be in a position to assess the impact of decisions taken.  I would like to know the intention behind this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What this amendment seeks to achieve is the transfer of the substance of section 8 (h) to the definition of disclosure of personal data any disclosures made to employees or agents of a data controller or data processor to enable them to carry out their duties. That paragraph is being dropped from section 8 and the definition of disclosure is being amended to exclude from it any disclosure of that kind.  While this achieves the same result, the amendment of &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; has certain advantages from a drafting point of view.  In particular it makes it clear that sections 6 (2) and 10 (7) do not require data controllers who correct errors in data to notify the corrections formally to members of their staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In transferring section 8 (h) to the definition of disclosure, one minor clarification has been incorporated, that is, the addition of the words &ldquo;directly or <Col N="2152" /> indirectly&rdquo; in relation to disclosures to employees or agents of a data controller or data processor.  This has been done to make it clear that these disclosures will still be excluded from the restrictions of the Bill even if not made directly to each employee or agent by the data controller or data processor; in other words, in a case where an employer communicates an instruction or information to a senior employee who then relays it to the rest of the staff.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter, I have no objection in principle to what he has in mind but I had the amendment referred to the parliamentary draftsman who advised that the text as it stands covers both a simultaneous disclosure of the other information and subsequent disclosure. That is the advice which I have received.  It would also cover the disclosure of such information made in advance of a disclosure of computerised data.</P>
    <P>The advice I have received is that this amendment is not necessary and might have a limiting effect in that it would not catch a case where the disclosure of the other information is made before disclosures of the computerised data.  As I understand it, a disclosure within the meaning of the Bill will take place in the type of case we are discussing, that is, where the computerised data alone do not identify an individual at the point in time when both the data and complementary information have been disclosed whenever that occurs.</P>

      <P>We are not really concerned about what goes in, what goes up <Col N="2153" /> or what goes down but it is the Department who would be held liable.  Deputy McCartan spoke of internal disclosures within an organisation which might adversely affect the data subject but it must be emphasised that the Bill regards the data controller as being one single unit comprising the organisation and the staff.  It is that unit which would be responsible to the data subject for any breach of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

Where the data controller passes on information within a corporation or Department and decisions are taken on foot of that information, it is not a case of the data subject wanting to know the thinking of the person who received the information but rather who the data processor passed the information to, where it went to and what use it was put to.</P>

    <P>(b)  a person referred to in section 7 (4) of that Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments are on the lines of a similar provision in the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, in relation to the powers of authorised officers under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and the Restrictive Practices Acts.  The provisions were incorporated in the Bill of the 1987 Act after the publication of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendments provide that the powers of inspection, etc., conferred on the authorised officers of the Data Protection Commissioner by section 23 will not be exercisable in relation to financial institutions unless a High Court order has first been obtained.  The High Court may grant such an order only if it is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so and that the exigencies of the common good so warrant.  The definition of &ldquo;financial institution&rdquo; in amendment No. 8 covers not just licensed banks but also building societies, the Post Office Savings Bank and the like.

      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 40, to delete &ldquo;fact&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fact, including any omission of fact or detail.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very simple in its intent and it seeks to refine in some ways the definition of &ldquo;fact&rdquo; in subsection (2). Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;For the purposes of this Act, data are inaccurate if they are incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact&rdquo;.  The purpose of the amendment is to include in that definition the words &ldquo;fact, including any omission of fact or detail&rdquo;.  This amendment suggests that one can say much about a person by overlooking or omitting a detail of relevance or importance.  It is particularly relevant to the provisions of this Bill where we are seeking to give the right to an individual to inspect and to insist on correction.  &ldquo;Correction&rdquo; could include insisting that a relevant detail be inserted into the record retained.  One thinks about the issue of the credit-worthiness of an individual which could be retained in financial institutions or anything held at Government level. When one is talking about matters and facts being accurate one has to ensure that they are also complete and this <Col N="2156" /> amendment proposes to ensure that that situation is covered and allowed for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I cannot move amendment No. 11 at present but I realise that the same intent is behind amendments Nos. 10 and 11 with regard to data which may be missing.  Subsection (2) does not refer to data which may be missing.  I am not really certain about the wording in The Workers' Party amendment because it would be unfair to include omissions of fact or detail which do not refer to the data on file.  This Bill attempts to put restrictions on and give access to individuals to data that are recorded and accessible.  I believe it would be unnecessary and impossible to give access to data that are not in existence of the file.  Therefore, my amendment seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;fact&rdquo; the words &ldquo;which is referred to in the data&rdquo;.  This would confine the obligation to data that are actually registered on the file so that they would be accessible but would also show that there has been an omission as to that data.</P>
      <P>This can happen in a number of ways. It may not be straightforward and it may happen that, as a result of cross-referencing, transfers and so on, which can be achieved with data processing, information may be left out.  We should be able to cover in some way the situation where data are missing from the information supplied to an individual.  Subsection (2) as it stands at present is lacking in that regard.  The Workers' Party amendment is unrealistic.  I do not believe one can leave it as vague as that and any omission of fact or detail, wherever it may be found, could be included in that amendment.  I believe my amendment is realistic and would probably cover the omission I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 10, subsection (2) provides that data will be regarded as inaccurate if they are incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact, as distinct from a matter of opinion.  Data can be incorrect or misleading either because some relevant item of information has been omitted or <Col N="2157" /> because some supplementary information has been included.  In either case the wording used in the subsection seems adequate to make it clear that when the Bill speaks of data being accurate it means that on any matters of fact data must not be incorrect or misleading, whether by the addition or omission of particular information.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Colley, I note what she is trying to achieve but I am advised that this is a drafting matter and that the present wording is adequate.  I do not see any difference between the wording but if the Deputy wishes I can have the matter examined during lunchtime to make sure that what I am saying will stand up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that from the Minister if he would have the wording looked at again.  It has been drawn to my attention that the subsection is not necessarily tight enough and it could be seen to be allowing omissions to slip through the net.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not yet fully alert but I do not understand how Deputy Colley's amendment addresses the problem of omissions or deals with the problem I sought to address in The Workers' Party amendment.  I do not see the difficulties being presented, not so much by the Minister but by Deputy Colley in respect of our amendment.  To the extent that the Minister's interpretation of the present wording allows for the omission of fact, I would urge him to put the matter beyond doubt by accepting words along the lines suggested in our amendment or indeed any other wording he thinks would better serve the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the overall working of this Bill.  Any press comment there has been on this Bill, or any articles written about it, have been seeking to alert industry and agencies to its wide scope, to the almost revolutionary impact its provisions will have on companies' practices in having to accede to requests from <Col N="2158" /> members of the public to inquire into the records they keep.  I am concerned that every conceivable device will be deployed by those companies who are slow to disclose information.  Many of us in our capacity as public representatives and otherwise have come across examples, particularly in this city, of cartels between credit companies, one referring to another information about people seeking credit.  I am not talking about large business interests.  I am talking about ordinary people seeking to survive by resorting to credit and the grave injustices often done such people by misinformation being put about or retained on file.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the fact that apparently, again in this city, insurance companies maintain black lists of people who represent insurance risks.  Reading between the lines of such comments and articles there have been on the provisions of this Bill, it appears to me that there is widespread concern about and an amount of resistance to them, particularly on the part of banks, insurance and credit companies. They are not happy with its provisions. They are not happy about the obligations and duties the provisions will impose on them.  They fear they will have to begin to open up their company practices and records to members of the public, something of which they never conceived in the past.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that we have water-tight legislation that does not afford people any opportunity to avoid its obligations or provisions.  I accept that the Minister is endeavouring to meet all concerns in this House and that the present wording, as he perceives it, includes problems arising through omission.  Perhaps my thinking here goes back to Catholic training&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;something from which I have long departed.  But I remember, from the days when the catechism was drummed into me, that sins were sins of act or omission.  It is this problem with regard to omission of which we must be <Col N="2159" /> aware.  As I speak I am endeavouring to think of an example of information which arguably can be correct, that there is nothing incorrect in what is retained on record but in respect of which a relevant piece of information could be omitted. Like the catechism, I should like the sin of omission written into the provisions of this Bill, to ensure that information tainted by omission is clearly defined as inaccurate so that its subject can have the matter corrected.  I should ask the Minister to consider inserting some provision to allow for that type of problem being encountered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a), line 41, before &ldquo;An appropriate authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;With the consent of the Government, and subject to a written copy of the designation being laid before the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the provisions of this Bill is to protect individuals' rights in this computer age, in an era when more and more information is capable of being stored in computers covering every aspect of people's lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intent of my amendment is to strengthen the provisions of the Bill, particularly as they affect the rights of individuals.  I contend that the provisions, <Col N="2160" /> as drafted, leave a number of loopholes which would render it easy for some specified bodies to escape their obligations. For instance, a member of the Government has power to designate a subordinate civil servant as a data controller or processor.  By so doing a Minister can ensure that the provisions of the Bill do not apply to himself.  I consider that provision most unsatisfactory.  My amendment would have the effect of ensuring that such designation could take place only as a result of a clear Government decision which would have to be taken and recorded, as opposed to a decision taken by a Minister acting on his own and that this House would have to be advised of any such Government decision.</P>
    <P>There is an important principle involved here.  The House has always accepted that a Minister of the day is responsible and ultimately accountable for acts or omissions of civil servants.  If we depart from that principle and institute a practice under which civil servants will become directly accountable for some of the provisions of this Bill, then I contend that can be done only with the knowledge and consent of this House. My amendment would ensure maximum accountability to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 13 deals in a somewhat different way with the problems to which Deputy Spring has drawn attention.  We must revert to the principle of the Bill.  The Bill is designed to provide a degree of protection for the individual, to ensure that information held by various types of bodies on computer is accurate, that an individual will have access to such information, know what information is held and, if necessary, have it corrected; indeed, if wrong information is held and an individual suffers damage as a result that he be entitled to bring court proceedings seeking damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one extraordinary and indefensible aspect of the Bill the rationale behind which I find very difficult to understand.  The obligations the Bill seeks to impose on bodies outside of <Col N="2161" /> Government, such as financial institutions, which are correctly imposed, the Government are seeking here to render themselves immune from.  They are seeking to ensure that Government Departments and other bodies are not held liable by the provisions of the Bill and cannot be sued by individuals who are wronged as a result of suffering damage due to wrongful information being held on computers which has affected their wellbeing, livelihood or family.  This arises as a result of the definition contained in subsection (3) (a) of section 1 which says:</P>
    <P>An appropriate authority, being a data controller or a data processor, may, as respects all or part of the personal data kept by the authority, designate a civil servant in relation to whom it is the appropriate authority to be a data controller or a data processor and, while the designation is in force&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the civil servant so designated shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be a data controller or, as the case may be, a data processor, and</P>
    <P>It then goes on to say, more importantly:</P>
    <P>(ii)  this Act shall not apply to the authority, as respects the data concerned.</P>
    <P>That all sounds very complicated until one has a look at what an appropriate authority is under this Bill.  We are told in subsection (1) that an &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956 and 1958.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the 1956 Act defines an appropriate authority as follows: In relation to a civil servant holding a position to which he is appointed by the Government, the appropriate authority is the Government.  In relation to a civil servant who is a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the office of the Attorney General, the appropriate authority is the Taoiseach.  In relation to a civil servant who is a member of the <Col N="2162" /> staff of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister &mdash; here being the Minister for Finance &mdash; is the appropriate authority.  In relation to any other civil servant, the relevant Minister in whose Department that civil servant works is the appropriate authority.  This definition seeks to ensure that the Minister, or the Government, or the relevant Government Department can render themselves immune from the protection afforded to the individual by this Act and, indeed, immune from being sued, by simply designating somebody within that Department as a data controller.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to remove that immunity from the Government of the day.  It certainly would continue to allow, as logically it should, Ministers to designate people within the Departments to be data controllers.  The ordinary legal view, however, would normally be that a civil servant is acting on behalf of his Minister and where court proceedings are necessary it is never the individual civil servant who is sued if a citizen suffers damage.  It is the Minister nominally who is sued, or the Government can be sued.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this Government would do so or that it is likely that the next Government might, but let us project ourselves beyond the year 2,000 and assume that we have a Government that become somewhat paranoid about their position and sought to develop computerised information that they retain about the political beliefs and peculiarities of every individual in the State.</P>

      <P>Let us assume that these computers are full of wrong information to which individuals wish to have access <Col N="2163" /> and that this information has been used to create havoc in some individual's life. Under this Bill that Government apparently could not be sued.  The individual civil servant who is foolish enough to undertake such a task on behalf of the Government could be sued, but the Government could not.  It would seem, on the basic principles of political responsibility as we understand them in this country, that it is an acceptable part of our political process that the Minister of the day is responsible for the acts of his civil servants.  It seems that this definition, which looks innocuous until one starts to examine it, seeks to ensure that the Minister of the day is protected against any wrongdoing by his civil servants in the use of computerised information, provided that he designates one as a data controller.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am misinterpreting the Bill and the Minister might explain the reason for this subsection (3) (a).  My amendment seeks to delete paragraph (ii) of subsection (3) (a).  It would restore responsibility to the Government Department, the Minister of the day, or the Revenue Commissioners, or whoever else is involved, for any wrongful information held in their files and used in a way which is contrary to the Act and causes damage to the individual.  This is important, because the Cathaoirleach has indicated that we should discuss amendment No. 62 in the context of this discussion.  Amendment No. 62 deals with section 7 of the Bill, which I assume will be discussed in more detail when we reach that section.  Section 7 is what could best be described as the damages section. It seeks to ensure that where somebody has suffered damage or loss as a result of the wrongful use of information, he or she can bring court proceedings and secure damages.  It is the data controller who in this instance would normally be sued.  My amendment to section 7 is to add a new subsection to it which would read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of the law of Tort where an appropriate authority has designated a Civil Servant to be a <Col N="2164" /> Data Controller, such authority shall to the extent that the law does not so provide be vicariously responsible for the compliance by such data controller with the provisions of this Act in relation to the collection of personal data or information intended for inclusion in such data or the processing, keeping, use or disclosure of such data and owe a duty of care to the data subject concerned subject to the same proviso as arises under subsection (1) of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) contains a number of provisos with regard to the bringing of proceedings. That amendment is designed to ensure that if a Government Department hold information and are in violation of this Act, if the information is wrong and someone suffers damage as a result, it is the Government of the day, or the Minister of the day, who is accountable to the courts for any damage done as a result of the holding of that information.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister may be seeking to ensure that this Government or future Governments, or the Minister of the day of a particular Department, is given a degree of immunity, I suggest that to try to extend the degree of immunity violates the constitutional principles enunciated by our Supreme Court in the case of Byrne <i>versus</i> Ireland.  It would seem that, in so far as this Bill would seek to prevent individuals from suing the State or the Government Department for damage suffered by them at the hands of that Department as a result of wrongful information being held and used from the computer processing system, in the light of the decision in Byrne <i>versus</i> Ireland any such provision is likely to be unconstitutional. I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say on foot of these amendments and his rationale for dealing with this matter in the way that it appears to be dealt with under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would not regard Deputy Spring's amendment as going far enough.  It simply agrees to this approach in extending some degree of immunity to Government, or the Minister for the day, <Col N="2165" /> provided that the Government have made the decision and that that decision is notified to the Oireachtas.  I hope that I am not doing Deputy Spring an injustice by saying that, as I read it, that is the effect of what he is saying.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Government consent would be given to a particular person within a particular Department being nominated as a data controller and a written copy of this designation would be laid before the Oireachtas.  That would not give the Oireachtas any control over that Government decision.  It would not extend to the Oireachtas any right to approve or reject it and it would not extend to the individual, following such a Government decision being made, any greater protection than the Bill, unamended, currently provides for the individual.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how this amendment would greatly protect the rights of the individual in ensuring that a Government Department, the Government, the Taoiseach or other bodies referred to as appropriate authorities in the 1956 Act can be properly sued in the courts for violating the provisions of this Act or can be required to comply with the provisions of the Act in the context of the various obligations that are imposed on data controllers and data processors by the Act. It is desirable that Government Departments, save for the very extensive exemptions they seek from this Act, should be the bodies required to comply with the obligations of the Act.  Designating a Government decision by simply notifying the Oireachtas or putting a note in the Library of the House does not extend any additional protection to anyone, other than letting people know the name of the designated data controller.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no loophole here and no diminution in the liability of the State and Ministers for the wrongful acts of their civil servants.  The Bill recognises the reality of the situation and puts responsibility, including liability for criminal proceedings for breaches of various provisions of the Bill, where it should <Col N="2166" /> lie, on those who are responsible for running the data systems of Departments. Everyone know that Ministers have nothing to do with the day to day operation of the system.  The Bill does that without taking in any way from the liability of Ministers and the State for the wrongful acts of their civil servants.</P>
      <P>Before going into detail regarding the amendments, I should like to set out the objectives of section 1 (3).  It enables the Government, Ministers and any other appropriate authority to delegate to a civil servant or civil servants their functions as data controllers or data processors. Defence Forces personnel data may be delegated by the Minister for Defence to an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces, for example.  Also, it deems civil servants, members of the Defence Forces and members of the Garda Síochána to be employees of their Minister or the civil servant he has designated or the Garda Commissioner, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>Where a Minister designates a particular civil servant, that civil servant will be the person to be registered in the register of data controllers that is to be maintained by the data commissioner. The decision to designate will be a matter for each individual Minister and probably most Ministers will designate the civil servant or civil servants with responsibility for particular areas of the departmental data activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Spring's amendment would require the consent of the Government before any designation is made and a written copy of the designation to be laid before each House.  I cannot see why the consent of the Government should have to be obtained for making a designation. A designation does nothing more than recognise the reality of the situation.  A Minister cannot be expected to supervise the detailed operation of the data processing of his Department: that responsibility should be placed on those whose duty it is to see that the departmental data is handled properly.  There is no diminution of the State's liability here for the acts or omissions of its civil servants involved.  Nor do I see any necessity for <Col N="2167" /> informing the Oireachtas whenever a designation is made either for the first time or to cover changes in personnel. On each occasion, the designation or change in designation must be notified to the commissioner and recorded in the register which is a public document available for inspection free of charge. Arrangements could be made to have a copy of the register placed in the Dáil Library and, if that is the wish of Members, there would be no difficulty about it.  It could be done administratively if that were deemed to be helpful.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 13, section 1 (3) allows a Minister to designate one or more civil servants to be responsible for the proper handling of the personal data kept in the Department concerned.  In the ordinary course, it is to be expected that Ministers would designate senior officers to be responsible for the divisions of the Departments to which the personal data relates.  I am sure Members recognise that Ministers could not be expected to involve themselves in the day to day operation of the processing system in use in Departments, in the same way as responsible senior officers would have to, especially when criminal sanctions can be invoked against data controllers in the public sector for failure to comply with the provisions of the Bill. That is why the Bill places the responsibility for compliance with its provisions on those civil servants who have been designated by the Minister for that purpose.</P>
    <P>That is not say that the Bill, in making that provision, in any way diminishes the right of any individual under the law of tort as extended by section 7, to relief for any damage he may suffer as a result of non-compliance with the data protection principles by a designated civil servant or any of his subordinate civil servants.  This is because, under the present law, the State is liable for wrongs committed by civil servants in the course of their duty and that will still apply to any wrong committed by a designated civil servant because his relationship to <Col N="2168" /> his Minister is not changed in any way by the Bill.  Accordingly, if that civil servant, as data controller, causes damage to an individual, the individual will have the same remedy against the State as he has now.  That applies also where the damage is caused by an officer who is subordinate to the designated civil servant.  His relationship to his Minister is not changed either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister says there is no diminution of the State's liability for wrongful acts by its civil servants and that the designation here is reality.  I acknowledge that there are civil servants throughout a ministerial department who have responsibility in individual areas and that that is the way Government works.  The way the Civil Service are accountable for what they do is through the political head of that Department who is normally accountable to this House.  As things stand at the moment, if a messenger from the Department of Justice driving a van along the road beside St. Stephen's Green crashes and causes physical injury, the person who is injured will seek damages by bringing proceedings against the Minister for Justice who is nominally the person who can be sued.  If what the Minister says is correct, that there is no intention here to provide the Government or the State with some degree of immunity for the wrongful acts of civil servants in the context of the Data Protection Bill, the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting amendment No. 62 in my name because it would insert a new subsection to section 7 seeking to ensure that State or Ministerial liability will be accepted in the context of actions for damages brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister is saying it seems that this amendment merely states what he intends to be the law and therefore he should have no difficulty with it. Section 7 seeks to ensure that the data controller, generally speaking, is the person liable for wrongful acts in civil damages and to ensure that where the ordinary law of torts or the civil law relating to litigation would not in some <Col N="2169" /> instances under this Bill provide for damages, there is a specific duty of care for which the data controller is responsible which is over and above the existing law of torts.  Section 7 provides that:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the law of torts and to the extent that that law does not so provide, a person, being a data controller or a data processor, shall, so far as regards his compliance with the provisions of this Act in relation to the collection of personal data or information intended for inclusion in such data or the processing, keeping, use or disclosure of such data, owe a duty of care to the data subject concerned.</P>
    <P>The section says that for the general purpose for the law of torts, it is the data controller or the data processor, who is liable and that in so far as under the ordinary law of torts he would not have a liability, this Bill specifically says that he has a duty of care with regard to the inclusion of data or the processing, keeping, or use or disclosure of data.  This is a very specific duty of care relating to the use of data held on computer or being processed through computers.  It is a specific duty of care dealing with what could be described as our civil law negligence in areas into which the civil law in this State has not yet travelled by way of judicial development.  Instead of awaiting judicial development and instead of waiting to see to what extent the courts will extend the laws of negligence to the use or misuse of computerised information, this Bill provides specifically what the nature of the duty of care is and to what it applies and it states that the person liable is the data controller, subject to various provisos set down.  The Minister is saying that even if that data controller who has been appointed by an authority under this Bill fails to comply with this duty of care the Minister of the day can be the defendant in court proceedings brought in which someone seeks damages. This Bill does not say that.  It says that the data controller is the person. Because of the definition section provision, it seems to me that the Minister cannot be the nominal defendant and <Col N="2170" /> cannot be sued.  I am not suggesting that a Minister can know what is being done from hour to hour by every official in his Department.  The Minister of the day, in theory at least, would not be responsible and in practice could not be held responsible for the bad driver attached to his Department who runs over someone. The reason the Minister of the day becomes the defendant is because that person is a servant of the State and if he runs over someone when in the employment of the State the State can be sued because the State has a vicarious liability for its employees.</P>
    <P>What is more important from the point of view of the person who is wronged is that the State is more likely to have the money to pay the compensation for the wrong suffered due to someones failure to exercise a duty of care, than will be the individual.  Will we have civil servants in Government Departments prepared to operate computer systems on the basis that they may be personally liable in cases of substantial financial damages if they fail to comply with the provision of the Act or if they have information on their computer which does damage to someone and which turns out to be wrong information?  I suspect that it would be very difficult to find any civil servant willing to operate under those conditions. But from the point of view of the rights of the individual, what is more important is that the individual will look to the State for compensation for negligence.  If the Minister's intent is that the State remains liable the Minister should have no problem in accepting the amendment to section 7 and in taking on board for the purpose of civil liability, the amendment I have tabled to section 1 (3) of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a minor point in relation to the phrase &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; in section 1.  The data processor is a machine and in the computer world generally, the phrase &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; is always used in relation to a machine. The fact that this Bill refers to a data processor as a person is bound to cause confusion and I suggest that the Minister <Col N="2171" /> change that phrase and consider a variation of it so as not to cause confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of the data processor is clearly spelled out in the Bill. I am sure that it will be very clear to everybody in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are not changing the law about the liability of the State for the acts of civil servants.  To do that would require an express provision to that effect.  Deputy Shatter suggested that by accepting his amendment it would be made clear that there was no question of giving the Minister immunity.  To accept it would negative the whole purpose of the amendment which is to distribute actual responsibility to the civil servants directly concerned. By accepting the amendment one would retain the Minister as top data controller with perhaps four or five other data controllers under him.  I have no doubt that confusion about their respective liabilities would emerge.  The Minister has responsibility to this House and indeed on occasion in relation to other matters, I recall Ministers coming to the House admitting that wrong information was supplied by their Departments and the House accepted the explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the time when we were trying to negotiate the milk quotas in Brussels and incorrect information which left us 13 million gallons of milk short in our quotas was submitted.  The explanation was accepted, and it was accepted that the Minister of the day cannot be involved in day to day activities.  I am satisfied that it is right to have people designated and there is no question of civil servants not wanting to take this type of work because they might be held responsible personally for anything that might go wrong in fulfilling their duties. The same could be said for a Minister.  A Minister might not want to take on the office of Minister if he was to be personally responsible for something that might go wrong, even things he knew nothing about down along the line.  What we are trying to do is exercise control and protect data.  We are putting the obligation on the people designated who will <Col N="2172" /> not be faceless persons and whose names will be on a register which will be available in the library.  If there is any change that change will be notified and if anybody is wronged the State will be responsible in the normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that the Minister wishes to distribute responsibility for actions taken under the auspices of this Bill or in relation to data processing to those who are actually taking those actions.  That is something which I support.  I support the reorganisation of the public service on the basis that those responsible for certain actions should be made to take that responsibility.  Unfortunately, this is probably the only Bill in existence in our legislative system that might seek to do that.  It is not possible to singularly give the responsibility for actions purely to civil servants in this Bill and not to do it right across the board.  I do not think you can opt out of the system in that way.  If somebody were to read the reports on the debate and hear what the Minister has said they could be confused with the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important phrase in amendment No. 62 in the name of Deputy Shatter is contained in line three which states: &ldquo;to the extent that the law does not so provide...&rdquo;.  That would remove the doubt that if somebody were to be designated as a data controller that he or she would get immunity from the State for any action taken either in tort or under this Bill against that person.  It is unrealistic not to make reference to that because it will be misleading to those who are examining the Act after it has passed through this House if it is not stated.  I have received representations from people who were under the impression that every Government Department was given immunity against the effects of this Bill and these are people who should know better if it were clear.  Obviously it is not clear and amendment No. 62 serves to clarify the issue while still retaining the notion of the Minister that one person in a Department should be designated as a data controller.  It is realistic for the workings of the Act to have somebody <Col N="2173" /> designated as such as it would not be possible to work it otherwise.  It should also be tied in very clearly to the policy that has existed so far, and still exists, in the process of government that the Minister is responsible for what happens in his Department.  I support the idea of moving away from that but it cannot be done in isolation with this Bill.  It must be a policy that goes right across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to Deputy Colley and say we are making a start in this Bill with regard to placing responsibility here for data handling on the people who will be designated by the Minister in the various Departments.  A start has to be made somewhere.  It is a good principle.  It is my experience in different Departments that it is often very difficult to find out &mdash; even as Minister &mdash; who has direct responsibility for certain matters.  On occasions it takes an effort to pin responsibility.  There are people here who have been in Government and have been in charge of Departments and I am sure they would agree with me, others in time will have the same experience. It can be very frustrating at times when one is trying to get the full story and the facts before making the required decision.</P>
      <P>It is very important in this instance when we are talking about data protection that we identify those who have specific responsibilities.  It is a major breakthrough and it is necessary in the context of this Bill.  As I have already said in relation to Deputy Spring's amendment, these designated persons will be identifiable and their responsibilities will be known.  They themselves will be very much aware of their responsibilities. This will give us all what we hope for in this Data Protection Bill which is the element of control and to see to it that it is not abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might borrow part of the phrase used by Deputy Spring in his opening contribution in support of his amendment, we have to protect the rights of individuals.  I believe this move is what is required in this area.  Having said that, we <Col N="2174" /> are not changing the Minister's ultimate responsibility for the wrongful acts of his staff.  We are not doing that in any way. If the Deputy, or Deputies, say we are changing the law about the liability of the State for the acts of civil servants, that is such a fundamental change that it would require an express provision to that effect.  We are not doing that.  The Minister has and must have ultimate responsibility because he is the political head of the Department.  He is the person who makes the designation and he has the authority to do so.  He then has the responsibility that goes with that authority to come into this House and answer any questions in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to make a Minister personally responsible for the observance of the data protection requirements when he is not involved in the day-to-day detailed operation in the various sectors of the Department. Having regard to other duties and functions of Government it would be impossible for him to do so.  Even in the less busy Departments there is no way the Minister of the day would have the time to observe on a daily basis and in detail what is going on.  In an effort to have an element of control in this sensitive area people are being designated.  I believe this is the proper way to do it.  I am not saying it should be like this for ever.  I go along with Deputy Shatter when he said that we must look beyond the year 2000 which is 11 or 12 years away.  I am not saying this Bill cannot be amended along the way &mdash; if the occasion demands it should certainly be amended &mdash; but I am satisfied that we are doing the right thing and that the approach is the proper and the correct one.</P>

      <P>In the context of the Minister's response, would he confirm if I am right in saying that section 7 of the Bill in effect sets out what the law of tort will be in this area and, indeed, may extend the concept of negligence in the context of dealing with computer processing to some extent and that this would be a provision in this Bill which specifically entitles someone to sue for damages?  Perhaps the Minister would explain how he can say that the State can still be sued or, nominally, a Minister can be sued under this provision even where a data controller has been appointed by an appropriate authority.  Subsection (3) (a) of section 1 expressly states that where such a data controller has been appointed the Act shall not apply to the authority as respects the data concerned.  If the civil liability arises under section 7 and a data controller is appointed, the appointment of the data controller seems to exempt the State, the Minister of the day or the Government Department from being sued for damages.  The Minister said this would be a major change in the law.  I am saying it is a major change in the law and it seems that this is what this Bill does.  If it does not and if the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment, an amendment in similar form to amendment No. 62, which I have tabled, should be tabled to be included in section 7 to expressly confirm that &mdash; even where someone has been nominated by an authorised authority as a data controller that the authorised officer for the purpose of civil damages would maintain liability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider introducing a roll of honour or honours list, whereby suitable recognition could be given to men or women who, by their efforts in sporting, cultural, artistic and business disciplines have brought distinction to this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I understand the Taoiseach's view on the matter, but would it not be an appropriate time to reconsider that issue in view of the fact that quite a number of Irish people have over the past number of years distinguished themselves in international fields of various types and that in recognition we as a nation should be in a position to grant them some special status or honour whereby their efforts could be readily recognised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a big gap in our system that we have not got such a provision but, as the Deputy knows, the issue has been approached on a number of occasions without success.  I am always prepared to have another attempt at it and I agree with the Deputy that it is disappointing from time to time when some Irish person brings great honour, glory and distinction to the country that we cannot award such person some honour which would recognise that fact. On the other side it is equally disappointing that citizens who give service internally above and beyond the norm should not be recognised, but in the past this matter has proved to be a difficult one to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's reference to the difficulties that have arisen in arriving at a formula to introduce such a system, could he see an all-party committee of the House being involved or having any role to play in <Col N="2179" /> working out the difficulties that have existed and trying to arrive at an accepted formula which would be in accordance with the sentiments expressed in the question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when and how he will publish the progress reports prepared by each Minister, with the exception of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, on measures to advance the position of women within each of their areas of responsibility as announced in the EC publication <i>Women of Europe</i>; and if these reports will be published every six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The progress reports on measures to advance the position of women in the areas of responsibility of each Government Minister will be examined and co-ordinated when received in my Department next month.  I would propose that a composite progress report be issued in September with further similar reports at six-monthly intervals thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the <Col N="2180" /> Taoiseach saying these reports will be published in September and I compliment his Department and the Minister of State on making that announcement in <i>Women of Europe</i> magazine which I came across recently.  Would the Taoiseach agree that there are two yardsticks against which Ministers can plan and chart their progress in this area?  One is something the Taoiseach knows about already, the reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights of which the Taoiseach was a member, and the second is the agenda for practical action published by the previous Taoiseach's Department in February 1985 which had a detailed plan of action in each area.  Would the Taoiseach instruct each Minister to appoint a senior official to study those documents and measure and report progress against the recommendations in those reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will look favourably on that suggestion.  I am not sure whether it would be a senior official or whether it should not be done within the Minister's office, but I think the idea is worth while for a concrete measure of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is well aware that there is a continuing discrepancy in pay between men and women.  There is a considerable lack of women on State boards and commissions; 18 per cent is very low.  I am not making comparisons, but there is still a concentration of women in low paid employment. Would the Taoiseach not consider that a Minister of State who is already extremely occupied in Europe, who already has considerable responsibility in the 1992 preparations, cannot herself fulfil the role of overseeing the question of women's affairs?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is time now to appoint a full time Minister of State for women's affairs to look at this very important area?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one point.  I am keenly aware of the need to have more women members on State bodies.  I assure the Deputy that we are genuinely making a determined effort to improve that situation and I hope to achieve concrete results.

      <P>I am aware that out of 584 appointments this Government have made 107 were women.  I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say he intends to take some steps.  Do the steps include, for example, a continual reference to the National Women's Talent Bank and the Women in Business Directory which are at the disposal of the Government all the time to enable them to pick suitable women but which seem to be ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is ignored.  I hope the Deputy will accept my assurance that it is difficult to identify the right type of woman for a particular thing when it arises.  Very often after appointments have been made one suddenly comes across, realises or identifies a woman who would have been perfectly suitable.  It is a matter that requires constant active application to achieve results.  I want to assure the Deputy that this Government &mdash; and I am not casting any aspersions on any other Government &mdash; are very keenly aware of the need to progress in this area.</P>

      <P>No.  On a number of occasions I have explained that the idea of having such a separate meeting is always kept on the table, but so far, either through the Anglo-Irish Agreement Conference or through the meetings which take place in the margins of the European Council, we have been able to deal with most issues which are of mutual interest.</P>

As the Deputy knows, it is not the practice to give any details of what was or was not discussed at these meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meetings benefit from the fact that they are informal and confidential, I would also like to direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that this meeting lasted over an hour, that a joint communique was issued after the meeting, to which I would direct his attention, and that both myself and the British Prime <Col N="2184" /> Minister adhered scrupulously to our decisions as to what we were to say about the meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 26, 35, 37, 38, 49, 73, 74, 75, 80, 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I announced on 24 June the details of the new measure to provide grant aid of 55 per cent for on-farm pollution control and 45 per cent for animal housing and fodder storage under the revised western package.  These rates will be increased by one quarter for eligible young farmers. The scheme will operate outside of a farm plan and will be implemented from 1 July.  The aid for pollution control will be available to dairy farmers regardless of their position on milk quotas.  Part time farmers will also be eligible to apply.</P>
      <P>New entrants to the farm improvement programme in less favoured areas who take out an improvement plan after 1 July will also be able to benefit from these higher rates of grant.  Under the farm improvement programme grant rates of 20 per cent are available in normal areas for waste storage facilities.  This is higher than the rates for fixed assets generally. Again, the additional aid for eligible young farmers will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme to implement the revised package which will now operate in all the less favoured areas was forwarded to the EC Commission on 24 May.  Before this programme could be approved by the Commission it was <Col N="2194" /> necessary to obtain the agreement of all the other member states through the standing structures committee.  I think the House will agree that, having regard to the procedure which had to be followed, the delay in having the programme drawn up and approved was minimal.  In fact, the Commission expressed their appreciation of the expeditious presentation of the programme by the Irish authorities and for my part I am happy to be able to record my own appreciation of the assistance and co-operation of the Commission officials in having the matter dealt with so expeditiously as to have the programme agreed on 24 June.</P>
    <P>The ongoing scheme of land improvement under the package will continue, but the rate of grant will be reduced to 35 per cent for new applicants.  The western drainage scheme will finally expire at the end of this year and while aid for drainage as such will not be available under the western package, aid will be given for drainage where it forms an integral part of a dry land improvement project.  I may say that this approach is in line with present Community policy and has the support of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I will announce, as soon as possible, details of other schemes which are to be implemented as part of the provisions of the revised western package.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that at long last this revised package is in place and I hope it will be fully availed of by the farming community.  Perhaps I should raise the question of the delay since the Minister mentioned it in his reply. Does the Minister accept, now that much of the silage has been made and other problems have arisen, that because of the delay in the introduction of this package the Minister and the Government bear a large measure of responsibility for problems that have already arisen during the course of this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what is achieved one is always blamed for what has been done in the past.  To the extent <Col N="2195" /> that there is any blame attaching, the Deputy should look behind at his own benches.  I achieved a unique package in March of this year which had to get agreement from every member state and it applies nowhere else.  The implementtation of the details of the scheme has to be worked out through all the structures of the committee, and anyone who knows anything about European procedures will know that this was the most expeditious programme ever achieved. Some examples of matters that have to be cleared with every member state are, first, that there will no longer have to be a farm plan; second, that dairy farmers will not be excluded &mdash; that is new and contrary to any EC proposals up to this &mdash; and, third, no longer will farm accounts be required.  All these are new. So much else that has been done here is not just new but absolutely unique.  Those who make complaints about delays should introduce themselves to the realities of European negotiations.  They will find that the Commission were not just using words for the sake of it when they congratulated us on the expeditious manner in which we got through this unique package.  In other words, the Deputy should not blame me for what did not happen last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House the extent of grant aid available to farmers in the non-disadvantaged areas for the carrying out of the kind of improvements set out in Question No. 11?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question generally related to the western package. The extent of grant aid available to farmers in the non-disadvantaged areas which are not part of the western package is 20 per cent, which is 5 per cent higher than that which goes for normal farm development costs.  That is the maximum available under the EC regulations.  Also, in regard to the farm income survey which was published recently showing a 31 per cent increase generally in farm incomes, <Col N="2197" /> and the fact that there was a smaller income in the disadvantaged areas which is the other two thirds I am dealing with here, it is clear that in the interests of the farmers themselves &mdash; because it is their markets that will be influenced by this whole area of product presentation &mdash; those who can benefit from 20 per cent where they have had a 31 per cent farm income increase should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of last week.  Farmers should be congratulated on their efforts to deal with this whole pollution problem this year.  They deserve more credit than they have been given.  In regard to the 20 per cent that the Minister is talking about, is this on top of what they may have already got under the farm improvement scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the farm improvement scheme.  The only addition to that is that there would be 25 per cent surplus which has now been agreed for young farmers and that applies to all under 35.  Where 55 per cent is the normal grant under the western package that is increased by 25 per cent to 70 per cent for all farmers under 35 and the same increase applies here.  I would be the last to take from the farm organisations.  In fact I have already today acknowledged that the farm organisations have taken a very responsible and positive position here but there are some small unrepresentative farmers who are doing irreparable damage.  I have called together the farm organisations together with ACOT with a view to isolating those who could do terrible damage to farming interests and the economy generally and all aspects of our environment.  I have no doubt that I will get full co-operation from the farm organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point there has been a certain amount of hype in the media over this question of pollution, particularly with regard to 1987 when there were several very serious incidents, <Col N="2198" /> and I am sure we all condemn those incidents. Will the Minister advise local authorities and fishery boards not to over-react and not to have a witch hunt against every farmer who has a problem?  People who have had planning permission for silage pits from these local authorities now find that they are being summoned and although they have shown goodwill and intent to rectify the problems they are still being pursued and there is somewhat of a witch hunt going on.  I would like that commonsense would prevail so that good citizens are not hounded because of this over-reaction in the media because of what happened last year. Would the Minister please see to it that we have a certain amount of balance, not over-reaction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably it was not confined to last year; it has happened this year as well.  Where there is evidence that a small unrepresentative group of farmers, either through carelessness or selfishness, are undermining our environment which affects our environment for living, our tourism and our £3 billion industry and the perception of our products abroad which have given us the highest beef and dairy prices, then I, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, will join with my colleagues in taking the most stringent approaches.  I know I will enjoy the support of the farm organisations.</P>
      <P>Part of the question the Deputy raised related to the responsibility of other Ministers.  I work in close consultation with the Ministers for the Environment, the Marine and Tourism and Transport but the regulations and prosecutions are not a matter for me.</P>

      <P>The concern about the environment and the food industry and the farming industry is shared by those of us who live in cities.  Can the Minister indicate the amount of money available under this scheme for the prevention of pollution and the provision of these holding tanks?  How much of this money will be EC money and how much will be Irish taxpayers' money?  Can the Minister also indicate if there is a time limit on the scheme itself?  Will the scheme cease after a period?  Finally, is there any obligation on farmers to take up the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on farmers to ensure that they comply with the law and we are strengthening the legal position there which was part of the common position of a Cabinet subcommittee on which I serve with my other colleagues.  As far as the amount of money is concerned it might help the House to indicate that the original total for the western package up to the end of 1991 for a ten year period from the EC was £149 million.  In fact, £60 million of that was drawn down after over six years. It is because I felt that the draw down was too slow that we renegotiated the package and included this element which was not there before.  Now there will be £87 million to be drawn down between now and 1991.  Of that, at the moment not less than £12 million to £15 million will be available just for this aspect of it. More will be available for infrastructures and land improvement, forestry, training and living conditions.  I want to assure the House that following negotiations I have obtained agreement from the Commission to set up a monitoring committee so as to ensure that we draw down all of that money, and we have only two and a half years in which to do so, and if the pace is slower in one area than in another we can switch from one part of the envelope to another.  That is a very important element of the new package.</P>

There are two questions which I would like to ask the Minister.  First of all, can he tell us if there is an upper limit on the amount of grant which may be made available and, if so, what is the figure?  Secondly, can the Minister tell us when the house improvement grants under the western package come into operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to join with my colleagues in acknowledging the work which has been done by many farmers. In fact, I heard earlier on the news that the farming organisations, and this is the kind of action we want to see, have made arrangements for slurry disposal for farmers who apparently are not able to cope.  That is the kind of action we want to see and we are going to get more of that co-operation.  No upper limit has been set.  Grant aid at 45 per cent will be provided for animal housing and fodder storage will be increased by one-quarter for eligible young farmers with grant aid of 55 per cent being provided for silage and slurry storage to be increased by a quarter for eligible young farmers.  No farm accounts need be presented.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to learn that this grant has not yet been paid.  The installation aid scheme for young farmers was introduced by the previous Government. It was a very imaginative and innovative scheme and was geared to encourage the early transfer of farms to the younger generation.  Many young farmers are now becoming disillusioned with the way in which this scheme is being implemented.  Many of these young farmers have had to obtain bridging loans from financial institutions at a very high rate of interest and two years after applying for aid, despite having complied with the stringent requirements on eligibility, <Col N="2204" /> they have not yet been paid.  Can the Minister give us an assurance that he will treat this case with the urgency that I feel it deserves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that installation aid is very important and an indication of the importance which I attach to it is that I was glad to be able to obtain agreement to have the grants restored this year having been obliged last year to suspend the scheme due to financial constraints.  I have to say in relation to this case that the registration was only completed by the Land Registry on 19 April.  That does not suggest there has been any undue delay in our part but it is a condition precedent that the land be registered and registration was only completed on that date.  In fact, we were informed of this at a later date but I will give attention to it.</P>

Therefore, if a farmer has 200 acres his earnings would be in the region of £16,000 per annum which would be on a par with the earnings of an industrial worker.

      <P>The Pig Production Group, representative of the Department, IDA, AFT and ACOT, which I set up in October 1987, has recommended that pigmeat processing could not expand without the backing of a well structured production sector.  Accordingly the manufacturing sector is being actively encouraged to take a lead role in ensuring that producers are given the incentive to expand.  Factories have been informed that grant aid for development will be conditional on pre-set pig targets being reached and have been asked to submit proposals, on an individual factory basis, detailing realistic plans to assist producers to expand.  The present position is that these proposals are awaited and when received will be critically examined by the group.</P>

However, under European Community regulations there is a definite limit on what a government are allowed to do in this area &mdash; a limit of a 25 per cent grant in less favoured areas and a 15 per cent grant in other areas.

      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken with regard to the potato sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 June I had wide-ranging discussions with the Irish Farmers' Association about the development of the sector.  The main purpose of the meeting <Col N="2212" /> was to discuss ways of improving the marketing, quality and presentation of Irish potatoes to enable producers to compete effectively with imports and have reasonable returns.  I look forward to the continued co-operation of the IFA with An Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>The question of appointing a market co-ordinator for potatoes is also being considered.</P>
    <P>The extension of the regulation on producer groups to potatoes and the possibility of increased FEOGA grants for the provision of potato storage have been raised with the Commission.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year An Bord Glas organised a promotion campaign for potatoes in order to generate consumer awareness of the range, health, eating qualities and suitability of Irish potatoes to meet consumer demands and in order to reduce imports.  An Bord Glas appointed an expert commodity team to examine the potato sector.  The report of the team, which is at present being considered, will form the basis of a five-year development plan for the industry.</P>
    <P>On 17 June I had a meeting with potato producer representatives, regarding the slow uptake of the early Irish crop and the consequential effect on producer prices.  This was followed by a meeting with representatives of major supermarkets, wholesalers and importers who gave a commitment to support the marketing of high quality, well presented Irish potatoes.</P>

Furthermore, would the Minister consider and comment on the following; first, why has the regulation in relation to below-cost selling not been applied to the potato industry? I know this is probably proper to the Minister for Industry and Commerce but surely the Minister of State present should have some input in any such decision.  Second, is the Minister satisfied <Col N="2213" /> that the regulation in regard to identification of growers, their registration and so on is being implemented, because it is my understanding that the regulation is not being implemented to any great extent?  Third, would the Minister consider changing the existing grading regulation? It has been suggested to me that a change in that regulation by way of increasing the minimum size would be helpful from the point of view of regularising the market.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take the last of the Deputy's questions first, as I said in my reply, we have made application to the Commission for a substantial increase in grant aid for potato storage.  The expert commodity team established for the potato industry clearly identified a serious storage problem at farm level. That commodity team estimated that there was a need for something in the region of 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes storage space on farms which would involve considerable capital investment.  While I would be the first to recognise that the potato industry, of its very nature, has been through difficult periods, not alone in the past 12 months but over many periods in the past, I would have to say that there is no common market organisation for potatoes within the Community. There would appear to be considerable resistance among some other member states of the EC to the establishment of a common market organisation for potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question the Deputy raised about below-cost selling, I should <Col N="2214" /> say that, when the relevant legislation was first introduced, there was provision that it be revised after a 12 month period. I am sure that the position with regard to potatoes will be considered then.  I do not want to anticipate what may happen but I am sure that the problems of that industry will be considered within that legislative review.  As I said in my comprehensive reply on the industry as a whole, the expert commodity team examined the matter and brought forward specific recommendations which will form the basis of a five-year development plan for the whole industry.  I hope that plan will be available in the not too distant future and will chart the future course of the industry, placing it on a firm footing from which it can progress.</P>

We must consider this matter against the background of there being approximately 66,000 primary potato producers with approximately 61,000 to 62,000 growing less than a hectare of potatoes.  Therefore, the Deputy will readily appreciate the difficulties encountered in that area.  There are some producers who have registered but, naturally, we would be much happier were more to register.  Within the context of the development plan for the industry we shall apply our minds to that aspect.</P>

      <P>May I seek the permission of the House to correct a rather important matter which has just been brought to my attention and which will not interfere with the order of questions? In replying to a supplementary question I indicated that, as far as I knew, there was no limit to off-farm income in relation to the western package.  It has been brought to my attention that, under an existing regulation of 1985, there is <Col N="2215" /> such a limit, though it did not form part of the negotiations in which I was involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Cereal producers' margins have been under pressure over the past few years because of EC measures to curb expenditure and competition from imported cereal substitutes.</P>
      <P>The additional co-responsibility levy will, of course, apply only if Community cereal production exceeds 160 million tonnes.  Small cereal producers will also be exempt from both the basic and additional levies in respect of the first 25 tonnes of cereals marketed.</P>
      <P>The European Council has called on the EC Commission to press for an appropriate solution to problems arising from imports of cereal substitutes into the Community.</P>

      <P>There is no point in the <Col N="2216" /> Minister bandying about this farm income survey which showed that farm incomes have been increased by 31 per cent when they are in fact 6 per cent below their 1984 level.  Would the Minister say whether the Council of Ministers can do anything to improve the incomes of cereal producers?  In 1984, as a practising farmer, I managed to get £145 for green barley whereas, in 1988, I expect to be able to get between £90 and £100 for the same commodity.  It would appear that, before long, cereal farmers will have to be put in glass cages; otherwise they will become extinct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a couple of general points first.  I agree with the Deputy that cereal producers have experienced difficult times &mdash; incidentally, all over Europe and, in other places, perhaps even more severe than here.  In the current season cereal producers are benefiting from firm cereal prices brought about by a relative scarcity of quality cereals on world markets and, in particular, drought problems encountered in a number of producer countries, including the United States, Canada and Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise cereal producers that their prospects are not at all bad now for a number of reasons.  I would advise them to concentrate on supplying commodities on demand in markets, such as malting barley, quality feed wheat and barley because it is in their production their prospects lie.  With regard to the European dimension, I want to assure the Deputy that I was very much involved in getting the Council to agree to a limitation on cereal substitutes &mdash; which I do know poses a major problem here &mdash; and to opening negotiations in relation to the control of cereal substitutes into the Community.  The House should remember that small producers have been <Col N="2217" /> exempted from the co-responsibility levy.  The set-aside programme will be voluntary for the individual producers but it will have to be brought forward shortly and finally by the Council and we, as well as the other member states, will act on it.  I expect a formal, final proposal very shortly.</P>

      <P>A Community scheme for the grading of pig carcases by reference to lean meat content will be introduced on 1 January 1989.  The scheme will apply in all plants catering for the home and exports markets which slaughter at least 200 pigs per week. Grading will be carried out by factory personnel.  However, officers of my Department will be closely monitoring the scheme to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the Community regulations. I believe that these arrangements are the most appropriate for implementing the new grading measures.</P>
      <P>The necessary legislative provisions to give effect to the new grading scheme will be put before the House in the autumn. Deputies will then have the opportunity to participate in a full examination of the arrangements being proposed.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept the need for the producer to have confidence if we are to attain the increase from two million pigs to three million pigs.  Will he accept that many producers will not be happy with the proposed arrangement from 1 January next? <Col N="2218" /> Even at this stage, will he consider a change in those arrangements which would lead to confidence on the part of the producers?  I am not making allegations against the factory personnel but there is perceived to be a problem in that regard.  Will the Minister agree that it would be far better to have an independent inspectorate rather than grading being done by factory personnel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern and I share his commitment to ensuring that we have the highest possible standards and that our supervision and inspection will guarantee that.  We are agreed on that point.  As I indicated to the Deputy, we will have an opportunity to go into this in detail because I propose to introduce the necessary legislation early in the new session, before the scheme comes into effect in January.  The points the Deputy made will then be taken into account.  It is very important that the market will be the criterion and that producers and processors will be very conscious &mdash; as I am sure they will be &mdash; that, unless they produce quality, they will not get quality prices.  That will be an important element in our approach because nobody will buy poor quality from any source.  I will not go into technical detals here as they will be much more appropriate during the course of the debate but there are different means, standards and investigations and we propose to introduce the most stringent and efficient ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be missing the point.  We are agreed on the need for quality but the problem is that many producers feel that when they produce quality goods they are not given the proper grade which will give them the top price.  Someone suggested to me that if the general price goes up the grade automatically goes down in some areas. Obviously, there is a need for confidence on the part of the procedures that having produced the quality they will get the proper grades.  That is why I urge the Minister, before the regulation is implemented, to have one independent <Col N="2219" /> inspectorate, which will solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the validity of the Deputy's remarks.  Perhaps the Deputy does not know that the regulations to which I referred do not oblige slaughterers to relate payment to lean meat content although they may relate to the grading.  We will obviously have to give serious attention to this matter because it is of vital importance for the producer.  If he produces the quality, he should be paid for it.</P>

    <Title>Data Protection Bill, 1987: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) For the purposes of this Act a data controller may mean a person, who is a partner in a partnership, who shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of all partners in such partnership as respects the data concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is tabled to cater for the difficulties which could be foreseen where a partnership would have data processing services and the particular machinery and equipment mentioned in the Bill and each partner in the partnership &mdash; as the Minister confirmed on Second Stage &mdash; would have to register as a data controller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the definition section in section 1, a data controller means a person who, either alone or with others, controls the contents and use of personal data.  Despite that, it appears that partnerships are not regarded as being one body and each partner under the Bill is required to register as a data controller. That is somewhat unrealistic and cumbersome and one of the objectives of the Bill is that is should be within the range of realism and that it should not impose an unrealistic burden on business and commercial concerns generally.  It would <Col N="2274" /> be cumbersome and difficult to operate if each partner in an accountancy or solicitor firm had to register as a data controller for the purposes of the Bill.  It would be more realistic to designate one partner as the person who will act on behalf of all the partners as a data controller.</P>
    <P>The definition seems to indicate that such a situation is envisaged in the Bill. I ask the Minister to have regard to that definition and specifically to accept the principle behind my amendment.  It is not attempting to get away with non-registration or to evade the responsibilities which this Bill places on those in commerce, but it would be more realistic. There would be large registration cost and bureaucratic procedures which are unnecessary.  For many other purposes, a partnership is treated as one unit.  It would be realistic in this instance to also treat it as one unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the position of partners under the Bill requires particular attention because of the nature of the partnership. Under the definition of data controller in subsection (1), any person who controls personal data either alone or with other partners will be a data controller. That will be a matter of fact in each case and should not give rise to any special difficulties.  So far as partners who may have to register are concerned, there is provision under section 20 for regulations to prescribe such matters and procedure as the particulars to be included in entries in the register, and also any other matters that may be necessary or expendient for the purposes of enabling the registration provisions to have full effect.  This will give an appreciable degree of flexibility which will deal with any difficulty in relation to the registration of partnerships.  I would envisage that a partnership would in effect be registered as such in the sense that partners who had control over the personal data concerned would be registered as data controllers.  In virtually all cases that would have to include all the partners. <Col N="2275" /> That procedure will meet the concerns expressed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misheard the Minister but he seems to be saying that on the one hand regulations can be introduced under section 20 which will mean that it will not be a cumbersome procedure but, on the other hand, I thought the Minister said that every partner will have to be registered as a data controller. The aim of my amendment is to obviate the necessity for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as partners who may have to register are concerned there is provision in section 20 for regulations to prescribe such matters of procedure as the particulars to be included in entries in the register and also any other matters that may be necessary or expedient for the purposes of enabling the registration provisions to have full effect.  That would give a degree of flexibility which is sufficient. I am quite happy that that will deal with any difficulty in relation to the registration of partnerships.  I would envisage that a partnership would in effect be registered as such in the sense that partners who had control over the personal data concerned would be registered as data controllers and in virtually all cases, that would have to include all the partners.  I am sure that will meet the concern expressed by Deputy Colley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Minister, it does not, because the point I am trying to make is that if for instance one were talking about a Government Department one person would be designed as the data controller.  I presume that private companies would also have one person designed as a data controller so that everybody who deals with the data would not be registered as a data controller.  It is unnecessary to have every member of a partnership designated as a data controller for the purposes of this Bill.  For the purposes of this Bill one person could be designated and perhaps the wording should be added that that person would be indemnified by the other partners if <Col N="2276" /> any action was taken under section 7 or under the law of Tort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In a Government Department one person will be designated as a data controller.  This is in line with the discussion we had before lunch.  In a private company the data controller is part of the unit of the company so the company is responsible for the data controller.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4), to delete lines 43 to 45, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) personal data that in the opinion of the Minister or the Minister for Defence is kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State save where such opinion is set aside upon review by the Circuit Court or by the Supreme Court on Appeal,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I referred to this matter during the Second Stage debate.  While I accept that the Minister and the Minister for Defence may on occasion for the purposes of security have to keep information to themselves relating to individuals living in the State, there is a question of opinion as to what is information that has a security content.  The Bill as drafted does not provide for any court of appeal.  There should be some method by which people can appeal against information held under the heading &ldquo;security&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 16 seeks to replace section 1 (4) with the following wording:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) personal data in the opinion of the Minister or the Minister for Defence is kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State save where such opinion is set aside upon review by the Circuit Court or by the Supreme Court on Appeal,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is intended here is that the court would not disclose the information to either the individual or his legal representatives but that a judge would act as an arbitrator in a review procedure.  We would not envisage that any information would be disclosed to anybody.  A Circuit Court Judge will decide whether he regards information as being of a high security nature and he could dismiss any appeal without disclosing the information to the individual.  There could be a further appeal to the Supreme Court which would again fulfil a similar role.  Will the Minister look at these reasonable amendments given the type of information that <Col N="2278" /> could be held concerning an individual and the difficulty that that individual would have in trying to secure from the State the information held by the State about him or her?  The procedure we have set out here &mdash; using the Circuit Court initially and the Supreme Court on appeal &mdash; would be a satisfactory way of dealing with this particular aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments propose that decisions as to whether personal data kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State should be subject to review by a judge of the Circuit Court with an appeal to the Supreme Court.  I do not agree because the exclusion of security data from the Bill is authorised by Article 9 of the convention &mdash; I think we all agree on that.  In no circumstances do we want any access to these data except by those people who have the responsibility of safeguarding our national security.  This kind of intelligence information must, of its nature, be confined to those whose job it is to safeguard State security and even there to the smallest possible group of people. That is because of the highly sensitive character of the information which if it were to be disclosed could possibly result in deaths or injuries.</P>
      <P>It goes further than that.  We do not want people to know whether information of this kind is kept about them because in many cases mere knowledge of the existence of such information could be detrimental to State security and could put people at risk.  That is why we have selected those Ministers who have been given responsibility for this area under the law and who are answerable to the House to have the final decision in the event of any dispute arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the United Kingdom a certificate of a Minister that an exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security is made conclusive evidence of that fact.  That is an example of the importance attached elsewhere to the considerations I have mentioned.  In the Bill we make the exclusion dependent on the opinion of either Minister and a certificate to that effect is made evidence <Col N="2279" /> of that opinion in any proceedings.  It will not, however, be conclusive evidence. The provision in the Bill is in line with those in foreign legislation which we have examined.  It is in accord with the convention and I believe it is essential to keep it in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate that I have no objections to information being held by the State which has a high security content.  Naturally, the State would not be anxious to disclose the content of that information.  In the way that subsection is worded it is a matter of opinion as to what is information of a security nature. All of us in this House will recall that in the not too distant past we complained bitterly when the contents of a report were not disclosed because it was felt it was for security reasons.  There was the question of opinion here as to whether it was for security reasons.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that this Minister for Justice or this Minister for Defence would abuse the power given to them under this section but in the future there may be a dispute as to whether information held about any individual is or is not of a security nature.  Therefore, rather than have a system whereby this information can be disclosed in public to anybody, I think it would be reasonable that a judge &mdash; after all, he is appointed by the Government to the Circuit Court &mdash; would examine the information and form an opinion as to whether he felt this was information of a security nature and, therefore, he could dismiss such an appeal or allow it to go to the Supreme Court.  None of this information would be disclosed to anybody but it is a safeguard that should be included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to redraft what I have suggested in some other way and come back later this evening before we complete Report Stage I would be very pleased.  I do not want to allow a situation where information of a security nature would have to be disclosed to anybody. If it can be worded in a different way to cater for the fears I have expressed I would be only too pleased to co-operate. <Col N="2280" /> People can form an opinion that in another person's opinion would not be information of a security nature.  If we are asking other people to disclose information about an individual, I do not think anybody should be immune from the law unless it is information of a high security nature.  The only way that can be done is to give it to a judge or a particular court: if you want to cut out the Circuit Court and go directly to the Supreme Court I have no objections to that but there should be some court of appeal for somebody who feels very strongly about information that is being held about him and has reason to believe that that information should not be in the hands of the State or anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of amendment No. 16.  Despite the good standing of the Minister and the Minister for Defence, there is the possibility in the future of a situation occurring where if an individual applies for information about data which is held on him he may be told that it relates to security and cannot be divulged.  It may, in fact, not relate to security at all but there is no way in which that individual can check that out.  It does not mean he has to find out what the information is but there should be some scrutiny over it.  This is a very wide power which we are giving here and it could negate the whole purpose of the Bill regarding Government bodies and Departments.  Whether it should be the Circuit Court or another court or a judge sitting in chambers that would not endanger the security of the State.  If a judge of high standing sitting in chambers were to hear certain evidence, without divulging any of it to the individual concerned or any other group of individuals, I think there would be a better safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy should always have checks and balances.  In this instance, in this part of the Bill, there are no checks and balances and it worries me.  It is no reflection on the Ministers but we do not know what will happen in the future and this Bill, when enacted, will be on the stocks for many years presumably, perhaps amended from time to time but the <Col N="2281" /> basic attitude in these sections will be continued.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to putting in some type of safeguard.  Merely the opinion of one or other Minister is very open and, to a large extent, is anti-democratic in the way it could be operated.</P>

      <P>I can understand very readily the sentiments of Deputy Barrett and Deputy Colley and if I were sitting on that side of the House I could very easily make the same argument.  This argument has been made on a number of occasions.  It was made recently when the debate was going on in relation to the Garda Complaints Bill.  It was then suggested that the chairman of the Garda Complaints Board, rather than the Minister for Justice, should have the final say as to whether information prejudicial to State security should be omitted from the report of an officer investigating the complaint.  That is more or less the same as what we are talking about now.  It is a somewhat analogous point.  My immediate predecessor, Deputy Dukes, said that the provisions in that Bill were being criticised on the basis that it was wrong that the definition of security of the State should be reserved to the apparatus designed to protect security.  In the course of the debate on that issue speaking in the Seanad on 9 July 1986, Official Report, Vol. 113, column 2175 he said:</P>
      <P>I do not see anything wrong with acknowledging and providing for the exercise of the responsibility that we vest in certain people involved in the administration of our judicial... system and who are involved <i>ex offico</i> in protecting the security of the State. It would be totally wrong to provide that the Minister for Justice should have no role in that because it is part of his responsibility given to him and confirmed by the seal of office the President hands to him.</P>
      <P>In relation to a proposal that the ultimate decision on the matter should lie with the complaints board he went on to say, and I quote from column 2177:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2282" /> I do not think that is a proper way to deal with a matter which could affect the security of the State or put another person's life at risk.  It would give the board a right to insist on disclosure of information which, on grounds of public policy, even the courts cannot require to be disclosed.  There is ample documentation in regard to that point.</P>
    <P>These are exactly my sentiments.  From a practical point of view Members would agree that if a matter such as this of a high security content and which would have very serious consequences on disclosure goes to a court you are certainly widening the number of persons that will be aware of what is there and it is very likely it will get out.  None of us want the consequences that could result from that which would be to make it easier to happen than it is.  God knows, we have enough trouble at times in keeping security information limited to the number who are meant to deal with it.  I think Deputies will agree with me on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, what is being discussed here is somewhat analagous to the Garda Complaints Board.  The Minister refers to the fact that high security matters should not be disclosed.  He refers to reports from the Garda Complaints Board and says that certain things should not be included. Here we are not talking about whether high security matters are involved.  We are talking about ordinary matters being dressed up as high security matters for the purpose of excluding them from the person's accessibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither is it necessary that a whole group of people in a public court have to be involved in this.  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of our imagination and ingenuity to come up with some system of scrutiny of what is said to be in the Bill, simply an opinion of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence.  It seems to be a very wide power with no stops on it at all save the fact that the seal of office of the Minister has been given to him by the President under certain rules and conditions; in other words he is <Col N="2283" /> expected to do his job properly.  If by any chance there is a bad apple in the barrel and he does not do his job properly, where are we?  The provision could be very easily used by unscrupulous people who would not wish to divulge certain information perhaps because it might damage a Department's reputation.  Any number of things can occur where the public servants do not wish information to be revealed.  It is possible that it could be hidden under this subsection.  It is dangerous.  I think the Minister is overstating the difficulties.  He should perhaps give some thought to using a judge in chambers to decide on the gravity of the situation and whether the opinion formed by the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence is reasonably formed and on a reasonable basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about personal data as distinct from the movements of an individual, whom he or she meets and so on.  I have come across occasions where Garda reports contain information about individuals that has subsequently turned out to be inaccurate. That information can be very detrimental to an individual.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is enacted the Minister of the day is not going to deal personally with every single application.  The Minister for Justice anyway, no matter who he is, has so much on his plate that he will not be dealing with all this himself. An official of the Department will be dealing with it, so other people will know; it is not just in the Minister's head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 111 provides that a Circuit Court judge may seek the relevant information, but it is the judge alone.  This is not being heard in public and there will not be barristers on the side of the defendant and a whole open court session about this application.  This will be a Circuit Court judge who may look at the information or he may not.  If he does he and he alone will see it and he will either refuse or grant what is sought.  Then there is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court and again only the <Col N="2284" /> Supreme Court will look at this information. I am quite certain that only rarely will this happen but it is a sign that within our legislation we have an open society.</P>
    <P>Once you become a Minister you cannot automatically say to everybody: &ldquo;You can hump off; I am not giving you information because in my opinion it is of a very high security nature.  You can do what you like but I am protected by the law&rdquo;.  We could have that sort of system but it would not do much for democracy.  It is better to be seen to be open and prepared to be examined if necessary in exceptional cases.  We are talking only about personal data and if it happened that information was held about any one of us that was inaccurate we would all be very anxious to get rid of it from the file whether it be in a computer or a manual file, because the consequences to individuals and their families can be enormous.  If the State is going to retain so much power in this legislation, it is only reasonable that in exceptional circumstances in the first instance a Circuirt Court judge, in chambers if you wish, can ask to see this information that is so important and confirm or reject the opinion of the Minister.  If you are still not happy you can go to the Supreme Court.  If you want to rule out a Circuit Court judge I will have no hang ups about that.  If you have to go to the Supreme Court, fair enough, but surely nobody would suggest for one minute that the members of the Supreme Court are individuals who are going to go around the town giving out information they have got of a high security nature.  They are not.  They are very responsible individuals.</P>
    <P>Something done in this Bill along the lines I am suggesting would be an indication to the public out there that nobody can say: &ldquo;Hump off, I am not going to consider your application&rdquo;.  That is a good thing in democracy.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be dogmatic about the wording I have suggested here or insist it has to be the way it is outlined in amendment No. 16.  If the Minister accepts the point, can he not between now and whenever we finish Committee Stage come back with maybe a suggestion <Col N="2285" /> for Report Stage?  Then we could consider it.  I am concerned about the principle here and I think it worth while pursuing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the Bill is in line with all the other legislation we have examined on the European scene and is no different from what our partners in Europe have.  It is exactly the same and I have no doubt but that the same type of discussion took place in the different parliaments when their data protection legislation was being enacted. The provision we have is in accord with the Convention.</P>
      <P>I appreciate very much that the Deputies want to prevent non-security data being certified as security data.  I can understand that as well, but the amendment would give a right of review of all data certified by the Minister to be security data, even if it is security data as presumbaly it would be.  I am very satisfied that no Minister who has to sign the certificates, irrespective of how busy he might be &mdash; the Minister has to sign the certificates &mdash; is going to express formally an opinion on such a matter without being satisfied that he could justify that opinion if necessary in court, because the possibility can never be excluded that the information in question would be irregularly disclosed later.  That is always there, even with the highest security matters, and God knows from our experience over the years we should know well it is there. It can be taken for granted that no Minister will give a certificate for this purpose without making sure it is in order because if it is not he cannot be sure the matter will not become public knowledge.  If that were to develop, we all know the situation that would develop in this House at that time, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, and I think everybody agrees with me, security information must be confined to the smallest number of people possible.  That is absolutely essential.  The amendments propose that decisions as to whether personal data are kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State should be subject to review by a judge of the Circuit Court, with an <Col N="2286" /> appeal to the Supreme Court.  That would be opening up the whole matter and the security risks and the cost would be far greater than they are now.  In no circumstances would this House want access to these data except by the people who have the responsibility of safeguarding our national security.</P>
    <P>We are talking about personal data and I presume the name of an informer would be described as personal data.  If that sort of information came out, the consequences could be very grave.  We are in line with every other European country, we are doing as they do and we are doing what the Convention allows us to do.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 17 in my name reads:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4), lines 43 to 45, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>I have listened to the debate and I am prepared to go along with amendment No. 16 in the name of Deputy Shatter. This is a most important area because it deals with the security of the State.  As Deputy Barrett said, we are talking about personal data.  I do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; but what comes to mind are photographs, age, place of birth, height, weight, marital status, family information and other personal statistics.</P>
      <P>Everything is open to error, even court decisions.  People have been wrongly convicted. People have been wrongly hanged.  Here we are talking about a clerk in a ministry putting data into a computer and the Minister is saying there must be no appeal against that.  There is such a thing as mistaken identity.  You could have personal data on a very prominent member of the Provisionals but you might have the wrong photograph.  That happens in newspapers.  The wrong information might be fed into the computer and a person might be innocent of being involved in a certain organisation.  It is very serious if such an individual cannot appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the danger was that non-security data might be regarded as security data.  That can happen in the <Col N="2287" /> Civil Service and in the Department of Defence, but there is more than that at stake.  If an innocent person is named as a security risk that person can be considered to be a grave danger to the State.</P>
    <P>As I said, in view of the Minister's remarks I am inclined to go along with Deputy Shatter's amendment as being best.  Under Deputy Shatter's amendment the Minister would still make his decision, and it could only be overthrown by a court.  In other words, a person would have to have very sound reasons for going to court, and would also have to have evidence showing there was something wrong with the data in the computer before going to court.  That is a reasonable precaution because in normal circumstances a person would not dash into court just to annoy the Minister.  This will be a costly procedure and a person must have good reason for taking that action.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment, or he might think of a suitable amendment to ensure that innocent people are not wrongly identified.  Let me put it this way.  There are data on a computer about a particular individual the Minister regards as a threat to the security of the State.  That does not put that person in immediate danger, but under certain circumstances that person would be rounded up when specific decisions are made.  It is more important that that information be accurate than the information on all the other individuals who are not regarded as a danger to the State, because very little is likely to happen to them, but the person in the first category is at very serious risk.  If there is something wrong, if somebody is wrongly named, photographed or something like that, and if a person is wrongly included in those data, he must have a right of appeal to get out of that grave danger.  That is the important point here.</P>
    <P>The minimum the Minister should do is to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment which gives some right of appeal.  The Minister is saying that once a person is marked as a danger to the security of the State he has no appeal against whatever <Col N="2288" /> data are on that computer.  When the crisis comes &mdash; say internment is introduced &mdash; that person is under observation because he is considered to be a danger to the State, with no appeal and no rights. However, there could be a number of other consequences from this as well.</P>
    <P>In the case of mistaken identity and wrong data inserted, innocent people could be involved.  The Minister is concerned about the court because he believes more people would have access to the data.  There might be some procedure at court in camera but a judge should be able to make a decision to have the minimum number of people involved, or the minimum amount of information made available.  There must be some procedure and maybe Deputy Barrett could tell me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there would not be any danger of widespread dissemination of information, which seems to be the Minister's main argument against accepting this amendment.  I appeal to him to look at this again and if he does not accept that amendment perhaps he would suggest some other type of appeal he would think appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to wear his parliamentarian hat as opposed to this Minister for Justice hat. There is undoubtedly a strong element of protection of State security in the Department of Justice, as there should be, but it seems to be an over-riding consideration where they are concerned.  The Minister of the day, because he is also a parliamentarian, must balance up what he is being informed of by his Department and the nature of democracy.  It is all very well to say that the same conditions and provisions apply throughout Europe in other legislation but we have here a particular type of democracy and Government system which we do not find in many of the other European states.  We, unlike Britain, have a written Constitution which protects the rights of the <Col N="2289" /> individual.  There is a place in legislation such as this for some checks and balances, which are not provided for in the subsection. The Minister has already said that if he were on this side of the House he would be making these very points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some person on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party probably made those points in regard to the Garda Complaints Bill and that is why the Minister of the day replied in those terms.  There is a duty on the Minister for Justice to balance the real and perceived needs of security with democracy and rights of the individual, which must be safeguarded.</P>
      <P>I am still very concerned that non-security matters will be dealt with as security matters under this heading, while also being concerned about mistakes or omissions in the data.  There is no way an individual can establish that a security risk is not involved if he wishes to erase or correct information.  It is a very basic right enshrined in the Constitution that the individual has a right to vindicate himself.  This legislation does not maintain that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly have a dilemma here.  I recognise that we must strike a balance.  There is no disagreement so far as high security information is concerned.  There must be absolute secrecy in regard to such information. The balance to be struck is a balance between injustice to an individual on the one hand and loss of life on the other hand.  It boils down to that.  This amendment would allow any subversive, who would be certain that his data were on the security computer, to have his claim that the data were non-security examined in the Circuit Court by one judge or by five judges in the Supreme <Col N="2290" /> Court.  I do not think any of us would want that.  High security information is valuable only when it is tightly held and available only to those who need to know. I do not think any of us would want to widen that in any way.</P>
      <P>With regard to non-security information, this information has to be produced by the Garda, unless it prejudices the prevention of crime.  With regard to the fear that non-security data might be certified as security data, I am more than satisfied that no Minister will formally express an opinion in such a matter without being satisfied that he could justify that opinion, if necessary in court.  The possibility can never be excluded that the information on which he based his opinion might be secret information.  Our experiences in the past have made that clear to us.  I am satisfied that no Minister of any Government would give a certificate for this purpose without making sure that it was in order.  It would be known, even to a small number, that the Minister was wrong in doing what he did. The ministry is a difficult and busy one and the Minister would not last ten minutes in the job if he gave a wrong opinion.  The information would be used against him in some way.  That information would not and could not be kept secret.</P>
      <P>With regard to our obligations under this convention, we are not doing anything in any way different from our colleagues in Europe &mdash; no more and no less.  I can readily understand the point of view that a balance has to be struck as against injustice to an individual on the one hand and loss of life on the other hand.  That is what other administrations in the EC had to face up to as well.  I can see why the amendments are put forward and I accept the intentions behind them, but the consequences would make it impossible for the people charged with State security to operate successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the Minister.  Of course there must be a balance.  The Minister talks about the security of the State, the disclosure of information and so on.  We are <Col N="2291" /> elected to represent people.  Suppose the son or daughter of one of us found out that gravely inaccurate information was held about him or her which was casting grave aspersions on his or her character, preventing the obtaining of employment or departure from the country.  I had the honour of being in Government for a short four years.  We all know how information is gathered.  It is gathered by a number of people and put on file or computer. The Minister of the day is not involved in compiling the information.  It is part of the job of the security forces to maintain the information on the file.</P>
      <P>Anybody who knows that he is a member of the Provisional IRA, and has bombed and done all the horrible things that I speak out about any time I get an opportunity, is not going to go into the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court to look for this information on the basis that it is not for high security reasons that it is not being disclosed.  What I am concerned about is that, in some of the very serious circumstances that could occur as a result of information being held, there should be some appeal to somebody.  If I apply for a gun licence the procedure is that I go to the local sergeant and he can issue a gun licence.  The sergeant might not issue a gun licence because he thought or heard something about me, but there is an appeal to the local superintendent, and the local superintendent will go further to investigate why this licence was refused and, in the process, could discover that a mistake had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I might have misled the Deputy.  It is the Garda superintendent who makes the decision, not the local sergeant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Col N="2292" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be helpful to the Deputy, no more than that.  I am quite satisfied that it is the superintendent who makes the decision and not the sergeant so there is not a right of appeal there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an appeal.  I am quite certain of that because I was involved in a case.  In this instance the reason a licence had been refused on a couple of occasions was that information that was held about this individual was not entirely accurate.  The superintendent made it his business to check it out and discovered that this was so, that somebody put something inaccurate on a file which was held against that person's character.</P>
      <P>The reality is that if people know there is a right of appeal they will be more careful about making absolutely certain that the information is correct.  Once that protection is there it causes people to be far more careful.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House because there are a number of amendments, but we are dealing with a very serious issue and we could talk about it all day.  I want to make an offer to the Minister.  One cannot say that the Chief Justice is somebody who cannot be trusted with security of information about an individual, that he might leak it.  The Chief Justice could be nominated in the Bill as the person to whom appeals could be made.  It could be the President of the High Court but let the Minister put in somebody so that it will be seen that there is a right of appeal to somewhere and that it is not just politicians getting together and saying that in their opinion it is a security matter and that information should not be disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how the system works.  If the Minister puts in the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court I will be happy.  It could be provided that a very senior member of the Judiciary would hear the case in chambers with no representations allowed; he could ask for information, look at that information and decide that the Minister is perfectly right, that that is a security matter and that the information should not be disclosed to <Col N="2293" /> anybody.  If the Minister does this I will not press the amendments that are down in the name of Deputy Shatter.  If the Minister can say to me that before we finish this Bill this evening he will put down an amendment which will be very tight but will allow one other individual to ever know what information is being held about an individual, I will be happy.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot agree to that all I can say is that the members of the security forces change; if a person in the Special Branch retires he will be replaced by somebody else and somebody else will know the information.  More and more people know about individuals every day of the week.  The same people do not remain in one place for ever.  Ministers change, civil servants change, and police officers change so a whole lot of people will know.  If I retire from politics or from the Garda Síochána or from the Civil Service, I do not go out and blabber around the place what I know about Deputy Colley or Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla.  There are certain standards because one is a particular type of individual.</P>
    <P>All I am asking the Minister to do is to put in the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice and I will be happy.  I am just asking that somebody be put in so that this thing will be resolved, because we are talking about opinions, the opinion of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence, and opinions can differ.  I want to keep people on their toes so that if they put something down on a file they are going to be damn sure that it is accurate.  I do not see why an individual should be deprived of his rights in the area of employment or access to other countries or whatever.</P>
    <P>My final point to the Minister is this, to forget about what they did in other European countries.  We are talking about Ireland.  Let us forget about England, Germany or France.  If they want to conduct their business one way, let them do it.  I am talking about Ireland. We were elected here to represent the people of Ireland and I want to see in this legislation some court of appeal, an individual such as the Chief Justice, the <Col N="2294" /> President of the High Court or the President of the Circuit Court, whoever the Minister wants to choose, that he thinks will be able to maintain information of a high security nature.  If the Minister does that I will scrap these amendments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to push this thing as if our view is the only view.  I accept, as the Minister says, that one has to be extremely careful when one is dealing with security matters.  If I were in his shoes I would be very nervous about letting anybody else have an ear into security matters, but let the Minister not tell me that the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court cannot be trusted about what is on a file about Seán Barrett. There are individuals who are highly responsible that we trust every day of the week to do certain things and, for the few exceptional cases that we are talking about, it would be worth while having this in.  More important still, it would keep people on their toes so that when they are gathering information and storing it in a computer it will be accurate if it involves serious issues relating to a person's character.  That is what I am concerned about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Barrett is doing his best to meet the situation as he sees it.  I appreciate that he has nothing but proper motives in doing so, but there is a very great difficulty here which prevents me from accepting the proposal as the Deputy has now framed it, that is, that the mere disclosure that there are any data on a person, on a subversive in particular, on computer can, in itself, have very serious consequences which could result in the loss of life.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not differ from Deputy Barrett in his view that the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court would be suitable persons to be named here.  There is no question in anybody's mind about their credibility so far as the security of the State is concerned, but if the mechanism suggested is provided, I am as definite as I can be about anything that the mere disclosure of that information being on a computer could in itself be <Col N="2295" /> sufficient to cause loss of life to somebody who is probably helping the security forces.</P>

      <P>One of the most important things in dealing successfully in the security field is to confine information to the smallest possible pool.  If there is any disclosure in any shape or form it will result in one or possibly two things.  First, the source of that information may dry up and, secondly, somebody's life could be lost as a result of the admission that that information exists.  It is an area where those involved have to be extremely careful and cautious.  There is no problem if the information we are talking about is non-security information. The Garda Síochána must disclose that information unless the disclosure would prejudice the prevention of crime or the arrest of offenders.  That is not left to the opinion of the Garda Síochána.  On receiving a complaint the Garda Commissioner can examine the data to decide whether the Garda Síochána are justified in not disclosing that information.  If the decision of the Garda Commissioner goes against the individual the individual can go to the Circuit Court to have it reviewed.  Moreover, in due course a code of practice for the Garda Síochána will be put in place which will fill in the details on this matter, which we hope <Col N="2296" /> will be given the force of law by a later amendment.</P>
      <P>While I would like to oblige Members of the House and be helpful to them, I am not in a position having regard to what is involved to go beyond what is contained in the Bill no matter how much I would like to do so.  I appreciate what the Deputy seeks to achieve.  The Deputy is trying to prevent non-security information being dressed up, if I may borrow Deputy Colley's phrase, as security information and being used as an excuse for denying a person his rights under this Bill.  I have made it as clear as I possibly can, that no Minister, in having properly formed an opinion, would dare do that. He would not be able to stand here very long if he did for the reasons I have already spelled out.</P>
      <P>In trying to provide for the position which both Deputy Barrett and Deputy Colley are genuinely concerned about, I am more than satisfied that persons involved in subversive activities against the State would and could look for information and would eventually bring the matter to the Supreme Court.  If we were having a general discussion on security I think the House would agree that one of the difficulties which we have faced in dealing effectively with those engaged in subversive activities during the years is the way in which those engaged in these activities have been able to use the legislation to their best advantage.  I do not accept that a member of the Provisional IRA or any fellow-traveller organisation engaged in subversive activity would not take it upon themselves to appeal to a court.  I have no doubt about that and, as I have said, we in this country find ourselves in a more difficult position with regard to the security of our State than any of our European partners.  We face far greater problems in trying to ensure that democracy survives.  If we accept these amendments we will go over the top as it were, way beyond what any of our European partners have done in their legislation, in an effort to protect the interests of the State.  I appreciate that that is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said I do not doubt the <Col N="2297" /> bona fides of Deputy Barrett or anybody else but I have no doubt that if we were to accept these amendments they would grant the right to a review of all data certified by the Minister to be security data.  Bearing in mind the dilemma which we find ourselves in and the very delicate balance we have to strive for, on the one hand there is the possibility of an injustice while on the other there is the possibility of a loss of life.  I believe we have struck the right balance, which is the only balance to strike in this instance. I ask the House to consider it in that light and not to press me further on these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to co-operate if I thought the case being made by the Minister was a justifiable one but quite honestly I think the case he is making does not stand up.  Section 8 which deals with the disclosure of personal data in certain cases states:</P>
      <P>Any restriction in this Act on the disclosure of personal data do not apply if the disclosure is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent or an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who holds an army rank not below that of colonel and is designated by the Minister for Defence under this paragraph, required for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State,</P>
      <P>Section 26 which relates to evidence in proceedings states:</P>
      <P>(1) In any proceedings&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a certificate signed by the Minister or the Minister for Defence and stating that in his opinion personal data are, or at any time were, kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State shall be evidence of that opinion,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on to state that a certificate signed by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent or an officer of the Permanent Defence <Col N="2298" /> Force who holds an Army rank not below that of colonel shall be evidence of that opinion.  It is a chief superintendent or a colonel in the Army who would actually sign the certificate saying that in the Minister's opinion this is confidential information.</P>
    <P>It is not accurate to say that if it became known that the State had information in regard to any person, particularly in dealing with subversives, it would endanger life or limb because all that anyone would have to do is make an application and get a certificate signed by a chief superintendent or a colonel in the Army to say that they are not getting the information because in the Minister's opinion the information which they have about them is confidential and there would be a security risk involved if they were to disclose it.  One cannot make an argument that if people got to know that the State had information about them it would endanger other people's lives because it is very simple to get information. All that one needs to do is to apply and obtain a certificate signed by a chief superintendent or a colonel in the Army.  Therefore, that argument goes out of the window.</P>
    <P>We are now down to the issue at stake, whether the opinion formed by the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence is the correct one.  That opinion will be formed on the basis of the information supplied to those individuals from records established by other people.  I am saying that because in certain exceptional cases the withholding of information about an individual could have serious consequences for that individual's future and that of his or her family, or his or her security for that matter, it is reasonable to test whether that opinion is accurate by allowing that person the right of appeal to, say, the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court.  That is not going to affect security one little bit.  The only other person who will have seen the information will be the President of the High Court.  There is no point in the Minister saying &ldquo;I would love to accept this amendment but by doing this <Col N="2299" /> we would let people know we have information about them&rdquo;.  They can find that out quite simply at present and the procedure is there for them to find it out. However, all they will find out is that it is only a certificate which has been signed by a chief superintendent or colonel who will tell them they cannot have it because, in the Minister's opinion, the information they have would affect the security of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to give out information about high security matters to anybody or to force him into the position where he would have to do that.  I do not want to force him into the position where he would have to widen the net of those who know about this confidential information which is of a high security nature.  I do not want him to do that; I just want him to build into the Bill a mechanism whereby the public, if they believe an opinion that has been formed on information supplied to the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence is wrong, can go to somebody else who holds a very high position in the State and is appointed by the Government. The Minister can choose whether it is a Supreme Court Judge, a Circuit Court judge, the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>I will withdraw these amendments if the Minister comes forward with an amendment in the next couple of hours which settles either on the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court.  I, and I am sure everybody in this House, would be perfectly happy with that.  It would be good for democracy and for the workings of the Government, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána to know that when they put down information on a file about somebody which has serious consequences for that person they are not immune from that information being disclosed if it is inaccurate. Serious consequences can exist for individuals when such information is held about them.  Nobody can tell me that that has not happened in the past.  It <Col N="2300" /> has happened and we all know it has happened.</P>
    <P>We have condemned other jurisdictions who have not disclosed information and used the excuse of its security nature for not disclosing it.  We recently criticised our neighbouring jurisdiction because a law officer used that excuse for not disclosing information.  We in this country were very quick to criticise him. What I am saying is that if in one instance an opinion is formed and someone wants to challenge it &mdash; and I suggest it would be very seldom challenged &mdash; at least one would have a right to go to the President of the High Court and say &ldquo;I want you to have a look at this&rdquo;.  The President of the High Court will look at it and he will not disclose the information to the individual or to anybody else.  He is the only one who will see it and if he decides at the end of the day that the Minister is right and the information should not be disclosed because it is of a high security nature that will be the end of it and the only person who will have seen the information is that judge.</P>
    <P>That is not going to endanger the security of the State because if a member of the Special Branch leaves and is replaced by somebody else that person will find out the information.  If a civil servant from the Department of Justice leaves, goes on holiday, gets sick or retires and is replaced by somebody else or if the Minister is booted out of office or decides to give up politics and is replaced by somebody else that person will find out about the information.  All I am asking is that one other person who has been appointed by the Government and who has a very high office should be able to say &ldquo;I confirm the Minister's opinion and he was right in not giving that information because of its security content&rdquo;.  I believe that is good for democracy and this is all I am arguing.  I will withdraw these amendments if the Minister comes forward with another amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in replying previously to my contribution mentioned that the great difficulty he has in accepting an amendment such as this is that by <Col N="2301" /> simply disclosing that there are data on file on an individual he could endanger somebody's life.  I understand why he says that but I want to raise a query, in the most constructive fashion, because it seems that as framed at present the Bill demands that that will be very obvious. If somebody applies for the disclosure of information or data which is on file in a computer in a Government Department he will be refused on the basis that the Act does not apply to that disclosure because, in the opinion of the Minister or the Minister for Defence, it is a security matter.  In other words, it must be disclosed that the Minister or the Department are relying on that provision in order not to disclose the information.  In itself, that means that a disclosure is being made that there is information on file.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister regards that as a big problem in taking on board an amendment along the lines set out by Deputy Barrett, to be decided on by the Minister and his officials between now and 7 p.m., which I have to say is looming ahead of us.  If the Minister looks at the Bill he will find there is already a provision in it whereby there will be disclosure to an individual that there is information on file.  Even by implication it is present in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 sets it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there might be a slightly different connotation with regard to section 8.  I do not think the Minister will have great difficulty in introducing an amendment which safeguards the rights of an individual who has been wronged.  If, as Deputy Barrett said, the matter is referred to a Chief Justice, the President of the High Court or some other individual the fact that the information is on file will be disclosed simply to the extent that it is on file.  It will be disclosed to that extent anyway under the Bill as it is at present drafted.  I appeal to the Minister to have regard to that fact in deciding on an amendment of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy <Col N="2302" /> Barrett's reliance on section 8 for the argument he subsequently built up as he developed his contribution, there may be a slight misunderstanding in the interpretation of section 8 in that there is a difference between the section we are dealing with and the data in section 8.</P>
      <P>The data referred to in section 8 are not security data.  They are data kept by, say, an employer with regard to attendance, time-keeping and so on and by the Garda when investigating subversive or non-subversive crime.  In those circumstances an employer may be prevented, by the provisions of the Bill, from disclosing that information unless he was registered and had listed the Garda as people to whom such data should be disclosed. That is most unlikely.  Therefore, to protect a data controller, the provisions of section 8 allow disclosure to the Garda in these cases.  They are data that are not deemed to be of a security nature and would be made available only for the purposes of facilitating the full and proper investigation of crime whether that be ordinary or subversive crime. That is fair enough; I accept that.</P>
      <P>To deal with the point raised by Deputy Seán Barrett, I believe that a simple right of appeal to the President of the High Court would not necessarily suffice because its outcome could determine whether there was some information available; in itself, that could be lethal in some cases.  It would necessitate a most elaborate provision for which there is no precedent in any other legislation.</P>
      <P>I fully understand that the Deputies opposite are trying to prevent non-security data being certified as security data.  I would ask them to bear in mind&mdash;and I mean this &mdash; that, accepting the amendment as tabled, would give the right to review of all data certified by the Minister to be security data; it would give that right and those engaged in activities against the State would have that right. That would mean that the balance I am endeavouring to achieve in the way this legislation is framed would be weighted totally on one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Colley as to whether a person <Col N="2303" /> makes inquiry in order to ascertain whether information about them was held on computer, I should say that no answer would be given to such an inquirer other than to say that there were no personal data held that the data controller is obliged to give the subject under the provisions of the Bill.  That might not be the actual formula used but it would be a variant thereof.  However, it would be open to an aggrieved inquirer to complain to the Garda Commissioner who would have full power to investigate whether the Garda were justified in refusing such information.  There is not any problem with regard to non-security information &mdash;none there &mdash; but, when it comes to security information, we must keep that as tight and as close as we possibly can. Bearing in mind that ours is a country bedevilled by security problems the House should realise that I am now being asked to go far beyond what our European colleagues did in their legislation in fulfilling their obligations under the convention.  I am being asked to go way beyond the provisions enshrined in their legislation.  Were I to accede to such requests it would have very serious and dangerous consequences for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to drag out this debate.  We have exhausted almost every angle and aspect that can be exhausted.  Perhaps we will have to agree to differ on it.  Would the Minister agree that the reply he has just indicated an individual would receive, or something along those lines &mdash; if a person sought data that were not going to be divulged because of a security risk &mdash; implies that there are data available covered by security considerations?  Would he agree that that would be the implication or interpretation taken by anybody applying for disclosure of information under the provisions of this Bill?  Therefore there is no difference between those circumstances and those obtaining in which somebody would apply for such information, have their application refused and seek appeal to the President of the High Court or somebody else.  There is no substantive <Col N="2304" /> difference between the two sets of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the argument Deputy Colley has advanced.  I do not accept that that type of reply would in any way inform a subject or applicant that there is information about them on computer because it would not.  That is the type of answer that would be given to all inquirers, so that they could not read anything into it.  That type of formula had been used in other instances in the past in dealing with security matters even in this House.  There has never been an admission that such and such was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that but, post the enactment of this Bill, we will be talking in a very different context because there will then be a basic right to information. If that information is not divulged implications will be drawn therefrom.  There are a small number of reasons only for refusing to divulge information, one being the security of the State; two, that already data are required by law to be made available and, three, personal data of a domestic or recreational nature.  If such data are to be refused because they are not by law required to be divulged somebody will take the absolute implication that that refusal is because of a security problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>But I cannot limit it because, if we acceded to the provisions outlined in the amendments, that would give everybody the right to question all information whether it be high security information or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley put her finger on the difference.  After the enactment of this Bill people will be able to write in and request personal data that may be held about them.  If that involves information of a security nature, obviously it will not be disclosed, rightly so, particularly if it affects the security of the State.  I would not expect any Minister or Government Department to do so.  All I want is that there be a safeguard provided so that, when somebody applies for information, they will not be told that it cannot be disclosed for security purposes when that might not be the real reason.  The subject may think it has nothing to do with the security of the State but will have nobody to whom he or she can appeal.  I am not contending that the State should disclose any information of a highly confidential or security nature.  I would not expect that to be done for one moment; I would be totally opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is not accepting what I am saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are endeavouring to do is initiate a safeguard in case somebody abuses the provisions of section 1 (4) (a); that is all.  It does not involve the divulgence of any information whatsoever.  All we propose is to check on the opinion, if you like.  If the Minister tells me he is not disclosing the information sought because of its security content, that it would affect the security of the State and I know there is nothing there that could suggest that, and wonder what to do about it, since there is obviously incorrect data about me, there is <Col N="2306" /> no way that I can get them to change that misinformation.  The Minister is using this safeguard.  Is there no right of appeal to some high judicial individual who can confirm the Minister's opinion and agree that I should not get the information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of points made by Deputy Colley and Deputy Barrett, it seems that the State would not be so naively ingenuous as to say, in response, that they are not disclosing the information to that person and smile coyly and the person would then think that he or she is a security risk.  What the State, I presume, would do would be to devise a formula to the effect that there is no personal data applicable to that individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that the State will have a formula, but that is beside the point.  I do not want to intervene at any length on this.  I hope we might reach section 7.  I sympathise with the spirit of this amendment seeking some other view beside that of the Executive on a matter such as this.  On the other hand, it raises the consideration, are we entitled to take what is an executive matter and run to the courts for a decision?  We have a division of power.  There are certain areas prescribed to the Executive, certain to the Judiciary and certain to the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But no intermingling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that matters of security are peculiarly for the Executive. The Executive, <i>per se</i>, does not consist just of the political head of a Department. It consists of the political head and the permanent administration that serve him.  I would remind the House that we can rely on the integrity of the permanent administration and the integrity of the Minister of the day, between them, to <Col N="2307" /> ensure that no injustice will be done to a citizen.</P>
      <P>Again, there will be a practical difficulty in going to a third party, even a court.  One would have to be attracted by the thought of going to a court and the practical difficulty would be that if you go to a court you automatically open the door to advocates' submissions and displeasures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is totally avoidable.  It must come through somebody to reach the judge's desk, unless one is going to have a system of secret messages going from the Minister to the judge.  In that event, the thing is pointless because the Minister would say what he wants to the judge.  There would have to be some third party or some way of presenting the matter to the judge that inevitably involves disclosure to other persons.  The intention is understandable and one would have to have sympathy with it, but speaking from experience I would have some reservations about its practicality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the House recognises the background of the introduction of this legislation and the reason for it. We have very carefully studied the legislation already enacted by other states, states with which we have much in common in the European sense.  If we had, as put forward by Deputies Barrett and Colley now, a formula different from what is suggested, we would stick out like a sore thumb.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is domestic law in Germany or France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but in this area, having regard to how it is applied, particularly with regard to financial services, it is law that we are enshrining where it has very important international connotations as well.  It is suggested that <Col N="2308" /> we do something which in my view would be totally unnecessary.  I know it is not the intention and accept completely that it is not, but it can only benefit those whose aims and desires it would be to damage the security of the State.  I know that it is not the intention of the Deputies who would be as hardline on this as I would be, as we all would want to be.  In a country like ours, where we have very serious security problems, we would be making it more difficult for us to deal with those engaged in subversive activities. Nobody could shift me on that; it is a fact.  If the Minister of the day who, as Deputy Cooney very correctly pointed out, is just a political head of his Department, made an incorrect decision with regard to the formation of his opinion that a certificate should not or should be signed by him, I could readily see that Minister of the day being of the day and no more than that.  I said that and I mean it.</P>

One of the difficulties, as Deputy Cooney will tell the House, <Col N="2309" /> having been Minister for Justice, is that trying to make a factual decision on information at times is like standing on shifting sands, because as the investigation develops the scene changes.</P>

      <P>You do as often as you can and even then it is an exceptionally difficult situation.  To make a decision, you like to have all the facts.  There are times when you should not take shortcuts in any shape or form because if you do the consequences are normally very great. There are times when professional advice is a mentor along the way and there are times when it will be proved to be incorrect, perhaps after a length of time.  On the day, one must rely on the professional expertise and advice of those who cover this area.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooney with regard to responsibility of the Judiciary, of Government Ministers and of this House.  If the Minister of the day is given the responsibility of answering to this House on a particular issue that is his concern, as a member of Government. That is why the people gave him that position along the line.</P>

That is not any secret.  With regard to the protection of the source, if a belief emerges that the source may be disclosed, directly or indirectly, or that <Col N="2310" /> information is in existence, the source may feel that his time has come to sever all connections, if he is lucky, and to backtrack as quickly as he can.

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19.</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4), lines 46 and 47, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) personal data consisting of information that the person keeping the data is required by law to make available to the public, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (4), the subject of this amendment, excludes from the scope of the Bill any personal data that are required by law to be made available to the public &mdash; electoral lists, the register of companies and so on. There is no need for protection of privacy in those cases.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes two changes in the paragraph.  This first is a technical one.  It recognises that what is normally required by law to be made available to the public is information in readable form &mdash; not the information in its computerised form, as the present text of the paragraph provides.  So the amendment makes the exclusion apply to personal data consisting of information required by law to be made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second change restricts the exclusion to the information when it is shown in the electoral list, companies register or other such public document. If that information is computerised by another person, then, in his or her hands, <Col N="2312" /> it will now be covered by the Bill in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20.</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 50, after &ldquo;individual&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or club or association&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with page 6, subsection (4) (c).  It is the third category of information to which the Bill does not apply, personal data which is kept by an individual for domestic, household or recreational purposes.  It has been brought to my attention that, as the Bill stands, it is possible that sporting clubs and other organisations of a purely recreational or non-business nature would be caught by the Bill and could be required to conform to many regulations and so on in relation to the kind of information they hold and which should not be included.</P>
      <P>The last part of this paragraph should read &ldquo;that personal data kept by an individual or club or association only for recreational purposes&rdquo; should be included. That is restrictive enough because the intent of the paragraph is to restrict the meaning to those organisations or data that have nothing to do with business or commerce but are purely for individual or recreational needs.  My amendment is in keeping with that and expresses something I read into the paragraph as being intended but not clearly said.  I ask the Minister to consider it in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given a lot of consideration to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Personal data kept by an individual for recreational purposes is intended to cover the keeping for one's own use of computerised information on, for example, football results or other sporting statistics. Perhaps a better phrase might be &ldquo;amusement purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of personal data kept by a club or association would not be for such purposes but rather for the business of running the club &mdash; membership subscriptions, customer accounts and so on <Col N="2313" />&mdash; which would not be very different from any other business.</P>
    <P>A club or association would have a lot of personal data on members and I would see no justification for exempting them from the obligations imposed on every other body that keeps such data.  Of course, a club would not have to register unless it comes within the categories who are required to do so by section 16.  Moreover, to exclude such personal data from the Bill would require a derogation from the convention.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am not disposed to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the data, or, as the case may be, the information constituting the data shall have been obtained lawfully and with due observance of the constitutional rights of the data subject,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment I have been advised that the obligation already imposed by the subsection to obtain fairly data or information constituting data would amply comprehend also obtaining it lawfully and with due regard to the data subject's constitutional rights.  The amendment is unnecessary.  What the Deputy is thinking about is already catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the wording in section 2(1) (a) covers my amendment?  What I am asking is that the data or as the case may be the information constituting the data shall have been obtained lawfully and with due observance of the constitutional rights of the data subject.  It should be clear that <Col N="2314" /> there is an obligation to only obtain data on people by lawful means.  One could put a tap on somebody's phone to get information but that would be an unlawful way of getting information.  There should be an obligation to obtain information legally.  The present wording does not make that quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says &ldquo;fairly&rdquo;.  Fairly and lawfully are two different things.  I might regard it as fair to tap the Minister's phone but it is not lawful to do so.  It should be made quite clear that information should have been obtained lawfully and with due observance of the constitutional rights of the data subject.  I cannot see how that will cause difficulties.  The Minister has used the word &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; but has said nothing about &ldquo;lawfully.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having consulted the explanatory memorandum the meaning of this section is expressed as being that the use or disclosure of the data in any manner incompatible with the specified and lawful purposes for which they are kept is prohibited.  It does not refer to the gathering of the data.  It refers specifically to the use or disclosure of those data as having to occur in a fair or lawful manner.  There is some element of doubt about the meaning of that section.  It would be useful to have this expressed quite clearly as being lawful in the obtaining and not just in the processing and the disclosure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation imposed by the subsection to obtain fairly data or information constituting data.  I am told that &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; comprehends also obtaining it lawfully with due regard to the data subject's constitutional rights. There would be a particular difficulty in specifically requiring a person to behave lawfully.  There is a presumption that people behave lawfully because if they do not they incur sanctions under the general law governing false pretences, fraud and so on.  A requirement to obtain <Col N="2315" /> the process data fairly and lawfully is contained in article 5 of the convention, but when the Bill was being drafted the parliamentary draftsman considered that a specific reference to &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; was unnecessary.  The point was put to the parliamentary draftsman and he advised that a specific reference to &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; was unnecessary and inappropriate.  This matter was raised because it came to attention in studying article 5 of the convention. My reason for having this as it is, is the advice of the parliamentary draftsman whom I regard as the professional in this area.</P>

      <P>The Minister's comments worry me.  The word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; should remain in the section.  The word &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; does not really mean anything. Everybody's opinion of what is fair is different.  &ldquo;Lawfully&rdquo; is a specific defined term.  I support that amendment. The Minister's remarks are worrying to say the least.  I cannot follow the logic of the point that it should be omitted as a purely technical matter.  If it is in the convention it should be retained in the Bill.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help the Minister if I drew his attention to the fact that section 2 (1) (c) (i) indicates that the data shall be kept only for one or more specified and lawful purposes.  In that case the parliamentary draftsman decided that the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; was necessary.  The parliamentary draftsman could have said &ldquo;shall be kept only for one or more specified purposes&rdquo; and assumed that everybody would behave lawfully.  It is relevant to have it here as it is to have it there.  As Deputy Mac <Col N="2316" /> Giolla has said, &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; is a very subjective term and &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; is a very objective term which can be defined.  In legislative terms it is a better term.</P>

I am advised that &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; comprehends everything and that the specific attention of the parliamentary draftsman was drawn to Article 5 of the convention.  I cannot claim, much as I might be tempted to, that I am better at providing phraseology in legislation of a technical nature than the parliamentary draftsman so I have to be guided by him and I am told that the amendment is unnecessary and inappropriate.</P>

How in God's name can you expect an ordinary person in the street to be fully informed of the law when they go about reading an Act or a Bill couched in language that is not used by anybody else or when there are excuses for not putting in things for various reasons?

      <P>It is stated in section 2 (1) (a) that: &ldquo;the data or, as the case may be, the information constituting the data shall have been obtained, and the data shall be processed, fairly,&rdquo;.  If you put that to any ordinary individual &mdash; and that is who we represent &mdash; who will decide what is fair and what is not fair?  If you want to say that, you must also say that the data <Col N="2318" /> should be obtained lawfully and processed lawfully.  In other words, it should be made quite clear that you cannot get data about an individual by unlawful means, for example, you cannot put a tap on my phone and get information, put it into the computer and store it.  Whatever information is got about me must be obtained lawfully, not &ldquo;fairly&rdquo;.  I could argue that it was only fair that I was able to tap into your phone, that I got the information and that all is fair in love and war and so on.  It does not necessarily say that it was lawful for me to obtain it.  Why not make it clear in the legislation that information obtained must be obtained by lawful means?

One can only give the benefit of the advice one gets from the professionals whose job it is to give advice and I am advised in this instance that to accept what is suggested might very well cause problems.  For instance, regarding Deputy Mac Giolla's question which I accept was asked in good faith, that is, why not have it in in accordance with the law, &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo; the continental sense &mdash; Deputy Colley knows what I am going to say&mdash; means in accordance with a statute or regulation.  We might be getting ourselves into an area which we might not want to get into but I will convey to the parliamentary draftsman the views of Members on this particular issue, because it is a drafting problem, and let him know the concern we have here for the work which he has to do and to let him know, too, that we are doing our job as carefully as we can.  If, having studied the Deputies' arguments, he feels that an amendment should be considered, then there would be an obligation on me to consider an amendment for the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In page 7, lines 31 and 32, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2320" />&ldquo;(4) All provisions of this section apply to back-up data.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states that paragraph (b) of the said subsection (1) does not apply to back-up data.  Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) states that the data shall be accurate, and, where necessary, kept up to date.  Later it states that this does not apply to back-up data.  I cannot see the necessity for that.  If you are keeping your data accurate and up to date and not altering the back-up data when, as Deputy Barrett said on a previous occasion, somebody resigns, a new person coming on the job finds that the back-up data do not tally with the accurate data on the computer.  Then he may well change the data that have already been altered and accurate because he would imagine that the data and the back-up data should be the same.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that where you have accuracy and up-to-date information, if some of the back-up data are inaccurate or not up to date at least they should be scrapped, deleted, taken out or brought up to date and made accurate. It is highly dangerous to have back-up data different from the data you have on the computer and are giving out for the person.  The person goes in with all this Bill behind him to get the information relating to him on the computer, he gets some of the data but does not get what is in the back-up data.  Will the Minister explain why it is essential not to have any accuracy or up-to-date information in the back-up data?  At least delete the stuff that is out of date or inaccurate in the back-up data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>Subsection (4) makes an exception in the case of back-up data to the requirement that personal data be kept up to date.  Any person who uses an automated information system generally makes back-up copies of all computerised files so that if there is damage to the operational file a replacement copy is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Back-up copies by nature are not as accurate and up to date as the original <Col N="2321" /> file and for this reason could not be expected to comply with the requirements in this regard.  This applies to the amendments other than No. 22; it applies to amendments Nos. 23 and 49.  For instance, I understand in banks that back-up data are changed every afternoon practically.  By definition back-up data are almost always out of date because new transactions are going on.  That is the main reason why this is being treated as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that because data from a bank of something which took place five years ago are still up to date.  That is what happened on that date.  That is all accurate information on what happened yesterday or a year ago.  I do not take that to be what the Minister is calling back-up data here. There is no mention of back-up copies. This refers to back-up data.  I do not think his reference to the banks is an example of something that is not accurate or not up to date.  It is supposed to be an accurate account.  I know many times banks make errors regularly and continuously and so do we all, but it is supposed to be accurate and up to date.  All that is specified in section 2 (1) (b) is that &ldquo;the data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date&rdquo;.  I agree with that, but then it provides that this does not apply to back-up data.  I cannot think of exactly what that means but it is not back-up copies anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a thing is inaccurate and new information comes in and shows that what you have is inaccurate, you make it accurate and bring it up to date.  Bits and pieces of things all added together are what you have finally and your back-up data is still inaccurate and out of date and you do not have to correct it.  That is dangerous.  People often check up on what is on their computer through the back-up data.  They find differences and do not know why.  They may change what is correct into what is incorrect.  Why is it necessary to exclude them from scrapping or changing the back-up data?  This is computerised and it is not as difficult as if one had to go through numbers of <Col N="2322" /> files and change the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; here and there or something like that.  We are talking about a computerised system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>By definition again, back-up data are almost always out of date because new transactions are taking place and in some businesses the back-up data is there for a reason.  In the case of a fire or something like that, they would be there to help them to build a new base. Probably they are stored in another building. They are not kept as up to date as Deputy Mac Giolla thinks because new transactions are going on regularly.  In the case of back-up data section 2 (4) makes an exception to the requirement that personal data be kept up to date. Any person using an automatic information system makes back-up copies of all computerised files.  If the operational file is ever lost or damaged in any way a replacement copy is available.  Back-up copies by nature are not as accurate and up to date as the original files and for this reason could not be expected to comply with the requirements in this regard.  I think that is reasonable.</P>

      <P>We have not been given sufficient examples and I cannot think of sufficient examples.  If you are talking about personal data instead of bank transactions and so on, and mostly we are talking about personal data here, you are talking about keeping personal data up to date.  The guy had another child or is now separated and living with somebody else, one of his family died, he is older; all that sort of information is being put in some place on his file.

      <P>I understand Deputy Mac Giolla's comments and in an effort to help clear up any misunderstanding let me say to him that back-up data are kept only for the purpose of replacing other data in the event of their being lost, destroyed or damaged.  Many data controllers seek to protect their investment in data by keeping duplicate files in case the equipment or the programmes which processed the data fail.  These recovery or back-up data are updated at regular intervals depending upon the activity concerned, its importance and the frequency of transactions.  The copies may become out of date as alterations are made in the current data.</P>
      <P>It must be emphasised that this exemption covers only duplicate records which are held solely for keeping the data safe and the information held on the original files must be made available to the data subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a)  The Minister may, for the purpose of providing additional safeguards in relation to personal data as to racial origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, physical or mental health, sexual life or criminal convictions, by regulations amend subsection (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>(b)  Regulations under this section may make different provision in relation to data of different descriptions.</P>
      <P>(c)  References in this Act to subsection (1) of this section or to a provision of that subsection shall be construed in accordance with any amendment under this section.</P>
      <P>(d)  Regulations under this section shall be made only after consultation with any other Minister of the Government who, having regard to his functions, ought, in the opinion of the Minister, to be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the <Col N="2325" /> draft shall have been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment empowers the Minister for Justice, after consultation with any other Minister concerned, to make regulations providing additional safeguards in relation to personal data about racial origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, health or sexual life, or criminal convictions.</P>
    <P>These categories of particularly sensitive data are specified in article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention which provides that data of this kind must not be processed automatically unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards.  The convention does not necessarily require different provision to be made in regard to those data as compared with safeguards applicable to other personal data, and we believe that the general provisions of the Bill provide appropriate and adequate safeguards in respect of same. That is why we did not consider it necessary to introduce a provision on the lines of this amendment in the Bill as introduced.</P>
    <P>However, it might perhaps be more prudent to provide for the possibility that additional safeguards could prove to be necessary in regard to those particular kinds of data.  It might be, for example, that one of the other parties to the convention might impose severe restrictions on processing a particular category of health data and might be reluctant to allow the export to this country of that type of data for processing here unless similar safeguards existed in this country. Article 12 of the convention permits contracting states to restrict transborder data flows in such cases.  Accordingly, it seems desirable to provide the authorities here with a reasonable degree of flexibility in reacting to any situations of that kind that might come about in the future, and that is what the amendment sets out to do.</P>
    <P>As the regulations providing for these additional safeguards will amend the protection provisions in subsection (1) of section 2, it is being provided that they will not come into operation until a draft <Col N="2326" /> of them has been approved by each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (6), line 2, to delete &ldquo;one month&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;40 days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments, except amendments Nos. 30 and 39, extend the period allowed to data controllers for complying with requests by individuals to have their names removed from marketing or mailing lists, to have access to personal data about them and to have data rectified or erased.  It is proposed to extend that period from one month to 40 days.</P>
      <P>This does not mean that individuals will now have to wait an extra ten days. In many, if not most, cases the information, if readily available, can and will be supplied well within one month. However, it has been represented that in some instances, for technical reasons connected with the nature of the processing cycles in businesses using automatic information systems, it may be difficult to produce the information inside that limit and that controllers could be in breach of the obligation imposed on them by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 30, on the other hand, proposes to reduce the specified period for compliance from one month to 21 days.  This is the period allowed under section 3 to a person who is asked whether he keeps personal data and the purposes for which the data are kept. That is a very simple request and there should be no difficulty in replying to it within 21 days.  Indeed, I expect that when the Bill comes into operation all data controllers will prepare a standard document containing a description of the <Col N="2327" /> types of personal data kept by them and the purposes for which the data are kept. All they need do on receiving a request under section 3 is to send a copy of that document to the individual making the request.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 39, which proposes to change the period mentioned in section 4(6)(b) from &ldquo;2 months&rdquo; to &ldquo;60 days&rdquo;, is a consequential drafting amendment.  All the other time limits are being expressed in days rather than in months.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the principle of this amendment, although I am not convinced of the necessity for it. The amendment requires a data controller who deletes an individual's name from a direct mailing or direct marketing list to tell him of any other purposes for which the data are kept.</P>
      <P>Now, under the Bill as it stands, there is provision for any individual to be told by a data controller, whether registered or not, for what purposes personal data are kept.  That is provided for by section 3.  If the controller is registered, a list of the purposes will also be set out in the registered entry and available for inspection by the public free of charge.</P>
      <P>As I said, I have no objection to the principle of the amendment but I am not convinced of the need for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the data subject concerned <Col N="2328" /> requests the data controller in writing to cease using the data for that purpose,</P>
    <P>the data controller had 40 days instead of a month.  Subparagraph (i), (ii) and (iii) read:</P>
    <P>(i)  if the data are kept only for the purpose aforesaid, erase the data,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the data are kept for that purpose and other purposes, cease using the data for that purpose, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  notify the data subject in writing accordingly.</P>
    <P>If he has other information he should notify the subject.  I cannot see any difficulty in accepting this amendment.  Its inclusion would make things clearer.  If a data controller has information about a subject, he should know about it and the more often we say that the better.  I do not see why the Minister cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2329" /> In page 8, to delete lines 8 to 12 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;An individual who believes that a person keeps personal data shall, if he so requests the person in writing&mdash;</P>

    <P>The amendment I am proposing will increase the effectiveness of section 3, which enables individuals to establish the existence of personal data.  As the Bill stands, those individuals must be told whether any personal data are kept and, if so, the purposes for which the data are kept.  The amendment requires that they be supplied, in addition, with a description of the data.</P>
    <P>Furnishing this additional information should not impose any burden on a data controller whereas it is likely to be very useful to individuals who may be using section 3 to establish the existence of personal data as a preliminary to exercising the subject access rights in section 4, particularly in cases where the data controller is not required to register.</P>

      <P>As it stands a fee is required to be paid in every case by an individual who wishes to exercise his right of access to personal data concerning him.  While it is reasonable to provide for the reimbursement of expenses incurred in complying with requests for access, there will be some cases, I am sure, where data controllers will not charge any fee and the Bill should provide for that possibility.  For example, some data controllers may give free access periodically, say once a year, if only to keep their records up to date.  The amendment makes it clear that controllers are not obliged to charge a fee for access, although they are authorised to make a charge if they so wish.</P>

      <P>A fee shall be payable to the data controller concerned in respect of such a request as aforesaid and the amount thereof shall not exceed such amount as may be prescribed or an amount that in the opinion of the Commissioner is reasonable, having regard to the estimated cost to the data controller of compliance with the request, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment would insert after &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; the words &ldquo;having regard to the individual's capacity to pay, and&rdquo;. I have no idea what the fees might be <Col N="2331" /> now or in the future.  The cost of the acquisition of the information could be placed so high as to put it beyond the capacity of some individuals to avail of the facility of getting the information. That would be an interference with their right to obtain the data.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate who is to prescribe the amount.  What does it mean?  I am asking the Minister to accept that the commissioner should fix an amount which is reasonable, having regard to the capacity of the individual to pay.  Some people would find a couple of pounds an exceptional burden but to other people a fee of £10 or £20 for access to information would mean nothing.  The fee might be £50, which would certainly be beyond the capacity of somebody receiving assistance of £37 per week.  Perhaps the Minister would comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have proposed an amendment to ensure that there is no obligation on the data controller to charge a fee.  Even where a charge is made, it must not exceed a prescribed amount or an amount which the commissioner considers reasonable, having regard to the estimated cost to the data controller, whichever is the less.  I appreciate the motives behind Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment but I believe it would further complicate the provisions and introduce uncertainty, while not necessarly benefiting the data subject who, if he is to pay a fee, must pay it before the request can be processed.</P>
      <P>The maximum amount prescribed as a fee for access should be a reasonable one and should take into account that experience suggests requests for access are relatively infrequent and should not in many cases involve any great difficulty in complying with them.  I am sure that some data controllers will give access free since it will have the advantage of ensuring that their data is kept up to date. Others may give free access once a year and charge for more frequent requests. We will have to wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands strikes the right note.  There will be a <Col N="2332" /> maximum fee which I undertake will be a reasonable one and no data controller can charge even that if it costs him any less to comply with the request for access. The fee is not to exceed the amount to be fixed by regulations made by the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, or the estimated cost to the data controller of complying with the request, if that is less.  In many instances there may not be a fee and the data controller will, I am sure, take account of the circumstances of the person making the request.</P>
    <P>I very much appreciate what Deputy Mac Giolla is trying to accomplish but the difficulties which would arise would be great.  My approach is, perhaps, the proper one but we will have to wait and see how it develops in practice.  The regulations will have to be approved by the House and the matter can be reviewed during discussion on the regulations.</P>

The data controller may claim that very large expenses were incurred.  I want to ensure that the commissioner will not base his decision on what it costs but on the capacity of the individual to pay.  The Bill is giving each individual certain rights and I want to ensure that the rights are not removed by the imposition of an inordinate fee which would prevent a person availing of his right.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 35 is in the name of the Minister. Amendments Nos. 36, 37, 54, 55 and 71 are related.  It is proposed therefore to take amendments Nos. 35, 36, 37, 54, 55 and 71 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (c) (ii), lines 46 to 48, to delete &ldquo;corrects or supplements, or erases all or part of, the data concerned&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;rectifies or supplements, or erases part of, the data concerned (and thereby materially modifies the data) or erases all of the data&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The four official amendments have a common purpose, that is, to avoid data controllers having to take action under the Bill where inaccuracies in personal data come to light but they are quite trivial and inconsequential.  As the Bill stands a data controller could be obliged to refund the fee for access if there was a mispelling in the personal data which he had collected.  Also under sections 6 (2) and 10 (7) he would be obliged to notify such correction to any person to whom the data concerned were disclosed during the proceeding 12 months.  It seems better to tighten up these two provisions so that the data controller will be bound by them only if the correction he makes materially modifies the data in question.  He will of course continue to be obliged to correct the data but not to go further and proceed to refund the fee or to notify the disclosees.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Barrett, in the event of the person seeking information, then being given information that was subsequently corrected, the person who had received incorrect information would be notified that the correction had taken place so he would not be misled.

      <P>It is obligatory on the data controller to notify people that a mistake had been made.  What I am saying is that surely I must have a right to get a copy of what was there prior to correction and then I can decide for myself to tell people who may have seen the incorrect information.  I do not see why we should fear a data controller having to supply the incorrect information. I cannot see why we should not insist on that.  It is the right of an individual.</P>

      <P>It is there in section 6 (2). I certainly have some sympathy with what the Deputy has said.  I am not convinced that the proposed amendments would be justified.  I agree that it is important that data subjects should be given a copy of the information kept about them on the date of the receipt of the request for access and that there should be no tinkering with data after that with a view to concealing a breach of the data protection provisions.  It does have what I consider to be a reasonable exception for any amendments that would have been made irrespective of receipt of the request.  In other words, ordinary business operations, for example, crediting and debiting accounts can continue uninterrupted while the request for access is being processed.  The amendment would seem to me to require data controllers to react instantly to a request for data and to produce a copy of the data immediately in every case.  That would pose no problem <Col N="2335" /> in a small business but it certainly would in a large commercial institution or Government Department and could disrupt operations, especially if there were any difficulties in locating the data on the basis of the information supplied by the data subject.  I appreciate that the object is to prevent any mending of the hand by data controllers after a request for access comes in, but I believe that subsection (5) adequately achieves that without imposing any unnecessary burden on the data controllers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (8), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) Whenever it is proposed to make regulations under paragraph (a) of this subsection a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the regulations shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the regulations in paragraph (a) of subsection (8) which is on page 10.  This amendment proposes that when it is proposed to make such regulations, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment we have been attempting to put in and which has been put in one or two Bills instead of the type of measure which is normally in the <Col N="2337" /> Bill that such a regulation will come into effect unless the Oireachtas, in the mean-time, opposes it.  What we are saying is that it must actually be brought before the House and must be passed into effect by resolution of the House approving of the draft before it becomes part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, which is No. 113, relates to section 31 which is a general overall section relating to the whole Bill.  My amendment is saying that a draft of every regulation should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and they should not come into effect until they have been passed by each House.  I know that the Minister has accepted other amendments of this type to, for instance, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and I would ask him to consider doing it in this instance also because regulations which will be put into effect under this Bill will be extremely important and should be scrutinised by the Oireachtas. It is a new area of legislation.  We are feeling our way along and I believe that we should have scrutiny at every point in the process if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides in section 31 that with one exception every regulation made under it must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If a resolution annulling it is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which the House has sat after the regulations have been laid before it, the regulations shall be annulled.  That is the normal provision for regulations which are of a procedural or technical nature or whose scope is clearly delimited by the Bill and which are required to give full and proper effect to its objects in cases where detailed provision has to be made to cover particular circumstances requiring a measure of flexibility which cannot be achieved under the normal legislative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the regulations to be made under this Bill comply with these norms and I do not see how we would be justified in departing from them.  There is one exception to what I have said and it <Col N="2338" /> relates to the regulations proposed to be made under the amendment made to section 2 regarding the provision of additional safeguards relating to certain sensitive personal data.  I have provided for positive approval of these regulations by each House because power is being given to amend the data protection provisions in that case.  To have all other regulations subjected to positive approval by each House would I suggest be quite unnecessary and, if adopted, would impose undue pressure on parliamentary time.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 44 in the name of Deputy Spring, I should make it clear that there can be no question of regulations made under section 4 (8) having retrospective effect.  In fact, these regulations must be enforced when the right of access provisions of the Bill come into operation.  Otherwise, patients could have an unrestricted right of access to their health data and that, by causing serious harm to them in some cases, would not accord with the provision of the convention which envisages exemptions to protect the rights of data subjects.</P>
    <P>Moreover, these regulations can only modify the right of access where the Minister, after consulting with the other Ministers concerned, considers it desirable to do so in the interests of the data subjects concerned.  He cannot make modifications in that right for any other reasons, such as administrative convenience and the like, and if he does his actions would be subject to judicial review.  For these reasons I consider that the provisions in regard to regulations are reasonable and in accordance with established practice having regard to the type of regulations I have described which are involved in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of subsection (1) (d) are intended to cover malpractices in respect of financial services which fall short of criminal offences.  The function of financial regulation is imposed on several bodies, such as the Central Bank, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Council of the Stock Exchange, the official assignee in bankruptcy and so on.  There are times when subject access to the personal data kept by these bodies would likely be to the detriment of the discharge of those regulatory or investigative functions.</P>
      <P>The exemption from the right of access given by paragraph (d) is limited in two respects.  First, the exemption is granted only in respect of those functions which the Minister for Justice specifies by regulations to be, in his opinion, designed to protect members of the public from financial loss, firstly, caused by dishonesty, incompetence or malpractice on the part of persons concerned in the provision of banking, insurance, investment or other financial services or in the management of companies or similar organisations and, secondly, caused by the conduct of persons who have been at any time adjudicated to be bankrupt.  Also, the exemption is granted only to the extent that access would be likely to prejudice the proper performance of those functions.  I think this is a necessary provision to protect the public against the kind of dishonest practices I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it to the Minister that if the various individuals or bodies he has referred to are performing the statutory functions correctly they <Col N="2341" /> would only need to maintain accurate records with regard to instances of dishonesty, incompetence or malpractice.  If accurate records are maintained, no harm can be done to the general public if someone who believes they are the subject matter of such records or data has access to it.  There is always the possibility that such data may contain a comment or view about someone's competency or dishonesty which is not accurate and that person, as opposed to protecting the general public, could be severely prejudiced in their day-to-day lives and in their business lives because wrong views about them are held by people acting in a supervisory position.</P>
      <P>I suggest that where people acting in supervisory positions retain data of a damning nature about someone, that person should be entitled to have access to that data.  If the data is correct and truthful there is nothing they can do about it but if the data is untruthful then clearly the people who are meant to protect the public are not doing their job properly and are severely prejudicing an individual or a body in their working operations.  I ask the Minister to indicate more specifically what particular prejudice he would see arising and to give me some specific examples as a result of allowing data subjects access to this information.</P>

If the question of damage or harm to the investigative procedures does not arise, and this would be decided upon by the commissioner, the information would be readily made available.  The commissioner's decision is open to challenge, as the Deputy is aware, and he would have to take into account what is involved here.  I think it is fairly reasonable as it stands.</P>

All I would say to the Minister is that I have considerable reservations about the need for this particular exemption. I can see the need for other exemptions. It is one thing in the context of investigative procedures but in the context of a supervisory body retaining information which they believe indicates someone is guilty of incompetence, malpractice or dishonesty, it would seem that there is a case to be made in respect of bodies acting in a supervisory capacity to have hanging over them the threat that if they retain information which is inaccurate, that people may act upon, that that information can be discovered and that the data subjects could get access to it.  That would ensure that these bodies operated efficiently and properly and did not simply retain in their files gossip and rumour about people as opposed to specific substantive information.  Because we do not have much time to tease out these matters I will not push this any further. Perhaps the Minister would have regard to this section when the Bill is going through the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), between lines 51 and 52, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) in respect of which the application of that section would be contrary to the interests of protecting the international relations of the State,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these amendments adds to section 5 a fresh category of personal data to which the right of access given in section 4 will not apply.  Disclosure of the data in question to the data subject <Col N="2343" /> would, in the words of the amendment, &ldquo;be contrary to the interests of protecting the international relations of the State&rdquo;. Article 9a of the Convention sets out the major interests of the State which may require exceptions from the basic principles of data protection.  These are the protection of State security, public safety, the monetary interests of the State and the suppression of criminal offences.</P>
    <P>The Bill has given effect to these exceptions by excluding personal data, involving State security, from the Bill completely and by permitting exemptions from the right of access in any particular case where the prevention of crime or the interests of the Revenue would otherwise be prejudiced.  It seems, however, on further consideration that these exceptions are not sufficiently comprehensive in so far as they would allow a right of access to personal data in circumstances where that could adversely affect the international relations of the State.  The official commentary on the Convention recognises this in paragraph 55, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The notion of &ldquo;State security&rdquo; (in Article 9) should be understood in the traditional sense of protecting national sovereignty against internal or external threats, including the protection of the international relations of the State.</P>
    <P>For that reason we thought it advisable to propose a specific exemption from the right of access for any personal data in any particular case where its disclosure would be contrary to the interests of protecting our international relations.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 63 to section 8 is a corollary of the amendment to section 5.  Section 8 lists those cases where the restrictions in the Bill on data controllers disclosing personal data to third parties will not apply &mdash; where the Garda may need information for security purposes or the prevention of crime but where disclosure is urgently needed to prevent injury to someone and so on.  Because the protection of our international relations is equally as important as State security, it is right and logical that a data <Col N="2344" /> controller should also be free, if he so wishes, to disclose information to the proper authority when this is required to protect the international relations of the State.  That is the effect of amendment No. 63.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), between lines 51 and 52, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) consisting of an estimate of, or kept for the purpose of estimating, the amount of the liability of the data controller concerned on foot of a claim for the payment of a sum of money, whether in respect of damages or compensation, in any case in which the application of the section would be likely to prejudice the interest of the data controller in relation to the claim,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is being moved to meet a concern expressed by the Irish Insurance Federation that section 4 as it stands could prejudice the interests of insurance companies in dealing with claims.  It is a regular practice for insurance companies to put a provisional estimate on a claim being made either by a policyholder or by a third party under, say, a motor policy.  This is done for both financial and management reasons.  It is necessary for the companies to know at any given time the extent of their possible liabilities under existing claims so that they can make reasonable and adequate provisions for them.  The provisional estimate is also used by them as a basis on which to negotiate the settlement of a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously if details of this estimate were to be made available to the person claiming, their bargaining position would be completely eroded.  It has been considered that these estimates were covered by the exclusion in paragraph (e) of section 5 (1) &mdash; the exclusion of personal <Col N="2345" /> data in respect of which a claim of privilege could be maintained in court proceedings in relation to communications between a client and his legal advisers. However, it appears that these estimates are prepared shortly after a claim is received and before any communication takes place with the legal departments. Indeed many claims are settled without any question of legal proceedings arising.</P>
    <P>This kind of problem could also arise for other companies or individuals against whom a claim for damage or compensation might be made and who might seek advice as to what would be a reasonable estimate of their liability.  The amendment has, therefore, been drafted in general terms so as to apply to any estimates of possible liability or to personal data kept for the purpose of making these estimates, irrespective of whether the data controller is an insurance company.</P>
    <P>In all those cases the right of access conferred by section 4 will not apply. However, there is an important qualification to that, similar to the qualification in each of the proceeding paragraphs of section 5 (1), that is, that the right of access will apply unless it would be likely to prejudice the interests of the data controller in relation to the claim.  That qualification may not be as significant in this context as in the earlier paragraphs but it is a limiting factor which could in some situations require access to purely factual reports on which the provisional estimates are based.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment because the section, as it is framed, makes no reference to the construction that is to be put on this duty of care that is owned and it is not clear whether it would encompass economic or financial loss.  I should like the Minister to address that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7, as drafted, will allow a claim, as outlined, to the extent that the law of tort provides for damages in respect of any of these matters.  All the section does is fill any gap there may be in the present law of tort as regards the existence of a duty of care between a data controller or processor and the data subject concerned.  If damages can now be awarded under the particular headings referred to then the data subject will be entitled to them under the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>The important point is that section 7 does not change in any way the existing principles governing the award of damages in tort cases.  Indeed it would be undesirable if the provisions of the Bill were to effect any change in the principles governing the general law of tort that would be applicable only to breaches of a duty of care by data controllers or processors.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I am unable to accept the amendment.  But I have no reason to think that the existing law of tort, as extended by the provisions of section 7, would not deal adequately with any claim for damages that might arise in regard to data protection.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Since it has been around for a long time, we have become very familiar with the title of the Bill at least, but it takes a good deal longer to become familiar with the details.  This amendment in the names of Deputy Seán Barrett and myself is an <Col N="2350" /> attempt to make a provision on the face of the Bill which would conclude proceedings which have gone on since 1962.</P>
      <P>In 1962, the present Taoiseach, when Minister for Justice, decided to set up a committee to look into our bankruptcy legislation, to update it and to consolidate existing legislation.  The main legislation which is being consolidated is contained in the Irish Bankruptcy and Insolvent Act, 1857, the Bankruptcy (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1872, and the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy (Ireland) Act, 1889.  It was time in 1962 to have a look at those old Statutes in an attempt to update and consolidate them. They were supplemented by the Bankruptcy Court Rules which are now incorporated in the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1962, as amended, as well as by a number of statutory provisions relating to bankruptcy which are contained in legislation concerned primarily with other matters.</P>
      <P>The committee which was set up reported in 1972.  The recommendations were not acted upon at that stage because it coincided with our entry into the EEC. This imposed certain obligations on us. There was an obligation that bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings, for example, commencing in one state could be proceeded with and I understand that these issues are still being debated in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect on this Bill was that the report of the committee was left lying there for some time until work began in the Department of Justice to put this Bill together.  The Bill, substantially as it is now before the House, was first published in 1982.  Again, it was left lying there for some time.  Then we took Second Stage on 8 February 1983.  On Second Stage, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, spoke on behalf of the Opposition and agreed we should refer it to a special committee of the House to deal with Committee Stage.  The Committee Stages in the Dáil and Seanad were taken by an unusual provision, which established a precedent; they were dealt with by a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Legislation which was set up in <Col N="2351" /> this House.  It was the first &mdash; if not the only &mdash; time that a subcommittee of the committee dealing with legislation took the Committee Stage of a Bill of this magnitude and dealt with the Dáil and Seanad Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>We are now debating the Report and Final Stages and I presume they will also have to be passed in the Seanad.  The Special Committee commenced their sittings in November 1984, continued to the summer session of 1985 and sat again in the autumn.  It was a very long and intensive Committee Stage and it is appropriate that, as I was Minister at the time, I should thank the people who took part in that committee.  Committee work in the House is thankless enough but Committee Stage dealt with by a special committee is totally thankless because there is no public awareness of the work done.  The people on that committee worked very long and grinding hours. They did an extremely good job and put us in a position where this legislation can finally pass through the Dáil tonight without much controversy or delay.</P>
    <P>The reason I put down this amendment is that section 2 of the Bill provides that this legislation will come into effect on such a date as the Minister sees fit.  When something has gestated, gone through the formation and discussion period for 26 years, it is a good idea to put a final date on the proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Instead of leaving it in the hands of the Minister for Justice &mdash; well disposed as he is to bankruptcy legislation &mdash; we should amend section 2 of the Bill to say that in any event the Minister will bring this into law not later than 1 January 1989.  The amendment should not read &ldquo;1988&rdquo; because, skilful as the Members of the House are, they have not yet succeeded in making the provisions of the Bill retrospective. Maureen Potter suggested on one occasion that the contraceptive Bill should have been retrospective.  I do not <Col N="2352" /> want to pursue that line because I will be ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>I know that bringing this into law by 1989 will present some difficulty to the Minister because he is not only empowered but obliged to publish and bring into being a series of rules which will run parallel with the Bill and without which it cannot work effectively.  The work on the rules is probably reasonably complete in the Dapartment of Justice and if the Minister thinks there is sufficient time between now and 1 January 1989 to complete proceedings in the Seanad to finalise and publish the rules and regulations and to bring them before the House by way of motion, to enable him to finally bring the Bill into law on 1 January 1989, it is a very good idea.  It is normal to leave a Bill open-ended at this stage.  I appreciate that but, because it has gone on so long, it would please everyone if a final date was agreed.  Certainly, the officials who worked intermittently for a great number of years would have a sense of achievement if they knew, leaving the House before the summer recess, that the Bill would become law on 1 January 1989.</P>
      <P>Other considerations arise in dealing with this Bill.  It has gone on for so long that other areas of law have passed it out.  There are matters which, if we were starting afresh, would be incorporated in the Bill.  I am thinking of the changes that have taken place in family law, particularly the legislation in the mid-seventies which dealt with the family home.  In certain circumstances, where the only asset of the bankrupt is the home, obviously the rights of wives are relevant to this legislation.  When I was proposing Committee Stage it was the intention that another Bill, which was being prepared in the Department of Justice, would deal with these matters.  That dealt with the area where spouses jointly owned the family home and the intention was that the updating measures, in so far as the family home was concerned, would be incorporated in that legislation rather than in this Bill.  I have an amendment later on which draws attention to that fact and I should like the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> So much work has gone into this Bill that it would be proper to let it go through because if we try to make it better now we may lose our enthusiasm and in three years' time someone else may be trying to get it through.  I put down this amendment at a very early stage of the Bill because it will give other Members an opportunity to refresh themselves on the issues in section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We sometimes have to remind ourselves that it is 1988.  When I was a student in Kings Inns in 1973 I went down to buy the report on which this Bill is based, to be part of what was then my growing law library.  I remember thinking, looking at the beginning of the report, that it was amazing that in late 1973 or 1974 when it was published, this document had been the product of a committee which had been set up about 12 years previously, in 1962.  I also remember reading the foreword of the report in which the chairman of the committee said that in 1927 the Dáil had a first canter over the course and had set up a committee to revise the bankruptcy law but that nothing had been done on foot of the report.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that 26 years after the Government of the day decided to ask Mr. Justice Budd and the committee which he chaired to investigate bankruptcy law and 16 years after that committee reported, we should still be discussing whether this Bill will become law.  The amazing feature is that it was not a difficult one to deal with as soon as the committee reported, because the committee went to the unusual extent of not merely furnishing heads of Bills at the end of the report, as the Law Reform Commission do now, but it drafted every last line of the Bill they were proposing to consolidate and amend the law in relation to bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They even went so far as to put a facsimile of the harp on top of the section of the report that sets out the Bill's provisions. Worse still, they even set out the rules of court which they thought would be necessary to bring it about.  They went into the matter in such detail that they <Col N="2354" /> set out in the foreword to the report in 1973 that they decided that as the result of their research was so interesting they should publish it in a full form.  It became a student text book and is still a practitioners text book because it surveys so comprehensively the law which exists with a view to deciding what was wrong with it that it is valuable as a text in itself. It is amazing that this House, so long afterwards, is putting its final signature to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to bankruptcy law in general, it is worth reminding ourselves that in legislation it is necessary to provide for adequate remedies for the recovery of debts.  One of the things that is a huge scandal about Irish law is the fact that there is no means of recovering small debts and bankruptcy which was always regarded as a last resort is increasingly becoming a first resort because it embarrasses the person against whom the process is initiated.  It is effectively a sledgehammer to crack a nut in many cases.  In many ways because of slowness on the part of county registrars and sheriffs in recovering sums due to creditors, court proceedings without the bankruptcy code behind them are totally useless. It is virtually impossible to persuade the court messengers and officers to recover on foot of court judgments.  The Government of the day ran away from the issue when they appointed revenue sheriffs to do collection work on a separate basis.  Now the ordinary Joe Soap is faced with a system which does not collect on judgments.</P>
    <P>Since the administration of justice is something that is set out in the Constitution it is undermined if we do not provide an effective system of execution in respect of debts adjudicated on by the courts.  At the moment, irrespective of the bankruptcy provision the method of recovering debts here has collapsed completely and many Irish solicitors tell their foreign clients there is no way of recovering debts.  If we do not provide an adequate method of recovering debts, in the last analysis we undermine the right of property guaranteed by the Constitution because there is no point in <Col N="2355" /> allowing a judge to adjudicate on property issues if his decree is a worthless piece of paper.  That is why Deputy Noonan's amendment is a good idea in theory. I do not think the Deputy will press it very far because he is relying on the Minister's good faith in the matter and we want to get on with the matter and finish it once and for all.  The Minister does not need a statutory time limit to get on with it and possibly the best thing the House can do is to encourage him to get on with it by having a short debate here tonight.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to obstruct or prolong this debate.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that there are many things in this Bill which have now become dated, but let us put them into operation in so far as they are being capable of being put into operation now.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that one of the problems in relation to the family home is that the 1970s legislation does not seem to find a mirror in the provisions of this Bill.  That is true, but on the other hand we in this country have a bit of a hang-up about the family home. We should get our priorities straight.  The 1976 Family Home Protection Act does not prevent people from running up debts and having their house sold to pay for them.  There are several High Court judgments to the effect that a judgment mortgage does not amount to a conveyance on the Family Home Protection Act and, therefore, a spouse whose home is sold out by another spouse running up debts does not find protection by virtue of that Act alone.  It would not be right to provide that people could sit in large and substantial houses immune from any process while small creditors and businessmen who dealt in good faith with one or other of the people who live in that house find themselves without remedy.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we are a bit over-romantic in our view about the significance of the family home.  If one owes somebody money and is sitting on assets, one cannot excuse one's liability to pay on the basis that these assets are used to house the debtor and his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be my only speech of the evening.  Deputy Noonan has put down a number of amendments suggesting an updating of the figures last fixed in 1985.  They were originally fixed in the Bill in 1982 at £500 and in 1985 they were amended to £1,000 and Deputy Noonan is now suggesting £1,500.  I am sure the Minister will see that that is a reasonable updating of the figures in question.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the time has now come to put this Bill into law.  We have gone through every possible permutation and combination of the legislative process to consider it, to amend it and to improve it.  We have the most detailed report on which this Bill is based. This Bill may have imperfections but it is about time it became law.</P>
      <P>If this House used select committees more and if as part of the select committee procedure it set out a pre-setting consultation where the civil servants or whoever is promoting the Bill sat down with the people who would be on the committee and went through the Bill to study the provisions and the merits of the amendments, we would have fewer problems on Committee Stage.  People think that if one does not put down amendments on Committee Stage one is lazy and failing in one's duty and people put up paper amendments on Bills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is like priority questions, indeed, and the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> is not here to record us now.  However, people think that unless one snows down the Minister with a raft of verbiage and nitpicking amendments one is not doing one's duty or that one is not showing sufficient interest in the measure.  It would be far better if this House decided to use select committees more often and if the members of the select committees sat down together and considered the <Col N="2357" /> legislation informally without a stenographer present, so that they could decide the issues of principle on which they differed.  That would shorten the debate considerably.  Having said all that and having probably abused the latitude extended to me by the Ceann Comhairle, all I am saying is that I want this to pass as soon as possible.  After 26 years it is about time we allowed the Bill to be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan and Deputy McDowell for their contributions. Like them, I am pleased it is here this evening.  I am very happy and pleased that it is here this evening.  I will never be in a position to take credit for this Bill.  It is there for a long time and many Ministers for Justice have had a hand in it, at some stage in the last 20-odd years.  The holders of that office could say that over the years they brought it some part of the way, but in fairness great credit is due to Deputy Michael Noonan for the part he played in bringing the Bill to the present stage.  I acknowledge publicly the hard slogging work which he did because a select committee is nothing other than slogging work.  The extent of that work is indicated by the reports which I went through to try to get a better understanding of what is involved in the Bill and to come to grips with the Bill.  It is a technical and detailed Bill at which one has to slog fairly hard to get an idea as to what it is about.  One can readily say, and I publicly say this to Deputy Noonan, that but for his own personal input into this Bill &mdash; and he was a very busy Minister &mdash; we would not be at the stage, as we are this evening, of seeing it concluded.  I am in a most peculiar position in that, whereas Deputy McDowell said if people do not put down amendments to legislation they can be taken to task by the members of the press for whatever they want to take you to task for &mdash; it is not too difficult for them most of the time &mdash; I find that all the amendments put down, even the official amendments, with the exception of one in my name, are Deputy Noonan's.  They have emerged from Committee Stage.  I do not <Col N="2358" /> think anybody will take me to task for that.  The only dilemma I have is that I do not know whether to ask Deputy Noonan to move them for me or to move them myself but I suppose I had better comply with the strict procedures of the House.</P>
      <P>I would also very briefly like to mention the fact that if we conclude this Bill tonight &mdash; and I hope it will go to the Seanad next week for Report and Final Stages &mdash; a tribute will be due to the Members who served on that committee and did the hard slogging work in the early sixties under the chairmanship of the late Judge Budd.  Those who are alive now, the majority are dead, will be glad to see the fruits of their labour being used as they would want them to be.  I will not mention any names because one could easily forget somebody.  It is nice to know that even on my right our principal adviser was a member of that committee at that time although he denies it has anything to do with his age.</P>
      <P>On the first amendment proposed by Deputy Noonan to add &ldquo;not later than 1 January 1989&rdquo;, I fully appreciate the intent of that amendment.  Deputy Noonan is correct in saying that the Bill can only come into operation as soon as the bankruptcy rules are made by the Superior Courts Rules Committee.  I cannot compel them but I anticipate that these rules will be made and concurred by me before the end of the year.  I am in a position to accept the amendment and it will act as a spur on all of us if the date is there because it is going on so long.  I will insist that that particular amendment which I am now accepting will ensure that I be given a place on the Seanad agenda for next week.  These are the little things that help us along the way and we will make this Bill a reality as soon as we possibly can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments arise from discussions which took place in regard to section 122 which provides that it will be an offence for a bankrupt not to disclose after-acquired property, that is property which comes to him after his adjudication. The question was raised in the sub-committee as to the position of rights of action in respect of injury to the person or character of the bankrupt and of damages recovered by a bankrupt in such actions, that is actions of personal torts. It was pointed out that while rights of action of the bankrupt, generally speaking, vest in the official assignee, those in respect of injury to the person or character of the bankrupt do not and, furthermore, the damages recovered by the undischarged bankrupt for personal tort do not vest in the official assignee.  In practice this means that if a bankrupt obtains an award arising out of a personal tort the damages cannot be intercepted by the official assignee and so long as <Col N="2360" /> they retain the character of damages he cannot lay claim to them as after-acquired property.  There is a wide variety of cases involving awards for injury to the person or character of the bankrupt, awards for injury to his person and to his property and awards arising out of actions for personal earnings after bankruptcy. It is the purpose of this amendment to ensure that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Bill which, in principle, vest in the official assignee on adjudication all the property of a bankrupt, do not interfere with or prejudice the established case law and practice governing these rights of action and the awards deriving from them.  The new subsection (5) proposed to be inserted is based on the saving clause common to Statute Law Revision Act of 1896 section 1 and the Statute Law Revision Acts of 1962 and 1983, section 2 in each case, where its purpose is to emphasise that the mere repeal of statute does not effect any established rule or practice based upon it.  The first and third amendments then are consequential.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 35, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 9 of the explanatory memorandum comes to the core of what I want here.  Section 8 repeats the conditions at present required before a debtor's summons, now &ldquo;bankruptcy summons&rdquo;, may be issued.  It makes statutory the existing requirements that the debt must be a liquidated sum and introduces a requirement that a notice in the prescribed form requiring payment of the debt must have been served on the debtor.  Under existing law a debtor's summons may be issued for a debt of £20 although a debt of not less than £40 is required to fund the creditor's petition for adjudication in bankruptcy. This anomaly is being removed by providing that the minimum amount of the debt for which a bankruptcy summons will be issued is the same as that required to enable a creditor to petition, that is £500.  That was the position as published.  On Committee Stage the figure was up-dated to £1,000 in 1985.  If there are no other considerations apart from simple indexation, I think the fact that we are finalising the Bill three years after the decision to raise the figure to £1,000 justifies raising it further.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that the Minister for Justice will come back into the House quickly to change the figure.  Even though £1,500 now is over indexation relative to £1,000 three years ago, when we take into account that there will be no great rush back here, it is a reasonable sum to settle on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that somebody can be hauled into bankruptcy at the moment for a debt of £40.  This has given rise to cases where arguments, personality clashes, and quarrels between people result in their ending up in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> for £50 or £60.  People who are quite liquid have their reputations paraded around the country and become an object of gossip in the Bar Library and in the <Col N="2362" /> Bar for the sake of £40 or £50 simply because of some personal disagreement. That is not right.</P>

I think £1,500 now is going a little ahead of the market but the market will catch up fairly quickly.  I am unsure whether there are other considerations apart from the amount.  The officials might advise the Minister and the Minister might advise the House on whether considerations of comparability with the provisions of company law arise or whether it is purely a matter of indexation. I am putting forward the amendment purely on indexation and the same applies to the consequential amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the amendment and the manner in which it is drafted will not be acceptable to the Minister because in effect it removes a crucial section from the Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the family home and the issues which arise where somebody is declared a bankrupt and the only asset he has is the family home but then under the Family Home Protection Act the wife's position has to be protected.  Is that protected position incorporated here in <Col N="2366" /> this section?  Serious doubts were raised by Deputy Shatter, Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Taylor in the Special Committee on Committee Stage and I think it is an extremely important question.  We should ensure that we do nothing on this Report Stage which would cut across the social advances which have been made in the legislation introduced by Deputy Cooney when he was Minister for Justice in the mid-seventies where the rights of spouses were not only recognised but enshrined in law and the position of married women in relation to the family home was protected.</P>
    <P>Various other legislation has been put through the House which raised questions about this matter and this House and the Seanad have always been enormously careful not to move backwards in respect of those rights.  I hope that what we are doing here tonight will ensure that the rights of wives under the family home protection legislation will still be protected. I think this comes under section 44.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to what Deputy Shatter said on Friday, 29 March 1985, at page 75 of the Parliamentary Debates, Joint Committee on Legislation, Subcommittee on the Bankruptcy Bill, 1982.  It is worth quoting the Deputy because he is a recognised authority in these matters as a practitioner before the High Court and the Supreme Court, as well as being an eminent Member of this House.  He said:</P>
    <P>Property here includes all the property of someone who is adjudicated bankrupt.  If a husband and wife are living in a family home and the home is in the husband's sole name the home can be taken into the bankruptcy and can vest in the Official Assignee.  Ultimately, the sale of the home could come about.  The problem of someone being adjudicated a bankrupt who owns the family home is mirrored by the problem that is created where, for example, the husband owns the family home and he incurs debts, and a judgment mortgage is lodged against the home which can force its sale.  The <Col N="2367" /> Official Assignee or the person who is entitled to the benefit of the judgment mortgage are not persons under the Family Home Protection Act who require the consent of the spouse residing in the family home to sell the family home.  The Official Assignee can bring about a realisation of the assets without, under section 3 of the Family Home Protection Act, needing the consent of the non-bankrupt spouse.</P>
    <P>There are two particular situations that can arise.  The first situation is where a wife believes her husband is throwing away the family funds, not operating correctly in his business, gambling, creating a large number of debts and is not paying bills.  The husband may, in those circumstances, behave in that way deliberately because the marriage has broken down and he wants to force the situation where there is a sale of the family home and the wife will not consent.  The husband behaves in that way, either deliberately or because he has a problem; he may be an alcoholic or a compulsive gambler.  If the wife learns of that before there is a bankruptcy adjudication or before a judgment obtained against the husband has been launched as a judgment mortgage, she can bring proceedings under section 5 (1) of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and ask the court to make a property transfer order to protect her and her children's interests and to have the family home transferred to her.  There have been cases in the courts where the husband is incurring large debts in which property transfer orders have been made and the court under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 has transferred the house into the wife's sole name and in so doing has sought to transfer the beneficial interest in the house into the wife's sole name.  If a wife moves quickly, if she knows of the debts, incurred by her husband and if she has efficient, competent lawyers, or sufficient money to pay for competent lawyers, she can bring about a <Col N="2368" /> situation whereby the home is transferred to her by the courts which apparently protects her currently in the context of a possible bankruptcy adjudication.</P>
    <P>The bankruptcy legislation has not tried to come to terms with the Family Home Protection Act, or how the bankruptcy legislation works in this context and equally is not coping with the judgment mortgage problem.  If the wife does not move quickly, if her lawyers are a little bit incompetent or are not familiar with the position and if the creditors move that bit quicker, they will get in with their act of bankruptcy which automatically will produce the situation where the asset &mdash; the family home &mdash; is gone to the Official Assignee.  In those circumstances the courts will not transfer the home to the wife and she and the children can be rendered homeless.</P>
    <P>This is a double barrel issue.  Can the wife and children be made destitute if the family home is vested in the official assignee in a bankruptcy case?  Alternatively, if there is collusion between husband and wife in matters of bad debts, can a competent legal team succeed in transferring the one asset which remains into the sole name of the wife so that significant assets can be removed from bankruptcy proceedings in a deliberate attempt to evade responsibility for debt? Consequently can the efficacy of this legislation be undermined?  This is a real issue which was raised in committee but is not being met by any amendment tonight.  I want to highlight this issue in the only way available to me, without having the skill to draft at enormous length amending amendments by suggesting the deletion of the section.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister I will not be pressing that proposal but I want both sides of this issue aired.  I want to air the possibility of the wife's rights being eliminated and the family home being vested in the official assignee and, consequently, the wife and children becoming destitute where everything is bona fide. <Col N="2369" /> On the other hand, where there is collusion between husband and wife, can a competent legal team ensure that assets are ringfenced from creditors and isolated from the proceedings of a bankruptcy because they are assets represented by a significant property? Both points have to be met.  I see Deputy McDowell nodding in agreement, and perhaps he would like to comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was involved in litigation which concerned judgment mortgages. It was decided by the High Court that judgment mortgages applied to a family home and that you cannot get the fact that you owe money by talking refuge in the Family Home Protection Act if a judgment mortgage is registered against your interest in a house.  What Deputy Noonan is saying has some merit, but my suggestion is that we should not address that issue in the context of a Bankruptcy Bill.  The 1976 Act left so many questions unanswered I am always amazed because it erected certain rights in respect of spouse and family home, but it did not deal with any of the problems.  It must have been put through the House very much on the nod because there are so many problems arising out of that legislation I think we should address it separately on another occasion.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to provide protection but I have seen many cases of people with a house of £250,000 who invoked the Family Home Protection Act to evade their creditors.  That is all right where the creditor is a bank, but where the creditor is a small trader, I have grave misgivings about the justice of a case when a man whose only asset is his house, can insulate himself from any form of legal execution. As I said, we should address the Family Home Protection Act separately.  The Minister should produce a White Paper and a discussion document on it which would deal with the family property in family homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that if we try to introduce a protection here we will introduce an engine of fraud for people who want to avoid paying their obligations. The courts lean over backwards <Col N="2370" /> for a genuine spouse by way of giving stays on execution and the like, but if we give a statutory right of immunity in respect of one class of property, we create injustice.</P>
    <P>I do not have any assets apart from a house and my car.  My house, in so far as I own it rather than the building society, should be amenable to my creditors and my wife's section of the house should be available to her creditors too.  We have to say, realistically, that most people's assets are bound up in their family homes. Most &ldquo;Joe Soaps&rdquo; should not have their only assets made immune from legal execution because it means in most cases there will be nothing left for the creditors.</P>

This is a very complex area and when we come to section 61, which deals with the family home, we will see how we can protect the rights of the family and reconcile the rights of the family with the rights of creditors.  This is a very difficult one.  I am advised that if this amendment were accepted it would cause quite a number of difficulties for us.</P>

      <P>The reason for amendments Nos. 7 and 9 is to get rid of certain exceptions to provisions which enable the official assignee to overturn transactions made by a bankrupt prior to adjudication.

The sub-committee questioned their relevance and on examination I have decided to delete them.  Amendment No. 8 also arises from discussions in the sub-committee.  The ten years limit in section 59 (1) (b) was considered excessive and it was felt that it should be reduced, first, to lessen the onus of proof and, secondly, to follow current trends in other jurisdictions which allow shorter periods in these cases.</P>

      <P>In page 26, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) On an application by the Official Assignee under this section for an order for the sale of a family home, the Court, notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other enactment, shall have power to order postponement of the sale of the family home having regard to the interests of the creditors and of the spouse and dependants of the bankrupt as well as to all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of discussions in the sub-committee on certain sections of the Bankruptcy Bill, notably those dealing with the vesting of the bankrupt's property in the official assignee, the avoidance of transactions entered into by the debtor before adjudication and the official assignee's power to sell or otherwise dispose of a bankrupt's property.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed about the position of the family home in the event of a bankruptcy taking place and the question of the inter-relationship between the Bill, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 and the Succession Act, 1965 was raised. It was submitted that the Bankruptcy Bill was not the appropriate place to amend the Family Home Protection Act and that there was no need to alter the official amendment to section 61, which required the prior sanction of the court to any sale or disposition of the family home.  It was also pointed out that the family home was vested in the official assignee subject to any interest attaching to it and, secondly, that the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 did not deal with ownership of the family home.  Thirdly, it was pointed out that a proposed Family Home Bill in course of preparation was intended to provide for joint ownership of a family home by both spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sections of the Bill referred to were approved but it was agreed to re-examine the position in the light of the comments made by the sub-committee. The various options in relation to the family home were considered in detail and it was decided to include in the Bill <Col N="2374" /> guidelines for the exercise of the court's discretion so as to allow the court to postpone the sale of the family home where appropriate, having regard to the interests concerned and all the circumstances of the case.  This amendment will not affect the balance between secured and unsecured creditors or materially alter the position of a judgment mortgage.  It is an option that goes as far as possible, in the absence of a family home Act, to meet the points made by the sub-committee and at the same time to conform to changes made in the law by the Status of Children Act. It also follows trends in other jurisdictions in allowing the interests of possible dependants of the bankrupt other than children to be considered, for example, grandparents.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand the intent and I agree that it is rerunning the same issues that arose in our discussion on section 44.  Perhaps the Minister for the benefit of the House and of those who read the Official Report would explain the amendment itself in a little more detail rather than its intent.  I am not sure how the amendment actually works to achieve the Minister's intent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to an application by the official assignee.  Does that include an application by a trustee?  We are about to give powers to a trustee.  Does it cover that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy McDowell's question is yes.  In reply to Deputy Noonan, this is a very complex matter and no perfect solution has been found, even in jurisdictions where there exists legislation which provides for the joint ownership of the family home by both spouses.  As it stands, the family home cannot be sold without the sanction of the court and in practice the court will delay the sale where hardship would be caused.  The difficulty is to strike a balance between doing justice to the creditors and treating the spouse and family fairly.  Circumstances can differ greatly. One family home may be worth £200,000 and another £25,000.  While a sale might be justified in the former case, with the <Col N="2375" /> spouse and family transferring to a modest dwelling, it would be unfair in the latter case, especially where the solvent spouse had made a big contribution to the home by looking after the family for many years.</P>
      <P>Since the discussion in the sub-committee, various options have been further examined.  The first option is to exclude the family home from the bankrupt's assets and the second is to exclude a family home below a specified value.  The third option if to sell the family home and apply part of the proceeds towards alternative accommodation.  The last option examined was to allow the court the same discretion as it has at present and to give statutory effect to it by laying down general guidelines.</P>
      <P>The first three options were rejected because they would involve in varying degrees unfairly prejudicing the interest of creditors in favour of those of the family, discrimination between bankrupts where the family home formed the major or sole assets and those where it represented only a small part, acting as a disincentive to potential creditors who would be slow to give credit or loan facilities to small traders or businesses, leaving untouched the position of secured creditors and thus further weakening the position of unsecured creditors.</P>
      <P>The fourth option is the most realistic one in the absence of legislation which would provide for a system of co-ownership of the family home.  To go further at this stage could have implications for judgment mortgages since the benefits conferred on the solvent spouse in bankruptcy in relation to the family home would outweigh those available to a judgment mortgage seeking to realise his security in similar circumstances.  The complexities involved in this whole area were emphasised by the sub-committee and there seems to be general agreement that what was required in the Bill was to give some guidance to the court in the exercise of its discretion.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister refers to three options.  The fourth option is to leave it in the hands of the courts.  Once it is left in the hands of the courts, have the courts the right to look at those options?  For example, could a court dispose of a family home worth £250,000 and assign £40,000 to provide accommodation for a wife?  Does the court have that flexibility within option No. 4?  If not, what is the nature of the flexibility which the court has in disposing of the family home?</P>

      <P>I am not certain from the Minister's answer if it is possible for the courts to have discretion, say, where a house is worth £250,000 to sell the property and leave aside a sum of money to provide reasonable accommodation for the family.  If there is not some sort of discretion of that nature what eventually happens is that the unfortunate wives and children, who in most cases are the ones to suffer, have to be provided with a house by the local authority, paid for by the taxpayer to the tune of £30,000 or £35,000.  Is it possible for the courts to have that discretion or is it that the only power they have is the power to delay matters, to delay the disposal of the property or delay taking a decision, hoping that things will come right at the end of the day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>The matter would be before the High Court.  The court would have to have regard to the constitutional problems that could arise and to the spouse's interest.  The practice has been that the court can delay to give the spouse an opportunity to make other arrangements. They would have to have regard very definitely to the constitutional validity of decisions they make.</P>

      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART V</P>
      <P Just="Center">Winding up by Trustee</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>110.&mdash;If, at the statutory sitting referred to in section 17 (3) or at any <Col N="2379" /> adjournment thereof, at least three-fifths in number and value of the creditors voting at the meeting, either in person or by a person authorised in writing in that behalf, by resolution declare that the estate of the bankrupt be wound up by a trustee and a committee of inspection, and appoint for that purpose a trustee and a committee of inspection of not more than five creditors qualified to vote at the meeting, the Court, on application being made to it in that behalf, may order that the property of the bankrupt be so wound up.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of these amendments is to include in the Bill what are called the trustee clauses of the 1972 Bankruptcy Act.  These 35 clauses allow a bankruptcy to be administered by a trustee and a committee of inspection rather than by an official assignee.  One of the major recommendations of the Bankruptcy Law Committee was that the clauses should be dropped since no trustee had been appointed for over a century, and this was given effect when the Bill was introduced.  However, in 1984 a trustee was appointed in a rather complicated case and subsequently the Incorporated Law Society asked that the clauses be reinstated to provide for particularly complex bankruptcies or those where the amounts involved were considerable.  The matter was also raised on the sub-committee and it was agreed that the procedure be looked at again.</P>
    <P>More recently a further case occurred of the bankruptcy court making an order that the bankruptcy be wound up by a trustee and a committee of inspection.  I understand that the size and complexity of the case would have imposed an inordinate burden on the official assignee's office.  In the circumstances, and having regard to the increase in the number and the size of bankruptcies, I have decided to retain the trustee clause procedure as an alternative to the administration of bankruptcy by the official assignee in appropriate cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That legislation was originally published in <Col N="2380" /> 1982 arising from the recommendations of the 1972 report.  It was reasonable to drop the whole concept of a trustee and a committee of inspection and their particular rights from the Bill.  As the Minister has pointed out, a trustee had not been appointed since the last century and, in effect, powers which might be exercised by a trustee on a committee of inspection had become redundant through lack of use.  I know that the Incorporated Law Society have a fairly strong view and have made fairly strong representations as a result of the trustee and committee of inspection to which the Minister refers in a particular case in 1984.  I accept what the Minister is saying.</P>
      <P>There are complex bankruptcy cases involving large amounts which would take up an inordinate amount of time of the official assignee.  There is another consequence which is worth remarking, that if the official assignee has to give an inordinate amount of time to a particularly complex case he will not be available to deal with the commonality of cases which affect many more people and are of far greater general concern than the one complex one that he might get tied into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's amendment. There is just one point I want to clarify. As I understand it the bankruptcy court, by order, would be the initiator and it would be the bankruptcy court that would appoint the trustee and not any other agency.  Would the committee of inspection be appointed by the bankruptcy court or would it be put together by the trustee?  When replying perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the circumstances in which the court would make an order for the appointment of a trustee, how the creditors would get involved with the committee of inspection, how the two would inter-relate and what the relative powers are in respect of the trustee and the committee of inspection. A second issue which the Minister might deal with when replying is what the position would be once it is tracked into that particular process.  Would it be possible at a certain point when the proceedings have moved into an area of less complexity to assign it to the official assignee or would it be the case that once <Col N="2381" /> it is made the responsibility of the trustee and the committee of inspection, that responsibility would remain with them until it is concluded with in effect the official assignee being out of the game once the bankruptcy court appoints a trustee and the creditors come in with their committee of inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to explain the position as best I can to Deputy Noonan. A number of amendments have been tabled.  Amendment No. 13 deals with the order of the court winding up a bankrupt property by a trustee and the committee of inspection procedure would simplify the existing procedure for doing this.  Amendment No. 14 would divest the property of the bankrupt out of the hands of the official assignee and vest it in the trustee.  Amendment No. 15 would combine a number of provisions at present in the trustee clauses so as to give effect to the underlying principle that since the property of the bankrupt is vested in the trustee, as if he or she were the official assignee, the powers of the trustee should correspond so far as possible with those of the official assignee. Parts IV and VI are excluded because they deal with arrangements under the control of the court, which is a pre-bankruptcy procedure, and with the administration in bankruptcy of estates of deceased insolvents.  The remainder of the Bill would apply as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (c) of amendment No. 15 is intended to cover provisions relating to vacancies in the office of trustee and the committee of inspection as well as procedural matters which can, where necessary, be dealt with by the new bankruptcy rules to be made by the superior courts rules committee.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 covers the discharge of the bankruptcy and the release of the trustee when the estate has been realised.  Amendment No. 17 would give the court the power to make such orders as it could make if the bankruptcy had been administered by the official assignee.  Amendment No. 19 is consequential on the retention of the trustee clauses and gives the reference in the Arbitration Act to a trustee and the committee of inspection.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This amendment is acceptable to us.  Duties are now being assigned to the official assignee.  Up to now the thrust of the Bill seemed to be that matters would be simplified by centralising the role of the official assignee.  I must say that the Minister's reply to Deputy Barrett surprised me slightly.  This was to the effect that the amendments which we have just accepted would give an initiating role to the creditors rather than to the bankruptcy court and that the creditors would take the initiative to make the trustee central to <Col N="2385" /> the issue rather than the official assignee. That runs counter to the thrust of the Bill as presented and I ask the Minister when replying to deal with that problem.  I understood the Minister to say in reply to Deputy Barrett that the creditors would now be able to decide whether the bankruptcy would be dealt with by a trustee and a committee of inspection or by the official assignee.  I understood the thrust of the Bill up to now was to centre everything on the official assignee but the Minister's reply has made me feel uneasy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Grant Payment to Kilkenny VEC.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter this evening.  I have never used the facility of the Adjournment debate in a frivolous manner or for a subject which has not been important.  The record will show that any time I have used this facility it has been for a very special and important reason.</P>
      <P>My reason for raising this subject tonight is because of the further victimisation of the disadvantaged.  Can there be a more disadvantaged group in our society than the mentally handicapped? The Government and Ministers have continually stressed that in their cutback policies no disadvantaged groups would suffer, yet we see all around us every day in the health services, the welfare services, housing services and in this instance in the education services, ample evidence that the disadvantaged are being victimised further and are suffering the most cruel blows as a result of the Government's policies of cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I want to refer to is the payment of an annual grant by Kilkenny VEC to the day care centre for the adult mentally handicapped in Kilkenny city. By direction of the Department of Education that grant has to be discontinued <Col N="2389" /> from 30 June this year, which is just a few days away.  This grant which was paid by Kilkenny VEC to the adult mentally handicapped centre has been in operation since 1978 when an agreement with the management of the centre, known as SOS Kilkenny Limited, came into existence. The agreement provided for an annual payment of money, aggregating to 15 part time teaching hours per week. Having regard to the increases in part time teaching rates, there is a record of an increasing annual payment each year since 1978.  For example, the total amount paid between 1 July 1986 and 31 August 1987 was £9,367 and the total for the current year will possibly be around £10,000.  The grant paid to the SOS centre in Kilkenny enabled that centre to employ, for 15 hours a week, a home economics instructor whose role has been to maintain a canteen at the day care centre and, more importantly, to instruct up to 70 mentally handicapped adults in self-sufficiency skills, which is a most important job.  This course would save a lot of money to the various services in future years because it must be appreciated that the more self-sufficiency skills mentally retarded people are taught and shown how to perform then the less dependency they will have on other sources of assistance and in the long run this more than pays for itself.</P>
    <P>This voluntary organisation, SOS, cannot maintain this service in the absence of the annual grant from the VEC because they have many other heavy commitments.  This is a major undertaking and they are doing a marvellous job in the centre.  Kilkenny VEC, of which I am a member, agree that SOS cannot carry this extra burden.  If they do take it on it means that some other service for the mentally handicapped will suffer. Whether we are members of health boards or VECs, we are continuously told that cutbacks must be brought about without hurting these people.  However, clear directives have been issued from the Minister's office in the Department of Education stating the priorities that have to be adopted and nowhere is any priority given to the instruction provided by this VEC to the mentally handicapped. The letters to the committee and <Col N="2390" /> the chief executive officers which come from the Minister's Department have all kinds of threats in them on what will happen if they deviate from the strict terms of the circular letter.  I am referring in particular to the circular letter dated 16 April 1988 which clearly identified the priorities by which the VECs are obliged and compelled to abide.  Because of the contents of that circular letter, the VEC in Kilkenny were left with no option but to discontinue this funding.  All that is required from the Department is the very modest amount of £10,000, in order that this very important scheme can be continued.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress sufficiently how important this scheme is or how imperative it is that the Department act immediately. I am not accusing the Minister of gross indifference.  I prefer to take the line that there may have been an oversight. Granted, an oversight on a matter of this kind is serious and should not happen but I am prepared to take that more lenient view.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister herself visited Kilkenny last week when a number of people mentioned this matter to her.  I hope the Minister of State, who is representing her here this evening, will be in a position to reassure Kilkenny VEC that this £10,000 will be made available to the committee to ensure the continuance of this essential service.  It is unthinkable that such a service should suffer as a result of cutbacks no matter now serious the overall economic position may be.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of my remarks that it is for the gravest reasons only that I raise something on the Adjournment of the House &mdash; the record will prove that to be the case.  This is a grave matter and is capable of early resolution by the Minister amending the letter of 16 April last and providing these moneys for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that there is not a travellers centre under the aegis of Kilkenny VEC.  I know the Minister rightly affords priority to this scheme for travellers but there is not such a centre located in Kilkenny.  Therefore, there is no expenditure in that respect in Kilkenny.  This would strengthen our argument that money be made available <Col N="2391" /> for this unique service.  I would hope that the Minister would not contend that the VECs of the vocational education system have no responsibility for the instruction of mentally handicapped people.  It was an enlightened move in 1978 when the VECs took on this form of instruction of mentally handicapped adults.  It is something that should be encouraged, developed and expanded rather than cut dead in its tracks because of the current overall economic position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in this case appears to arise because the VEC in question claim that the non-pay budget for 1988 is not adequate.  My Department, in response to representations from the vocational sector, this year gave a block non-pay allocation and allowed the relevant VEC discretion to distribute the allocation as they deemed fit provided that certain priorities were met.  These priorities were: (a) essential second level school services, including administration of the school transport scheme; (b) junior and senior traveller centres; (c) vocational preparation and training and middle level technical programmes which attract counterpart EC funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first indication my Department had about this problem was in mid-June. The VEC claim that their non-pay allocation is inadequate and that this service must suffer as a result.  However, my Department would need to satisfy themselves that this is in effect the case and that the VEC are not funding other discretionary activities which might give way <Col N="2392" /> to the funding required by the SOS centre.</P>
    <P>In this regard I deem it pertinent to point out that the information available to my Department from the VEC is inadequate to enable such an assessment to be carried out.  Moreover, as part of their information and expenditure control system, my Department require VECs generally to provide a yearly expenditure profile and a monthly expenditure return in the early part of each month.  In the case of Kilkenny VEC neither the profile nor expenditure returns have yet been received despite a number of reminders from my Department.</P>
    <P>I would point out also that the VEC in question also had, at the end of 1987, a deficit of some £200,000 necessitating the payment of scarce moneys to meet interest payments on overdraft facility.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this House would generally concur with the view that it is incumbent on the Minister for Education to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent to best effect.  To enable this to be done I need information about what money is being spent and how it is being spent. I have asked my Department to again contact the VEC with a view to securing all the information deemed necessary to enable this issue to be properly examined. To accede to requests for additional funding without proper examination of the VEC's overall finances and the areas being funded would be abdication of the Minister's responsibilities to the taxpayer and this House.  I do not propose to lay myself or the Minister open to such an accusation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the Commission's proposals for agricultural prices and related <Col N="2220" /> measures for 1988-89 had been completed but difficulties arose subsequently in interpreting part of the agreement reached.  Consultations are continuing between the parties concerned but at this stage it is unclear whether the agreement can now be implemented.  If not, the Commission may proceed to take the market management measures which it deems appropriate.  The package of measures that had been agreed represented a reasonably satisfactory outcome, given the Community's budgetary situation, the very restrictive measures contained in the original Commission proposals and the further proposals made by the Commission in the course of the negotiations.  I would be hopeful that agreement can be reached either today or tomorrow on the interpretation of that part of the agreement relating to the Greek agrimonetary issue.</P>
    <P>Following is the main outcome of the agreement reached in so far as Irish agriculture is concerned:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Beef: The present rules provide that the buying-in price for intervention is the average price for the quality concerned in the member states where intervention is taking place plus 2.5 per cent or the highest price in any one of these states, whichever is the higher.  The Commission proposal was that for the future it should in all cases be the average price only. In the final package this proposal was withdrawn and replaced by agreement that the suspension of the existing provisions should take place only in certain market conditions to be determined. There has since been agreement that in order to put a floor in the market, mechanisms would be put in place to allow the buying-in price to be fixed at levels above the average market price if that price fell below 82 per cent of the intervention price.  These mechanisms should prevent any downward spiral in the market prices.</P>
    <P>The Council also called on the Commission, in its proposals for the reform of the beef market organisation to be tabled later this year, to consider increasing the special male beef and suckler cow premia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> Cereals: The Commission had proposed that from the next marketing year the value of the monthly increments, designed to compensate owners of cereals for the costs incurred in delaying offers until late in the marketing year, should be reduced by half.  The Council agreed to limit this reduction to only 25 per cent.  Because of falls in interest rates since last harvest this reduction should have little effect on producers' incomes.</P>
    <P>The Council also agreed that cereals can again be offered to intervention in 1988-89 at up to 15 per cent moisture content where a 14.5 per cent limit poses practical problems, and up to 15.5 per cent in exceptional circumstances.  The position under existing rules would have meant that from 1 July grain with a moisture content above 14.5 per cent would not have been eligible for intervention.</P>
    <P>These concessions, which were made following persistent pressure by other colleagues and myself, are worth £5 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Milk: A proposal to reduce the intervention price for butter by 2 per cent from 2 July was withdrawn following objections by a number of member states including Ireland.  The Council also undertook to deal with the implications of the ruling by the European Court of Justice in the Mulder case and it called on the Commission to consider reducing the co-responsibility levy from the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year.</P>
    <P>Sugar: The proposal to cut intervention prices by 1 per cent from 1 July 1988 was dropped.  The Council also rejected the proposal to phase out the regionalised price system under which intervention prices are higher in Ireland, UK and Italy than elsewhere in the Community.  This is worth about £2 million a year to Irish beet producers.  It will now be examined when the common organisation of the sugar market is reviewed in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>Agrimonetary: The Council agreed to dismantle existing negative MCAs on a phased basis between now and 1992.  The first stage of dismantling will take place on 1 January 1989 and in Ireland's case <Col N="2222" /> will involve a 1.55 per cent reduction in MCAs.  For technical reasons this adjustment does not yet apply in the beef sector pending completion of the review of the regime, but when it does it will eliminate the existing Irish beef MCAs.</P>
    <P>The agrimonetary adjustment, on 1 January next will be worth about £31 million to the agricultural sector in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Commission had not originally proposed any green currency devaluations for any member state other than Greece because the 1988 budget guideline agreed by the Heads of State at the February Summit had been fully committed. As a result, however, of demands from some other colleagues and myself the final package provided for adjustments to phase out the MCAs and re-establish support price unity in the Community. This represented a considerable achievement in the acute budgetary circumstances.</P>
    <P>The overall package of measures agreed contains substantial benefits for the agricultural sector in the 1988-89 marketing year and in the longer term.  In summary, the value of the agrimonetary adjustment is about £31 million and the withdrawal of a number of the proposals submitted by the Commission about £13 million in a full year.</P>

The estimated employment in December 1987 was 36,800 which is the latest figure available.  The figures for May 1988 are not available.  The drop in employment numbers may be due in part to seasonal fluctuations as well as to the implementation of rationalisation plans in the dairy and meat sectors in particular. In addition, many companies now take services on a contract basis where formerly they provided such services within the company.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Storage space is arranged at a rate per tonne of product stored rather than on a utilised floor space basis.  The total amount of all food products stored in intervention in this country at 31 May 1988 is 213,122 tonnes valued at £422.575 million.</P>
      <P>The position by commodity is as follows:</P>
      <P>Dairy Products</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intervention stocks of butter amount <Col N="2227" /> to 77,500 tonnes valued at £170.605 million. There are no intervention stocks of skimmed milk powder in Ireland.  Contracts have been placed for the sale of 27,000 tonnes of butter in Irish stores which will be removed from intervention by 15 July next.  As a result some 51,000 tonnes will remain in store in Ireland after that date.</P>
    <P>Beef</P>
    <P>There are 53,700 tonnes of bone-in beef valued at £104.5 million and 54,800 tonnes of boneless beef valued at £145.3 million in intervention.</P>
    <P>Cereals</P>
    <P>Barley is the only cereal in intervention in Ireland.  Barley stocks in intervention amount to 27,122 tonnes valued at £2.17 million.</P>
    <P>The earliest dates of entry of food products currently stored in intervention are May 1986 in respect of butter, September 1985 in respect of boneless beef, July 1986 in respect of bone-in beef and October 1987 in respect of barley.</P>
    <P>The ultimate decision for the disposal of intervention stocks rests with the appro-Commission, acting through the appropriate management committees. However, the Deputy will appreciate that intervention sales are largely dependent on stock levels and on world market conditions and vary considerably depending on the product involved.</P>
    <P>Exchequer costs for storage</P>
    <P>The costs incurred by the Exchequer including storage, handling and freezing, are remibursed by the EC at standard rates worked out on the basis of inputs from all member states.  Such reimbursements are not sufficient to cover the full costs involved and as a result the operation of intervention involves a significant net cost to Ireland.  The cumulative net cost to the Exchequer of all storage of intervention goods since 1973 was £73.232 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The December 1987 livestock enumeration revealed that the non-breeding cattle population over one year old was at the same level as at December 1986. Accordingly, any reduction in disposals this year will result primarily from decisions by farmers to retain more cows <Col N="2231" /> and heifers for breeding &mdash; a development which is in the long term interests of the industry.</P>
    <P>The reduction in cattle slaughterings so far this year has been caused by a number of factors viz:</P>
    <P>(i)  Slaughterings in the early part of 1987 were very heavy in advance of the introduction of the new intervention arrangements on 6 April, 1987;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Farmers are retaining more cows and heifers for breeding;</P>
    <P>I am confident that the overall downward trend in live exports which has been a feature of recent years will continue over 1988 as a whole, and that market conditions, together with the wide range of supports now available, will stimulate the continuation, this year and next year, of the expansion in beef cow numbers that is already taking place.  This expansion is evidenced by the reduction in cow and heifer slaughterings and the increase of about 8 per cent in AI usage in the first five months of 1988 over the same period in 1987.</P>
    <P>The supply situation for sheep and pigs is expected to be adequate in 1988.  Pig output is of the order of the 1987 level. The national sheep flock has undergone rapid expansion in recent years and I expect a significant expansion in sheep slaughtering at meat export plants in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bovine tuberculosis is a classical contagious disease and epidemiological investigations in Ireland and elsewhere have confirmed that under field conditions direct animal to animal transmission is the normal means of <Col N="2232" /> spread of infection within and between cattle herds.  Cattle with open pulmonary tuberculosis are the source of the infection which is spread to contact cattle by means of infectious aerosols.</P>
      <P>Recent limited trials carried out at the Veterinary Research Laboratory over short periods have shown that a number of tuberculosis free cattle maintained in contact with reactor animals under good husbandry conditions did not contact disease. Full details of these trials will be published in due course.  The results are not seen, however, as conflicting in any way with existing knowledge on the transmission of disease.  It is well established that infection is more likely to be transmitted when the immune defences of the exposed animal are overcome or weakened. This can come about through exposure to overwhelming doses of infection, disadvantageous nutritional or environmental conditions, or the ageing process.  The primary role of lateral spread in disease outbreaks remains unchallenged.</P>
      <P>The precise factors that lead to the shedding of sufficient virulent tubercle bacilli to infect contact cattle is a complex area of research and one which must continue to receive close attention.  As I indicated to the House on 21 April last, the research function is being given a special emphasis in the new arrangements for the bovine TB scheme and adequate funding is available for worthwhile projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be concerned &mdash; and my concern in this respect would be shared by the management board for disease eradication &mdash; that recent press reports relating to the research should lead to a general belief that the danger of tuberculosis spread has been over-stated and that we can relax our efforts.  There will be no let-up in the campaign against bovine TB and the management board will be pressing ahead vigorously with a comprehensive eradication programme.  My Department will continue to emphasise the importance of securing boundary fences, isolating reactor and suspect animals and removing reactors for slaugther without delay.  Herd owners should be in <Col N="2233" /> no doubt but that failure to follow this advice greatly increases the risk of cattle contracting and spreading disease.</P>

      <P>There has always been a degree of difference in the gross margins as between milk on the one hand and beef and cereals on the other.  As well as the prices of inputs and outputs, the <Col N="2234" /> average size of enterprises and the average level of efficiency in each of the sectors are among the most important of the factors determining gross margins.  I am confident that there is a viable future for the efficient producer in each of the three sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals for the pilot programme were drawn up in consultation with the EC Commission.  One vital criterion which was laid down was the size of the areas which participate in the programme.  The target population was 5,000 or thereabouts, which for many areas correspond broadly with administrative rural districts.  While some of the areas chosen span the border between two counties, being limited to this number has meant that half the counties of Ireland, with perfectly valid claims for a pilot area, could not be included in this particular programme.  The funding arrangement discussed with the EC was based on around ten such sub-regions.</P>
      <P>It may be reassuring for the Deputy to know that the Government have placed a time limit of two years on this pilot study.  It is the intention that the experience gained from this programme be applied on a nationwide basis so that all rural areas can be facilitated to improve their economic and social developments.</P>

      <P>The most recent CSO provisional estimate on 5 February, 1988 of total farm income, which excludes off-farm income, in 1987 is £1,318 million, an increase of 17 per cent on the 1986 figure.  However, current reviews of farm income for 1987 suggest that the final figure will be significantly higher as indicated in the AFT National Farm Survey &mdash; Provisional Estimates.  As yet, it is too early to speculate on the rate of increase for 1988, which is dependent on output and input price movements, volume changes and the general performance of farmers in responding to changing market conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme began in 1954, disease levels in the dairying counties were exceptionally high and posed severe problems for herd owners.  One in three cows was infected at the initial round of testing and herd incidence was upwards of 50 per cent in many areas.  The situation has improved dramatically in the meantime.  The present position is that 1,941 of the 82,685 herds in the ten highest milk producing counties, namely, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry, Kilkenny, Cavan, Waterford, Wexford, Monaghan and Clare, are currently restricted due to bovine tuberculosis, that is a herd prevalence of 2.3 per cent; the disease incidence in animals is 0.2 per cent.  As regards developments in more recent times, over the last two years an improvement has occurred in the bovine TB situation in the dairying counties as a whole.  Following the 1987-88 round of <Col N="2236" /> testing, that is at the end of March last, the average level of disease prevalence in the counties concerned was 2.07 per cent of herds compared to 2.71 per cent at the end of the 1985-86 round two years earlier.  Some 16,000 reactors were removed from the dairying counties over the 1987-88 round compared to almost 19,000 over the 1985-86 round.  Results to date from the present (1988-89) round suggest that progress is being maintained.</P>
      <P>As I indicated when introducing the new arrangements for the bovine TB scheme, the target set by the Government is that the remaining levels of disease should be halved over the next four years and I am confident that the target will be met in the dairying counties.</P>
      <P>The brucellosis situation in the dairying counties at the commencement of the eradication programme in 1964 was in many ways more serious than in the case of bovine TB and the resultant losses to herd owners of even greater proportions. Substantial progress has been made in the eradication of brucellosis in the mean-time. At present, 43 herds located mainly in north Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and Waterford are considered to have a serious disease problem.  Despite the very low levels of brucellosis, serious outbreaks still occur and highlight the need for constant vigilance against any resurgence of the disease.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that a claim for tax relief in respect of the expenditure referred to in the question has not been lodged by the taxpayer.  On receipt of a claim by the inspector of taxes, the question of allowing relief will be considered.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, expenditure incurred on hearing aids and aural appliances if prescribed by a medical practitioner would qualify for relief under Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967.</P>

Within this average, however, there can be longer delays in issuing some copy maps due to the fact that extensive reconstruction work may have to be carried out on existing maps (which apart from being on an old six inch scale can at times be in very poor condition).</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Registrar of Titles that the average delay in the issue of land certificates is 12 working days, which does not take into account time taken in transmission through the post both ways.

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 16 April 1988 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who found her to be incapable of work from that date. Accordingly, payment of benefit was <Col N="2250" /> restored from 16 April 1988 and all benefit payable to date has been issued to her.</P>

      <P>Section 28 of the Social Welfare Act of 1988 provides for a new scheme called pre-retirement allowance to be paid to persons who have reached a certain age and have retired but who have not reached pensionable age and who would otherwise be entitled to claim long term unemployment assistance.  The allowance will be paid by books of paying orders of the type already used for pensioners.</P>
      <P>Regulations to enable the scheme to come into effect are being drafted.  They will prescribe the minimum age for eligibility as 60.  Initially, the scheme will be confined to those with &ldquo;nil&rdquo; means; those who have means can be brought into the scheme at a later point.</P>
      <P>The detailed procedures to be followed by staff at the Department's local offices in implementing the scheme are being finalised at present and instructions in the matter will issue shortly.  The first task will be to issue an information leaflet and application form to all current long-term recipients of unemployment assistance with &ldquo;nil&rdquo; means who are over 60 years of age in order to give them the opportunity of opting for the new scheme.  The aim is to have this task completed by the end of next month.  The further administrative arrangements will then be put into operation and it is expected at this stage that by the autumn order books will be in the hands of those who opt for the scheme.</P>

      <P>Because of the number of serious traffic accidents in this area, it is considered that the most appropriate medium term solution would be to provide a grade-separated interchange between the Rathcoole and Saggart junctions on the Naas Road.

      <P>The GMS (Payments) Board regularly circularises participating doctors with comparative data on the cost of a standard course of treatment with various alternative versions of the drugs most commonly in use to allow doctors to prescribe the cheapest version available.
