      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9 and 18.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.  It is further proposed that No. 9 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 18, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Justice.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 35.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to No. 18, it is proposed that the proceedings on Committee Stage be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. tonight.  Since last Thursday a substantial number of amendments have appeared, including a number of amendments put forward by the Minister. I take the view that it will not be possible to deal adequately with the matters in this Bill before 10.30 tonight so I would ask the Government to change its <Col N="1658" /> view on that and not to apply a time limit to that debate.  Let us see how far we get by 10.30 tonight but I do not believe that that Bill can be adequately discussed on Committee Stage during the course of the day and I do not believe there is any good reason for wishing to conclude it by 10.30 tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking clarification on this.  The original proposition put to the Whips last week was that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill would spill into tomorrow. It was the Fine Gael Whip who wanted a full debate on the Cecchini report tomorrow and agreed that item No. 18 would conclude tonight at 10.30. tonight.  It was on that basis that the Progressive Democrats' Whip and I agreed to the conclusion of the Bill at 10.30 tonight.  Is there to be a change in the procedure now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the House should have the debate that the Whips have.  The fact is that since the <Col N="1659" /> agreement on Thursday that these proceedings would be concluded tonight, a number of extra amendments have been put down and we have had the agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to No. 18 I have not been involved in the discussions at the Whips' meetings and was not aware that this matter would be concluded at 10.30 tonight until I received the Order of Business this morning.  We also received in our post this morning a list of 100 amendments to this liquor Bill and we do not see how those amendments, not even the amendments from the Minister for Justice himself, can be dealt with in the time allocated, and for that reason we are opposing the proposal here to conclude the debate at 10.30 tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The term was not previously defined as the Deputy has said in Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  However, it was defined in the Children Act, 1908, in section 120 as &ldquo;any open drinking bar or any part of the premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;  Section 120 of the Children Act has been repealed so it is necessary to restate the definition for the purpose of Part 4 of the Act.  It is also necessary to extend the definition to exclude the operation of bar facilities in restaurants with special restaurant licences.  In this part of the definition the word &ldquo;bar&rdquo; means any counter or other type of barrier at which the public can stand or sit and across which drink can be served either for consumption there or in some other part of the premises.  The waiting and dining areas of a restaurant could not be described as being exclusively or mainly used for the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor and will not therefore be excluded from areas where alcohol can be sold or consumed.  It is envisaged that the sale of alcohol in these <Col N="1666" /> areas will be by waiter service or by collection or through service hatches.

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 17, after &ldquo;licence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or temporary special restaurant licence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As you Sir, pointed out, all the amendments you mentioned deal with the issue of the granting of temporary special restaurant licences.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed as it is presented to us a problem will arise for many restaurant owners around the country who have a trade which does not extend beyond a short period during the year, particularly the summer period in many seaside and holiday resorts.  They have a season of approximately eight to ten weeks or, if lucky, a 12-week season. It would manifestly be unfair for such restaurant owners to have to pay the same licence fee as that for a restaurant which opens the 12 months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed in this amendment would be welcomed by the restaurant trade.  It is reasonable and would bring fairness into the operation of the Bill.  I press the amendment strongly.  The fee involved for such temporary special restaurant licences should be commensurate with or at the very same rate as the special restaurant licences allowed for in the Bill, the yearly fee being £3,000 whether on a monthly basis or a three monthly basis.  I suggest it should be three months, but I leave that to the Minister to decide.  That <Col N="1668" /> fee should be <i>pro rata</i> to the £3,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>The problems which would arise for a restaurant which opens for only the three months or ten weeks would be immense, certainly in the first year where the owners would have to find another £3,000 if the restaurant, as envisaged under the terms of this Bill, is to be properly designated for the purpose of granting a special restaurant licence.  If they have a full-time restaurant bona fide providing the service envisaged in the Bill, they should be entitled to have a licence but it is unfair if that is made uneconomic for them.</P>
    <P>The turnover in any of these restaurants gives a false impression of the profit restaurants make.  Some restaurant owners tell me that before VAT was removed from their business they had in Dublin approximately 1.5 per cent profit rate and outside Dublin it was about one half of 1 per cent.  Since then it has risen to the magnificent rate of 2 per cent and approximately 1 per cent outside Dublin. Out of that for a three month period it would be unreasonable to ask restaurant owners to pay on top of their existing overheads a further£3,000.  I hope the Minister will agree with me on this and will not bring in something that is manifestly unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be supporting this amendment put forward by Deputy Colley.  There is some justification for the points she made but in the introduction of these special restaurant licences one has to strike a balance.  We have to cater for people who are at present in business and who have tremendous fears, perhaps rightly, that abuses could take place as a result of the introduction of these special restaurant licences.  I am attempting with a couple of amendments to tighten up even further what is already in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must remember that there are people who provide service on a 12-month basis.  In rural towns and villages and, indeed, in city areas they are providing a service all year around, giving employment to people and they have to pay rates and keep other overheads <Col N="1669" /> covered.  It would be unfair to them that an individual or individuals could come in for the height of the season, for three months and scoop the pool so to speak and then leave it high and dry for somebody else to provide the service for 12 months.  In our attempts to introduce licences for genuine restaurants we have to take into account the fact that other people who have considerable investments in their properties and businesses are very fearful that the introduction of these special restaurant licences could in some way jeopardise their business.</P>
    <P>Competition is healthy and I support fully the concept of being able to have a drink with a meal in a restaurant, but it would be unfair, taking into account all the other aspects, to cater for somebody who wants to operate for just two or three months and leave it to somebody else to provide the service for the rest of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very much with Deputy Barrett's general approach in this.  I understand very well the arguments Deputy Colley has made but one has to strike a balance.  I have a sheaf of post here, as I suppose every Deputy has, one from one side of the fence saying the fee is too high and another from the other side saying it is too low.  I think it is about right.  Although I have no first-hand experience of the restaurant business I have a great deal of experience of it at the receiving end, not so much in this country because I cannot afford it here but in other countries where I can.  I feel that if the restaurant business in Ireland as a whole is operating on a profit margin of 0.5, or 1 or at best 2 per cent, there is something wrong somewhere with our system, with management or the industrial relations structures forced on them which contribute to that result.  The State perhaps have a role in trying to induce a better management system and a better industrial atmosphere in that trade and business.  I am inclined, therefore, to share the sympathetic unwillingness of Deputy Barrett to support Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another consideration which occurs to <Col N="1670" /> me is that if there was such a thing as a licence at a reduced rate covering only, say, July and August, in this country where we do not like pedantry, least of all in the enforcement of the law, it would impose a very odious burden on inspectors monitoring the legislation to tolerate a full service of drink in a restaurant on 31 August but who would be expected to initiate proceedings which may deprive the owner of a licence if his staff mistakenly &mdash; or perhaps just because they think they might get away with it &mdash; continue to serve drink on 1 September.  A restaurant which, during the tourist season, has a full range of drink services will enjoy a lot of sympathy and the law will look rather silly if when they throw their full bar open without permission around Christmas they have the State around their neck.  There was a certain virtue in Deputy Colley's remarks but it would impose an impossible and very disagreeable policing duty on the State if such a rule was made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed in Deputy Colley's amendment. In my constituency the tourist season operates for a short season only in places like Lisdoonvarna.  They continously complain that there is a bias against them and they are looking for some kind of relief.  In practice, intoxicating liquor licences already issued in the form of six and seven-day licences have also caused difficulty and it is peculiar that people now on six-day licences are now asking the Minister to convert early closing licences to full licences for a fee.  If the Minister were to establish temporary licences for restaurants it would not be long before temporary restaurant licence holders would be looking for full licences.  Will the Minister impress on the Department of the Environment that perhaps local authorities might relieve rates on people who operate restaurants on a part-time basis in constituencies like Clare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a good local representative, will Deputy Carey say <Col N="1671" /> whether refunds on rates should be given before the potholes are filled?  Where will the priority list start?  These amendments propose the establishment of a temporary special restaurant licence; in other words, seasonal or short-term licences.  Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendments for reasons I explained on Second Stage. The only valid reason for allowing seasonal licences is that the initial fee would be lower than the sum of £3,000.  I impress on Members that this fee is a once-off fee, not an annual one.  That is a very important point.</P>

      <P>This is written into the Bill and if Deputy Taylor wants to strengthen it in any way we will certainly consider an amendment from him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a seasonal licence was taken into consideration when the Bill was being prepared and, as Deputy Barrett and Deputy Kelly said, there is no doubt that the fee of £3,000 would be much higher if seasonal licences could operate on the basis of a given percentage of the full fee.  However, seasonal licences would be inflexible.  It would mean that a person having a six months licence from April to September could not open for Easter if it fell in March and could not open in October if, for some reason, the tourist season was <Col N="1672" /> extended.  After considerable examination of the arguments, including the practical, procedural and operational problems, we cannot accept this group of amendments.  In fairness to Deputy Colley, there is some merit in her arguments and if something could be done to help the smaller licence holders I would be happy to do it.  However, I would not do it in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that other Members have generally spoken against the various amendments.  Deputy Barrett referred to a fear on the part of existing restaurant owners and he thought that a number of temporary restaurants might suddenly mushroom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill states that only bona fide restaurant owners and providers of proper premises and facilities can obtain a licence.  The same criteria would extend to those obtaining a special temporary restaurant licence.  They would already be serving the public in this manner and providing bona fide restaurant facilities.  With regard to the fear that there would be unfair competition in some areas from those who would cream off the profits in the couple of months of the year when tourists would come, many towns close at the end of the season anyway and there would be no question of unfair competition because everybody would be in the same boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley knows that in such cases they are not given any financial relief by way of exemption, at present.  If we were to do that, we would be changing legislation from now until Kingdom come and there would not be restaurant licences for the tourist season this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's fears.  However, they are not a good reason for continuing the discrimination against businessmen and restaurant <Col N="1673" /> owners who are desperately trying to provide a service.  Despite Deputy Kelly's disparaging remarks about the restaurant industry, there is a growing industry which should be helped in any way possible. This Bill would allow us to do that if we seize the opportunity.  By not doing so, we are preventing those who are trying to get started.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the fee of £3,000 is reasonable and that he had regard to those who might have a seasonal trade. Nevertheless, the fee is based on a restaurant which would, in general, be in business for 12 months.  It is unfortunate that we cannot make an allowance for restaurants who are not in that position. Deputy Carey asked what would happen if these extended to full licences.  It would be beneficial as it would show that business was better and that things were expanding.  I would encourage business to look for a full licence at that stage and to pay the full fee then.  For Heaven's sake, let us help them to get off the ground and provide facilities which the public are seeking.  I have no doubt that after we pass the Bill there will be many areas where nobody will take out these licences because they will not be able to afford them.  Those who visit those areas will be denied the facilities.  I am referring to seaside and tourist areas where restaurant owners will not be in a position to take out such a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of observations on what has been suggested.  When considering this section it was a concern of The Workers' Party that the fee of £3,000 was not adequate.  However, following a commitment by the Minister on Second Stage to keep the amount of the fee under constant review we did not table an amendment to it.  The making available of the facility, and the opportunity to retail alcohol, other than wine, by restaurants is a major advancement in the services that restaurants provide.  In my view the once-off fee of £3,000 is, as Deputy Kelly indicated, just about right. That fee may be increased or decreased in the future, depending on how the trend <Col N="1674" /> develops but the concern at the moment is that the existing licence trade may be set at a disadvantage.  If the cause of the amendment is being advanced on the conversations Deputy Colley has had with some restaurant owners who say that they work on a profit margin of 1.5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The conversations were subsequent to my putting down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is my belief that she has been misled.  I do not believe that there is a restaurant in Ireland that works on that type of profit margin.  It would be impossible, as has been hinted on this side of the House.  In any event if that was the position the £3,000 would be quickly written-off against the obvious losses the restaurant was incurring and it would not represent an invasion on the profit margin.  I am aware of a licensed premises in Dublin known as An Béal Bocht but I have not seen too many restaurants borrowing that name.  We must keep this argument in the realm of reality.  From my superficial knowledge of restaurants my impression is that the margins of profit and gain are greater than has been suggested by Deputy Colley.</P>
      <P>In regard to the argument about the short season in some areas I should like to state that while the season may be short it is very generous to those who can avail of it in seaside resorts and so on. On balance the fee fixed is a fair one.  In fact it may be too generous but we can look at that later.  I do not think the House should support Deputy Colley's amendments.</P>

      <P>It is the intention that under the new system for licensing restaurants the take-away type premises will not qualify for licences.  The standard regulations should make that clear.  However, I think it would be desirable to copperfasten that intent by writing it into the definition of a restaurant.

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> In page 5, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;at midday or in the evening, or at midday and in the evening&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;at any time from midday each day&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to bring some sense of reality into the provisions regarding special restaurant licences.  The Bill provides that an applicant who receives a special restaurant licence may serve alcohol during lunchtime and in the evening but not between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  I cannot see any good reason for that restriction and my amendments are intended to remove it and permit restaurants supplying substantial meals to the public to provide alcohol with meals at any time after mid-day. I do not understand the thinking behind restricting the serving of alcohol with meals to the hours mentioned while at the same time the Minister is seeking to remove the `holy hours' from public houses which do not serve meals as the main part of their business.  We could have public houses who serve pub grub, sandwiches and so on serving alcohol throughout the day while a restaurant which is in the business of providing substantial meals all day will be restricted because they will not be permitted to serve alcohol with meals between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for that restriction.  The people I have raised this issue with are puzzled about it.  Tourists travelling on ferries to this country arrive at unusual hours and they may wish to have a glass of beer with their meal after their journey but if they go to a restaurant between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. they will not be served beer.  The whole purpose of the Bill, as I understand it, was to accede to public demand but that will not happen in this case.  There are bona fide restaurants in Dublin who serve substantial lunches or grills throughout the afternoon &mdash; I am not talking about fast food outlets &mdash; and they will be restricted under this provision.  In fact, not alone will they be prevented from serving beer or spirits between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. but they will be obliged to relinquish their existing <Col N="1677" /> wine licence when we adopt this measure and cannot serve wine.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind this and I oppose it very strongly.  I hope the Minister can see reason in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure to what extent my feelings about this matter represent those of my party &mdash; very likely they do not, as usual.  I must confess that this time I find myself strongly in agreement with Deputy Colley, more or less for the reasons she gives but also because on the European Continent, of whose outward tourist trade we enjoy a disgracefully small percentage, people are not psychologically tied to the idea of breakfast, dinner and tea to the extent we are.  It is impossible to get that through the heads of Irish people who when they think of abroad, think of America.  I have been coming and going on the European Continent since I was a student and I spend as much time as I can there.  It is very common to see people eating at various times during the day.  Perhaps some of these people choose to work through what we regard as the dinner hour.  Perhaps they are actually keen enough on their work not to bother going to eat at the times when we find it impossible to carry on with a low blood sugar count. These people suddenly find they get a bit peckish around 4.30 in the afternoon. I have very often seen people take a substantial meal at an hour which my metabolism would rebel against.  To impose our village timetable for eating and drinking on people from Germany and Italy and hope they will come here in numbers ten times greater than they have so far is pitiful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all the understanding and sympathy I have for the Minister in having to deal with the crotchety lobby who have effectively prevented this legislation being enacted for 66 years, I ask him to listen carefully to the points Deputy Colley has made and to ask himself what his reaction would be if he were a busy, overworked man from Wuppertal or Milan who arrived off a ferry or who had business here and worked through the lunch hour, as even Irish people now do, <Col N="1678" /> and suddenly felt like a steak and chips and a pint of stout at around 4.30 p.m. Where is the reason or the morality in this?  I cannot see the reason for the Minister's line except that he has to pacify a lot of people whom it has proved difficult to pacify over the last two generations. They have had a long enough crack of the whip by now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to abolish the period during the afternoon when specially licensed premises cannot serve alcohol and alcohol cannot be consumed in them. It must be remembered that this licence is restrictive in its operation.  The cost reflects that restriction.  The main purpose of the licence is to allow consumption of alcohol with substantial meals at a time when a demand for such a service could reasonably be said to exist.  If the person to whom Deputy Kelly refers feels peckish around 4 o'clock and goes to a restaurant he will not get a substantial meal, which he must have if he is to have alcohol as well.  I suggest that we would probably go somewhere else.  It is normal to assume that the service we are talking about would be provided at lunchtime, teatime and evening.  I do not think the type of restaurant I envisage would be providing substantial meals at 4 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that in Germany or Italy a very large proportion of restaurants close their kitchens at 2.30 p.m. or thereabouts and do not open again until 6 p.m. for reasons of convenience and to give their staff a rest.  It does not suit those restaurants to make a meal between those hours, but that is not true of all of them.  Virtually every continental town of any size with a population over 6,000 or 8,000 will have at the railway station a perfectly run and usually very cheap restaurant operated by private enterprise to whom the national transport company have let out the facilities on a concession, something which CIE should consider in their beautifully built but increasingly dilapidated premises throughout the country.  In the places to <Col N="1679" /> which I am referring it is possible to get a substantial meal from early in the morning until near midnight.  I am not suggesting that people whom it does not suit should be asked to serve meals to come under the benefits of this Bill but those whom it may suit to keep their kitchens open throughout the day ought not to be deprived of this facility.

      <P>This amendment raises an important issue.  Taking with it amendment No. 28 which relates to section 14 delineating the hours, there are a number of questions which concern me about the scheme.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the workings of the licence as it would be issued.  Subsection (1) (b) seems to suggest that a restaurant will have to close between certain hours, even if it is not intended to make alcohol available. A better reading might be that the restaurant could remain open without serving alcohol.</P>

      <P>Immediately there is a problem in terms of policing.  There is no drinking-up time allowed for in the context of the Bill.  We can begin to see almost comical scenes developing where the proprietor will bang the table while his customers are halfway through their meal, telling them it is time to stop drinking. They can continue eating while bottles are being whipped from the table.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly has learned a few tricks from his infrequent visits to Irish restaurants.  We get into the difficulty of all kinds of devices being employed.  We are dealing with a relatively short time in the day.  Is this regime for restaurants enforceable?  A party may arrive into a restaurant at 12.45 p.m. and order a meal.  They may see a party next to them drinking beer in the course of a meal but if they order the same they will <Col N="1680" /> be told they cannot be accommodated because they arrived 15 minutes too late, but if they come back in two hours and 45 minutes they will have better luck.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that this regime will be first, unworkable, secondly, cannot be policed and, thirdly, probably will be the source of more jokes and jibes against our restaurant business than we would care to invite.  On balance, one would have to agree with Deputy Colley's suggestion that it would be better to extend the licence over a continuous period through the day.  I ask the Minister to look again at this proposal and, if it cannot be immediately acceded to, to look at the whole question before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what regulations exist with regard to drinking up? What is the position if a person embarks on a meal, is served, for example, with beer to accompany the meal and crosses over the time limit?  Is he or she to be allowed finish that meal?  How is it proposed to deal not just with the problem of decanting drink into teapots but of people taking their time over their meals and drink and finding themselves left with something to consume over the time period?  Those are all practical problems that spring immediately to mind.  Does the Minister seriously believe they can be overcome in the way proposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are both reasonable and sensible.  It should be a broad general principle that what we enact in this House is reasonably capable of being enforced and the House should have a good measure of confidence that it will be enforced.  The restrictions imposed here, I agree with Deputy McCartan, do not have the remotest likelihood or probability of being enforced, except perhaps on a very odd occasion.  I cannot visualise the spectacle of Garda raids on restaurant premises to see if wine is being consumed between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  The measure, allegedly, is being introduced largely for continental tourists and the Minister for Tourism and Transport is given a major role in this.  Such <Col N="1681" /> people have their lunches late in the afternoon. One sees lunches going on well after 3 p.m. in restaurants on the Continent and they would expect to find the same happening on their holidays in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The overall imprimatur, the main thrust running through the Bill is that such drinking must be in conjunction with a substantial meal.  I would have thought that a sufficient condition to satisfy any reasonable requirements that there would be no abuse, providing undue or unfair competition with the public houses.  The idea of having a cut-off point at 3 p.m. and reinstatement at 6 p.m. has no reality in this context.  One cannot compare such a situation with a pub that has a closing time at the end of the day, with Garda presence, or whatever.</P>
      <P>This legislation will not be enforced and will be a joke.  It will appear, to people who know of the law, to be ridiculous and we should not deliberately bring the law into disrepute and make it a laughing stock.  I cannot foresee prosecutions being brought for breach of the regulations.  The gardaí have much more important functions to perform.  There are much heavier demands on their time than seeing if some hapless, bewildered Frenchman is having a glass of beer while finishing his lunch at 3.30 p.m.  We should not expect the gardaí to carry out that kind of activity.  I appeal to the Minister to be reasonable about this.  The practicalities are that it will not be enforced or be enforceable.  Why enact it into law in those circumstances?</P>

      <P>There seems to be an impression that tourists coming to this country cannot be served alcohol at certain times, that we are backward and have not the facilities that are available on the Continent.  Like many others in this House, I have been on the Continent and the type of restaurant envisaged in the special restaurant licence do not exist there.  There are no pubs as we know them on the Continent but there are places outside which people can sit and where drink is served without having to have a meal.  That really is a pub.  What <Col N="1682" /> I envisage in connection with this special restaurant licence is a genuine restaurant. Pubs will still be able to serve drink, meals and snacks, as will hotels.</P>
      <P>The impression is also given that there are many thousands of people waiting with bated breath for us to change our licensing laws so that they can rush into Ireland as tourists.  I do not accept that at all.  The tourists are being catered for at present and will be in the future.  Changes will take place.  Licensing laws of their very nature, because of changing ways of business, will need to be regularly updated.  The implementation of the Bill, in itself, will prove whether the genuine restaurant will be in business or whether there will be abuse of this special restaurant licence.  Time should be allowed to see if this legislation will work.  We are endeavouring to provide restaurants with a special restaurant licence.  We are not trying to deprive people of a having a drink at certain times during the day; they can already do that.  I may be wrong, but the type of restaurant I can see getting this special restaurant licence does not open for business at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m.</P>

      <P>They may be.  At 3.30 p.m. there are very few people in restaurants which I envisage getting this type of licence.  If others want to get a licence they can get an ordinary publican's licence or a full restaurant licence. We are talking about special restaurant licences.  Hotels have to employ staff, pay PRSI, rates, overheads and all the rest and provide the service.  There are, I understand, over 10,000 pubs in the country and in many rural parts of Ireland publicans are struggling for an existence. This has nothing to do with pressure groups or lobby groups.  I can make up my own mind about what views to take on board from various interest groups. People are entitled to make points and points have been made to me over the past two or three weeks that I must admit I had not thought about but that I am thinking about now.  These people are <Col N="1683" /> providing an essential service for a tourist industry, giving employment, paying substantial amounts of money for their property and business and for licensing.  They are catering very well for the tourist industry and the home industry.  They feel there is a danger &mdash; and there is &mdash; that someone, for a once-off payment of £3,000, can get a licence to remain open all day for the sale of alcohol.  One must take that into account in introducing something new.</P>
      <P>The kind of restaurant I envisage being entitled to get one of these licences by and large, even in the city of Dublin, is not open for business at 4 or 5 o'clock. They open for a certain period.  Between 12 noon and 3 p.m. they close and they are open again at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. in the evening.  There are other café-type restaurants who provide a service throughout the day but they are not covered under this special restaurant licence.  To compare it with the Continent is not to compare like with like.  The sort of restaurant one gets on the Continent is our type of pub and it is not fair to say that one can go on the Continent and get a drink but that one cannot get one here. One can get a drink here in a pub, in an hotel in the same way as one can on the Continent.  The sort of restaurant we are talking about here does not open for business on the Continent at 4 pm.m or 5 p.m. in the afternoon.  It is wrong to say that there is an urgent need for the sake of the tourists to start giving licences to enable restaurants to serve drink all day. We have to take into account that there are other people in business who have made a heavy investment and who give a lot of permanent employment throughout the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A balance has been struck here and, as Deputy Kelly says, there is nothing wrong with the Minister coming back in 12 months or two years if <Col N="1684" /> times change, if there is a gap in the market and people cannot get a service. In that event we should change the law but we should first see how this works bearing in mind that we are not selling ourselves short as we are providing a very good service to tourists.  The hoteliers and publicans have done an excellent job for the tourist industry and we should not allow it to go abroad that we feel that we are not catering for tourists.  We should remember that we are talking about special restaurant licences for special premises.</P>

      <P>I would like to answer the points which have been brought up and I appeal to the Minister in regard to these amendments to recognise that life in Ireland has changed.  I do not look for changes because a horde of tourists are arriving on our doorsteps demanding change.  The reality is that life has changed.  People do not eat their dinner in the middle of the day, their tea in the evening and their breakfast in the morning, without any change in routine. There is a different emphasis in Ireland on eating out nowadays.  Whether the person eating out is a tourist, Irish or foreign, or whether he is simply eating out in the course of his normal daily life, it is obvious that life has changed.  Some people work on shift or only eat two meals a day.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise that in this Bill, and not to put it off for another 12 months or two years so that we miss this opportunity and have something in place that we do not need or want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, as Deputy Barrett said, that there are many public houses who provide snacks that, in Cork and Dublin, after the passage of this Bill will be open during the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; so that there will be no break in service.  I understand they have put a lot of investment into their businesses, but so have the people who own restaurants.  I have withdrawn the amendment concerning the temporary restaurant licences, so we are left with those who are in business all year.  We must try to develop the industry.  One of the major purposes of this Bill is to <Col N="1685" /> develop the tourist industry and to allow restaurants to be in existence that would otherwise find it very hard to exist.  The vintners are mistaken in seeing this as a direct threat to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Barrett that the type of restaurant envisaged in this Bill is one which will serve a high class meal. It will be a bona fide restaurant.  There will not be a proliferation of those.  Not every restaurant will come within the definition in the Bill.  The vintners are mistaken in trying to restrict the development of this business.  It is a fact that the public houses are offering a different service to that of restaurants.  The question at issue is not whether one can obtain a drink between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. but whether one can obtain a meal with a drink between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  After all, the purpose of this part of the Bill is to allow alcohol to be consumed with meals.  We are inhibiting ourselves and restricting the growth of a sector of the market which provides for tourists whether they be Irish or foreign if we prevent restaurants from serving drink between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>Some restaurant owners are saying they will lose 1,000 hours trading in a year which they would not lose if they were trading on the same basis in the restricted hours.  That is not right. Deputy Barrett said they could remain as they are at present with a restaurant certificate, but the purpose of this Bill is to allow bona fide restaurants which serve a high standard meal to serve alcohol with their meals.  Therefore, why restrict them to a wine licence if the purpose of the Bill is to do otherwise?</P>
    <P>In relation to enforceability of this rule, we should have regard to a situation which could easily arise where alcohol could be sold for consumption on the premises before 3 p.m. with a substantial meal, and a licensee could also sell alcohol after 3 p.m. with a meal.  A garda could come in at 3.45 p.m. and find two tables with two sets of drinks one of which was sold before 3 p.m. and one sold after 3 p.m. both for consumption with a meal. How will that garda know which was which?  It simply is not enforceable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> I appeal to the Minister to be reasonable and farsighted in regard to this amendment and to recognise that what we are about here is not protecting one version of the licensed trade from another.  We are trying to provide the basis for the development of an industry and one industry will not cut across the other.  The public houses will certainly provide snacks, pub grub, etc. with alcohol between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. but the purpose of this part of the Bill is to allow alcohol with substantial meals and if someone wants a substantial meal between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. he simply will not be able to have one with alcohol.  That is a grave mistake and it is unnecessary.  It will not affect the pubs.  If somebody wants a snack he will go to a pub.  If somebody wants to have a full meal they will go to a restaurant and they should be entitled to have a beer or a gin and tonic before having that meal.  It is perfectly reasonable that they would be allowed do so.  Let us say again that I do not think there is any conflict between the two divisions in the licensed trade.</P>

      <P>Let me sound a word of caution.  Deputy Colley referred to the development of the industry but this Bill, although in one sense concerned with the development of the industry, is also geared towards curtailing the abuses which exist at present.  On Second Stage I referred to the increase in the number of clubs and I sound a word of caution when people speak about the development of the industry.  What are we developing?  I think we should concentrate on curtailing the abuses which exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The rationale behind this part of the Bill is to permit restaurants to serve drink with meals yet because of the restrictive hours outlined in the Bill I think we are taking an illogical stance in that a restaurant would be able to serve drink with substantial meals between 12.30 p.m. and 3 p.m. and between 6 p.m. and 12.30 a.m. but would not be allowed serve drink with substantial meals between 3 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.  This <Col N="1687" /> is crazy and just does not stand up to reason.  As other Deputies have said, this provision will result in derisory situations so far as enforcement is concerned.  For instance, subsection (2) of section 14 would apply the provisions of the Act of 1927 relating to prohibited hours and I would like to hear the Minister tell us how he would see those provisions impacting on restaurants which have special restaurant certificates.  Of course, the provisions of the 1927 Act also enable members of the Garda Síochána to go into a restaurant and demand names and addresses.  It is odd that a person would be legally able to have a drink when eating his joint at 3 p.m. and yet when having his pudding at 3.10 p.m. he would be breaking the law by having a drink also and could have his name and address taken by a garda.  As Deputy Seán Barrett has said, there are some restaurants who may not engage in business during the afternoon but for those restaurants who do want to engage in business all through the day, why not let them serve drink with meals at whatever time they have customers wanting to be served with meals?</P>

Is that correct?  The reason I ask the question is because the answer would affect my attitude towards section 9 which outlines the proposed cost, £3,000, for a special restaurant licence.  As I understand it, the reason that amount is so low is to enable us to cater for restaurants which would only open during the tourist season.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us why it would be necessary for restaurants to close in the middle of the day? I am more concerned that they would be allowed to stay open late at night.  Under this Bill, they would be allowed to stay open longer than public houses.  Having listened to Deputy Colley I think too much emphasis is placed on the consumption of drink.  I always understood that a restaurant was a place where someone went if they wanted to have a meal. In this Bill the Minister is proposing to do away with the `holy hour' so if someone wants to have a drink, surely the place to go is a public house.  There are those who do like a drink with their meals but I do not think, as Deputy Colley tried to argue, that there is a great public demand to have drink served in restaurants and I would like the Minister to tell us why it would be necessary for restaurants to close for a period during the middle of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with what the previous speaker, Deputy Michael Barrett, has said, that it is likely that there would not be a great demand for what is being sought in the amendment but that is a reason for acceding to the amendment.  I think it should be agreed to.  If we are going to establish the principle in this Bill that when you have a substantial meal you will also be able to have a glass of beer, let us accept that principle and provide that a person can have a glass of beer with a meal at 2 p.m., 3 p.m., or any other time.  Deputy Barrett made the point that most restaurants close during certain hours anyway.  That is fair enough.  If they are closed a person would not be able to be served with a meal, a glass of beer or a glass of wine so the problem would not arise.  In the case <Col N="1689" /> of someone who starts to eat lunch at 2 p.m. or 2.30 p.m. which, even for Irish people is by no means unusual, they could be in trouble after half an hour if they were to have a glass of beer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett gave as one reason for not acceding to the amendment the fact that the business of so many publicans could be affected.  That is one line of argument which is divorced from the principle contained in this Bill.  Quite frankly, I do not think it is likely or probable that the relatively minor alteration in the principle which is being proposed in this amendment is going to affect publicans up and down the country or the people who work for them.  It seems to me that the amendment is fair and reasonable.</P>

      <P>I would like to follow on the point which was made by Deputy Lynch who referred to the curtailing of abuses.  Any member of the Garda Síochána responsible for enforcing the licensing laws would tell you that drinkers have used restaurants, because of their special licences, to continue drinking.  While I can see the point which has been made on the other side of the House in relation to opening hours in the afternoon I think there would be some abuse and that, therefore, we would have to move cautiously in this regard.  These special restaurant licences could be purchased for the very small sum of £3,000.  A publican's licence on the open market would be worth about £10,000 so if I were a publican I would be very aggrieved if restaurants were to be allowed to stay open for more hours of the day than a publican albeit with the substantial meal provision.  As previous speakers have pointed out, restaurants are places where people go to if they want to have a meal but not necessarily a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pursue the argument advanced by Deputy Taylor that it would be impossible to police a 3 o'clock closure.  Deputy Cooney made the same point.  I would contend that the difficulty of so ensuring will be much greater at 12.30 a.m.  How <Col N="1690" /> is one to go into a restaurant at 12.30 in the morning and get people out?  I suggest that the real difficulty will not arise at 3 o'clock in the afternoon but rather at 12.30 in the morning.  The majority of people frequenting the types of restaurants that will be granted these types of licences will be people who eat late in the evening.  The demand or market for lunches in these types of restaurants is dying.  The majority of people I know of, business people and so on, do not eat heavy lunches in the day any longer: it is a thing of the past and people eat snacks and so on.  Either we have licensing laws or we do not but there must be a cut-off time and whenever one chooses to have that cut-off time, one will experience difficulty in implementing the provisions of the law.  I would say to Deputy Taylor that there will be more difficulty experiencing in trying to do so in 12.30 in the morning.</P>
      <P>This is not a party political issue.  It is an endeavour to achieve a balance.  One must recognise that when one is introducing something new, one is endeavouring to fit into an existing pattern and it will be extremely difficult to get across to the public in general exactly what will happen.</P>
      <P>What we are doing here, in terms of the special restaurant licence is reasonable.  If circumstances change in the future, then let us change the provisions.  I want to know whether Deputy Taylor has a solution to the difficulties that will arise at 12.30 in the morning, seeing that he has pointed out all the difficulties that will arise at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a few more words on this point.  The nub of the matter has been stated, not for the first time, by Deputy Taylor a minute ago.  The point of the change which this House is making, about 66 years later than it first had jurisdiction to make it, is to enable people have a drink whenever they are having a substantial meal in a restaurant.  That is the main purpose.  That purpose is being, admittedly marginally only, but from the point of view of logic and morality &mdash; if there is any morality in this area &mdash; indefensibly and irritatingly qualified by the Minister's section.  It is not really a question of merely trying to suit tourists. I am not going to say anything disparaging or anything of that sort at all but I believe that a lot of continental tourists would not regard their gastronomic experience in this country as one of the high points of their visit.  However, without unduly stressing that point, it is not really a question of trying to provide a service for tourists.  It may even be a question of trying to haul ourselves into Europe, into the European patterns in which we seem to be interested only from the point of view of it providing a market for our surplus bullocks and butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something to be said for trying to adapt our system of life and even our tastes to those of our neighbours, of course not to the point of abandoning things that we like eating and drinking, of course I do not mean that, but we should realise that there is such a thing as a choice, that it is possible to have a meal consisting of a relatively modest collection of food on a single plate and not to go through four or five courses, finishing with tea or coffee and some biscuits, that would sink a battleship, which is the perception of many Irish people of a meal in a restaurant.  Indeed, there are many restaurants which will not deliver a single dish on a single plate and let one go with a good heart.  They will <Col N="1692" /> feel that somehow they have been done down if that is all one is having.</P>
    <P>It may appear something easy to make fun of but our patterns in this regard are like almost everything else, derived from our immediate neighbours, the British, who themselves have very little to teach anyone when it comes to food, very little, much though I respect them in many other areas.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for endeavouring to offer Irish people &mdash; leave alone the tourists &mdash; a sight of and the possibility of the benefit of a different mode of eating out, a different mode of eating outside their own homes.  Deputy Colley is the only woman present but no doubt there are plenty of other women in the House who would appreciate this point &mdash; that any such evolution which will simplify, cheapen and rid of complications, financial or otherwise, access to private enterprise-provided food in places of public resort will be a considerable enhancement of the lifestyle of ordinary Irish women.  These things are important and have nothing to do with tourists.</P>
    <P>If we are going to think about catering for tourists, the point I am endeavouring to make becomes a great deal more important because, for tourists, certainly those from central and southern Europe &mdash; where the climate is said to insulate its inhabitants physiologically against excessive consumption of drink, against the drink culture obtaining here &mdash; then it should be remembered that one is catering for a man or woman to whom eating and drinking are part of the same total experience.  It is very hard to explain to a continental, who himself would not take much to drink, who would take very little to drink by ordinary Irish standards &mdash; by my standards or those of the kinds of people I know, very little &mdash; that there are such people in this country as total abstainers, that there is such a movement here as the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, the roots of which lie in an effort to drag people out of the degradation to which excessive indulgence in alcohol had thrown them at the end of <Col N="1693" /> the 18th or beginning of the 19th centuries. That part of our existence will be completely strange to the continental tourist.  He would not understand the sort of official terror of drink, which is officially present here, for the past 66 years.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing a story &mdash; I will let the House hear it for what it is worth &mdash; I cannot swear that it is true but I heard it as being true when I was a student.  I was told that the late Pope Pious XII received a pilgrimage formed of a large number of members of the Garda Síochána who had this in common, they were all members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  I was told that His Holiness had been mistakenly briefed by monsignori in the Vatican who had mistakenly misunderstood what the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was all about so that, when the Pontiff came to address the teetotal policemen, at Castle Gondolfo, or wherever it was, he read them a script in which he deplored and sympathised with their unfortunate malady which deprived them of one of the great gifts of God's bounty on earth and made it impossible for them to enjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Admittedly, the amendment has had a fair amount of hop; it has been going for about an hour.  But it is important to make this point, that there is a sort of official terror in this country which leads us to have this battery of licensing laws.  I believe we have more complicated licensing laws than any other country in western Europe except the British who have even loonier laws. There, it is a sin to have a drink between 2.30 in the afternoon and 6 o'clock in the evening in an ordinary pub, at least it <Col N="1694" /> appears to be, and it must be a moral-based reason because there is no practical reason against it I can think of.</P>
      <P>If we are talking either about tourism or about giving our people an opportunity of seeing other modes of existence, the very modes of the Continent into which we should be seeking integration at more levels than butter and bullocks, then this kind of legislation constitutes quite an important element.  We must understand that other people see these things differently and that we might get some benefit from allowing our people to do so.</P>

      <P>These amendments already have helped to drag us down a road never intended to be taken when the provisions of this Bill were being considered. Deputy Colley should recognise that what she is endeavouring to do is to meet a demand that does not exist at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that it does not exist at present.  I have had, as have other Members of the Oireachtas, long discussions with the various groups involved in the liquor laws over a lengthy period of time.  At no stage was there any substantial case made, with any degree of credibility, that such a demand existed at present, or that restaurants could not function or provide substantial meals between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the afternoon unless they were allowed to sell drink.  If there is a demand there it is certainly a matter that should be looked at.  If it can be shown after the first season of operation that there is a demand there I will certainly be prepared to look at it. I hope that whoever is Minister for Justice at the time will have a look at it, and I would encourage him to do so.  Certainly the demand is not there as of now and there is no point in saying there is a demand, that the tourists who are going to come in by the shipload &mdash; and we hope they will &mdash; will not be satisfied if they cannot have beer with their meals. That is not so because, as Deputy John Kelly said earlier, if somebody is peckish <Col N="1695" /> at 4 p.m. there are good meals available in many establishments which can meet the needs of those people.</P>
      <P>In an effort to make a case for the amendment the argument was made that enforceability would not be possible.  I say that it will be possible, the same as it is possible in any other area where enforceability is to take place, and it takes place right across the board.  Would the argument that one cannot enforce the law at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. apply even more so, as Deputy Barrett said, at 12 a.m.?  If we are to have enforceability then we are going to have it.  We have to remember that licences by their very nature are restrictive.  I do not think it is any mystery that when special restaurant licences were introduced in Northern Ireland at the beginning there was great abuse of the system and in a number of instances a new type of pub flourished in a very short period of time.  I do not think anybody here wants a new type of pub flourishing for any reason.  That is something we want to try to prevent but if, as Deputy Colley said, a case can be made to show us that there is a demand for the type of service she wants given as of now that will be considered down along the line.</P>

Of course it has.  I think many Members of this House know that the number of Deputies who go to the restaurant for their mid-day meal has diminished considerably.  Most <Col N="1696" /> people take a snack in the middle of the day and not a substantial meal, and I can assure the House that it has nothing to do with the prices in the restaurant.  Of course life is changing and I recognise that it is.</P>

      <P>With regard to enforceability, there is a problem with enforceability in areas other than the one we are dealing with here.  The question of enforceability arises when gardaí are not given permission to enter certain buildings to see what is going on there.  That is a matter we will be talking about during the course of this debate.  I am trying to frame an amendment to deal with that and if I do not have it on Committee Stage I will certainly have it on Report Stage. Enforceability is a difficult issue and it is something we have to try to deal with. Licences allow people to work under certain conditions and there are restrictions on these licences.  I want to say to Deputy Colley and to the House that if after this season I am satisfied there is a need to meet the point raised by the Deputy I will not wait for 12 months to do so; I will come back in September or October so that the matter can be considered by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the basic arguments advanced by the vintners' trade in submissions made to us throughout the <Col N="1697" /> debate on the Bill, has been that a balance has to be drawn and there has to be uniformity of conditions applying to restaurant licences on the one hand and to licensed vintners on the other hand. This is one of the areas where there is a major departure from uniformity.  I think the point was made by Deputy Ahern that if we agreed to this amendment the restaurants could operate for longer hours.  In fact, it would not amount to that because a restaurant licence starts from 12.30 p.m. onwards.  The granting to them of three hours from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. would not mean, because they close at 12.30 a.m. that they would have longer hours.  If anything, the advantage, to within an hour, would still be with the licensed premises.</P>
      <P>I believe the argument advanced that there is not a real demand for this, or that it would affect so very few people &mdash; Deputy Barrett made this point and the Minister borrowed it from him &mdash; makes the case for the amendment.  It will not mean a major disruption of trade between the licensed vintners on the one hand and the restaurant trade on the other hand but against that it will introduce a degree of uniformity and consistency to the principle that if and when a person sits down to consume a meal at whatever hour &mdash; and the Minister made our case by suggesting that eating patterns are changing and people do not have three set meals at particular hours of the day &mdash; the basic point has to be that it is a &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo;.  That being so, I urge the Minister to look again at the amendment.  If he is prepared to come back in six to nine months, I say to him that he should not impose that burden on himself or on a busy Government.  He should consider how small a change this represents and, borrowing both his and Deputy Barrett's point, because it will affect so few people he should amend the law at this stage and allow it to run in a uniform consistent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make that point also because, as has been said already, hotels can provide a meal with alcohol of whatever sort at any time of the day.  We do not hear arguments being advanced that that is <Col N="1698" /> being abused or that it represents a serious incursion on the licensed trade at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They have their own licences.  They are part of the licensed trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about hotels is that they present a certain atmosphere that attracts people who want to sit down at leisure for a period of time to consume a substantial meal and have an alcoholic beverage with it.  They are a different type of clientele from those who like to have recourse to pubs.  The pub will always have its intrinsic attractions and granting facilities to restaurants and hotels will not seriously invade on that but it is a consideration.</P>
      <P>I can only speak from my experience of Dublin but in Dublin there are two phenomena developing.  On the one hand there are a number of restaurants that have bought pub licences and have coupled them, and they can and will be able to continue as restaurants-cum-pubs providing substantial or other meals and any kind of alcoholic beverage throughout the licensing hours of the day.  On the other hand, there are also a number of pubs that have developed a lucrative restaurant business in conjunction with their pub business.  So, slowly building up in Dublin are premises that either started out as restaurants and acquired pub licences or started out as pubs and have developed restaurant businesses and are now in a position where they can provide the meals and the alcohol throughout the full pub licensing hours.  They will still be there irrespective of whatever we enact in the legislation here today and we will have that disparity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a further non-uniformity that will exist in the licensing laws and uniformity is something we should work towards in the licensing trade generally.  Pubs, restaurants and hotels each have their own intrinsic atmosphere and attraction that will balance out in time and will not seriously infringe on each other.  For that reason, rather than seeking to come back <Col N="1699" /> in six to nine months time, we should look at it now.</P>
    <P>The argument was made that the case was not made by restaurateurs or their representatives in meeting with the Ministers but they are not legislators.  We are here to make legislation that will work and to improve on it as presented.  We are dealing today with a significant advance on the somewhat archaic licensing laws in this area.  We are merely suggesting that the Minister could, in a small way, make the legislation even more workable.  I do not believe that the proposal would represent an invasion on the trade of vintners or on the moral fabric of those who do not seek to drink at meal times.  I would ask the Minister to give this a fresh thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are pushing this amendment are missing the whole point of Part II of the Bill.  This was a special measure brought in as a result of pressure from restaurateurs in reasonably high-class restaurants whose customers asked for this facility.  These restaurants are open mostly at night time. Subsequently, these restaurants began to build up a lunch time trade because of the huge increase in the pub restaurant lunchtime trade, mainly in the city areas. This is a special measure mainly to facilitate the people who run high-class restaurants. While I can see the point that is being made in relation to the middle of the afternoon, as the Minister has said there is no demand at present in that regard; the demand is late at night and perhaps around lunch time but at no other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is no demand for substantial meals at midday.  I am a former member of the joint services committee which was faced with debt and decided to establish a self-service restaurant here because of the lack of demand for the substantial meal that was served in the restaurant.  Anyone going into the Dáil restaurant during the day will notice that very few people drink during midday <Col N="1700" /> meals.  Deputy Colley is over-emphasising the need for drink.  There is not a great demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is about allowing certain forms of alcohol to be sold in restaurants in conjunction with meals. We can huff and puff about property rights and vested interests but the reality is that this measure is designed to allow bona fide up-market restaurants to serve liquor such as beer and spirits with meals.</P>
      <P>A publican who has a licence can serve these spirits and beers with a meal at any time of the day under this legislation so there is nothing wrong with it in principle. To say that there is no demand is no reason that it should not be extended to bona fide restaurants.  What is the logic behind saying that a publican can do it but a high-class restaurant cannot?  One can have a low class meal or even a bun or a bread roll with one's spirits or beer all day in a pub under the legislation as it will end up if the Minister's Bill goes through unamended yet a reasonably high-class restaurant which opts to serve beer or spirits will be prevented from doing so during three hours in the afternoon. That is totally illogical.  What about a restaurant which decides to stay open all afternoon and not to apply for one of these special licences?  It will be allowed to continue to serve wine all afternoon with meals.  Restaurants do not have to opt into this new system.</P>
      <P>So now we have three forms of institution under this Bill if it goes through unamended.  We will have pubs serving low or high-class meals entitled to sell beer and spirits all day; we will have restaurants, low or high-class, able to sell wine with a meal all day and there will be a new, hybrid form of institution, a high-class restaurant approved by Bord Fáilte, which must stop serving any form of alcohol during three hours in the afternoon because only up to that time and after it is it entitled to sell beer and spirits in conjunction with a meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anybody honestly say that creating three new institutions is a logical way to reform our laws?  We are saying effectively to those who apply for these special <Col N="1701" /> licences that the downside, the legislative catch, is that if they go into the business of serving hard liquor with meals they will have to desist from all alcohol sales during three hours in the afternoon.  That is just stupid legislation.  It is being enacted, not because we think it is desirable &mdash; if we did think it was desirable to stop the sale of alcohol with meals during the afternoon we would stop publicans from doing so &mdash; not because we think there is too much drinking in conjunction with meals in the afternoon because restaurants at the moment can serve wine and fortified wines and so on with meals at any hour of the day, but because we want to assuage the publicans' lobby in that we are giving away some of what they consider to be a monopoly right but are putting a catch in which will mean that those who take it up will find they are obstructed, that it will not be a licence to print money, it will look entirely illogical but it will see the publicans' lobby right.  That is what we are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The licensing laws were not designed to create monopoly rights for anybody.  They were designed to limit the amount of alcohol that was sold and not to create property rights for publicans in the piece of paper which their licence represents.  They have &mdash; and it would be idiotic to suggest that it is not the case &mdash; a monopoly value and the vintners as a group have decided to protect that monopoly value because they put an investment into those licences.  They were never intended to create private monopolies or to confer on publicans a property right.  This is a shabby exercise.  We are making a silly illogical gesture which nobody in their right mind would think up from first principles to publicans in order to assuage <Col N="1702" /> their feelings that their property rights are being interfered with.</P>

      <P>They are a strong lobby in this House and they are a fine group of men but on this occasion the Minister is throwing them a very fine bone to chew on as a consolation prize.  I wish we would not put ourselves through this absurd procedure of enacting laws and throwing bones at interest groups just to keep them quiet.  It will not affect the publicans as a group.  Where there are two restaurants, one which does not offer the new special licence and one which does, both of them will be conducting business on a street and one, because it has the right to serve spirits as liquor and beer with meals, will have to close down and stop serving alcohol for three hours in the afternoon.  The other restaurant, which has not opted for the new licence, will continue to serve wine during the entire afternoon.  A pub up the road will be serving fantastic meals with all kinds of liquors available all day and the publican's interest will, in the last analysis, not be protected.  I am suggesting that this is nonsensical legislation. We should not go along with it.  It is designed as a consolation prize for the vintners and it is making fools of us, as legislators, in this House.  I ask the Minister to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell referred to monopolies and strong lobbies from the vintners but what has not been mentioned here today is the responsibility that goes with the holding of a licence.  I think that Members in this House would agree that when the family publican held that responsibility almost solely down through the years we did not have the problems we have today.  I would be very worried if we were to pass legislation that would lead to an escalation of those problems.  The responsibility that goes with the holding of a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor must be respected.  We have almost <Col N="1703" /> reached a position in this country today where no law is enforceable with regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor.  We have a law in existence at present which is impossible to comply with and impossible to implement.  The Minister has taken a very brave and courageous step in introducing this legislation.  While I do not want to see curtailment in any particular sector that would be seen as irresponsible, at the same time I must warn the House that grave responsibility rests on the shoulders of anyone who applies for a licence.  It was mentioned here that good class restaurants are applying for licences.  I know, on good grounds, that many restaurants which I expected would apply for licences, will not apply for licences because they are in the food business.</P>

In my final appeal I would like to remind the Minister that on Second Stage he indicated that he would be more than willing to accept reasonable amendments to the Bill, and, I would submit that my amendments come within that description.  They are reasonable and logical amendments and are in keeping with the spirit of the Bill which is to allow alcohol in the form of spirits or beer to be served with substantial meals.  If we remind ourselves of what Deputy McDowell said about the other forms of restaurants and pubs which will be serving food and alcohol throughout the day, it is absolutely anomalous to restrict these types of restaurants to the hours outside of 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment because it is very reasonable and it is of the type, I would submit, that <Col N="1704" /> on Second Stage he said he would be willing to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the abuse factor that has been mentioned by a number of businesses.  Possibly there is no other business that is more subject to abuse than the licensed trade and the practicalities of policing the licensed trade are immense.  My colleague, Deputy Ahern, applied for this licence and all I can say is that I hope that that will be the case.  I know that is the spirit of this legislation and that is the Minister's intention but down the line from now I hope we will not see glamorised fish and chip shops acquiring this type of licence for the paltry sum of £3,000.  We have referred to the lobby of the vintners who have served this country and the trade for a long number of years.  During recent years family owned businesses have been at the pin of their collars to exist and keep the business going.  We have some excellent amendments before us but I would not put this one in that category.  That is all I would like to say except that I want to highlight the abuse factor.  I am worried about that aspect of this legislation and the difficulties which will be presented in terms of policing the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jacob used a formula which I remember using in the same sense and with the same opinions behind it when I was Minister with responsibility for Tourism and when I was doing my best in that shortlived Government to get this legislation into this House.  I did not have any success nor did any other Minister, until the present one, for the last 66 years have any success in this regard. There is a possibility that the fish and chip syndrome or what would now be called the fast food joint would get into the position of being able to compete with publicans of the traditional kind.  I share Deputy Jacob's views about that but I do not think this legislation in general will have that effect.  I would have understood that the expression &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo; did not cover such things. Of course, it will be left to the District Court and, I suppose, the High Court <Col N="1705" /> ultimately to make a decision about that and maybe the High Court will decide that a plate of fish and chips is a substantial meal.  Many a time I have lunched on that just by itself and it would be substantial enough for most people, but probably the legislation will not be so understood.</P>
      <P>The other point Deputy Jacob makes in the context of Deputy Colley's amendment is one I would have more difficulty in accepting.  First of all, I agree with the idea of the family-run business as a very important part of Irish society and we should have a special eye to trying to help family run businesses.  That is why, in a general way, while trying to help the consumer, I am against seeing the retail trade in any shape or form gobbled up by huge, impersonal multiples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family vintner has had difficulty down the years but probably that springs from a conjunction of two factors for which the restaurant trade should not be asked to pay.  One is there are simply too many public houses in the country.  That fact, which was notorious at the end of the last century, was the factor responsible for inspiring the 1902 licensing law which prevented any more licences being <Col N="1706" /> offered unless other ones were extinguished. The other factor is the crushing extent to which the State relies for income on excise imposed on liquor.</P>
    <P>These two factors unquestionably must weigh very heavily on the small family vintner who is competing with perhaps too many other businesses in the same street, compared with what it would be in some other country in these latitudes, and he is competing with a product which is becoming almost unaffordable &mdash; or many parts of it are becoming unaffordable &mdash; for so many people.  I sympathise very strongly with that point of view, but I am damned if I can see why the restaurant trade &mdash; or the tourist industry which to some extent depends on the restaurant trade being conducted in a reasonably internationally recognisable way &mdash; should be penalised for it or made somehow to prop up the weak situation which the Deputy described.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 33, after &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which may be designated in size by the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to control the waiting area of the restaurant given that the waiting area will be licensed under the new arrangements.  Section 6 defines it as an area set aside as a waiting area in a restaurant for persons intending to have a meal in the restaurant.  Within that definition, there is no indication as to the size of the waiting area, how large it should be and what ratio it should bear to the size of the restaurant so it is open to abuse.  Most restaurants licensed under this section would not wish to abuse the provision but some of them might attempt to extend the meaning of the waiting area and to have it larger than the restaurant.  It would be reasonable to look for some delineation.</P>
      <P>My amendment suggests that Bord Fáilte should, in their inspection, have regard to the size of the waiting area in relation to the restaurant, have the power to say that it is too large and that they could not certify the restaurant in its present form.  I am open to other suggestions as to how we can cope with this problem but we should adhere to the principle behind the amendment, that there should be some regulation concerning the waiting area in a restaurant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that there should be a waiting area in a restaurant.  It is quite reasonable for a person to be able to relax with a pre-dinner drink before moving to <Col N="1709" /> the table for a meal.  That is what the public want and we should accede to that wish but we should guard against any abuses of such a facility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 46 because section 16 (1) states that a restaurant in respect of which a special restaurant licence has been granted under this Act shall not contain a bar.  The definition of a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; contained in section 2 is: &ldquo;bar&rdquo; means any open bar &mdash; that is a circular definition and in my view is not a definition at all &mdash; or any part of a licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and shall include any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public.  On that wording an ante room to a restaurant would, inevitably, come within the definition of &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.  All restaurants would have an area where they would keep the drink and be serving gins and tonics and aperitifs to the customers.  It would be part of a licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor because it would not be the restaurant but the ante-room to it where people would be having their pre-meal drink.  Consequently, there will be a conflict between that definition and the requirement of section 16 (1), that a restaurant shall not contain a bar.  A <Col N="1710" />&ldquo;bar&rdquo;, as defined, inevitably, means the normal type of ante-room that would be outside a restaurant and I tabled amendment No. 46 to provide that the ante-room of a restaurant should not be deemed to be a &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled my amendment for the same reason that Deputy Colley did, to tighten up on the definition of a waiting area.  I have no doubt that abuses could creep in in relation to the designated waiting area.  The words I have proposed inserting, &ldquo;the purpose of which is solely to accommodate persons who are waiting bona fide to have a meal in the said restaurant&rdquo;, will overcome the difficulty.  The Minister may say that my amendment is not necessary because I understand that the regulations to be made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport will incorporate a provision in relation to the waiting area.  However, it would be worth while accepting my amendment so that there will not be any ambiguity as to what is meant by a waiting area.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody will object to a restaurant having a waiting area where people can wait on a table and have a drink.  However, like many provisions in our licensing laws, there may be a lot of abuse of that.  A waiting area inspected by Bord Fáilte may be extended later to cater for a big number of people who could not possibly be accommodated in the restaurant area.  Those people could be held to be legally entitled to drink on the premises while in the waiting area and it would be impossible to check that. For that reason we should clearly define what we mean by &ldquo;a waiting area&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any special preference between the various amendments which relate to this matter.  I would be happy if the Minister assured the House that he is not going to sponsor legislation the end effect of which would be to impose, effectively, a certain decor on the waiting area of a restaurant.  From my slight familiarity with restaurants <Col N="1711" /> here, always in the posture of a guest, I am aware that some of them in their waiting area have a sort of bar or half bar.  It is not a structure that one would lean against in an old fashioned Victorian establishment but it may be five foot or six foot long.  Behind it would be a counter with a mirror or glass up against it with a sparkling array of bottles.  I hope it is not the Minister's intention to outlaw that decorative feature which, perhaps, bears the same relation to the ritual of drink as a throne room does to the ritual or monarchy.  In my view it will impose problems of decor on the proprietors of restaurants if they are not allowed to have something which is not a bar in the colloquial sense of the word but is built in that shape in minature.</P>
      <P>I should like to be assured that whatever we sponsor in the end &mdash; this thought comes to my mind when looking at Deputy Barrett's wording &mdash; the waiting area, or whatever it is called, will not be understood in the statute or in the regulations as meaning that people may only sojourn to that part of the restaurant while they literally are waiting for a table to become free or for their meal to be prepared.  I do not get any pleasure out of lengthy rounds of drink before eating but in my view we will annoy people, and make a difficult job even more difficult for a restaurant proprietor, if we forbid him to leave a table which may be set or a meal which is ready to serve at any moment until such time as the party going to dine in the restaurant have had what they regard as a reasonable number of aperitifs.  That may not be what the Minister or I would want to drink but I hope that we will not police this to such lengths that the legislation can be understood as entitling people to drink before their meals only until such time as something becomes available.  The table may be ready and the brigade in the kitchen may be ready to serve the food but the party may not be complete or when the last guest joins the group they may want to have a further drink with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not make ourselves ridiculous by interpreting the waiting period too <Col N="1712" /> narrowly.  I agree that this will be defeated and abused if the bar or waiting area, with or without this or that decorative feature, is to be occupied by people who have no intention of eating anything afterwards.  I quite agree that the bona fide element which Deputy Barrett mentioned in his amendment must be upheld but I do not think the restaurant proprietor should be compelled to adopt or refrain from adopting any particular decor in the waiting area.  He should not be tied to dictating certain lengths of time or a certain number of drinks which may be consumed before eating a meal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Cooney's description of a bar.  Perhaps we should ensure that we do not leave a loophole here.  I suggest that the word &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; could be substituted for &ldquo;bar&rdquo;. My definition of a lounge is of an area where intoxicating liquor can be served but which must be sealed off or obscured.</P>
      <P>I wonder what criteria there are in regard to waiting areas in ordinary restaurants, the majority of which serve intoxicating liquor?  Most restaurants have wine licences.  We are suddenly confronted with the problem of the size of waiting area to be allowed.  Are we to expect that the restaurant trade will increase their potential by 100 per cent just because they have a licence?  I would exercise extreme caution in this matter. We must ensure that people who get these licences do not abuse that privilege.</P>

      <P>One of the purposes of this legislation is to provide for the availability of beer at meal times.  I have some difficulty in understanding how a restaurateur is expected to accommodate dispensers and barrels unless he has some kind of counter.  The customer should always be entitled to see his beer poured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that restaurants will sell beer in bottles and that the draft dispenser will not be a feature of restaurants?  The definition of &ldquo;bar&rdquo;<Col N="1713" /> may be the standard one borrowed from some other part of the intoxicating liquor code.  If so, it must stand and Deputy Cooney's suggestion that it should not apply to the waiting area is sensible.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned about the capacity of Bord Fáilte to police or oversee the designation of areas but if the Minister tells us that this is possible then Deputy Colley's amendment should be supported.  The idea behind Deputy Barrett's amendment is the very essence of the Bill.  I do not think any court would have any difficulty in understanding the intention.  If the Minister thinks this is a useful amendment I will not raise any doubts or obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; could be construed to mean that one is only allowed to make use of this area before a meal.  There are many restaurants where diners retire to the waiting area after a meal, thereby allowing others to take their tables.  Provision should be made for allowing diners to use the waiting area after a meal.  I am not sure whether this is precluded or whether an amendment is needed to make it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 should be dealt with separately from amendment No. 46.  Deputy Colley's amendment gives Bord Fáilte the power to designate the size of the waiting area. Section 12 gives the Minister for Tourism and Transport power to make provisions for the maximum accommodation in such areas.  It is the intention that the seating accommodation in the waiting area cannot be more than 20 per cent of that in the dining area.  I accept that this aspect of the Bill is sufficiently important to warrant specific statutory provision and I propose to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to specify more particularly the size of the waiting areas in the special licence restaurants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention in the definition of &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; in section 6 was to make it clear that it meant an area in a restaurant whose sole purpose would be to accommodate persons waiting to have a meal in the restaurant.  This seems to be the <Col N="1714" /> intention of Deputy Barrett's amendment. It is not clear that it adds anything to the existing definition.  I am having the proposed amendment examined urgently by the parliamentary draftsman to see if it tightens up the existing definition of &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; and in the light of his decision an amendment may be introduced on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I presume the intention behind Deputy Cooney's amendment No. 46 is to allow alcohol to be consumed in a small room or area adjacent to the dining area of the restaurant both before and after a meal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the waiting area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 already allows alcohol to be consumed in the waiting area of a restaurant as soon as the meal has been ordered.  That would be equivalent to that part of the amendment which seeks to allow alcohol to be consumed in an anteroom while waiting to commence the meal.  Once again, I emphasise that while liquor can be consumed in the waiting area before a meal there can be no bar trade as such.  I am specifically thinking of the comments by Deputy Kelly.  There is no specific waiting period.  Customers will not be told to wait for a certain number of minutes and they will not be told what to drink.  There is no question of dictating the decor.  I cannot agree to alcohol being consumed in the waiting area or anteroom after a meal has been consumed.  To do so could very well lead to the abuse of the system of licensing, mainly through the development of a bar trade or the consumption of alcohol which would only be remotely, if at all, associated with a meal.  It gets us away from the principle of what is involved.</P>
      <P>Referring to the comments of Deputies Colley and Barrett, having regard to what I think I am interpreting correctly from amendments Nos. 5 and 6, it is not their wish, nor indeed would it be mine, that a waiting area would be of such size as to allow a bar business to be conducted there.</P>

What we are trying to provide for &mdash; and I think Members would agree with this &mdash; is a place where people who go out for an evening to have a meal must wait for a certain amount of time while the table is being prepared and their order is being given, have a number of drinks, which is their business, and then have their meal and drinks with that. That is the extent to which I can go.  I cannot go, as Deputy Cooney seems to suggest in his amendment No. 46, to the point where they would be allowed to return to this anteroom and drink there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 46 is designed to cover two points, one of which the Minister has dealt with.  I can understand his apprehensions about giving authority for the consumption of drink after a meal, in a place other than the dining room.  What we have in mind is that people would be asked to have the last course of their meal, their coffee, in the anteroom so as to vacate tables for other diners.  They could have their drink then with their last course.  I take the Minister's point that the policing of that could be difficult and it might lead to abuse.  If the Minister does not want to accept my suggestion, that is all right with me.  However, the effect in the restaurant will be the same &mdash; alcohol will be consumed at the table with or without the coffee.  My proposal was in ease of the restaurant management so that tables <Col N="1716" /> could be vacated and that part of the meal completed in the waiting room.</P>
      <P>The more significant point I wanted to make in my amendment has not been addressed by the Minister.  It is that a restaurant to get a restaurant licence cannot contain a bar.  As &ldquo;bar&rdquo; is defined in the Bill, inevitably and unavoidably a waiting area will come within that definition. Technically, all premises could be excluded.  I cannot conceive of a waiting area that does not come within that definition.  If it does so, it will lead to a breach of section 16 (1) unless my amendment to delete the phrase about after dinner drinking is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to draw attention to and support what Deputy Colley says in this respect.  It is, in fact, the practice &mdash; and I am imagine one which is to some extent in ease of the restaurant management &mdash; that guests at the end of the meal, when having coffee or whatever it may be and some wishing to have a liqueur or brandy or whiskey with their coffee, are encouraged to leave their tables and go back to the lounge or the waiting area from whence they came. It may be that the restaurant proprietor wants to serve a new lot of guests or that his staff want to get the tables cleared.  In either event, it is a convenience for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back to the contradictions which Deputy McDowell mentioned in reference to a former amendment, it will be legal in hotels, in public houses, in places which serve food and which also have a full public house licence and, so far as the service of wine is concerned in restaurants which at the moment have wine licences, that people move from one part of the restaurant to another.  The only case where it will not be possible will be in the special licensed area.  There the coffee and liqueur or whatever it may be must be consumed at the table.  This is not a matter about which I would be fanatical.  I only mention it as perhaps an unreasonable irritant which the Bill may contain.  Since the Minister has shown anxiety to meet the wishes of the House and to look again at this section on <Col N="1717" /> Report Stage, perhaps he might look also at this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole history of intoxicating liquor law is riddled with anomalies and complexities.  We are not doing anything in this Bill or this sequence of amendments that will help that situation one iota.  In fact, it is becoming somewhat ludicrous.  As the Bill is drawn, we already have three categories of areas within the restaurant premises.  There is, first, the restaurant proper, secondly, the waiting area and, thirdly, the bar area or possible bar area. To those three categories Deputy Cooney seeks to add a fourth which he describes as an anteroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a waiting room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a fourth designation, a fourth type of description. A bar presumably means an area where liquor is sold <i>per se</i> on its own, but a bar will rapidly turn itself into a waiting room under the definition if a person who is there is in the position of having ordered a meal.  The whole concept of prosecution taking place for infringement of these definitions and triple divisions of a restaurant premises does not bear thinking about.  Was the customer there with somebody?  Had he ordered his meal yet? Was he genuine about it?  Had he come there after the meal?  We ought to seek to simplify this whole position.  There is the restaurant area with the designations given under the various provisions of the Bill and there is a waiting area.  The sole parameters ought to be as laid down in section 7.  The intent should be whether the people drinking in the waiting room are there in connection with a meal or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this bar concept and the prohibition of the bar idea in this Bill has no relevance or logic and it should be taken out.  My guess is that it has been introduced as a result of the vintners' lobby.  We are talking about restaurants and drinking in connection with a substantial meal.  One can see perhaps how <Col N="1718" /> it arrived there, that it was feared that the waiting area would be used solely to be a mirror image of what a bar would be in a pub and the vintners feared that their business would be interfered with on this account.  This is contrived; it does not hold a natural place in the Bill.  We should be confined to two descriptions, waiting area and restaurant.  The parameters are fairly reasonably set down in section 7 as to the permitted use of the waiting area. Whether it is necessary to go into a breakdown of maximum percentages that may be attributable to a waiting area <i>vis-á-vis</i> the entirety is another matter.  We should not be too strong or lay down too firm decisions on that score.  Different restaurant premises may be divided up in different proportions.  That should be a matter for the owners.</P>
    <P>I refer to line 10, page 6, where the maximum time permitted in the waiting area after a meal is ended is 30 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will instruct the Central Statistics Office to begin publishing data on the numbers at work on a month by month basis; and if he will arrange that such data is published on the same day each month as the live register figures</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few countries have comprehensive estimates of the numbers at work on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>The Live Register statistics are derived from an administrative system which requires frequent registration of unemployed persons for payment purposes. The extension of PRSI to the self-employed would in principle enable regular estimates of persons at work to be compiled.  In reality, however, there would be considerable timing, coverage and other measurement problems which would have to be tackled before this source could be utilised to provide even reasonably accurate estimates.</P>
      <P>In a report published within the last few days the National Statistics Board drew attention to the statistical potential of such administrative records.  I have asked the board to take up the matter of regular employment estimates based on administrative sources with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The alternatives to administrative-based estimates are direct inquiries covering all sectors of the economy or a monthly labour force survey, neither of which is feasible because of the prohibitive costs involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the administrative and technical difficulties involved, will the Taoiseach agree that the live register figures at present do not accurately reflect the situation in regard to unemployment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the ESRI report last week which contends that about 13,000 jobs will disappear from the economy in the next 12 months.  I would impress on the Taoiseach the urgency of taking steps and will the Taoiseach do everything possible to take steps to deal with this, because we are not getting a true reflection of the factors such as emigration and the Job-search programme which are not reflected in the live register?  As the Taoiseach has outlined his agreement in principle, I suggest that he carry it through.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that reply.  Will the Taoiseach accept that <Col N="1721" /> the National Ballet is a national resource? It is something that not many of us including myself, are overly familiar with, but looking at the conflict and the difficulties that have occurred in the last number of months between the Arts Council and the National Ballet, I see a certain degree of vindictiveness on the part of the Arts Council.  Will the Taoiseach do everything he can, through his office, to resolve this difficulty and to restore the National Ballet to its proper status?</P>

      <P>There are no paperwork requirements imposed on business by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The requirements imposed on business by the Central Statistics Office relate to the completion of statistical returns. These returns are used to produce the statistical indicators needed to satisfy the requirements of effective Irish Government policy-making both in the domestic and EC contexts.  The content of forms is kept continually under review.  The continuing need for the various inquiries, their frequency and the implications for statistical developments arising from the Single European Act are being assessed as part of the work of the National Statistics Board.  A senior official, a statistician, has been appointed in the Central Statistics Office as the named officer for the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Asked the Minister for Finance if he will establish an independent authority to ensure that allocations from the National Lottery to community, sporting, and cultural groups are made on the basis of need and merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The surplus revenues earned by the national lottery are paid into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue and are issued from Subhead N of the vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance to suspense accounts operated by the relevant Government Departments for spending on approved projects in the areas of sport and other recreation, <Col N="1725" /> national culture (including the Irish language), the arts, the health of the community, youth activities and amenity and welfare projects.  This is entirely in accordance with the procedure set out in section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>Once global allocations of funds to the activities specified above have been decided by the Government, the selection of individual projects for funding is a matter for the spending Minister concerned. All expenditure requires the approval of the Minister for Finance: this may take the form of specific approval for a project, or general approval for the terms of a grant scheme.</P>
      <P>Issues from each Department's National Lottery Suspense Account are audited in the same way as other public expenditure, and are published in the Appropriation Accounts.  Recipients of grants are required to submit audited accounts to the Department concerned after the end of the financial year, and to provide a separate account of expenditure on the project for which the grant is given.  Where the grant represents the greater part of the total income of the grantee, the books and accounts of the grantee are to be made available, if required, for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The criteria applied by the Department of Education and by the Department of the Environment in administering the new amenities scheme and the capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities respectively have already been published.  I am circulating the details in the Official Report.  These detailed criteria together with the audit requirements to which I have already referred will ensure that there is full accountability for the use of lottery funds within the general allocations decided by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the national lottery in generating a level of funding for worthwhile projects in the sections of activity to which I have referred has greatly exceeded our expectations.  Nevertheless the applications for support from groups around the country are well above the <Col N="1726" /> level of funding available at present. Inevitably, therefore, some applicants have had to be disappointed on this occasion.  As Deputies will appreciate, it is the responsibility of the Government to determine priorities in the use of public moneys, which include lottery funds and it would be quite inappropriate to pass this responsibility off to an independent agency which would not be accountable to the Oireachtas for its decisions.  It is my hope that as the national lottery goes from strength to strength it will generate a level of funding which will enable the Government to respond over time to the very many applications received from community and other groups around the country.</P>
    <P>Following are details of the schemes:</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Grant Scheme for the Provision of Recreational Facilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Objective of Scheme</P>
    <P>This scheme is designed to assist and encourage local initiatives in the provision of recreational, leisure and community facilities (excluding swimming pools and environmental works).  The provision of indoor and outdoor facilities are eligible for consideration under this scheme.  The scheme is open to all voluntary community organisations wishing to provide recreational facilities and thereby promote the greater availability of recreational and leisure opportunities for the community.</P>
    <P>2.  Conditions for Participation</P>
    <P>(i)  <i>Site Acquisition</i></P>
    <P>Applicant organisations must provide a suitable site for the development.  The site must be owned or held under long-term lease (not less than 25 years from time of application) by the applicant.  In determining the suitability of a site the Department will take into account its proximity to existing facilities and its accessibility in terms of the potential use of the proposed facility by the community and schools.  Grants will not be made available towards the purchase of sites or premises.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Grant Limits and Local Contribution</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be required to provide a local financial contribution of at least 30 per cent of construction cost of the proposed project but in very exceptional circumstances a contribution as low as 20 per cent will be acceptable (in such cases full particulars of these circumstances must be furnished).  The level of grant-aid will be at the discretion of the Department.  Grants will <Col N="1727" /> only be considered in respect of work to be done by recognised building contractors and will not exceed £100,000.  Under no circumstances will the grant exceed 80 per cent of construction costs for the proposed project, as agreed in advance by the Department.  Grants will not be increased in line with increased building costs.</P>
    <P>Where the development of playing pitches is proposed a grant maximum of £20,000 will apply in the case of any single project or group.  All other conditions of grant assistance stipulated in this schedule shall apply in the case of such developments.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory evidence of the ready availability of the required local contribution amount must be produced prior to the confirmation of grant-aid by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iii)  <i>Plans</i></P>
    <P>Plans for the proposed development must be prepared and submitted to the Department.  The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.  Each development must proceed in accordance with the design and costs agreed by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iv)  <i>Planning Permission</i></P>
    <P>Applicants will be required to secure planning permission and by-law approval for the proposed development.  The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>Construction of Project</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be responsible for all arrangements for the construction of their project.  The project must be put out to tender and subsequently executed by building contract.  If it is proposed to pass over the lowest of any tender the Department must be notified before any other tender is examined.  Failure to accept the lowest suitable tender may result in reduction or cancellation of grant aid.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory arrangements must be made by the grantee for the professional supervision of construction works.  The Department will not be liable for professional fees incurred.</P>
    <P>Grants will not be provided towards work performed by voluntary labour or under Government training schemes.</P>
    <P>Where proposed construction works exceed £100,000 building contractors will be required to secure an insurance bond in respect of such projects in advance of the award of a contract.</P>
    <P>Tax clearance procedure (i.e. production of a current C.2 Certificate of tax clearance) in respect of contractors proposed for selection must be complied with in advance of any contractual commitments being made on the part of the grantee.</P>
    <P>(vi)  <i>Commencement of Building Work</i></P>
    <P>Reasonable progress towards the commencement of building work on the project must be in evidence within six months from the date of provisional allocation of grant aid.  The onus <Col N="1728" /> will be on the grantee to show evidence of satisfactory progress towards project construction stage.  In the absence of such evidence the Department retains the right to withdraw the offer of grant assistance.</P>
    <P>(vii)  <i>Management and Maintenance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the proposed facility.</P>
    <P>(viii)  <i>Guarantee of Community Access and Continued Usage</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to submit a written guarantee that the completed facility will be made fully available to the local community.  It will also be necessary to provide an undertaking protecting the Department's financial interest in the facility and guaranteeing the repayment of grants should it cease to operate or should a change of usage occur.</P>
    <P>(ix)  <i>Insurance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to arrange for the provision of adequate insurance cover for the completed facility, against fire and all other insurable risks, with an approved insurance company and to pay all necessary premiums.  The insurance will be for such amount as will provide cover for the full re-instatement value of the facility, together with a sum for professional fees.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the grantee to maintain satisfactory public liability insurance in respect of users, general public, etc.</P>
    <P>Groups wishing to avail of grant-aid must be in a position to comply in full with the conditions for participation in the Scheme outlined above. All applications will be considered on their merits, but special consideration will be given to cases where an early commencement of building work is possible.</P>
    <P>3.  Payment of Grant</P>
    <P>Grants will be paid to approved projects following submission of architects' certificates/ builders' invoices in respect of work completed. Grant instalments will issue at a rate established by the Department having regard to the level of grant approved.</P>
    <P>The Department will retain a proportion of the approved grant amount against satisfactory completion of the proposed development works.</P>
    <P>A grant will not be payable in respect of projects being grant assisted by any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>4.  Project Visits</P>
    <P>Approved projects will be subject to occasional visits by officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>5.  Application Forms</P>
    <P>Application forms for completion in respect of eligible projects are available from the Secretary, Department of Education, Youth Section, 11th Floor, Hawkins House, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>All questions on the form must be answered <Col N="1729" /> and failure to disclose full details will render applications ineligible for consideration.</P>
    <P>6.  Acknowledgment</P>
    <P>This grant scheme is being funded from the surplus proceeds of the national lottery.  All grant assisted projects must display an acknowledgment that the project has been aided by the national lottery.</P>

    <P Just="Center">COMMUNITY AMENITY PROJECT GRANTS</P>
    <P Just="Center">(Financed from National Lottery)</P>
    <P Just="Center">GRANT CONDITIONS</P>
    <P>1.  The grant is allocated on the understanding that the project is not being grant assisted by any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>2.  The grant allocation is made on the understanding that a local contribution of at least 30 per cent will be made towards the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>3.  The grant is available only in respect of actual costs borne by the applicant organisation. (For example, work done by voluntary labour or under Government Training Schemes cannot be included).</P>
    <P>4.  (1)  A major objective of the scheme is the promotion of youth employment. Accordingly, every effort should be made to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the workforce are under 25 years of age.  Local authorities will be required, when claiming payment of the grant, to furnish a certificate on the extent to which persons under 25 were employed on the project.</P>
    <P>(2)  In addition, other unemployed local people should be employed as far as possible.  Such employment should be arranged through FÁS (The Training and Employment Authority).</P>
    <P>5.  Reasonable progress towards the commencement of work on the project must be in evidence within six months from the date of allocation of the grant.  In the absence of such progress, the Minister reserves the right to cancel the grant allocation at any time. All projects or phases of projects must be completed by such dates as may be specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>6.  In the case of a project to be carried out by a body other than a local authority, the allocation is conditional on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the submission by the local authority of a certificate that</P>
    <P>&mdash; the project, when completed, will be of public utility and will be available for public or community use as far as practicable;</P>
    <P>&mdash; there will be adequate arrangements for management and maintenance and for meeting running costs, if any;</P>
    <P>(b)  the detailed planning and execution of <Col N="1730" /> the work being subject to the general approval of the local authority;</P>
    <P>(c)  the local authority satisfying itself that the balance of the cost of the project is, or can be made, available.</P>
    <P>7.  It will be a matter for the local authority to ensure that cost estimates are accurate; no additional grants will be made in respect of any cost over-runs arising for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>8.  The grant payments will be made directly to the local authority on behalf of the bodies involved on receipt of the appropriate expenditure/recoupment certificate from the local authority.</P>

    <P>10.  Under new arrangements announced in the 1987 budget statement, payment of grants exceeding £500 from State or local authority sources is conditional on the production by the payees of a certificate from their local tax officer that their tax affairs are in order. The new arrangements apply to voluntary bodies as well as individuals and companies. Where it is proposed to carry out work by contract, tax clearance procedures relating to the contractor must be complied with before the contract is signed.  Advice in these matters should be sought from the local authority responsible for supervision the grant aided project so as to avoid difficulties and delays in payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>11.  Grant-assisted projects must display an acknowledgement that the project has been aided by the national lottery.  The local authority responsible for supervision of the grant aided project so as to avoid difficulties and delays in payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>12.  The grant allocation is made strictly on the understanding that the project will be completed without further grant aid under this scheme.</P>

      <P>In view of the considerable parliamentary and public disquiet about the way in which these grants are disbursed, would the Minister consider setting up an informal all-party committee to discuss with the Ministers concerned the criteria to be used and how to avoid the questionable publicity which surrounds the allocation of these grants so as to ensure that public support for the lottery will be maintained?</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said about there being <Col N="1731" /> disquiet over the method of disbursement of lottery funds.  What we are doing is similar to what has been done in the allocation of funds under any particular subhead by successive Governments since the foundation of the State.  Therefore, if people want to play down the success of the lottery by making accusations and innuendoes and spreading gossip on how these moneys are disbursed, they are wasting their time, because I could refer to the many hundreds of projects throughout the country which are benefiting from allocations received from lottery surplus funds.  They themselves would only be too anxious to publicise the fact that they have received this support to provide these necessary facilities and amenities in their own immediate areas.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would like me to read into the record the criteria which are being used by the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment I would spend the next 20 minutes doing so.  As they are well known I do not think I have to read them into the record.  Arrangements for the distribution of the lottery surplus funds have already been decided upon by both this and the previous Government.  A national sports centre is going to be provided here in Dublin and six other locations have been delegated for regional sports centres, five of which were decided upon by the previous <Col N="1732" /> Government.  A number of counties will also benefit from additional lottery surplus funds.  Seemingly the argument being put forward by Deputies both inside and outside the House on the availability of these funds mainly stems from distribution of the £10 million allocated to the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment &mdash; £4 million to the Department of Education and £6 million to the Department of the Environment &mdash; but this will hardly cater for one-tenth of the number of applications received, many of which were received three or four years ago.  There was no prospect of either work being started or being completed until lottery funding became available.  If Deputies can show me any member of the Government or any Deputy on this side of the House any particular project which has received an allocation which it was not entitled to receive, they should come forward but until such time as they do, I say put up or shut up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <P>As Minister for Finance, does the Minister see any anomaly or difficulty in the fact that, by virtue of the way in which the national lottery is working and its undoubted success, there appears to be ample money available for a narrowly-defined set of purposes while cut backs are taking place in other perhaps more essential areas, such as education and infrastructural development? Does he, as Minister for Finance &mdash; and I am asking his opinion here &mdash; see any difficulty in the long-term public perception that might arise from what is an apparent anomaly, when cuts are being effected in one area and largesse occurring in another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer the Deputy by saying that that is why the Government, when they took office 14 months ago, extended the areas on which the national lottery moneys could be spent into the health and community areas generally, wheras there had been a much narrower definition on the part of the previous Government in relation to how these moneys should be spent.  It is important that people would accept fully that expenditure in sport, recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts, the health of the community, youth activities and amenity and welfare projects covers a fairly wide and extensive area and, in my view, is having great success on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would accept what the Deputy has said, that it can be difficult for any of us, Government or Opposition, to justify expenditure under some of these headings while, at the same time, charges are being imposed for services or some services are being curtailed; there is no <Col N="1734" /> doubt about that.  But we must make up our minds: do we want all of the national lottery funds to be spent in the way decided by this and the previous Government, or do we want that money to come in as normal non-tax revenue to the Exchequer and then be dispersed accordingly into areas that might appear to have higher priority, at least in certain people's minds.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it desirable that individual Members of this House should claim credit, in printed material, for the manner in which the Government carry out their duties under the National Lottery Act, as at present constituted, and that it gives rise to the natural and reasonable belief that political influence is used in the manner in which these moneys are expended?  Would the Minister explain to the House &mdash; if he considers it entirely inappropriate, to use his phrase now, that an independent board should disperse the national lottery moneys &mdash; how then he sat mute this morning when a Bill to effect that exact purpose had its First Reading in this House?  Would he agree with me that it is indicative of the fact that he is afraid of being beaten if the matter was put to a vote in the House?</P>

These are people who, for example, avail of a church annulment and a church remarriage without the annulment of a civil marriage or people who enter a marriage ceremony in a civil office abroad though their domestic marriage has not been annulled.  I understand these people are accommodated on the production of the second marriage certificate for the purposes of being married by the Revenue Commissioners whereas many other people, since the Referendum on divorce was not successful, who are living together and who are frank and forthright with the Revenue Commissioners are getting no consideration whatsoever. Certain anomalies exist at present to the disadvantage of those who are perhaps more straight or forthright with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>The increase in the outflow of manufacturing profits must be seen in the context of the substantial rise in manufactured exports over the period.  It should be emphasised that the rise in exports associated with the generation of these profits has resulted directly and indirectly in increased employment.  The <Col N="1743" /> aggregate figures for employment of course reflect a number of other factors besides increased exports.</P>
    <P>There was no growth in the profit outflow in 1987, despite a substantial increase in merchandise exports.  This could, in part, be a result of the efforts being made to encourage the retention of a higher proportion of profits in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The aim of Government policy is to increase the potential for growth and employment by the encouragement of profit retention for increased investment domestically.  The retention of a greater proportion of the profits of these companies will depend to a large extent on growing confidence in the economy.  An essential condition is an improvement in our international competitiveness so that we can successfully compete for further investment from these companies and from other firms contemplating investment in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the scheme which provides for the issue of special tax-exempt securities for purchase by eligible foreign-owned companies operating in Ireland.  The scheme, provided for under section 69 of the Finance Act, 1985, is intended to increase the range of investment possibilities for these firms so that they can have the choice and the opportunity of putting their surplus cash to work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of profit retention is, of course, only a partial solution to a more fundamental problem of insufficient investment.  For a number of years past, the level of private investment in the country, and especially investment by indigenous enterprise, has not been high enough to support the rates of economic growth we need.  The thrust of current Government policy is directed at reviving private investment in the productive sectors. The basic requirements for this are confidence in economic management, a strengthening of our competitive position and low interest rates to enable a realistic return to business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister that the figures he has given to the House <Col N="1744" /> in relation to the repatriation of profits are verging on scandalous, a situation which, as I am sure the Minister is aware, has recently been described by the ESRI as bizarre.  We have had an export boom for the past number of years and we have a trade surplus but not one extra job has been created because of this repatriation of profits.  May I ask the Minister if this is considered by the Government to be satisfactory?  The Minister stated that it is the Government's aim to provide growth in employment but there is no way the Government will create growth in employment if the present situation is allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister if he considers this to be satisfactory at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that it is not satisfactory and we have taken many steps to ensure that it will not continue at the levels that pertained when the Deputy opposite was Tánaiste in the previous Government.  We have succeeded in a number of ways.  For example, the section 69 bond and the ECU bond allow people to invest their excess profits here and to take the opportunity of making money here.  It is a question of making profits with profits and more profits which, hopefully, will lead to investment here which will create jobs. There can be no jobs unless there is profit and it is about time Deputies realised that.  It is up to us to have a sufficiently good climate to ensure that those profits stay here and provide the jobs here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This nonsense about creating a climate seems to have entered into our directory here.  Perhaps if one were selling tourism one might need a climate.  Creating any climate is not going to create the jobs the Minister is talking about.  From a practical point of view, will the Government consider ensuring that increased corporation profits tax is paid by these companies because, with the present rate of 10 per cent corporation tax most companies are paying far less, around 2 per cent or 3 per cent after write offs?  That should be looked at as a matter of urgency.  Second, will <Col N="1745" /> the Minister look at the tax situation in relation to offering tax rebates to companies if they put money into research and development in this country?  We could bring in amendments to the taxation legislation to allow the companies certain tax avoidance measures if they re-invest here for research and development in which we are lagging way behind the existing developed countries and the newly industrialised countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that it would be possible for us to compete in the international climate.  We have to compete for investment here on the periphery of Europe with many other countries. Therefore certain concessions and reliefs must be given as has been the policy of successive Governments for all my time here, that is, nearly 20 years. That will continue and, far from putting further obstacles in the way as suggested by the Deputies, we are probably going to have to look at other ways of ensuring that we get the investment from abroad and also hold whatever investment we can here so that the jobs are created here and not exported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister does not consider my suggestions worthy. How does the Minister see job creation arising from the continuation of the present policies?  Profits obviously have to be made in the private sector and we have no problems with profit being made but what is galling is that these profits are being repatriated without any commitment to re-investment.  I would ask the Minister to accept that it is shortsighted to think that these jobs will be created when all these profits are being repatriated.</P>

Will the Minister accept that that arises out of gross profits of about £1,400 million and that the companies in question paid a paltry £150 million in CPT?  In the light of that, has the Minister any serious intention of speaking to the Revenue Commissioners about the transfer pricing mechanisms which are in operation and about section 69 of the Finance Act which facilitates such transfers?  Is the Minister aware that this practice has now been adopted by the Bank of Ireland which sent out £375 million to buy a bank in the US and to buy Irish Life who, three weeks ago, sent £75 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is beginning to get it confused.  I gave it to him in the reply.  What we are talking about here is profits, dividends, royalties.  We are not in a position to separate them.  In relation to moneys flowing back into the country, we have seen interest rates drop by 6.5 per cent in 14 months because of liquidity in the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest rates are all to do with money supply.  Nothing else governs them except money supply.  In relation to the points made by the Deputy, we must try to secure sufficient investment to create jobs here.  Are the <Col N="1747" /> Labour Party now saying that the hundreds of factories owned by multinationals and employing tens of thousands of people that came in here during the time that Labour were in government and were told that they could repatriate their profits if they so wished should now take their investment out of here?

As far as we are concerned our duty is to try to encourage those people who are making those profits here to re-invest them here. We have introduced instruments to allow them to do so.  We would hope that the climate would be right for them to invest further in manufacturing industry rather than in financial instruments.  That is the policy that this Government are pursuing and we hope that it will create additional jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in view of the willingness expressed by one of the major banks to facilitate old age non-contributory pensioners in obtaining refunds of the DIRT tax, whether he has satisfied himself regarding the refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to supply the bank with reclaim forms and the refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with forms prepared by the bank; whether he will direct the Revenue Commissioners to co-operate with the banks in making available on bank premises the necessary forms to enable elderly people to reclaim the DIRT tax; and his views on whether the present refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to co-operate with the banks <Col N="1748" /> amounts to an unnecessary and unfavourable obstacle for such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that simplified forms for claiming repayment of retention tax were designed in 1987 in order to make the application process as uncomplicated as possible for claimants, particularly for elderly persons not previously in the tax net.  When a claimant makes contact initially with the relevant tax office, the tax official involved decides from the information supplied which particular form is appropriate.  The Revenue Commissioners considered that this was the best way to deal with claims from individuals in differing circumstances for refunds or retention tax.</P>
      <P>I understand that a request was made by one of the banking groups to the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes in May 1987 to have a supply of claim forms No. 54D &mdash; (Claim for Repayment of Retention Tax &mdash; for completion only by persons who are exempt from tax) made available for distribution to the group's branch offices.  The request was not acceded to at the time because it was felt that banks would not generally be aware of a customer's tax status and would not be in a position to advise as to the claim form or forms which would be appropriate. In those circumstances it was considered that the issue of supplies of claim forms to banks would be likely to complicate the repayment process and could cause confusion and delay in dealing with refund claims.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are prepared to have discussions with representatives of the banks to see if it would be practicable to give the banks a role in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and for acceding to some of the points made in the question.  Would the Minister not agree that if the banks were not in a position, in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners, to deal with the refund of DIRT tax on behalf of people over 65 years of age, in many cases those <Col N="1749" /> people would hardly be in a position to do the same thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is because there would be some confusion because the banks may not know which form the claimant should fill in.  Initial contact was made last May, 12 months, and has not been pursued since.  Discussions can take place now with the banks and the Revenue Commissioners to see if they can co-operate in the way the Deputy has described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me that it is desirable that where refunds are simply not available but due to taxpayers that the Revenue Commissioners should take the initiative by having easily understood self-explanatory forms available where these people are likely to find themselves and where they are likely to have the question of tax refund in their mind?  I suggest to the Minister that there is an element of making this procedure somewhat obscure and unavailable in the hope that it will not be availed of.  Would the Minister not agree with me that it is desirable that the Revenue Commissioners should make these forms available in the most convenient place especially to people who are getting on in years and find it difficult to contact Revenue on their own behalf or to make the relevant representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention was not to try to hide the kind of system that existed or prevent anybody from having access to the forms they would require to get refunds of deposit interest retention tax.  The point raised by the banks was not pursued at the time.  Maybe they are interested in pursuing it now, but we will see the result of the discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and the banks concerned.  I agree with Deputy McDowell that it would and should be the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that, for any purpose, their contact with the public is streamlined and efficient.  The Deputy will accept that, in relation to the points <Col N="1750" /> we discussed here in the course of the last few weeks regarding the introduction of self-assessment and so on, the Revenue Commissioners are more than anxious to ensure that everybody is aware of what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 31 together.  The Government's current decentralisation programme is based on the original list of centres selected in 1980 when decentralisation of Government Departments to provincial centres was first proposed. These centres are at Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The decision to confine the revived programme to the centres selected in 1980 was guided by the ready availability of sites in many of these locations, and the degree of preliminary planning which had been carried out regarding both the accommodation required and the staff to be transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decentralisation programme now under way is an ambitious one, and the Government's present priority is its <Col N="1751" /> implementation.  The Government will however at a later date and in the light of the experience gained be in a position to consider representations from other centres including Roscommon and Tuam as further locations for decentralised offices.</P>

We hope in the next month to be in a position to advertise the other locations, and the intention is that work will begin on them before the end of the year.  It is hoped that within a year or 18 months the whole system will be completed and that the decentralised offices in the 12 locations will have staff working there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 41 together. I am aware that responsibility for the maintenance of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell drainage district rests with a committee of trustees who are elected every three years by the benefiting landowners in the district.</P>
      <P>There is an adequate established mechanism whereby these trustees are statutorily empowered to levy and collect drainage rates from the benefiting landowners in the district to cover the cost of annual maintenance works.  In turn each drainage rate payer is, by statute, empowered to recoup the amount of drainage rate paid from the respective County Councils of Cavan or Leitrim, in whose area they live.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather important question because we are dealing with a unique position so far as this is the only drainage board in the country that has not been taken over by the local authorities under the Drainage Act, 1937, because of its cross-Border dimension.  It caters for approximately 40,000 acres of arable land.  What the Minister has said is essentially right but it does not make commonsense.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in view of the fact that the Office of Public Works are at present undertaking restoration work on the dormitory wing of the 15th century Vicars Choral Building on the Rock of Cashel and that major work on Cormac's Chapel is being mentioned which means that the chapel will be closed for some considerable time, and visitors to the rock will have little to see, if he will give (1) details of the plans (2) the scale and duration of the plan (3) the way in which it will affect visitors and (4) the cost of same; and if he will give the same details in respect of Ormonde Castle, Carrick-on-Suir, which is completely closed this year and the ruined Abbey Priory of Augustinian Cannons, Cahir, County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to give an account of the large programme of work which the Office of Public Works are engaged in at the three national monuments mentioned by the Deputy.  Taking each national monument in the order listed, the following is the information sought.  First, I will deal with the Rock of Cashel and I will give separate details in respect of the major works programme at present in train, in the dormitory wing of the Vicars' Choral and in Cormac's Chapel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dormitory Wing of the Vicars' <Col N="1756" /> Choral was formerly in a ruinous condition. It is being restored with a view to providing in it improved visitor facilities including an audio-visual show which will assist in the interpretation and appreciation of our national monuments.  This year's work programme includes erecting the upper levels of the north wall, repairing cut stone windows, repairing masonry, erecting roof timbers, building blockwork for an office and sanitary facilities in the basement and providing access to the vault of the Vicar's Choral Hall.  Next year, resources permitting, the roof will be completed, floors, stairs, windows and doors will be put in, electrical works and general fitting out will be done before the audio-visual equipment is installed.  I am hopeful that the work will be finished at the end of 1989 and that the audio-visual facility will be in operation in 1990.</P>
    <P>As this part of the national monument has not previously been accessible to the public, the work programme will not impose any additional viewing restrictions. On completion there will be an exciting new dimension to the Rock and improved visitor facilities.</P>
    <P>The total cost is estimated at £220,000. In relation to Cormac's Chapel, works there this year will involve scaffolding, commencement of work on roof masonry, the continuation of conservation work on the wall paintings, the installation of monitoring and control equipment to guide future progress, and the lowering of the level of fill in the croft.  The overall plan involves the completion of the conservation of the wall paintings, cleaning, repairing and conserving masonry, some replacement of stonework, repairing the arch of the south door, fitting doors and windows, laying a floor to the croft, and providing appropriate heating and lighting.</P>
    <P>Due to the painstaking and specialised nature of the work the programme will take at least five years to complete.</P>
    <P>During the next two years the chapel will not be closed to visitors except for occasional days, as the work requires. Later on, when interior stone cleaning is being done, it may be necessary to close <Col N="1757" /> the structure to the public for a short time.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the total cost will be in the region of £120,000.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with Ormonde Castle, Carrick-on-Suir.  A major programme of works has been in progress there since 1982.  Aspects remaining to be completed include the repair of external plastering, pointing of walls, fitting of timber panelling in the library, major works in the Long Gallery, completion of the spiral staircase, various repairs to windows, doors, walls and fireplaces as well as presentation and exhibition work and the provision of staff and visitor facilities.</P>
    <P>The current programme of works is expected to be completed at the end of 1989.  Conservation work to the older 15th century portion of the castle will be required at a later date.</P>
    <P>The works being done this year are of a nature incompatible with public access. As well as public safety considerations, a continuity of progress is essential where structural works are involved.  It is hoped to re-open the castle to the public in summer 1989 even though works in some areas will still be in progress then.  While I regret that this monument will not be open this year, I am confident that we will make good progress with the restoration works over the coming 12 months and that when the castle is re-opened in 1989 it will be a much greater attraction and a boon to the town of Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the 1982-89 programme is £330,000.</P>
    <P>Next I shall deal with Cahir Abbey, where the work being done this year involves the conservation of dangerous portions of one of the towers.  The full programme of work at the site involves conservation of all walls, removal of infill to the tower arch, re-construction of the collapsed portions of another tower and presentation works.  It would take approximately three years to complete this programme but only works required to make the structure safe are being done initially.  The public can visit the site but the tower area is being closed off while work to secure it is in progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> The cost of the work in 1988 is estimated at £26,000 and the total cost of the entire project is estimated at £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's very detailed and comprehensive reply to a rather lengthy question. We are indeed fortunate in County Tipperary to have so many points of historical and architectural interest including Holy Cross Abbey.  A great deal of concern has been expressed in Cashel about the closure of Cormac's Chapel, that the many visitors who would wish to see it would be prevented from doing so. I am glad to note from the Minister of State's answer that it will be closed for only rather a limited period.  Again the closure of the castle in Carrick-on-Suir for a year and a half is causing a great deal of concern.  The Minister might arrange that it be opened even at intervals to enable tourists who wish to avail of it and to view it to do so.</P>
      <P>The Abbey Priory of Augustinian Canons in Cahir is a very historical old church founded in 1140.  The people there fear that unless it is taken under the care of the Bord of Works immediately and restructuring work carried out it will fall into further disuse and further abuse.</P>
      <P>However, I am pleased to learn from the Minister of State that the three areas mentioned are receiving immediate attention from his Department and I urge that the work be expedited so that the attractiveness to tourists will not be interfered with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank report states that, while progress in fiscal adjustment has undoubtedly been made in 1987 and 1988, a considerable degree of adjustment is inevitable in future years.  While the ESRI report tends to be over-optimistic in its assessment of the prospective opening budgetary position for 1989, it too accepts that the borrowing requirement needs to be reduced further.</P>
      <P>The best advice available to me is that a further budgetary adjustment, involving sizeable expenditure cuts, and probably of the same magnitude as in 1988, will again be required in 1989.  Obviously, economic and financial trends, both at home and abroad, will have a bearing on the level of adjustment eventually required.  Nevertheless, it would be unrealistic to expect that these will substantially mitigate the scale of adjustment needed to continue to make satisfactory progress towards achieving the targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for stabilising the Debt/GNP ratio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will restate what I was talking about before the sos.  These amendments deal with the size of the waiting area of the anteroom adjacent to a restaurant.  There is general agreement between the Minister and the different spokespeople about the fact that this should be designated in some way and &mdash; relating to Deputy Barrett's amendment &mdash; that those who are waiting should be waiting to have a meal in the restaurant.  However, the Minister seemed to indicate that the ante-room or waiting area should be restricted to diners who are there before their meal and that it should not be available to those who have finished a meal, who have reached the coffee stage and who wish to finish their bottle of wine or whatever drink they have in the waiting area.  This is a reasonable practice and, as Deputy Kelly said, it allows the restaurant proprietor to make room for other diners and to clear the tables.  It is reasonable to request that the ante-room should be available for that purpose. I will be interested to hear the Minister's views because he seems to be indicating that he wants diners to finish their meal and, if they wish to have a post-prandial drink, to get into their cars and find a licensed premises somewhere in the locality.  That is a most unrealistic suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a barbaric solution, so much so that I do not believe the Minister means it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe he means it but perhaps he has not given it full consideration. The Bill deals with high quality restaurants &mdash; not takeaways or fast food joints &mdash; and people who frequent such restaurants do not expect to be shifted and shunted around the locality to satisfy their needs for the night.  At present, that certainly is not the case and it would ultimately be a step backwards if the Minister insists on such an interpretation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) (iii) states that intoxicating liquor must be consumed in the waiting area of the restaurant before the meal by the person for whom the meal was ordered, consumed in the waiting area or else within 30 minutes of the finish of the meal, in the dining area.  On a number of counts, that will not be easy to control.  The waiting area should also be used for the consumption of alcohol after the meal in a reasonable fashion. Most people who go for a meal expect to finish it in comfort, including a bottle of wine, in congenial surroundings adjacent to the restaurant or part of the restaurant premises.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the 30 minutes rule will be policed.  Perhaps the Minister will say how he envisages that being dealt with.  Diners who come in at 8 o'clock in the evening could finish their meal at around 9.30 p.m. or 9.45 p.m. but other diners may not start their meal until 11 o'clock.  Who will be able to tell which diner has finished the meal, which diner is waiting and which has finished the meal an hour and a half ago?  It cannot be policed and will bring the law into disrepute like so many other laws.  It is high time we moved away from implementing legislation that is inoperable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the points made by Deputy Kelly, Deputy Cooney <Col N="1807" /> and Deputy Colley are reasonable, civilised and understandable.  However, in relation to licensing laws, the average punter in the street fails to understand why places in Leeson Street are open until 4 a.m. and that some hotels will serve pints at 1 a.m.  They wonder why they cannot get a drink in a ballroom. The law is being abused and it is very hard to argue against many of the points made.  Nobody would object to people going into an ordinary restaurant having a meal and a drink and then going home. However, there are loopholes in regard to the special restaurant licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it will depend on enforcement but the police have a lot more to do than going around every restaurant to check the position.  We can provide for the sort of entertainment to which Deputies have referred in relation to people having a drink with a meal and, at the same time, tighten the provisions of this Bill to counteract the possible loopholes.  That is why I have tabled amendment No. 6 to clearly indicate in legislation that a waiting area is a place where people wait to have a meal and have a drink while waiting.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he would look at these amendments.  I do not know whether he intends to accept amendment No. 6.  Perhaps he is not happy with the wording.  Does he have a proposal for Report Stage?  My amendment does not put an onus on Bord Fáilte but, if the Minister does not intend to accept it, perhaps he will explain why.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier in dealing with the amendments tabled by Deputy Colley and Deputy Barrett, I am also very conscious of the size of the waiting area.  I am anxious that waiting areas should not be large enough to constitute bars, as happened in Northern Ireland, when it was necessary for them to legislate to prevent these restricted licences becoming full <Col N="1808" /> bar licences in a very short period of time. Having regard to their experience it is my intention to limit, as a percentage of the restaurant dining area proper, the size of the waiting room.  I do not intend to put any restricition on anybody having a drink, or a number of drinks, as I said in reply to Deputy Kelly.  People may have as many drinks as they wish up to 30 minutes after their meal at the table where the meal was served.</P>

I recognise the thrust of Deputy Barrett's amendment and I am prepared on Report Stage to come forward with a definite proposal which will limit the size of the waiting areas so as to avoid the creation of a new pub.</P>

It could be an issue if the waiting area was extended beyond what would be reasonable for a given sized restaurant but I am concerned about the use of the waiting area, whatever its size.

      <P>The House should accept the Minister's willingness to consider this matter between now and Report Stage. We must never get away from the main purpose of the Bill which is to permit the serving of intoxicating liquor with a meal. We do not have a definition as to what is a waiting area in a restaurant and I hope one is produced between now and Report Stage.  Is there such a definition in respect of restaurants that serve wine in accordance with their wine licence?  I was interested to hear Deputy Taylor's comments in regard to a waiting area.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that drinks served in a restaurant with a substantial meal will appear on the bill for the meal.  That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Barrett's concern in regard to a strict definition of &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; and between now and Report Stage I will try to produce an amendment that will tighten up that definition so that it will mean what we want it to mean, a waiting area where people wait while ordering a meal or waiting for a vacant table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the Minister, when considering this between now and <Col N="1810" /> Report Stage, will have it suggested to him by his officials, or it may occur to him spontaneously, that some questions in regard to the use to which the waiting area may be put could arise in the context of possible abuse.  In other words, it might seem to him, or his officials, relevant to consider questions of the provision of entertainment or the facilitation of entertainment over and above having a drink in a waiting area.  If that should be so I should like to ask the Minister to incorporate a special power.  I should like to ask him either to express in the Bill whatever restrictions he intends in this regard or to extend section 12, which empowers the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make regulations because, as it stands, it might not appear at a later date to a court to be wide enough to empower the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make regulations of a kind that do not relate to what might be called touristic standards.  The question of deciding, for reasons which do not have anything to do with tourism but everything to do with not providing unfair competition, on regulations might put the Minister for Tourism and Transport in a position that he might do something <i>ultra vires</i>, have this struck down and umpteen prosecutions invalidated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that is so but my point is &mdash; I had not anticipated speaking about this point which came into my mind a moment ago and I would like to have had time to think about it &mdash; that each Minister has a certain role and a certain battery of statutory functions and he is not entitled to exercise those statutory functions by reference to purposes which are the business of a different Minister or authority.  A plethora of authorities are involved in this legislation, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, the Garda Síochána and Bord Fáilte.  There are not too <Col N="1811" /> many Acts on the Statute Book that involve as many as four authorities in their administration.  It is fine to give the Minister for Tourism and Transport power to make regulations provided they are relevant to his role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment seeks to insert the words, &ldquo;which may be designated in size by the Board&rdquo;.  The Minister has said that regulations made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport may deal with the size of the waiting area in relation to the restaurant but another provision in the Bill states that those regulations by the Minister for Tourism and Transport may not be made.  Bord Fáilte, who will be in the position of designating a premises as a bona fide restaurant, should be given the responsibility of stating what constitutes a proper waiting area in the restaurant they are examining.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should enter the size of the waiting room in the section but Bord Fáilte should have responsibility for maintaining a proper ratio between the two areas in the one premises. If they are given that responsibility we will get over any difficulties that may arise if regulations are not put forward by the Minister for Tourism and Transport. So that there will be no doubt in regard to this, I am suggesting that Bord Fáilte be empowered to designate the size of the restaurant and the waiting area. Officials from Bord Fáilte, after all, will be inspecting such premises on a regular basis.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that this talk about the size of the waiting area as opposed to that of the restaurant area escapes me.  I do not see the point of it. Are we saying that if the waiting area is small drinking <i>per se</i> is all right there?  Is there a fear that if the waiting area is too large in comparison with the size of the restaurant the bar facility will thereby be abused?  If the waiting area is small, that is all right.  All of this is very far removed from what we are providing in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> We are saying that no part of this restaurant is to be used for the serving of drink without the adjunct of a substantial meal.  That is the crucial element.  What difference does it make if the waiting area is small, medium or large?  If a restaurateur decides he wants a certain size of waiting area, that is his affair.  The point which has to be watched is whether he uses this area purely for bar purposes.</P>
    <P>We are making this Bill far more complex than it ought to be.  To enforce this sort of thing one would need a large-scale map of every premises with the restaurant area edged in red and the waiting area edged in blue so that the gardaí could come in with a measuring tape to see if the boundaires are being observed. If a person wants to bring his dessert into the waiting area, is it the end of the world?  This thing is getting out of hand and we are being carried away.  If we go much further down this road we will end up in cloud cuckoo land instead of in a restaurant.  We are talking about a restaurant premises where there is a waiting area and a dining area.  We are trying to ensure that the drinking which takes place there is in association with a substantial meal.  That is provided for in section 7.  The only aspect with which I am not happy is that it does not provide for people to finish off drinks or have a drink after they finish their meal in the same way as before they start the meal. I do not see that any great differential ought to be drawn between those two situations.  We must move away from these complexities which have been introduced because of pressures from outside lobbies.  If we do not we will have messy, unenforceable and not very sensible legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to disagree with Deputy Taylor.  The waiting area is of the utmost importance.  Most Deputies have spoken about abuses.  This area has the greatest potential for abuse.  I do not like to hear about a percentage of the premises being designated as a waiting area.  A large premises will have a large waiting area which will have the potential <Col N="1813" /> to be a lounge bar.  There is no way it can be competently policed and controlled. The Minister is trying to ensure that these restaurants can supply intoxicating drink with a meal.  If we provide a waiting area it will become a bar, a lounge, or a saloon for drinking purposes.  Deputy Taylor mentioned taking the dessert to the waiting area at the end of the meal.</P>

We all know what happened when <Col N="1814" /> seemingly harmless clubs were given the go-ahead some years ago.  I know one town in County Meath which has 15 clubs.  Nobody knows how the books are kept and in some cases it is not known who is operating the clubs.  The licensing trade has got out of hand.  The Minister is to be commended on listening to every submission.  It is important to ensure that there will not be abuses such as the addition of ballrooms to existing restaurants. I know that is not the intention but we must eliminate the possibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 gives the Minister for Tourism, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, power to make regulations to deal with the size of the waiting area.  I do not see why we have to have a provision if a further amendment which Deputy Colley and I have down says that the Minister for Tourism and Transport shall make regulations, as distinct from may make them.  We are guaranteed, if that amendment is <Col N="1815" /> accepted, that regulations will be made. Those regulations can cater for the size of the waiting area as provided in the Bill.  In the meantime, let us talk about the purpose of the waiting area, which is what I am endeavouring to do here.</P>
      <P>There is an impression that because you make a point you are against the person who wants to go out and have a meal and a drink with it.  Like Deputy Taylor, I attend many restaurants in town and know what is happening.  Equally, I know what is going to happen.  I have been given evidence which shows that some of the bright boys have already moved in and bought premises where they intend opening night clubs under the legislation as it stands at present.  The idea is that you have a disco on the ground floor or in the basement and a restaurant on the first floor.  You call the ground floor or basement the waiting area and provide drink and disco music.  How can you ask a garda to try to prove that any person there is not waiting for a table upstairs?  I am not in any way trying to interfere with the normal restaurant with a waiting area, a place in which people have a genuine meal and drink, and a cigar if they wish, can chat for two or three hours after a meal and go home.  I want to prevent the bright boys, under a special restaurant licence costing £3,000, from upsetting genuine businesses built up at very high cost and employing many people, paying PRSI and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down so that there would be no doubt as to the purpose of a waiting area.  It is for people who are waiting to have a meal and the vast majority of those finish their meal, have a drink at their table, get up and go home. We do not want to interfere with them in any way.  There is at present wholesale abuse of the licensing laws and we as legislators should be doing something about it.  I do not want another loophole created on the introduction of special restaurant licences.  I would ask people to think about the possible abuses.  There are masses of abuses that could be introduced under this section at the cost of £3,000 and £50 renewal fee.  I have no <Col N="1816" /> time for those who have broken the law consistently and put genuine people out of business.  Of the three ballrooms in this city, one is up for sale at the moment. The city is left with only two ballrooms because there were abuses of the exemption laws in relation to licences.  Because people who go to discos and get drink there, other people were put out of business, bands were put of business, causing a lot of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>Deputy Barrett particularly makes the case that there are people who are already looking for loopholes in this legislation but it relates to the type of business in which there are already abuses &mdash; the disco and late night drinking fields.  If the purpose of this part of the Bill is to provide legitimate restaurants with the facility of serving alcohol with meals, let us confine ourselves to thinking about those situations and deal on a separate basis with the anomalies that have already occurred in the present legislation.  Let us not penalise the legitimate traders and restaurant owners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me define what I mean by penalising.  We are now going to refuse to allow legitimate restaurants to carry <Col N="1817" /> on their legitimate business as they do at the moment, which includes people retiring to a waiting area after a meal and meals being served throughout the day, on the basis that this will give rise to abuses, whatever that means.  I put it to the House that, to a great number of people, it seems to mean that the trade carried on so far by licensed vintners may be threatened.  In other words, we are not allowed to develop different aspects of the drink trade because it might impinge on the existing trade.  That is incomprehensible and indefensible.  If we continue along the road we are taking with the Bill before us, we will penalise legitimate restaurant owners because we will not allow them the full potential to which their business is entitled.  I would be one of the first to say let us close the loopholes in relation to late night drinking and discos, certainly, but this is not the way to do it.  They will find loopholes in this legislation too.  Let us address that matter in proper terms in proper legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention of anybody to penalise the restaurateurs in any way whatsoever.  It is very wrong to keep suggesting, as Deputy Colley is, that that appears to be the intention.  It is not accepted by the restaurateurs that that is the intention, that that is what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations made by the restaurateurs show that they are satisfied with what is there with regard to the waiting area.  The genuine restaurateurs do not ever want to become involved in the bar trade.  They recognise that in their own interests they must hold the line as much as we would want them to.  Their licences come up for renewal at the end of the year and if they are involved in trade other than the bona fide restaurant trade, they will be in serious difficulty with regard to their licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Northern Ireland legislation framed as we are now framing ours, was grossly abused.  We are learning from that <Col N="1818" /> experience.  What Deputy Barrett has said is correct with regard to people trying to move in to get themselves ready to avail of loopholes.  Some of those involved in the licensed trade generally are the first to see a loophole.  On behalf of the vintners whom I have met, in the country and in the city, I must say that they are not interested in loopholes.  They want this legislation properly set up and running from the word go.  The main comment I get from those involved in the licensed trade is that there should be one rule right across the board for everybody and that if that law is enforced there would be no difficulties.  We want to get as near to that as possible.  Deputy Colley may not understand or know the scene as outlined by Deputy Sean Barrett.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I do, but this is not the way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Colley does, she should readily understand why Deputy Barrett is trying to tighten up the definition of a waiting area.  I accept the thrust of his amendment.  I have no objection to it.  My only difficulty is that I have already had discussions with the parliamentary draftsman to try to come up with an appropriate format of words, as I do not think that Deputy Barrett's format of words will do what he, I and others want it to do.  On Report Stage we will have the benefit of the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, incorporating the thrust of Deputy Barrett's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that restaurateurs would be penalised if the areas in which drinks could be had while waiting for a meal were specified as being within a certain size.  I understand the concern Deputy Taylor showed in his contribution. The Deputy said that what we are talking about here is allowing drinks in association with a substantial meal. That is true, but we want to ensure that others who would not be half as scrupulous or as honest as Deputy Taylor and others in this House will not drive a coach and four through this so that we finish up having the Leeson Street strip scene <Col N="1819" /> throughout the length and breath of the country.  That is what I am trying to prevent and I say that without apology to anybody.</P>
    <P>I accept that Deputy Colley is not trying to advocate the extension of the Leeson Street scene but I am strongly advised that if we do not do as we are doing there is every likelihood that that is what will develop.  If we define the size of the waiting areas it is not for the purpose of making anybody hang a chart on the wall saying that areas in green constitute the dining room proper and that areas in red constitute the waiting room, and so on.  Nobody wants anything like that or to cause extra hassle for restaurateurs who are making a living and providing a good facility.  The genuine restaurateurs are more than anxious that we tighten up this definition of the waiting area as is suggested by Deputy Barrett. That is why I can quite readily accept the thrust of what the Deputy is suggesting.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest when we are doing this that we are here representing any particular association.  That was the second time here today that that accusation has come from the same party &mdash; from Deputy Colley now and from Deputy McDowell earlier on.  That is not good enough and it is something I want to nail here and now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to this debate and I have been concerned, as is the House, at the rather slow progress. I do not know if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the House when the Taoiseach gave that undertaking, that if we did not make sufficient progress the matter might be reviewed.  That is outside of our control at this stage and it is a matter for the Whips.</P>
      <P>A lot of restaurateurs are located in my constituency in Dublin South East and I have been approached by many and I am reflecting their views.  The sort of restaurants I refer to would automatically be included in the top list of premises designated by Bord Fáilte and qualifying on all the other criteria.  The restaurateurs' interpretation and their solicitors' interpretation of this Bill, specifically in relation to the points raised, is that where they have a bar they could well be required to remove it.  We all know of restaurants around town which have in the waiting area a place where people can sit and drinks are served in the normal way.  I accept that but it might be more appropriate to deal with this on Report Stage.  However, my constituents' concern is that, on top of having to pay a licence fee, when the Bill becomes law, they will be required to change the layout of the waiting area and remove the bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved in the design of a number of restaurants and so on.  The kind of restaurants we want to legalise, of necessity, have a waiting area and a waiting area traditionally has the facility to serve an aperitif or a pre-dinner drink. Because of the storage and the hygienic <Col N="1821" /> requirements associated with it, that usually comes from a bar.  If the legal interpretation of this Bill is such that owners are required to remove the bar it would damage the operation of the premises as a first-class quality restaurant and we would remove what is the intent of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have read the amendment put down by Deputy Barrett on behalf of Fine Gael and the amendment put down by Deputy Cooney in his own name and I support them.  I have been approached by quite a few restaurateurs who have drawn my attention to this point.  Some restaurateurs would not apply for a licence because the additional cost implicit in what could be interpreted would be prohibitive along with the cost of the licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be common case that we all want to see a waiting room or an anteroom in addition to the dining area, where people will gather before proceeding to dine and where they will have drinks.  The size of the waiting room in relation to the dining area is irrelevant, as Deputy Taylor said.  The waiting room will be a premises that will mainly be used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  That is inevitable, because the liquor that will be consumed will be sold in that room.  It will be billed with the meal, but the main use of that room will be for the consumption of intoxicating liquor, while people are waiting to have a meal.  That will be the nature of the waiting room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 (1) says that a restaurant which has a special restaurant licence shall not contain a bar.  The definition of a bar specifies that one of the ingredients of a bar is that it consists of a premises mainly used for the sale of intoxicating liquor, which is what the waiting room will be.  The point is that the definition of a bar inevitably and unavoidably includes the waiting room that we have all been talking about.  However, section 16 (1) excludes a restaurant from having a bar and we are defining a waiting room as a bar.  We have a contradiction here.  We cannot have a waiting room in the manner <Col N="1822" /> that we have been talking about if we have a definition of a bar as in this section.</P>

In broadening legislation, which is what we are doing here, we must ensure that we do not make any provision that will give rise to abuses.  As I have said, the legislation was broadened so as to allow for the granting of special licences for discos and dinners.  There have been abuses down through the years but I am glad that the Minister has reiterated what he said on Second Stage, that is, that there will not be one law for one section and another law for another.  I am glad the Minister is sticking to his guns on this matter.</P>

Just like Deputy Quinn, I would like to be reassured, just in case I misunderstood the Minister, that this Bill will not require a restaurant owner to change what is essentially the decor or otherwise he cannot serve drink.  Traditionally, there is some small area in a restaurant which looks like a section of what conventionally would be called a bar.  I would like to be assured that there is nothing contained in this Bill which would interfere with the physical object, which we call a bar, in a waiting area.</P>

The first is a purely physical object which, as a matter of mechanics, is indispensible for storing beer barrels and allowing water to be put on tap to dilute drink.  Surely, we are not going to require its removal if it exists at present in areas used by restaurants as waiting areas?</P>

I can think of two restaurants in this constituency which would automatically qualify for this type of licence.  One of them contains a counter. As Deputy Kelly has said, in order to be able to serve drink and comply with the hygiene regulations which Deputy Lynch is familiar with, one would need refrigeration, washing and storage facilities. These are combined usually in one physical object which fronts out into the waiting area.  People either sit beside it or they sit on easy chairs or stand beside it.  Alternatively, a person does business <Col N="1824" /> behind it and comes out from behind with a tray of drinks.</P>

      <P>What I hope to achieve with this amendment is some consistency.  As I understand it, when a person applies for a licence for a licensed premises they have to produce a map of the area to be licensed.  There appears to be no reference in the Bill to such a requirement in respect of a special restaurant licence. I thought it might be worth while putting down an amendment in order to find out the actual position.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Barrett that the intention of section 8 (1) is that the application for a <Col N="1825" /> special restaurant licence must show to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court that a Bord Fáilte certificate in respect of the restaurant is in force.  It would be inappropriate that any provision as to the content of such a certificate should be included in section 8 (1).  I note also that under the Deputy's amendment the map or plan would merely show the area of the restaurant concerned but need not show the disposition of the accommodation. The Deputy's amendment says that the area will be delineated and I presume the intention is that this would already have been done before the certificate was issued.  If the intention is that the Bord Fáilte certificate should have a plan of the restaurant attached, a provision to this effect would I think be more appropriate to subsection (2) of section 8 in view of the definition of the Bord Fáilte certificate in section 6.  The question as to whether a provision of this kind might be inserted in section 8 (2) will certainly be examined by me between now and Report Stage.  I will come back to this matter again on Report Stage.</P>

Restaurants often cluster in certain areas in towns, often bringing business to one another as a particular area acquires a reputation for good eating out facilities.  I would also have no objection from a public order point of view to having several such restaurants in a particular neighbourhood.  At the end of the day, and I am sure the Members of the House would agree with me, supply and demand will determine the number of restaurants in any area and I am quite happy with that.

      <P>My amendment, No. 13, asks that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; be inserted between the words &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;; in other words the subsection would read:</P>
      <P>Where in relation to a restaurant the Board is reasonably satisfied that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words the board must act reasonably in arriving at a decision as to whether they will grant a certificate.  We say here that the board will grant a certificate but one might well ask: what is the reality of the circumstances?  The reality is not that all the members of Bord Fáilte will travel down and look at a given restaurant.  The reality is that one person, an inspector or perhaps one member of the board &mdash; I do not know &mdash; will go and look at a restaurant.  We must be careful here that his level of satisfaction is a fair, objective and reasonable one and not subject to his whims or notions.  It is fair that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; be inserted to ensure an objective standard and balance in the very important decision involved.  When one thinks about it, the livelihood of that restaurateur may be at stake as a result of this decision.  It may well be that unless he gets his certificate he may have to close his restaurant, it may not be viable or competitive.  Therefore, it is a very important matter so far as the restaurateur is concerned.  It could mean the difference to him as to whether his restaurant would continue to be viable or would not be able to compete and would fail.  I would hope that the Minister would <Col N="1828" /> agree to insert the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; to ensure a level of objectivity.</P>
    <P>In my amendment No. 15 I am asking that the provision about regulations made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport on the conditions that have to be met be deleted.  I want to say this about the generality of bringing in ministerial regulations.  Very often in this House we go too far on this issue.  Perhaps the parliamentary draftsmen have an idea that one cannot enact any Act of the Oireachtas without providing for ministerial regulations.  One can.  We go too far on this.  Every measure we look at says that the Minister may make regulations on this, that and the other.  The volume of regulations is becoming massive; it must be a factor of 100 or 1000 of the legislation that emanates from this House.  I do not deny that it is necessary in many cases, of course it is, but I do not think we should allow ourselves to get carried away by the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set out in subsection (2) (b) a number of very well thought out conditions which I have read carefully, as I am sure have other Members.  They are a very fine, broad set of conditions. They cover every conceivable aspect of what is reasonable to enable a Bord Fáilte inspector to reasonably determine what is required.  I will just go through them briefly.  For example, he must be satisfied that a restaurant is well equipped, well furnished and provides comfortable seating in the dining area and waiting area. That is comprehensive so far as that aspect is concerned.  Second, he must be satisfied that the restaurant is operated by a competent management and staff and third provides a high standard of catering.  That is all very good.  The fourth requirement is that there must be at least one member of the staff who holds a recognised qualification in cooking or has sufficient experience in cooking to prepare meals of a high standard &mdash; that is first class and ideally meets the bill.  The fifth requirement is that the restaurant maintains a high standard of hygiene. Those conditions are well and comprehensively set down.  Why do we have to take on ourselves here and hand to <Col N="1829" /> the Minister the power to bring in other regulations of which the House would know nothing, would never realistically have a chance to debate &mdash; notwithstanding the saving clauses &mdash; because we all know what is the reality, particularly when the Minister proposes to arrogate to himself the power, in section 12 (2) (e), which is one of the most remarkable conditions.  There are certainly some delusions of grandeur there.  Having listed out certain parameters earlier on hygiene, catering, management, staff and so on, this subparagraph reads</P>
    <P>(e) any other matter which the Minister for Tourism and Transport considers to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>That is some wide-ranging power the House is being asked to give &mdash; any other matter at all, no matter what he, the Minister, considers necessary, he may being into law without any realistic reference to this House.  With all due respect to the Minister that is over-reaching himself.</P>
    <P>The conditions required for qualification for a Bord Fáilte certificate are well set out there and cover every possible range of requirement.  That adequately meets the position.  It appears to me that the need for further regulations to cover any other matter whatever that the Minister thinks up, without reference to this House, is not necessary. I contend that, if anything else arises, he should come back to the House and seek that power.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 13, I do not accept that the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in the opening line of section 8 (2) would add anything to the sense of the provision as it stands.  Indeed I am convinced that it would introduce an element of uncertainty. It might suggest that, if the board were not fully satisfied that the requisite standards were maintained, they might still issue a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 15, I should say that its effect would be that the decision as to whether a given restaurant <Col N="1830" /> was of an acceptable standard would be left totally to Bord Fáilte.  That would be the effect of that amendment, without any reference to regulations made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport under the provisions of section 12 (2) (e).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would be by reference to the conditions laid down in section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would not.  I might refer the Deputy to the provisions of section 8 (2) (b) which says:</P>
      <P>(b) in case no such regulations are in force,...</P>
      <P>So it will be only in the case of regulations not being made that the conditions set out would apply.  In my view it is clearly necessary, not merely that minimum standards for regulations should be prescribed, but that every interested party should be in a position to know what are these standards.  Clearly that objective would be best met by way of regulation.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Taylor's amendment would mean it would be a matter for the board to decide the standard to be met in every case but we will spell them out much more clearly in these regulations.  Deputy Taylor knows as well as any other Member of this House that these matters are not beyond discussion in this House because any Member of the House may move their annulment within so many days and have the matter discussed here; it has happened before.</P>

      <P>I really do not appreciate the Minister's point at all.  I do not know exactly what additional requirements the Minister will introduce by way of his regulations. If my amendment was adopted the statute itself would provide that a restaurant has to be well equipped and furnished.  It appears the Minister will bring in regulations to deal with equipment and furnishing.  I am trying to imagine what might be contained in these regulations; for example, that the colour scheme has to be suitable to the eye, that the chairs had to have a cushion depth of, say, two inches.  If there is a ground of reasonable objectivity provided by the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; those conditions are also set out in section 8, which is the right and proper place to do so.  They are set out and my amendment does not delete those conditions, not at all.  Rather it highlights them, rendering them the over-riding conditions by which Bord Fáilte would have to be reasonably guided.  One might well ask: why did the Minister bother inserting them at all?  It is right and proper that they should be set out in the statute and the Minister has rightly and properly done that.  The conditions which a restaurant would have to meet with regard to furnishings, equipment, seating, competent management and staff and so on, are set out and I cannot see how much further regulations will advance this issue because these conditions are spelt out already in section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble.  They are not spelt out but they will be spelt <Col N="1832" /> out properly and fully in very specific detail by way of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What more can be spelt out about furnishings &mdash; the colour of the curtains or whether they are lined?  I think this has been borne out of the concept that we must have ministerial regulations for everything, whether or not they are necessary.  I accept that they are necessary in many cases but when the Minister has gone to the trouble of laying down the parameters what is wrong with inserting the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>If it is left to the satisfaction of the board they might say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied with this restaurant&rdquo;.  As I said, it is not the board who will decide that.  I do not know how many members are on the board of Bord Fáilte but let us say there are ten members.  They are not going to go down to Mr. Jones's restaurant to check out whether it should receive a certificate. Probably not even one member of the board will go down to the restaurant.  An inspector will go down to the restaurant and it will be on his say so that the very important decision as to whether a certificate should be granted will be made. It will be done on the say so of one inspector in much the same way as an inspector in An Bord Pleanála appeals hears all the oral evidence and so on. The members of An Bord Pleanála who makes the decisions are never seen at these hearings and the same thing will happen in this case.  An inspector who is not a member of the board will check out the restaurant.  The real question is whether the inspector will or will not be satisfied that a restaurant meets the requirements.  That is what will happen and that is why I say the element of reasonableness should be introduced into it.  Why should an important decision, perhaps affecting a man's livelihood, in regard to obtaining a certificate be decided according to the whim of one inspector?  Why should he not act reasonably and objectively in coming to that decision rather than being guided by his own personal whim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day I cannot see how the regulations are going to be any more <Col N="1833" /> definitive on matters such as the operations of a competent management and staff.  When the staff see an inspector coming in to a restaurant they will, no matter what they are in reality, be very competent and efficient while he is there. It is fair that we should insist on the element of reasonableness and no doubt a court may deem it to be there even though it is not there.  With the insertion of one word we could spell it out and assist a court, if a case goes to court on this issue, by saying that a person was adopting an objective standard and not his own personal foibles or views, which might well differ from inspector to inspector.  There might be a half a dozen inspectors employed by Bord Fáilte to check out restaurants and decide whether a certificate should be granted.  One inspector might have one idea on what is a high standard of catering and another inspector might have a different idea. Some balance ought to be achieved here and I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to help any Deputy who is trying to improve the Bill but I honestly do not see much need for Deputy Taylor's suggestion.  As he hinted a moment ago in a subordinate clause, and as a lawyer, he knows perfectly well that even though a statutory power does not explicitly require the person on whom it is being conferred to exercise it reasonably and objectively, the courts take the view, and have for decades taken the view, that it must be so construed on the simple supposition that this House does not create powers with any other object in view other than they should be reasonably applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inspector's set of perceptions are to some extent no doubt born into him and conveyed to him by his parents because no two people grow up in houses where exactly the same standards of order or cleanliness apply.  They may differ only minutely but everybody has a different perception of where the line is to be drawn which will separate that which is clean from that which is not. That is unavoidable in human affairs and it is even unavoidable on the judicial <Col N="1834" /> bench.  As Deputy Taylor knows better than I do, no two justices will take exactly the same view in exactly the same case on the same set of facts or if they do it will be an accident.  That is why the public occasionally get excited and upset because a judge or justice takes what to them seems a very perverse view of something. It may be perverse but that does not mean it is not the result of an honestly exercised discretion.  All the Dáil and Seanad can do in conferring a jurisdication or power upon a judge, court or authority is expect that it will be honestly and reasonably applied but there can be no rational expectation that it will be applied with a mechanically measurable consistency. That is not given to flesh and blood to command.</P>
    <P>If I thought there were reasons to suppose that inspectors, in spite of that being the law, were nevertheless going to run wild I would be inclined to urge the Minister to make sure, at an official level, that that did not happen.  However, since it would be against the law for an official to apply capricious views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; of what was in conformity with this or that kind of standard, I do not think this amendment is necessary. It is against the law as it stands without the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.  I would be glad to put in a word for Deputy Taylor's amendment if I thought it would improve the Bill.  I often used to make such points when I started off but over the years and, in particular, during the past ten or 15 years, the law on this has become so solidified that there is scarcely anything less in doubt than that a statutory power must be exercised within the four corners of natural or constitutional justice, as it is called now, and one of the many aspects that term includes is the aspect of behaving impartially, reasonably and with an eye to the objects for which the power was conferred on you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned specifically section 8 (2) which states &ldquo;in <Col N="1835" /> case no such regulations are in force, the restaurant &mdash;&rdquo; and it lists the conditions required in about eight to ten lines.  I mentioned in reply to Deputy John Kelly earlier today that we have draft regulations practically completed.  They are not completed yet but they are not far from it.  There are seven and a bit pages in the regulations clarifying exactly for those intending applicants the conditions they will have to meet before they apply. This is an effort to make it easier for them to understand what is required of them and it will not be left to the whims of one inspector to say whether they are out or in.  They will know exactly what they are entitled to and what is required of them so that they can best make their case for their application.</P>
      <P>I want again to say to Deputy Taylor that the publication of these regulations will be of great benefit to all those who are interested in applying for licences because they spell out in great detail what is required of them.  The House will have an opportunity of discussing them and to propose their annulment.  If the Deputy is afraid he will not get an opportunity of discussing them I will use whatever good offices I have with my Whip &mdash; and I do not know how good they are &mdash; to see to it that there will be a discussion on them. I would not object to it because it is something we are all interested in.  There is no political party divide on anything in this Bill, nor should there be.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 35, after &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including <i>inter alia</i> by annual inspection&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I intend here is that it be made quite clear that before Bord Fáilte issue <Col N="1836" /> a renewal certificate the premises are inspected annually.  That is necessary so that standards can be maintained.  I would also be anxious that the taxpayer would not be asked to fund the cost of these inspections.  Would it be in order for the regulations the Minister is making to include a provision that the cost of inspections would be borne by the applicant?  If it is not possible to do it that way, perhaps the Minister would consider introducing an appropriate amendment on Report Stage to see that that is done.  It is only reasonable that those seeking licences should carry the cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for his contribution on this amendment. The regulations will provide that the cost of inspections will be borne by the applicant. If some poor restaurateur from Dingle is to bear the full cost of a journey from Dublin to Dingle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if we would get anybody there.  We could not afford these luxuries in working class constituencies. It is a matter that we are all conscious of. The cost will have to be borne by the applicant and it is a matter for the board to ensure that the inspector will inspect as many in the region as possible rather than charging somebody £200 to £500 for a visit; nobody would want to see that happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment it will be noted that under section 12 (2) the intention is that arrangements for the inspection of restaurants in connection with the grant of a Bord Fáilte certificate is a matter to be regulated by regulations. <Col N="1837" /> I am satisfied that this provision is appropriate as such arrangements can be satisfactorily made only in the light of the contents of the regulations themselves, that is, the number of and the average standard in restaurants applying, and of course the staff of inspectors available to Board Fáilte.  I am confident that the board will arrange for such inspections as are necessary to ensure that certificates will not be granted or renewed if the restaurant concerned falls below the requisite standard.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Barrett's amendment calls for an annual inspection.  It would be my intention to ensure, by way of regulation, that there would be more than just the one inspection.  I think that would be Deputy Barrett's intention too. Certainly there would have to be an inspection before a renewal application would be decided on and I would like to think that inspections would be carried out at other times by the Bord Fáilte staff during the course of the operation of the licence.  If the Deputy agrees that we should cover this by regulation I feel that this would be the best place to cover it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Barrett says in regard to the cost of these inspections but I do want to tell the Minister that, in my opinion anyway, if he intends that that should be so and if he intends that the regulations regarding standards should provide for levying a charge on the premises that are being inspected, it will have to be said in this Bill that those regulations may so provide. There is a case on this subject, already nearly 70 years old, Murphy and the Waterford Corporation, that appears <Col N="1838" /> rather analogous to what we are talking about.</P>

      <P>I agree in theory with the thrust of the amendment Deputy Barrett has introduced here but my concern is that Bord Fáilte simply will not have the numbers of inspectors necessary to carry out this work.  Presumably it will mean an increase in work because this is not being done at present.  If we are to keep control on it we need to make sure that these places are inspected.  The Minister has referred to the fact that he is very keen to have this done also.  I just would not like us to leave open and uncatered for a situation where there would be a wish to have an annual inspection or a wish to have more than an annual inspection.</P>

I have kept a hand in on that to ensure that it goes the right way.  I take the Deputy's point and I recognise the difficulty as expressed there about the availability of staff but it will have to be done.  There is no question of these licences being renewed on a &ldquo;pay your fee and get your licence&rdquo; basis.  That would defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2) (b), to delete lines 39 to 49.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 is consequential on the amendment of section 12 by deleting the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I note that Deputy Colley has a similar amendment.  If it is to be obligatory for the Minister to make regulations there is no need to have subsection (2) (b) of section 8 included.  I sincerely hope that the Minister can, on this occasion, see his way to accepting the amendment that Deputy Colley and I have down in relation to section 12 (1) in line 46 substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  This is important because, as the Minister said, the regulations that have been drafted are very comprehensive.  That is the way it should be and if that is the case I see no reason for including section 8 (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 as it stands empowers the Minister for Transport to make restaurant standard regulations. The effect of this amendment would be to oblige him to make those regulations. This question was raised when the Bill was being drafted and the advice received from the Attorney General was that it was not appropriate to impose an obligation on the Minister concerned to make regulations in such circumstances.  I am <Col N="1840" /> advised by the Attorney General that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would not be appropriate. I repeat that the intention is that these regulations will be made before Part II of the Bill is brought into operation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposed amendment to section 12 (2), it is not clear that this would add to the sense of the subsection as it stands.  The effect of subsection (2) is that the regulations may make provision for all or any specified matters. To say that the regulations shall make provision for all or any of the specified matters would not alter significantly the scope of the provision.  The point raised by Deputy Barrett and by Deputy Colley was raised by us with the Attorney General. The advice he gave us was that it was not appropriate that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be inserted rather than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 16 in the name of Deputy Barrett, I want to make it clear that the intention is that Part II of the Bill which relates to special restaurant licences will not be brought into force until the relevant standards regulations have been made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  The provision covered by the Deputy's amendment relating to the case where no such regulations were in force was inserted for a technical, drafting reason. This is because section 12 empowers the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make the necessary regulations.  I have been assured that for technical and legal reasons it would not be appropriate to say that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make the regulations.  Accordingly paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 8 was inserted to cover the theoretical case where regulations had not been made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that these provisions will not be brought into force until the regulations have been made.  I hope the Deputy will consider that and perhaps withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what reasons the Minister has in mind but I can think of two instances, admittedly unlikely to occur, where it might be necessary to <Col N="1841" /> have the fall back protection of the subsection we are talking about.  One would be &mdash; I do not ever remember it happening &mdash; where this House annulled regulations which were in force.  Suppose the House is given power by a section in the Bill to annul regulations and if such an annulment took place and if there was a delay, for whatever reason, in getting new regulations in place, there would be during that period &mdash; which perhaps could be a tourist season &mdash; no regulations in force, and then there would be no form of control unless these provisions were there.  The other slightly less unlikely instance would be where the High Court declared the whole body of such regulations void for some reason, for example, that the person who purported to make them was not a Minister but was dressed up as a Minister and masquerading as this or that.  Such things have happened.  We had a case not too many years ago when somebody who was not masquerading but had been in all good faith made a district justice and was not qualified to be a district justice.  A question mark hung, therefore, over things which he had done, including the conviction imposed by him on the person who successfully challenged his appointment. These would be two settings &mdash; unlikely and marginal though they are&mdash; in which I could see some reason for that subsection to remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

      <P>I would be in agreement with Deputy Kelly on amendment No. 16.  Even if Deputy Barrett's amendment and my amendment which propose to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; were there I could see good reason for leaving in 8 (2) (b).  However, I am not convinced by what the Minister has said about the reasoning for keeping the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  At the very least we should have some provision in the Bill whereby it would provide that the regulations shall come into force before the commencement date.  I understand the Minister saying they are in draft form and they are in preparation and it is the intention that they should be in force before this part of the Bill is brought <Col N="1842" /> into operation, but in order to tidy matters up it would be reasonable to expect that it would be incorporated in the Bill.</P>

As it stands it is discretionary for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make regulations.  If the Bill is passed as it is presented here now the Dáil has no power to impose on any Minister obligations to make regulations.

      <P>The decision that would be made by the board here as to whether to grant this certificate could well be a matter of supreme importance to very many restaurant owners who would seek to get such a certificate.

    <P>While the Minister has indicated he is going to make detailed regulations and all the rest of it, and no doubt he will and they will be as specific as possible, at the end of the day when all those factors are taken into account there is an overall decision still of the Bord Fáilte inspector or Bord Fáilte themselves as to whether <Col N="1844" /> the restaurant meets the overall standards required.  It is a subjective decision on the standard of catering and so on. There is still the decision to be made and that is in essence a judicial decision, a matter of fact, whether this restaurant meets the standard or does not.  If that inspector holds against the person and says, &ldquo;Sir, I am sorry, your restaurant does not meet the standard&rdquo;, are we saying to him that that is the end of the story, that so far as obtaining his certificate is concerned he is out and cannot dispute or argue or discuss further with someone in a judicial capacity whether his restaurant meets the standard?  There must be some basis for a judicial appeal here and it could well be that within constitutional requirements there should be because this decision could affect the livelihood of very many people.</P>
    <P>As we know, under the Constitution judicial decisions overall have to be made by judges of a court, the District Court, Circuit Court or whatever.  It may not arise very often, but it ought to be open at least that if a person is aggrieved that he has not got a fair decision he has this right to appeal.  Maybe an inspector in one case will get it wrong.  Judicial decisions are often wrong.  Even High Court judges get things wrong and are overruled from time to time by the Supreme Court, so it follows that Bord Fáilte can get it wrong on occasion. Whether they get it wrong or not there must be at least one avenue of appeal open to the restauranteur to take it further and argue before a district justice, call evidence about it and so on and get an impartial decision on this appeal.  The appeals procedure is intrinsic to our whole system, and rightly so.  It would be dangerous and damaging to say that on the decision of this inspector alone &mdash; which is what it amounts to &mdash; the important matter of a man's livelihood perhaps will be determined without his having any further recourse whatever.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Taylor in what he is trying to achieve with this amendment.  I am not certain this is the way to do it but there should be some <Col N="1845" /> appeal.  I am not certain whether there is in existence a form of appeal in other similar circumstances where decisions are taken by certain boards to grant or not grant certificates, but we should have regard to this and make sure it is available to an applicant for a certificate under this Bill.  Such a decision is akin to a judicial decision and we would have to have regard to previous cases on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor's amendment does not appear to relate to an appeal on legal grounds to the court but rather seems to envisage that there should be an appeal to the court in relation to the findings of Bord Fáilte as to whether the restaurant in question complied with the requisite standards.  A provision of this kind would probably have the effect that there would be an appeal in every case to the District Court against a refusal by the board to grant a certificate.  This means the court would have to become the inspecting body in such cases to decide whether the restaurant in question was well equipped, provided the high standard of catering and so on.  This would be an inappropriate function for the court and clearly a matter that should be left to decisions by Bord Fáilte on the basis of the professional expertise available to them.  That is the most sensible course.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to expect a district justice to be able to make decisions on these matters because they are not judicial matters at all.  They are being decided on by Bord Fáilte on the basis of their professionalism and the expertise available to them.  On examination of the application they would see that the requirements of the applicant as laid out in the regulations are being met or not.  It is very wrong that the district justice would be asked to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Colley to a certain extent.  I see what Deputy Taylor is getting at, but getting into the District Court there may be an appeal to the Circuit Court and so on.  In effect, what is being decided is a question of fact, not of law, and the people who <Col N="1846" /> are expert in it are the inspectors of Bord Fáilte, not a district justice.  Probably Deputy Taylor and most people around here are well aware that district justices are over-burdened with technical matters from time to time and really they were not appointed to become involved in this.</P>
      <P>If Bord Fáilte for some reason were not able to give a certificate it would then be up to them to tell the applicant why he did not come up to their standards and at that stage the person would be in a position, it is to be hoped, to bring his premises up to the required standard in a short time.  I put forward for analogy of the Planning Appeals Board, An Bord Pleanála.  While they deal with appeals from the local authority they also are the final arbiter in relation to planning matters.  That is on the same lines as this matter here.  Bord Fáilte make the decision and that is the end of it.  It is open to the applicant to bring his premises up to the required standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, respectfully, with what the Minister and Deputy Ahern have said and for the same reasons.  There are administrative functions which are entrusted to people who are not judges and who are expected to be expert in the application of those standards.  Courts are not expected to be experts in the application of standards of that sort. Because Ministers for Local Government in the old days were finally seen by the Dáil, the Seanad and Government as not being expert in the decision of planning appeals the thing was confined at the appeal stage to a specially selected board, so carefully selected that the Government of the day would not even trust themselves to appoint the board but set up a special authority who would be a kind of buffer between themselves and the planning appeals board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is really everything in what the Minister and Deputy Ahern said here. Virtually every refusal would be appealed instantly in the District Court to a justice who is not equipped to assess these matters, to whom every step of the process of inspecting and licensing would have to be explained and who would be asked <Col N="1847" /> then to exercise his layman's judgment on what is clean for adequate purposes in the restaurant world, what is orderly, what is tidy and so on.  He might have no other training in the matter than what we saw in his own kitchen.  I need not embroider the theme, but I think the court would be quite an inappropriate forum.  If it is desired to have a process of appeal against Bord Fáilte &mdash; although we have enough boards to sink a battleship &mdash; it should be to an authority constituted by people who know something about the standards which the original inspector was commanded by this House to apply.</P>
    <P>If it is suggested that the inspector, or Bord Fáilte acting on the inspector's report, have behaved unreasonably, that they have not listened to something the applicant said, that they have not given him a chance to meet an objection they had up their sleeves and if there is a file in the building saying that this man is to be screwed because he got away with murder two years ago, then the applicant, if he has grounds for a grievance, can seek a remedy in the High Court.  That would instantly deprive Bord Fáilte of their jurisdiction either to issue or to refuse a licence.  It would make their entire proceedings null.  The District Court is not the appropriate place to deal with the question of whether a zinc fitting has been adequately cleared of residue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the comments on this issue, particularly by Deputy Kelly.  Are we really saying that decisions on matters of fact &mdash; not law &mdash; which are determined by all courts on different issues by district justices and other judges will be in the hands of one inspector of Bord Fáilte?  Will there be no recourse to any other court or tribunal?  It is no good saying that district justices and judges are not competent to deal with matters involving expertise.  That is a remarkable thing to say because they come to decisions on matters of expertise &mdash; and are called on to do so &mdash; every day of the week.  Decisions could involve the value of premises, medical evidence <Col N="1848" /> and so on.  It is interesting to hear the Minister say that he places his trust in experts.  If he went down to the courts some day and heard two orthopaedic surgeons, on opposite sides of the fence, giving contradictory opinions he would not have such wonderful faith in experts. It is the judge or jury who determine which of the experts is accepted.</P>
      <P>You cannot leave the applicant on an important issue affecting his livelihood without recourse to some appeals procedure. That would be most unjust.  I do not mind whether it is a tribunal or a panel of experts otherwise constituted.  I put down the District Court because it is simple, easy, available, cheap and quick. If the Minister says he intends to set up another tribunal I do not mind.  Deputy Ahern mentioned An Bord Pleanála and he said it was not composed of judges. However, I think a judge is involved on the panel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not a court but it is an appeals procedure and if a person feels, rightly or wrongly, that he has been badly done by he can appeal the decision to a higher authority.  He can have an oral hearing and call his own experts to give evidence before an independent authority who may be contradicted by the other experts as happens all the time in the court.  However, a judicial decision would then be given and it is no small matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a small rural area the inspector sent down might know the applicant for the certificate and indeed he might have a grudge against him.  He might come to a biased conclusion and refuse the certificate. It could mean that the applicant would have to close his restaurant and give up his livelihood without any recourse to an appeal.  It is totally unacceptable that a major decision of this kind should be left to one person and I am <Col N="1849" /> amazed that Deputy Kelly, of all people, would seek to uphold that position.</P>
    <P>Professionals differ on all sorts of important issues.  All the factors must be taken into account, the standard of the cooking, equipment and accommodation. The standards are laid down in the Bill and will be reinforced, no doubt, in the regulations.  We are talking about big, standard restaurants.  Professional experts who are competent to give decisions should be called in to give a second opinion.  I know the Bord Fáilte inspector is also an expert but he is merely an employee.  I respect his decisions but others might take a different view.  He might recommend that an applicant should spend another £5,000 to bring the restaurant up to standard but the applicant might not have the money to do so.  Perhaps another expert would have a different opinion.</P>
    <P>If the applicant had recourse to an appeals tribunal the evidence on both sides could be heard and a decision could well be given that the Bord Fáilte inspector got it wrong.  Are we saying that the Bord Fáilte inspector can never be wrong, that he will be spot on every time? Do we say that about district justices, Circuit Court judges or High Court judges?  We do not, we admit they could be wrong.  However, we are saying that the Bord Fáilte inspector can never be wrong.  Of course he can and will get it wrong on the odd occasion just as the High Court judges get it wrong sometimes. Will we elevate him to a more superior position than the High Court judge?  Do we really believe that his decision is so special it may not be appealed to any court or tribunal?  If that is the case, I cannot accept it because it is totally unreasonable, illogical and unjust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Taylor is overstating the case when he says that the decision will lie in the hands of one person because the Bill states that the board must be satisfied.  An inspector may inspect the premises and, if he is dissatisfied with them and does not issue a certificate, the applicant may apply to <Col N="1850" /> the board for a further inspection.  The board must be satisfied, even if that involves all members of the board having to take a train trip to places like Tralee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unrealistic to look for appeals to a court of law on such matters because where there are unreasonable decisions there is a course of action open to the applicant.  A later amendment, tabled by the Minister, is to the effect that steps to be taken within a specified period must be set out so that the person who is applying gets an opportunity to adhere to them.  That is only right and just.  I do not think there is a necessity to go into the court system for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On listening to Deputy Taylor for the second time I appreciate what I had missed hearing the first time or did not sufficiently concentrate on, the element of livelihood.  There is this much to be said for his point of view; if the withholding of a certificate was a function which bore immediately on a person's livelihood one might argue that the power entrusted to Bord Fáilte went beyond that envisaged by Article 37 of the Constitution, that it was, first, an administration of justice and, secondly, that it was something being done in a matter which was serious and far reaching.  In my view it will be necessary to show that this was an administration of justice, in the first instance, and that it was not limited or far reaching.  They are two hurdles which Deputy Taylor's liberal enthusiasm, which in a general sense I must share, would find it hard to clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No modern State could operate if there was an appeal to the ordinary courts from every administrative decision made. Under the planning process, which Deputies Ahern and Taylor mentioned, it is true that a former judge is the chairman of An Bord Pleanála but that does not convert it into a court.  It certainly gives it a high cosmetic value and, no doubt, makes its operations smoother <Col N="1851" /> because it has a chairman who is accustomed to seeing justice done but it does not make it into a court.  I would imagine that a person who is impoverished and whose only asset is a house which as it stands is not worth very much but which would be worth so much that it could get him out of all his troubles if he got permission for a change of use, when putting up for decision by other citizens in a position of authority a question which is extremely important to him &mdash; it may be as important to him as a question of livelihood or a question of a choice of livelihood between somebody running one type of restaurant and a person running another &mdash; has no claim to have the technical aspects of that issue decided by an ordinary court.  Of course, he can have recourse to the High Court if he is not fairly treated.</P>
    <P>There is a whole battery of mixed powers here, some exercised by people who from first to last are not judges. Some of them are mixed functions like the old workmen's compensation system, but we are very far from the time when it was possible for the late Gavan Duffy, when he was at the Bar, to argue that there should be no such thing anywhere as an administrative operation entrusted to anybody except a judge sitting in a court.  No State could operate like that.</P>
    <P>I would be very sorry to lose whatever reputation I may have in Deputy Taylor's eyes for being a reasonably liberal character, if I enjoy that much standing with him, but I do not think there is a State &mdash; the pinker the regime gets the less it would be true to say of it &mdash; with any kind of independent judicial instance to adjudicate on peoples' rights.  Even the most liberal bourgeois western democracy could not operate for a day if that was the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in relation to a restaurant that is closed down under the health Acts?  Is there a right of appeal against the decision to close such restaurants?  I accept that Deputy Taylor is genuine in seeking to protect the livelihood of people but we <Col N="1852" /> are not talking about closing down a restaurant but about not providing them with a liquor licence.  There must be precedents for the closing of premises under the health Acts and I hope the Minister will be able to give us information in regard to them.  If he is not in a position to do so, I respectfully suggest that he look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Taylor's amendment and I cannot understand why there is so much opposition to it.  We are referring to one individual, the Bord Fáilte representative.  We must bear in mind that a licence is granted by our courts on the basis of a certificate signed by a representative of Bord Fáilte.  Subsection (2) (a) provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Tourism and Transport but I wonder why there is a need for subsection (2) (b) which states, &ldquo;in case no such regulations are in force&rdquo; and so on.  A Bord Fáilte official may be very competent but not in a position to determine what standard of catering is required by the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>A district justice is aware of the law and will act in accordance with it but in this section we are told about regulations that may be brought in by the Minister for Tourism and Transport. In my view it is unreasonable to ask a person who applies for a licence to rely on the recommendation of one person. As Deputy Taylor stated, such an individual may have had a difference with the person who is applying for a licence. There should be some form of appeal for a person who feels aggrieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears we are unduly worried about the Bord Fáilte official. That person will not decide for himself or herself whether a restaurant qualifies for a certificate but will be acting in accordance with the statutory regulations prepared to guide that official.  The regulations will be clear to the person applying for the licence before he or she embarks <Col N="1853" /> on any renovations.  That person will be in a position to take advice on what is required in his or her premises.  If the Bord Fáilte official turns out to be so incompetent that he is unable to give a reasonable interpretation of the statutory regulation, it is open to the individual to go to Bord Fáilte and ask for his decision to be overturned.  Bord Fáilte are in the business of licensing hotels, which are much bigger enterprises than the businesses we are talking about here.  I do not know of any hotel which should be approved by Bord Fáilte and has failed to gain that approval.  The people in Bord Fáilte will give advice as to what is required before any work is undertaken. Any reasonable person who wants to obtain an intoxicating liquor licence for his restaurant should not have the sort of problems being envisaged.  There is some responsibility on that person to find out what is required before be spends any money.</P>

In the case of a person who has, say, ten bedrooms and a dispense bar, problems can on occasion arise with Bord Fáilte. They are doing a difficult job in that standards must be maintained.  The vast majority of the staff of Bord Fáilte are most conscientious and diligent in the discharge of their duties.  Sometimes, however, friction can develop between the proprietor of a premises and the Bord Fáilte official.  I have been asked to arbitrate in such cases.  Bord Fáilte are a lot bigger and more powerful then the owner of a licensed premises.  The Judiciary are independent and impartial and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the view <Col N="1854" /> expressed by Deputy Taylor but there appears to be agreement among all the other speakers that the way suggested by him for dealing with the problem is not the right or proper way.  I suggest that between now and Report Stage I should consider the matter and see if in the event of a person being refused a licence he can be told the reason.  Bearing in mind the extent of the regulations, he should be clearly told what needs to be put in order before he can get a licence.  If the Deputy will agree to withdraw his amendment and let me work along those lines, we might be able to go part of the way towards meeting his concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not quite meet what I have in mind.  If a person is refused, the reasons for the refusal ought to be given to him, without doing any favour to anybody.  That is a different matter to providing an appeals procedure, which I believe to be essential.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the question of livelihood.  I was approached by a person who runs a middle-of-the-road type restaurant and she told me of her position <i>vis-à-vis</i> this Bill.  She said she could not afford £3,000 for a licence but that if she did not get it she would have to close down because her competitors would obtain a licence.  In many cases a licence will mean the difference between staying in business and closing down.  If nobody could get a licence there would be no problem, but if some people get licences and others do not the people who want to have a drink will know where to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley's point about Bord Fáilte does not impress me.  The reality is that the inspector will give his report to Bord Fáilte and, in accordance with the usual secretive practice, the contents of the report will be secret.  We all know that the decision at headquarters will be based entirely on what the inspector says. The inspector actually makes the decision.  Deputy Cowen said an appeal against the inspector's decision could be <Col N="1855" /> made to Bord Fáilte.  That is not provided for in the Bill.  The applicant will not know the inspector's decision until he is told by Bord Fáilte of the refusal.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why there is resistence to allowing an appeals procedure in such an important matter.  It is a matter of such importance affecting the livelihood of people that it should not rest on the view of just one person.  The standard of catering is one of the issues. No matter what the Minister provides or how much detail he specifies in the regulations, the inspector from Bord Fáilte will give his opinion as to whether the standard of catering is in accordance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will consider before Report Stage introducing an appeals procedure of some sort, that will satisfy me. Otherwise it is my intention to call for a vote on this issue.</P>

      <P>When somebody applies for a certificate from Bord Fáilte and does not get it, the board must tell him why. Deputy Taylor is overstating his case somewhat when he says that the applicant will not be given sight of the inspector's report.  He will not be given sight of the inspectorate's report, but the substance <Col N="1856" /> of what the board have against issuing the certificate and of the reasons for this must be made known to him so that he can have a chance either to challenge the opinion which has been formed to show that somebody has made a mistake or has not looked at something, or else to put the matter right.  I take it for granted &mdash; I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that if it is intimated to him by the board that a certificate will not issue and he asks why and is told that there is a population of cockroaches under the soup or something like that, he will ask if his application may be held on ice for a few weeks until he puts the thing right.  Alternatively, even if he is shot down and a certificate is formally refused in black and white, he still must be told why it has been refused and, presumably, there is nothing to prevent him from reapplying a week later once he has carried out the necessary works.  I quite accept that that does not amount to an appeals procedure, or perhaps even to a substitute for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Taylor talks on his amendment, may I make a suggestion?  I understand that we are not getting any additional time, which I regret in view of the fact that we have a number of amendments to complete and also in view of the fact that my Private Members Bill on underage drinking was withdrawn on the clear understanding that we would get time to debate it when it came forward as part of this Bill.  Now we find that not alone will we not get the opportunity to debate that Bill, but there is the likelihood that we might not be able to debate it here this evening on Committee Stage.  That is extremely <Col N="1859" /> unsatisfactory, and no way to do business. However, it has been agreed.  The very minimum we should do is divide the remainder of the time between now and 10.30 p.m. so that every part of this Bill will at least get some airing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree to that. Perhaps the Chair would ask the Whips to do as Deputy Barrett suggests and that the Whips will meet and devise some time division for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, certainly the debate in both Private Members' time and on this Bill indicates that there is substantial interest in the area dealing with underage drinking.  It would be appreciated if the Whips would bear in mind that that is a part of the Bill we would like to give a little bit of time to tonight.</P>

      <P>My amendment reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (b), lines 21 to 23, to delete &ldquo;or such other amount as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister would have no difficulty in accepting this amendment because he told us this is exactly what the present position is during the course of the debate this morning.  The House will recall that this section outlines the fee, £3,000, which would be payable on a once-off basis for a licence.  The Minister assured the House this morning that there was no question of this fee being increased.  He said it would be a once-off payment.  That being so, I do not think the necessity for regulations would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a need <Col N="1860" /> for us to make more rapid progress but I would like to say to Deputy Taylor that this is a once-off fee for a first time applicant. Anybody who applies now would pay this once-off fee and no more but the Minister surely should have the power to adjust the fee in four years, six years or ten years time by way of regulation. Again, it would still be a once-off fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also understood from the debate this morning that there are many of us who could see this fee being increased within a much shorter period of time and not just in four years, six years or ten years time.  There could be a need to review that figure either upwards or downwards in four months, six months, or 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That could only be done by way of regulation and if such a regulation incurred the displeasure of the House it could take steps to annul it but it is not the intention to increase the fee.  It amounts to a once-off payment of £3,000 for a first time applicant but I am not too sure that too many people would argue that that would be the proper figure for a first time applicant to pay in ten years time.  It is a question of giving the Minister of the day the power to adjust that once-off fee by way of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised an amendment has not been put down to adjust the figure upwards, a figure which I regard as being very reasonable indeed.  The issuing of special restaurant licences so as to enable restaurants to sell intoxicating liquor would be a departure from the long-established principles that in order to obtain a new intoxicating liquor licence one would first be required to extinguish two existing licences.  The present position is that a person who is in the trade and who wishes to start a new business in a premises which would meet the criteria set out in the licensing laws such as there being adequate demand and it being far enough away from existing licensed premises in an area has to go out and buy two existing licences which could cost anything between £14,000 and £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> It seems in this instance we are being very generous indeed especially when we consider that there are already enough intoxicating liquor licences available for sale at present and before a new licence could be issued the person has to extinguish two existing licences.  There are many licensed premises which have a very small trade and which are probably available for sale.  I am surprised an attempt was not made to find out how many of those licences are available for sale so that some arrangement where-by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am too direct it will become obvious my vested interest will be declared.  I take the point which has been made, that this is a matter for the Minister to consider before Report Stage.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the fee of £3,000 because I think it discriminates against those who are already in the trade and who, if they want to buy another licence, have to buy two existing licences which would cost anything between £14,000 and £20,000. The figure in the Bill is regarded by the Minister as reasonable.  Presumbly some people at the Cabinet table think it should be increased while others think it should be less and because of this the figure which has been inserted in the Bill is what is considered reasonable by those who considered the Bill before it was introduced into the House.</P>
      <P>Like other members of my party, I believe the figure is too low.  One of the reasons why the figure is so low is to enable us to cater for those restaurants which are not open 12 months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> It would be considered too much of an imposition to ask them to pay more than £3,000 for a licence.  I suggest that if they do not remain open 12 month of the year that they are making their living from something else.  The person I am talking about is the ordinary person in the street who would like to see the figure raised above £3,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the same context. It is worth remembering that the licence issued under this Bill would be a special restaurant licence which would not be similar to the licence issued in respect of a licensed premises.  It would be odious to make comparisons between the two and we would only get into difficulties if we continued along that road.  I agree the Minister should have the right to increase or decrease the licence fee if things become wonderful in economic terms in this State and, being realistic, it is reasonable that the Minister would have the power to increase the fee at a future date.  I would like to point out to those Members of this House who are attempting to mix up the two licences and the two establishments in question that there is a huge difference between a licensed premises which deals purely in drink and a restaurant which serves drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with much of what Deputy Colley has said. Any time I have heard Deputy Cowen speak, except on the occasion when he spoke on the divorce referendum Bill when it was very hard to know which way he was going to vote let alone on what he was advising everybody else to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I advised no one, not even the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1863" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spent about one hour and half doing so.  On other occasions I find I agree with everything I hear coming from him but on this occasion I disagree with him.  Deputy Colley's point is very well taken.  We are not talking here about a drink licence.  It is infinitely more valuable to have a licence which would enable a person to sell drink, as much as they can pack in during opening hours, than a licence which has attached to it a condition regarding the serving of a substantial meal.</P>
      <P>I am not anxious to encourage more and more of those places which one sees written up about in the &ldquo;Table for two&rdquo; columns in the newspapers, where somebody airily talks about how they found it very good value at £74 for two.  They are very often the same journalists who would, under another hat, write a scathing article denouncing people who send their children to boarding school when for the very same money that boarding school will feed, clothe, educate and provide sporting facilities for a robust 16-year old for two weeks.  They will guzzle the meal down in two hours and say it was pretty good value.</P>
      <P>I am trying to reorientate Irish people and their visitors into simple restaurants of a kind in which there is no pretentiousness with, if you like, scrubbed tables and disposable paper tablecloths of the kind which are common on the Continent, which I use constantly myself when there, restaurants which would serve a decent, clean, well prepared plate of bacon and cabbage with a pint of stout beside it and leave one with change out of a £5 note.  That is what we need; we do not need the others.  That facility is not a goldmine.  A person who has that facility never will end up as might somebody who owns one of these enormous aircraft hangers which exist in the suburbs of Dublin, with 1,500 people sucking down brandies as fast as they can.  I am sorry to disagree so emphatically with Deputy Cowen but I think Deputy Colley's point is absolutely correct; we are not comparing things which are similar at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> We are doing something quite new and we must endeavour to strike some kind of a balance.  I feel that a fee of £3,000 is about right.  I am sure that the kind of place I am talking about that I would like to see serving decent, simple food, not pretentious &mdash; where one would get for a few pounds something which would fill one and leave one with the feeling that one had had something good or even unique &mdash; cannot be expected to pay an initial fee of anything substantially more than £3,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the £3,000 as being the right amount for the fee does not arise for discussion on this amendment. What we are discussing is whether the Minister of the day should have power, by regulation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but what about the Deputy's apprehensions under that heading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to Deputy Cowen I think Deputy Kelly is being very hard on him because Deputy Kelly did not have due regard to the way Deputy Cowen prefaced his remarks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor probably sees the need for the Minister to have power, by way of regulation, to adjust the initial once-off payment of the fee, thinking of circumstances that may arise in the future. I would ask him to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat one point to the Minister which arose in the course of our deliberations during the day.  I want to seek confirmation of the Minister's agreement that, within the year, if not shorter, the whole question of the fee will be looked at afresh either within the context of Deputy Cowen and <Col N="1865" /> others seeking its increase or the concerns of Deputy Colley and others about the businesses of people in occasional trade. I want to ensure that it will be kept under active review.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party are concerned about the overall impact this new licence may have on the established vintners' trade.  We should like an assurance that if there arose a serious imbalance, on a regional or provincial basis, the Minister would increase the fee, or use it, as a leverage or means of controlling the introduction of these licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I have said already.  I have dealt with the circumstances envisaged by Deputy McCartan.  The Minister would have the power, by regulation, to reconsider the fee and the Oireachtas would have power to annual any decision of the Minister and change his regulations if thought to be desirable.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 22 not moved.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 35, after &ldquo;situated&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any inhabitant of the parish or health authority within the meaning of the Health Act in whose functional area the restaurant is situated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10, as it stands, provides that a superintendent of the Garda Síochána may object to the renewal of a special restaurant licence on the grounds that the <Col N="1866" /> premises concerned have not been bona fide and used solely as a restaurant within the meaning of this Act.  I would like to see the provision added there &mdash; as is contained in other licensing Acts that &ldquo;or any inhabitant of the parish or health authority within the meaning of the Health Act in whose functional area the restaurant is situated&rdquo;.  That is a reasonable amendment.  I contend it should not be left solely to a superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  We should endeavour to maintain consistency in the sense that, as that provision is contained in other Intoxicating Liquor Acts, it should be included in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; missing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment would then read: &ldquo;or any inhabitant of the parish or health authority area within the meaning of the Health Act in whose functional area the restaurant is situated&rdquo;. In some cases that would comprise nearly three countries because the MidWestern Health Board covers counties Clare and Limerick and north Tipperary. I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to section 3 which states that this Act be construed together with other Intoxicating Liquor Acts and also to section 7 (2), by virtue of which a special restaurant licence would be deemed to be an on-licence for the purposes of the Finance Act, 1910.  One effect of this is that the existing power to object to the granting of a court certificate being necessary before a liquor licence is renewed would apply also in relation to special restaurant licences.  Under the licensing Acts, as they stand, there are some restrictions on the categories that may object to the initial granting of a liquor licence.  Any member of the community can object to the granting of a renewal certificate.  This would be the case in relation to the special restaurant licences.  In the ordinary way such objections may be made on the grounds of the dubious character of the licensee, the manner in which the business has been conducted in the course of <Col N="1867" /> a year, or on the unfitness of the premises. In the light of that I suggest there is sufficiently wide scope, under existing law, for objection to renewal in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He can, in fact anyone can object.  There are a number of ways open to people to object.  My argument is that what the Deputy is suggesting is not necessary, that there are already sufficient avenues open to anybody who may want to object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of this section, as it stands, seems to be more in keeping with some of the provisions contained in the Betting Acts, under which the person, if you like, who carries the right of a hearing or objection in relation to any of these applications will be the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  Therefore, to some extent he will be seen to be the sifting authority from the point of view of the objector or that of the public generally.  I have to admit I am not fully clear as to whether that is the procedural approach to objections to renewal of licences under the licensing Acts.  But I am aware that, in relation to the Betting Acts, the person who has the right of audience and of hearing is the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  He then decides, within his area of responsibility, what witnesses <Col N="1868" /> will be called, be they inhabitants or others in support of his objection.</P>
      <P>My understanding of this amendment and its effect is that it will introduce that type of regime into the District Court hearing, if you like, giving the sole right of audience or representation to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána, leaving it to him, or her, to decide whether a particular local inhabitant would be called as part of his or her armoury in presenting his or her case of objection should that arise.  If I am correct in that reading, it is a procedure that is worrying in some respects.  Frequently local residents may have a reservation or an objection to the renewal of a restaurant or dancehall licence or the granting of the renewal of a betting licence.  If that superintendent does not agree, he or she will have a right of veto over a person being heard in court.  A more democratic approach would be that all parties, subject to the ruling of the district justice, would have the right to be heard.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to clarify the position within the context of this amendment.  For example, will it be the superintendent who will carry the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  Under existing legislation when applications for restaurant certificates are being lodged for licensed premises &mdash; this power is contained already in the 1960 Act &mdash; with regard to the provision that the premises be bona fide and used solely as a restaurant, as Deputy McCartan knows full well the Garda Superintendent does not have the sole right to object.  Residents' associations may, of course, object to the unfitness of the premises.  There is no question of anybody being kept out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I put to the Minister was that if he did not make provision in this section can any other person, as I have specified, object on the grounds that the restaurant is not bona fide and solely used as a restaurant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 7, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;The Minister for Tourism may make regulations prescribing the inspection and certification of restaurants for the purpose of the granting of the renewal by the Board of a Bord Fáilte Certificate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 is a strange hybrid section.  It states: &ldquo;The Minister for Tourism and Transport may, with the consent of the Minister...&rdquo;, that is the Minister for Justice.  That is strange.  Why does the Minister for Tourism and Transport have to prepare the regulations and then submit them to the Minister for Justice for approval?  I do not know who is the correct Minister to do it but whoever the correct Minister is, it should be done by him and one Minister should not have to discuss the matter with another Minister who has a different brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport deals with matters such as accommodation, catering, hygiene, equipment and so on and this has the implication that all we are concerned about are tourists. Of course the tourist element is <Col N="1872" /> extremely important but I would have thought hygiene and matters like that would be of importance for us also.  The standards for restaurants are being dealt with and I find it difficult to understand how the role of the Minister for Justice would come into that category.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice is involved with such matters as the enforcement of opening hours rather than with hygiene and catering.  I do not know if there are staff in the Department of Justice who would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is worded to give two bites of the cherry.  First there is the general statement &mdash; and I have a reservation about the two Ministers being involved.  It should provide that regulations are made for standards for the grant of these certificates and for the running of these restaurants.  That is fair enough.  Then it is provided that regulations may be made in regard to various things which are listed.  Why is it necessary to spell out these items in this way? If the generality is there as I have suggested in my amendment, namely, giving the Minister for Tourism and Transport power to make the regulations regarding inspection and certification, I would have thought that that should do, but the <Col N="1873" /> matter does not end there, subsection (2) spells out these aspects: equipment, furnishing, management, staff, catering, hygiene and so on.  Then, as though all that were not enough, we come to the monstrosity of subparagraph (e).  Not content with providing the generality in subsection (1) and spelling it out in (a), (b), (c) and (d), (e) includes any other matter which the Minister for Tourism and Transport considers to be necessary and desirable.  That is some power for this House to devolve on the Minister.  I remember many years ago reading a book on constitutional law dealing with the question of delegated legislation and the designation given to clauses as widely based as that was the &ldquo;Henry VIII clause&rdquo;, indicating that so wide and so arbitrary was this power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is one or the other.  That is what is put up to us here and it goes too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make this other consequential point, and Deputy McDowell, I am sure, will be interested in this one in particular. It is proposed in section 12 that the Minister for Tourism and Transport may, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, make these regulations etc.  Then, without prejudice to the generality of that, the Minister for Tourism and Transport alone now may make regulations on any matter that he considers desirable.  For that, he does not need the consent of the Minister for Justice at all.  The way this whole section is constructed, having <Col N="1874" /> regard to the power that is given, is an unacceptable mish-mash.  That is why my proposal is to simply delete it and give a very short enabling power to the Minister for Tourism and Transport alone, without any dealings with the other Minister, to make the regulations in regard to inspection for the purposes of the Bord Fáilte certificate.  That would be a simpler and cleaner proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 as it stands is clearly a necessary provision enabling standards to be prescribed for restaurants which will qualify for the new special restaurant licence.  The wording of Deputy Taylor's amendment is very general and it is not clear whether it will entail the making of such regulations. Section 12 proposes that the consent of the Minister for Justice shall be required for regulations fixing standards for the premises in question.  This is clearly necessary since all these provisions relating to special restaurant licences are made within the scope of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts for which the Minister for Justice has responsibility and answerability to this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor is wrong when he says that the Minister for Transport and Tourism does not need the consent of the Minister for Justice under (e).  I would like to tell the Deputy that the Minister for Justice will still have to be consulted by the Minister for Transport and Tourism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most definitely.  I might also add that this provision was very strongly recommended to us by the Attorney General's office as being necessary. The Deputy can rest assured that the Minister for Justice of the day who has to have answerability to the Oireachtas on the operation of this legislation must surely be consulted on all matters relating to his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that any regulations he makes can come <Col N="1875" /> before the House and that poses a difficulty, particularly for the smaller parties such as the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and The Workers' Party, because the section dealing with that is section 24 which provides that the only way to get it before the House is to bring in a resolution annulling it within 21 sitting days.  That can only be done in Private Members' time and the way the two big parties in the House have structured the affairs of the House now means that it could well be that 21 sitting days could pass without an opportunity for one of the smaller parties to have a motion annulling these regulations debated in Private Members' time.  The Workers' Party do not have Private Members' time at all and are in a worse situation.  I do not know how they could be expected to get a motion down on the subject at all.  But even the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats could now find themselves in the position where they would not be able to get a motion in within 21 sitting days, so far apart are their allocations of Private Members' time. Even if it were possible, it is very unfair that the very meagre allocation given to the Progressive Democrats and to the Labour Party should be taken up for the purpose of debating or possibly annulling the Minister's regulations made under this section or any other section.</P>
      <P>There is a real problem about this and that is why all provisions dealing with the making of regulations particularly now, since the alteration in the arrangements for Private Members' Business has taken place, should be done by requiring the Minister himself to table a motion before the House to confirm his own regulations so that there would be an opportunity for the House to debate it, even for a limited period with one spokesman per party &mdash; I realise the time of the House is limited. At least we could be sure that way that these matters would come before the House for scrutiny and that it would be possible for the House to debate them even briefly and indeed vote on their adoption or rejection if necessary.</P>

      <P>The regulations referred to here are vitally important in terms of deciding whether this special restaurant licence will work in the way that is originally intended.  Section 24 deals with the annulling of regulations.  I have an amendment in, and I see that Deputies Taylor and McCartan have also, that these regulations should be laid before the House for approval.  In this instance it is vital that that be done.  It would be my intention to press that amendment and I am sure all the other parties would support it because this is one way of guaranteeing that all the provisions relating to the granting of special restaurant licences will be contained in these regulations.  It is essential that we have the opportunity of approving or rejecting those regulations by way of resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I welcomed this proposal.  There were as I suggested potential drawbacks in televising Dáil proceedings. It could, as is suggested in the booklet circulated by the Deputies putting forward the motion, trivialise the work of the House, although, occasionally we would not need the assistance of television cameras to do that.  Members of the House can, as we saw yesterday, quite adequately trivialise the work of this House without any outside help or hindrance.  The appearance of empty seats could, it is suggested, be misconstrued by the voting public, and the most important drawback, the privilege of the House could be abused.  On the positive side I accepted the suggestion made by the promoters of the motion that television coverage would be in line with the spirit of the Constitution.  It would allow in the last information or news medium which is denied access to the House and it would provide a valuable and useful historical record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I questioned the suggestion that television cameras in Dáil Éireann would either heighten public awareness of the Dáil or of the work of the Members or increase the respect of the general public for Dáil Éireann.  It seemed to me that these were somewhat inflated claims.  I also queried the belief that television <Col N="1878" /> coverage could improve the sometimes dreadful level of debate which takes place in this House.  That is far too much to hope for.  It would take a whole host of Bunny Carrs, years of patience and a more selective electoral system to achieve that end but I give marks to the Deputies opposite for trying.</P>
    <P>The case for television coverage of the House lies not with inflated claims as to the benefits but with the simple fact that it is inconceivable that there should be a permanent exclusion of television cameras from the Dáil.  Accepting, as all speakers have accepted, that television coverage is inevitable and it is something to be welcomed, we should turn our minds during this debate to how the potentially negative impact of coverage can be minimised.  In the document circulated by Deputy Bruton a number of the practicalities of television broadcasting are addressed.  The point is made that there is no need to have television personnel on the floor of the House.  This, as Deputies know, is the practice in other parliamentary assemblies.  It is not a good practice.  Roving camera crews and sound persons would be an unacceptable intrusion.  The point is made that modern equipment would not need strong lighting and there is little fear therefore that Deputies could be parboiled, at least not by the equipment.</P>
    <P>Having rejected the idea of a mobile television crew in the House, it is suggested that the House could be covered by static and remotely controlled cameras. This could give rise to problems as the jockeying for seats during the visits of President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Hawke illustrated recently.  Members of this House and Members of the Upper House have an innate and even unnerving capacity to recognise a good seat and once the prime location is identified they are willing to employ such measures as are necessary to acquire the good seat.  It may, to avoid a degree of undignified jockeying at the beginning of each day's business, be necessary as part of this arrangement to ensure some sort of pre-assignment of seats.</P>
    <P>There is a more serious issue that <Col N="1879" /> should receive the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where they come to examine the proposal, and this is the question of editorial control.  Of practical necessity the amount of air time that can be given on television to parliamentary debates will be limited.  It is likely that left to its own devices the television station will inevitably focus on specific items or parts of Dáil coverage that will provide a degree of televisual opportunities.  Question Time would be an obvious focus and this is mentioned in the document which has been circulated.  It has obvious attractions for procedures.  It is most economical in terms of staff and it offers a relatively brief period during which action can almost inevitably be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The introduction of legislation, in particular the Second Stage speeches, would again afford an attractive focus for the cameras and for the producers.  In both cases there are potential problems so far as offering a balanced representation of the operations of the Dáil is concerned. Both occasions tend to focus heavily on Ministers and on senior party spokespersons and only occasionally would backbenchers become involved in this procedure.  The most obvious focus from the backbenchers, given this need to edit, would be the troublesome member &mdash; the Deputy who is anxious to absent himself or herself from the House for a mini-break or perhaps to do some fishing in Galway &mdash; who could clearly create an incident, getting excluded from the House and get the benefit of his or her theatrical performance in the constituency. A protest such as this may be electorally helpful at election time but it is not helpful in the context of how this House is perceived.  This happens at the moment.</P>

      <P>Jealousy will get the Deputies nowhere.  The facts are that a prima donna performance, as we had yesterday, when somebody who changes from time to time his opinions on issues such as fishery licences would inevitably be highlighted by television coverage, by the necessity to be selective, to edit.  It would not do much for the dignity of this House if that were the type of matter to be highlighted by the inclusion of television in the House.  It is clear that these problems would need to get the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in their deliberations.  It is clear, as suggested by the Deputies who have sponsored the motion, that a strict code of practice would be necessary and should be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the scales a code of practice will need to establish that the less sensational work of the House should also be covered.  Last night I referred in particular to committees.  One of the sad facts of life is that while the proceedings of this House and the parliamentary reporting in Ireland are generally far better than elsewhere, the work of parliamentary committees, such as exist at the moment, does not receive due attention and does not receive the degree of focus that committee work should receive.  Committees do not receive the <Col N="1881" /> attention they need.  I would not wish that the committee would become the media circus which is the case in congressional committees in the US.  It strikes me that when the code of practice is set up &mdash; I am presuming that there will be a code of practice because I am presuming that we will progress in that direction &mdash; it will be necessary to incorporate a balance of all activities whether committee work, work on the ordinary parts of legislation or on the non-sensational parts of legislation.  In the code of practice it would be very important and in the case of committees it would be vital that the committees be covered.  That would be doubly beneficial.  It would highlight not just the work of the committee but would give some incentive to Members to be active on these committees.</P>
    <P>The committee in their deliberations might consider the question of public demand.  The TV station undoubtedly wants access in order to feed newsworthy films into its news and current affairs programmes.  That is reasonable. Members of the House are not unconscious of the publicity value of TV cameras in the House, but the one thing we have not established to date is whether there is any public demand for this.  If we are to allow TV cameras in here it might be worth while establishing what degree of interest there would be in this change. We could try to establish the degree of coverage and the output at the end of the day.  For a number of years I have supported the view that this House should be open to TV and I congratulate Deputies Bruton and O'Brien for bringing forward this motion.  There is no way we can stop this change, whether it comes about in six months or a year.  I am certain that within the next 12 months we will see TV cameras in here.</P>
    <P>I hope the points I put forward &mdash; I do not mean them to be in any way political because I am a fan of this proposal &mdash; can be taken on board.  In particular I hope we will have a fruitful discussion on this project in the CPP.  We are coming to the concept of televising this House very late in the day.  Sometimes it is a considerable advantage to come to an innovation late <Col N="1882" /> in the day because there is a wealth of experience in other parliamentary assemblies, on the positive and negative sides.  Deputy O'Brien mentioned that we have the experience in the Canadian Parliament to go on.  That was not a particularly happy experiment.  I know from my contacts with parliamentarians there that they were very unhappy with the focus, particularly the focus on the gladiatorial cross tennis matches that went on there at Question Time every day.  As the Deputies have pointed out in their document, there is a distinct difference in the way we handle Question Time here and that should ameliorate or modify the potentially negative impact there.  The Canadian Parliament itself and some of its committees have given a good deal of consideration particularly on the issue of editorial control.  We can look at their experience, hear what they have to say and learn and benefit from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on behalf of the Labour Party and compliment Deputy Bruton in particular for initiating a discussion and going to the bother and trouble of preparing a discussion document.  Too often we can be totally preoccupied with tackling the daily business of this House and not stand back to examine with any degree of impartiality the methodology with which we go about our daily business.</P>
      <P>The motion before us calls for two things (1) to examine the televising of proceedings in the Dáil (2) to ask the CPP to examine in a general way how we conduct our business with regard to length of speeches, procedures for dealing with urgent matters and the relevancy and admissibility of Parliamentary Questions. All these things deserve careful consideration and tonight is an appropriate time to do that.  Like Deputy Harney, I will try to confine myself tightly to time with the contribution I make and impose on myself that discipline we would exhort others in every debate to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the first issue, televising the proceedings of the House, in the discussion document Deputies Bruton and <Col N="1883" /> O'Brien comment about the constitutional provision which requires that sittings of this House and of the other House shall be in public.  We must pay attention to that.  The almost empty galleries for most of our discussions do not fit in with the spirit of open debate. Therefore, the way in which the procedures and debates of these Houses normally reach the public at large is through the print medium.  Because of limited space and the demands of journalism that medium obviously has to make judgments, and its value judgments on what is newsworthy often confound the Members of the House who have taken on an issue, researched it and worked on a speech.  Indeed, a colleague of mine this day who felt he had made a very worthy contribution to the Forestry Bill last night, a very experienced Deputy who did an amount of research and once held the Minister's portfolio, commented that there was not a line in the press today about his contribution.  Yet, any Member of this House can contrive to grab the headlines in any of the newspapers by being unruly.</P>
    <P>We need to see how we can conform to the constitutional exhortation to have public meetings of these Houses.  On the information the public get through the media their perception of this House and of the Members of this House is formed. It is not overstating the case &mdash; it is almost a truism &mdash; to state that the stock of politicians is particularly low and that many members of the general public have a very low regard for them.  Many politicians themselves denigrate one another and compound the low regard in which politicians are held by the general public. I refer to a measure in this House today to move out of the political sphere of influence the issuing of the national lottery moneys because it was felt that politicians could not be trusted.  These are fundamental questions.  If we, as politicians, give the impression that politicians cannot be trusted and that some body appointed by politicians is a safer group to dispense moneys or to monitor <Col N="1884" /> any situation, that puts a certain threat on democracy.</P>
    <P>The fundamental thing is public accountability, and the only people who are really accountable are the elected Members of this House who on a regular basis have to face the electorate.  They are accountable every weekend or every day when they return to their constituencies and have to face the general public and periodic elections.</P>

      <P>The issue of democracy itself is raised.  If we fail as a House and as individual politicians to maintain the confidence of the public we are undermining and eroding democracy itself.</P>
      <P>I want to state the Labour Party's position with regard to broadcasting the procedures of this House.  We support fully the concept of public access to all activities of the House and all the subcommittees of the House.  We will give full encouragement and endorsement to this motion and to the speedy implementation of any recommendations which will eventually come from the CPP that will bring in visual broadcasting as well as sound broadcasting of our proceedings here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is our experience to date?  It has been in the area of radio and I remember some of the fears expressed when the pilot scheme was introduced.  I compliment RTE on their magnificent, competent and professional handling of reporting the procedures of this House. Despite all the fears and barriers that some Members felt and tried to put in the way of sound broadcasting, it has been a complete and total success.  I am quite surprised at the number of people who listen regularly to the reports of the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad broadcast by RTE.  It brings the Members of this House directly to the people, makes us more relevant and keeps us on our toes.  The general public know the names of those whose voices are never heard because they do not contribute <Col N="1885" /> often, if ever, to the proceedings of the House.</P>
    <P>What were the fears originally voiced in relation to sound broadcasting?  The first which &mdash; is obviously even more relevant in terms of television &mdash; is the unruly Member, the individual who will play to the gallery.  There have been gimmicks and outrageous acts in this House and indeed in every other Parliament in the world.  The symbol of authority in the Parliament of our neighbouring island, the mace, was thrown to the ground.  That brought condemnation from all sides but acts which bring notoriety to individual Members are the exception and not the rule.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the viewpoint put forward that televising this House would encourage such gimmickry, it would have the opposite effect as people would be very loath to be seen as clowns and fools on the national media because the short-term notoriety would be damaging politically in the long term.</P>

      <P>The electorate are very sensible and they are respectful and mindful of the competent work of Members of the House.  They pay more attention to that than they do to outrageous antics by individuals or headline grabbers.</P>
      <P>I understand the frustrations that Members of this House feel occasionally when they try to raise a matter that is urgent, immediate and of national concern and which the procedures of this House debar them from raising.  Unfortunately, it is no great comfort to be told that there are other ways of raising the matter.  If they put down a parliamentary question it takes at least four sitting days to get an answer.  They may have to go to the CPP or explore some other avenue when they feel passionately about an issue that affects their constituency, the electorate and &mdash; often &mdash; the country. We need to make this House relevant to the ordinary needs of its Members and to the electorate as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> The other point raised was that television would damage the image of the House by showing the empty seats.  Other speakers commenting on this issue last night said that the solution is to bring everybody into the House.  I always get a little bit annoyed when I read reports of debates attended by only six or eight Members of the House.  My position is no different from that of any other Member. From the time we come in here at 9 a.m. or so until we leave&mdash;it will be 11 o'clock tonight&mdash;every minute is occupied either in committees, dealing with visitors or the procedures of the House.  It is not physically possible to work competently as a Member of this House and be physically sitting in the Chamber all day. We each have monitors in our offices, we follow proceedings on the monitor and we each have an area of responsibility. Our parliamentary position is taken within the parliamentary party and enunciated by the spokesperson of that party. It is not desirable or attainable that all 166 Deputies should constantly be seated in the Chamber.  It is an expectation which we should not encourage because it is unreal.  There is a myriad of other aspects to the work of a Deputy apart from sitting in the Chamber listening to debates.  That should be recognised and stated.</P>
    <P>In terms of giving the wrong image, many of those fears could be overcome by merely looking up a report and seeing the technicalities involved.  I had the privilege of seeing the very elaborate communications and television system in the American Congress.  They have a procedure whereby only the speaker addressing the floor of Congress and the chairperson of the session are focused on by automatic cameras.  There is a studio below the floor of Congress and there are no sound men or camera men working on the floor.  It is all done by remote control from the studio below the floor of the Congress Chamber.  They have their own cable network and they provide this broadcast directly to the public or to news stations which pay a fee to take the proceedings of the Houses.  All these fears in relation to giving the image of <Col N="1887" /> the House a bad name can be overcome. They are merely technical difficulties which can be solved without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Members have a great responsibility to make this House not only relevant but seen to be relevant.  In recent weeks and months, every time we turn on our radio or television sets, there are news, current affairs or general chat programmes dealing with the issues which are of concern to the people.  It is an appalling frustration for us and incomprehensible to the general public to know that these matters can be discussed on radio and television, and indeed at every bar counter in the country, but are often precluded from being debated in this House.  We must address that fundamental difficulty. If the procedures of the House are not seen to be relevant they must be changed because the very essence of democracy is having the support and the confidence If the general public that the national Parliament can respond to their everyday needs and wishes in a quick and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Private Members' Business is a very important part of the procedure of the House.  Because of the division of time, the Labour Party get roughly one slot of Private Members' Business per Dáil session and the same is true of the Progressive Democrats.  I suppose the retort from the Government benches and Fine Gael would be that we should get more Members elected.  However, the problem goes deeper than that.  Often, crucial issues could be debated in Private Members' time.  They would not be contentious or politically damaging, they would be relevant and Private Members' time, even if it means extended sittings of the House, should be considered.  The voice and the role of Opposition parties needs to be strengthened.  The Government control everything.  They order business and often business is ordered which is not crucial and urgent while Private Members' Business which is crucial and urgent is sidestepped by the procedures.</P>
    <P>There was much comment last night on <Col N="1888" /> the inadequacy of support facilities for Members of this House.  Back-up support for Members is practically non-existent. The drafting amendments to legislation or the preparing of questions is left to each Member.  In parties the size of the Labour Party or the Progressive Democrats each elected Member is a spokesperson for a particular area and we must find support groups to help us draft technical amendments to legislation.  That procedure is not adequate and it does not help the processing of legislation in the House or improve its quality.  It is wrong that in our areas of responsibility we do not get adequate support or briefing so as to be able to debate effectively all legislation that is put through the House.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Harney suggested that there might be a useful role for the Law Reform Commission to play in this area.  Many useful reports of that body were adopted by committees of the House.  We all have had the experience when discussing such reports at committee meetings of receiving reports from Government Departments that do not bear any relationship to them or consider the deep research that has gone into their preparation.  Obviously, we are not utilising the Law Reform Commission fully and we should give serious consideration to Deputy Harney's suggestion in regard to it.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the area of inadequate research that I have become aware of is the strength of lobby groups outside the House.  Any lobby group that is organised can use very professional research facilities to put forward a case that coincides with their economic or political objectives. Members faced with a very impressive and professionally prepared lobby paper have their position undermined. They often have to accept the lobbyist's research at its face value because they do not have any counter-position to put forward or the resources to check the facts.  That often results in undue influence being put on Members and parties here.  Often we do not have the objective view because of the weight of research that is available to lobby <Col N="1889" /> groups to push a particular case.  Unbalanced legislation has been enacted in these Houses because of the lack of resources available to Members.</P>
    <P>In relation to facilities in the House generally, the short statement is that they are inadequate and appalling at every level but we do not have the courage to address that.  We are cramped in a building that is grossly inadequate for the number of people who work in it.  The Labour Party offices must accommodate five TDs.  Over the centuries there was a lot of effort put into providing an independent Parliament for the Irish people and that Parliament, and this democracy, has a price and a pride.  As elected Members we must have that pride in these Houses and be willing to pay the price for an efficient democracy that serves our people.  We must fund our own business in a way that we have never been willing to do in the past.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in all the cost-cutting exercises that took place in our neighbouring island under Prime Minister Thatcher the one area of operation that she specifically exempted from cuts was the Houses of Parliament.  She recognised Parliament as being a crucial and important institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we, who have undermined our position by not insisting on proper and adequate facilities, should recognise that.  This is not the first initiative taken by Deputy Bruton.  As Leader of the House in 1983 he commissioned a report on new technology for Leinster House.  A huge amount of work went into the preparation of that report and it is worth looking at it to see if any of the recommendations have been implemented.  The answer is that we have progressed very little.  If anything, we may have gone back a few steps.  In the last Dáil we had made progress in the area of committees with more and more work being dealt with by more Members in committee.  More Deputies were involved in the processing <Col N="1890" /> of legislation through the committee system but we have fewer committees in this Dáil.  It is a pity that the advances we made in the last Dáil have not been continued.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following statement in the 1983 report:</P>
      <P>The deficiencies are known to the Members.  The debate on Dáil reform in January and February 1983 drew a wide range of speakers from all sides of the House.  Members criticised the lack of facilities and the time-consuming procedures that are a feature of Leinster House operations.  There was expressed a strong resolve to reform the procedures and update the facilities and administrative arrangements.</P>
      <P>Have we done anything to improve the facilities since?  I fear not.  That report went on to state:</P>
      <P>The deficiencies are also known to the administrative and support staff of the House.  The two hundred staff &mdash; transcribing and editing, library and research, translating and interpreting, security, maintenance and general clerical and administrative staff &mdash; operate almost entirely without the benefit of modern technical aids.</P>
      <P>It would be worth inquiring what technical aids exist and the progress made in that regard.  To go through the report, as I did this evening, makes one despair somewhat that all the good effort, positive thought and enthusiasm that went into the preparation of the report went the way of so many other good ideas and intentions, to gather dust on a shelf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not bore the House by going through the report in detail but I recommend it as light reading to Members. Recommendations on such items as computers and the use of, word processing and the use of, videotex and the use of, and databases were made in that report but to most Members they amount to a foreign language.  We do not have the resources to provide them and the money has never been provided by vote of the <Col N="1891" /> Oireachtas.  We must decide for ourselves if we are serious, if we take our business seriously.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that all that work has been abandoned.  I wonder if at 8.30 p.m. when we conclude this debate it will go the way of all others and be forgotten or whether there will be a genuine consensus view, across party lines, to do something about updating and improving the facilities for Members and the procedures of these Houses.</P>
    <P>Another area I should like to mention is that of Parliamentary Questions which are often staged managed and lack spontaneity. How can they be spontaneous when four days' notice is required?  We receive a prescribed and preset answer, the supplementaries are guessed at and replies to them put into the Minister's brief.  That contrasts with other parliaments. I had the privilege of observing Question Time in the Australian Parliament and I noted that the Prime Minister, and the Cabinet, are on daily notice to take spontaneous questions from the Floor of the House at Question Time. We must look at the matter of improving the procedure for Parliamentary Questions to bring them up to date and to make the Ministers respond to the needs of the day instead of being cosseted by Civil Service briefs prepared well in advance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney challenged the party system and her comments serve as an interesting talking point.  The implication is that we should have freedom from the party Whips and should all be individuals.</P>

      <P>I was drawn into this House and into politics by a conviction about fundamental principles.  That is why I joined a party that is principled. Those principles and convictions are expressed within a party system.  We have a party-based political system.  Within my party policy is decided by conference, by vote of the membership of the party. That is passed through the system to the parliamentary party and acted upon in <Col N="1892" /> this House.  It is inconceivable that each of the 12 members of the Labour Party could ignore the policies and principles of the party of which they are members. The Labour Party is not a party of 12 individuals but of people who have a view of the type of society we want to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton for formulating the document and putting it before the House.  It is not the first occasion on which he has pioneered policy.  He is to be complimented on his detailed research and on his attitude to the formulation of policy when in Opposition. I recall reading works he produced on the national finances and other matters, all of which were very well researched.</P>
      <P>Everybody seems to be agreed in principle about the televising of the Dáil proceedings. We live in an era of improved communications and television is recognised as the most powerful medium.  We should allow people the facility of seeing the workings of the Dáil, but the whole matter will have to be looked at in great detail to see how this policy can be put into effect.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, agreed in principle yesterday that this is the procedure which should be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the practicalities of establishing a balance in the televising of proceedings. There could be an attempt to abuse the fact that television cameras are in the Chamber.  Yesterday we had the case of a Member being suspended from the House.  This has happened to Members from all sides of the House over <Col N="1893" /> a period.  I suppose one can be critical of the media for reporting that type of occurrence so widely that it takes on a greater importance than virtually all the other proceedings in the Dáil that day.  It is just the kind of thing which could drag this House into disrepute and is very bad publicity in regard to the workings of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In order to allow this matter to be discussed further and to have some form of blueprint drawn up, there is a need for the party Whips and the television producers to discuss the mechanics of procedural arrangements, what would be covered on camera and how the technical aspects would affect the Chamber.  All these matters need to be discussed at length.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State recommended that the matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, of which I am a member, or to some other committee. It is certainly desirable to proceed in that way.</P>
    <P>It is very important to strike an equitable balance.  RTE have a monitoring arrangement whereby they allocate time to party spokesmen by reference to the percentage support which each party receives from the electorate.  That is to be commended.  Deputy Bruton's document refers to the fact that, in the absence of direct coverage of the Dáil, television producers attempt to stage shadow Dáil debates on such programmes as &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;. There is a need to consult the television producers in formulating a policy on equitable reporting.</P>
    <P>There are other technicalities relating to a fixed podium and a fixed camera but it is claimed that it would be necessary to get a complete sweep of the Chamber. There are regular comments on the absence of Deputies from the Chamber, especially by pupils on school outings. We believe we have a credible explanation but it is not very acceptable because it is complicated and not fully understood.</P>
    <P>We would probably have to monitor the percentage of time allocated to Question Time and the various debates. <Col N="1894" /> Would the Committee Stage of a Bill make good or bad television?  It would be very impressive for the public to see how meticulously legislation is discussed.  It would improve communications between the Dáil and the general public.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could take the first step in regard to this matter.  There have already been requests to televise the proceedings of some of the all-party Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, I have had a request from RTE based on the work we are doing with some of the very important semi-State companies. Such meetings would make pretty good television.  It would show the public at large that we are monitoring the investment by the taxpayer in State companies and it would give all sorts of interest groups the opportunity of making representations. That is the art of good communication and good accountability.  I strongly suggest that in the investigations that will proceed from this debate, with all-party agreement, which I believe is forthcoming from the House, they are issues which should be addressed and in some detail.</P>
    <P>Committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies have an arm's length contact with virtually the total annual financial Vote of this House.  We are probably indirectly in a position to seek answers to and get information on something like £7,000 million to £8,000 million of Government spending annually.  That is where accountability is on the top of the needle and where the public should be satisfied that the public representatives, the politicians, are on top of the brief and are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>There is a general acceptance that our tax levels are very high.  People are interested in how that money is spent, allocated and accounted for.  The work of the committees in the last ten years, after the initial attempt to get cheap publicity and over-publication which can happen from time to time, is now proceeding. They have a very major interest <Col N="1895" /> for the public and would make good television. I know that Deputy Barnes on the Joint Committee on Women's Rights recently produced a very comprehensive work.  That document took much painstaking research, it entailed many submissions and hearings and various interest groups explained their viewpoints. In many ways, that would be excellent television and be of great interest to the public generally.</P>
    <P>We should not be over-concerned about popularity.  Out of every 100 people questioned, you will get a very wide spread of opinion as to the merits or otherwise of televising the Dáil, the House of Lords, the United States Congress or the Canadian Houses of Parliament as referred to in the policy document.  It is hoped we are more concerned with communicating the efficiency and workings of Parliament.  The individual type of question as for instance at Question Time, has a broad appeal and interest.  It is applicable to many people. There also are the weighty matters of legislation.  We would not be over-concerned about it being good, popular confrontational TV programmes.  We would be much more interested that it would show a businesslike working efficiency from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton comments in his document, it would also help to get across the message to the public that there is this element of research, study and indepth analysis in the contributions and presentations made to the House by other than Ministers or Cabinet office holders backed up by the executive arm of Government.  There are many front bench spokespersons who put a lot of detail, time and energy into their work in this House.  Such work has to be researched and the back-up and support are not that great.  That, coming across on television, would give an impression that the public at present do not get.  It would be refreshing and helpful for them to realise that on many occasions there is cross-party support, that the House is united on various issues, that we do not necessarily disagree on everything in this <Col N="1896" /> House.  It would be a progressive communications achievement with the public that we are at one where issues are critical, perhaps on foreign policy, on social issues, on a matter such as this proposal for the introduction of TV.  On very many occasions we end up in agreement on issues that have been fully debated and discussed.  That type of consensus would help the public at large to realise that the political system is there for the common good and that the arguments for and against can be debated and a consensus gained on those issues that are agreeable.</P>
    <P>The arguments in the document against televising the Dáil when studied in some detail do not stand up.  The point about the empty seat I have already referred to.  The restrictions on the movement of cameras and personnel on the floor of the House, lighting and so forth can all be dealt with on a technical and management level.  One example, perhaps not a great one for the Irish people, is the House of Lords.  Very often one can see there interesting debates and a worthwhile presentation.  At other times it can be very boring and uninteresting. The experiment, in general, has probably been successful.  It is not confrontational, it has not the cut and thrust of politics which would be good television in so far as one could see the differences emerging as in the case of the past 12 months in this House when the Government and some of the Opposition parties were at one and others were opposed to certain difficult decisions we had to take.  The public would have a much better understanding of some of those issues if much of the debate which went on had been recorded and presented to them in a balanced and reasoned way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin touched on another point to which I would like to refer and no doubt it would be near and dear to the hearts of Deputies Bruton, De Rossa and Barnes &mdash; that is, lack of research and support.  When the Taoiseach took over as leader of my party, he set about endeavouring to make fairly substantial progress in this area.  I was charged with <Col N="1897" /> responsibility for endeavouring to computerise or automate the support mechanisms of Dáil Deputies right across party lines.  One of the first things was to get extra accommodation, which was obtained in the College of Art.  The second matter was the meagre step forward of a secretary per Deputy and then there was the question of automating to the extent of dictaphones, tapes and so forth.  We then looked at the possibility of what was then called a Search right programme from one of the computer suppliers, where a particular type of programme could be put <i>in situ</i> that would support the workings of each Dáil Deputy in his or her constituency record-keeping and streamline much laborious, repetitive administrative work.  Reasonable progress was made on those fronts, but not enough.  However, there was very little progress made on the actual research facilities.</P>
    <P>I find a great gap between the third level educational institutions and the parliamentarians, that we cannot establish some form of conduit of research support which could be part of a thesis of study or presentation of eventual work that some third level graduates would have to produce.  This is a major gap and one that would want to be looked at alongside the televising of the proceedings of this House.</P>
    <P>As the document suggested, televising the proceedings of the Dáil will certainly raise the level of debate.  If Deputies knew they were going to be televised when speaking on legislation or other business, their research would be more thorough. They are entitled to support in their research.  There are many issues near and dear to the hearts of many Deputies and they would love to have time and the back-up to do indepth research.  There are many areas of over-spending, lack of accountability and areas where social legislation is required.</P>
    <P>One of the major improvements in this House since I first came in, in 1977, is that Bills on policy issues are being put forward.  In years gone by it would be unheard of for Deputy Bruton to use his <Col N="1898" /> party's time in Private Members' Business for other than confrontational matters relevant to the day.  Instead, we are discussing tonight, a long-term step in the right direction.  Last week also the Progressive Democrats put forward a Bill, no doubt adequately researched, but the Minister felt it was not broad enough and he endeavoured to get agreement on tackling the problem.  That was a good illustration of the Opposition and the Government taking on an issue that needed to be addressed.  That is progressive and it is to be commended.  If that attitude came across on TV it would show the consensus which is necessary within the community at large.  We all take party stances on specific issues but the broad thrust of what we are trying to achieve is the common goal of equity right across the social divide, although different parties may have different ideas as to how it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Howlin talking about the Whip, and Deputy Harney referred to the Whip last night. They would want to be on this side of the House in a minority party to know what it means.  In a paper at the weekend I read where a Minister, due to the pressure of business, was trying to be in two or three places at the same time.  We have to be here and we have to obey the guidelines of the Whip.  The flexibility is on the far side of the House.  Yet, although in a minority position this Dáil has worked extremely effectively with great co-operation. I am not sure what timespan is allowed?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy insists on the time to which he is entitled he can carry on until 8.10 p.m. but I would advise him that it is hoped two Deputies will get an opportunity to say a few words, before I call on Deputy Bruton.  The Deputy might bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>I will be delighted to, because that is in the spirit of what I have been saying.  I will give every encouragement to making progress in this area. I hope the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="1899" /> Privileges can make substantial progress. We should look at the workings of some of the committees with a view to making a trial arrangement.  We should get in some TV production experts to tell us the mechanics of televising the Dáil and to tell us how equity could be achieved. Would the media people see television as stifling the complete happenings in the Dáil if the more colourful but less important matters that arise from time to time make more acceptable viewing?  Would having to vote to suspend a Member for disorderly behaviour be the sort of television a producer would like but which we do not think conveys the message of the day?  Would that stifle what happened in the Dáil on a particular day?  All these issues have to be teased out in greater detail.  I hope we will get the time necessary in whatever committee we deal with the matter.  I commend Deputy Bruton for bringing forward the document.</P>

      <P>Sharing the rapport across the House, I will hold to my five minutes and give Deputy De Rossa an opportunity to speak as well.  I wanted to be part of this debate, even for a brief time, because I am so positive about it. It is significant for me that the very first speech I made in this House was on Dáil reform.  Indeed, Deputy Howlin commented tonight that some of what was said then had not yet been implemented. It is the earnest hope of all of us here tonight that in five years time we will not <Col N="1900" /> look back on this debate and feel that nothing had been done with regard to this issue.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else in this debate I thank and pay tribute to Deputy Bruton for the work he has done.  The energy, enthusiasm and vision he has shown with regard to dragging this 18th century House into the 20th century has been Herculean.  The Deputy did this in a most constructive way by getting the support of all parties in the House.  I congratulate him on the thorough work he did beforehand, for instance, in relation to the booklet he issued outlining the advantages and disadvantages of televising the Dáil and addressing them.  I will not go into those advantages or disadvantages because Deputy Lawlor and others have already done so.</P>
      <P>We are elected to give leadership to society and to give society a direction. Our electorate relies on us to give that direction.  We would fail totally if we did not take on the new technology and control it rather than be overwhelmed by it, and use it in the most effective way for the people who elected us.  I have no fears about how television will be used or abused.  Common sense will prevail.  The viewers have a considerable amount of practical good sense and they will reject what is superficial or selective.  I am aware also that most Irish people have a high level of interest not just in politics and current affairs as evidenced by TAM ratings for our current affairs programmes, but have an incredible curiosity about people and that is really what politics is all about.  What is attempted in this House will appeal to the electorate and will make people realise that while we have policy differences and take different political stances, there is very often a common wish across the House to get the best out of the work we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for people outside of this House to realise what we do.  Many people, because of the necessity to curtail reporting of Dáil debates in the media, do not realise the work we do here.  The most newsworthy and headline-catching events seem to occur during the Order of <Col N="1901" /> Business and during Question Time.  I would like people to know there is life after the Order of Business and Question Time.  Many of our people are not aware of the Stages a Bill must go through and of the rapport that can be established by people on all sides of the House in their wish that the best legislation will go through.  Perhaps television will show the electorate the attempts which most of the Members of this House make to bring about the best possible legislation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I call for the establishment of a central research unit.  Such a unit is essential and is needed if we are to be effective in this House.  Staff would need to be trained to operate the technology and to undertake the research that would be required.  I think we should also televise the input that our European parliamentarians make in order to show the amount of like work which takes place at European level and at national level. As other speakers have said, one way of introducing television in a prompt manner would be to televise the work of some of our committees particularly at a time when interest groups were making oral submissions or when those committees were making recommendations. Television is a powerful medium and we should not be afraid of it.  I commend Deputy Bruton for bringing forward this motion and I thank all of the parties for supporting it and, for Heaven's sake, let us get on with it.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of being able to speak on this debate and I thank Deputy Lawlor and Deputy Barnes for giving me some of their time despite the shortness of time available which indicates that there is certainly a need for reform in the area of Private Members' Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support by and large what Deputy Bruton has outlined in his document and I think the televising of Dáil proceedings is long overdue.  It took us nearly 50 years to get around to recording and playing back what goes on here in the Dáil over the RTE wavelengths.  It also strikes me that we should be considering not just the recording of the Dáil and relaying it after <Col N="1902" /> editing but also the establishment of a channel which would broadcast live the proceedings which take place here in this House.  After all, this is the assembly which has been elected by the people of this State and they have a right to know what is going on and a right to be informed.  It would only lead to a strengthening of democracy in this State if they were better informed.  As other Deputies have said, television is one of the most powerful mediums at this time and there are very few homes in this State which do not have a television sitting in the corner of some room.  Indeed, some homes have two televisions and some people even have television sets in their bedrooms.  Clearly, even late sittings would be an attraction for some.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The slowness in reforming our procedures and in letting people know about what we do here is symptomatic with a fear of change on the part of many of us in this House and this is reflected back in the facilities which are available to Deputies and in a feeling, despite the fact that we are elected by the people, that in some may we do not deserve to have the best facilities available to us.  Some weeks ago I tried to acquire word processing facilities but I discovered, despite the fact that there was a report published on technology for this House in 1983, that we do not have a systems officer, although we did have one at one stage.  I urge the Minister to raise this matter with the Minister concerned.  If we are to make this House more efficient, the most efficient and up-to-date technology will have to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have liked to refer to sitting times, the extension of the facility of Private Members' time to individual Deputies, the provision of time for Private Members' Bills and a reduction in the amount of time in which this House is in recess but I do not have sufficient time at my disposal in which to do so.  In conclusion, let me make one suggestion.  This <Col N="1903" /> proposal calls for the recording for television the proceedings of this House.  Perhaps, some of the material could be edited into packages for use in schools in civics and politics classes.  There is a deplorable lack of understanding among young people about how exactly this House operates and one visit on the part of a school child for a half an hour to this House would not give any indication of the work which is undertaken here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight's decision to agree in principle to the televising of the proceedings of the Dáil is an historic one. The fact that the Dáil is able to agree to this so soon after the introduction of radio broadcasting is an indication that the pace of reform is speeding up and this is all for the good.  I compliment the Government in particular for the positive attitude they have adopted towards this proposal notwithstanding the fact that it is one which emanates from the Fine Gael Party.  This shows the constructive approach on their part.</P>
      <P>I am particularly appreciative of the kind words which were directed towards Deputy Fergus O'Brien and me in regard to this matter by the Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady.  There are many issues to be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, not all of which are covered in the discussion document which was circulated prior to this debate and therefore I can readily agree to the Minister of State's proposal to extend from three months to six months the time wherein the committee are to consider this matter.  It is essential, however, that there be a time limit and it is important that the committee would report at the end of that six months period rather than letting the matter drag on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people might criticise the proposal to televise the proceeding of the Dáil on the basis that it is another example of this country following what is happening in Britain but such criticism should not deter us.  If the House of Commons is on television and the British side of an issue of controversy between us can be seen on television being expressed on <Col N="1904" /> the floor of the House of Commons it is important that the Irish side of the issue also be capable of being seen on television from the Floor of the Dáil.  We cannot afford to pass up any opportunity to present our case effectively before the Bar of world opinion.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have expressed concern that television is a medium which trivialises issues, including political issues.  There is no doubt that there is some truth in this.  Matters must be compressed into a few minutes for television presentation and this often leads to over simplification but that is no argument for not having the proceedings of the Dáil on television.  Television is going to present programmes on politics anyway, whether we appear on them or not, and we cannot stop them.  The issue before us, therefore, is not whether politics is going to be on television but rather whether part of the coverage of politics should include what actually happens here in this Chamber. Surely, it is better that the actual happenings in this Chamber be directly accessible to the viewer through television rather than being solely mediated through the second-hand report of a journalist however reputable or competent he or she may be.</P>
    <P>There will be a need to give a good deal of thought, in co-operation and discussion with television journalists, to the appropriate code of practice to cover the televising of the proceedings of the Dáil. Such a code of practice should require balanced presentation.  There should be balance maintained between different types of Dáil work.  We do not want to see the happenings here in the Chamber receive undue coverage to the detriment of committee work.  We do not want to see arguments on the Order of Business hog the coverage to the detriment of more detailed work on the Committee Stage of a Bill.  We do not want to see particular Members receive unbalanced coverage, favourable or unfavourable. These are all desirable objectives. However, they should not be prescribed in a rigid or legalistic way in a code of practice.  To my mind the code of practice <Col N="1905" /> which I hope the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will agree in due course should be a generally phrased document giving broad guidelines.  The interpretation in individual cases should remain a matter of journalistic judgment. But this journalistic judgment should be open to subsequent oversight in the light of complaints and perhaps viewing of actual output by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, queried whether we should introduce time limits on speeches, as suggested in the discussion document.  He felt that some of the best speeches he had heard had lasted longer than the time suggested in the discussion document.  He has a point.  However, the time limits are there proposed in order to ensure that a larger number of Deputies than is the case at present be given an opportunity to contribute in the House.  If the proceedings are televised, obviously there will be a larger number of Members wishing to contribute.  It is my opinion that three Deputies should be given an opportunity to speak rather than one Deputy make an excellent speech.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested that there should be a facility for Members to circulate material along with their speech, in written form, with the Official Report.  This would allow Members to give supporting documentation, whether tables containing figures or text, to other Members in the course of a debate.  This is more like what happens, for instance, at business or trade union meetings where documents are exchanged between the parties to the discussions.  There is no reason it should not happen in the Dáil and, in my view, would constitute an improvement in the way in which the Dáil works.</P>
    <P>We need to introduce changes in Dáil procedure to render Dáil debates more conversational.  We need more exchange of views, perhaps more orderly interruptions and less set piece addresses.  We need to give Members an opportunity to reply to things said in the course of a debate rather than come in with prepared contributions &mdash; to some extent like the one I am now going through &mdash; which are <Col N="1906" /> read, in some cases to an empty Chamber, although this is a relatively well attended one.  To this end we should provide for a 15 minute period at the end of Estimates debates, and at the end of Second Stage debates on Bills when Members could make supplementary points for a minute or two and have these replied to by the Minister or by other Members.  This would lead to a much more lively type of discussion than we have at present.  At least it would give an opportunity to Members who might not have got in on the original debate to say something.  It would be of greater interest to the public and a useful addition to the suggestion I have made already, of circulating documents with the Official Report because these and their content could be queried in such discussion periods at the end of important debates before the actual vote took place.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mechanics of televising the Dáil proceedings, we should aim to have a remote control system.  It would be possible to have about three cameras covering the entire Chamber.  I would suggest that one be placed on a pillar on this side of the House, another on a pillar on the far side and perhaps a third located on a pillar in the centre which would focus on the entire Chamber.  These could be remotely controlled from a studio where all three screens would be shown. There are some highly adaptable methods of selecting particular shots. Given the geography of the Chamber there would not be any great problem in giving reasonably good shots of the entire Chamber and of any Member in any place in the Chamber from one of those three cameras.  There would be no need to have any television personnel on the floor of the House and, at any given time, one person could operate the entire system. I have seen these systems demonstrated in Britain.  It would be useful for the Members of the Committe on Procedure and Privileges to have an opportunity of looking at these systems before we introduce one here.  I can say to Deputy Fergus O'Brien and the Minister of State present, Deputy Leyden, that a number of companies have indicated that they <Col N="1907" /> would be prepared to come here and give a demonstration as to how this might operate, perhaps during the summer recess this year.</P>
    <P>The decision we are taking this evening, to allow, in principle, for the televising of Dáil proceedings is very much in line with the spirit of the 1937 Constitution. As pointed out in the document circulated earlier, the Constitution envisaged that the proceedings of the Dáil should be in public.  Had television been available as a medium at the time the Constitution itself was promulgated it is probable that television would have been allowed into the Dáil Chamber from the very beginning by the late President de Valera and the other promulgators of the Constitution.  It is time for us to do so 50 years after the Consititution has come into effect.</P>
    <P>In the few moments remaining to me I should like to refer to some of the points made by speakers this evening.  I was very struck by a point made by Deputy Barnes, that many people are interested in other people and seeing what they are like.  One of the ways of removing the sort of dehumanising attitude of many people towards politics and politicians &mdash; in the sense that they see them as abstractions opposed to their interests &mdash; would be to actually see them in person doing their work.  I was very interested also in the contribution of Deputy Liam Lawlor.  I agree with his suggestion that we should allow, as a pilot project, the televising of some of the committees if it is agreed even before the Chamber itself becomes televised.  That might be a good indication of what would follow thereafter.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the lack of research facilities.  While I agree with those Deputies that there is need for improvement, there is an excellent service available to us in the Library.  In fact there is a namesake of the Taoiseach and others who work with extremely good effect in the interests of Members in that institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche's fears in regard to some parts of the Chamber, some seats <Col N="1908" /> within the Chamber being more televisual, or televised, are not ones about which there should be undue worry.  If we allow a reasonable freedom for the cameras to rove around the Chamber it will not matter where anyone sits.  As regards Deputy Howlin's contribution about unruly Members, I would heartedly agree with him &mdash; Members who are unruly will lose more credit for doing so on television even than they might for doing so in the relative anonymity of our present Chamber.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Harney that the work of the Law Reform Commission should be brought closer to the work of the Chamber and perhaps some of the facilities of the commission might be made available to Deputies who are interested in law reform.  In the previous Dáil there was a joint committee on legislation who were given a specific mandate to work on the commission's reports.  I regret to say that the committee did not do that.  They complained about the lack of facilities in other regards but they did not use the facilities they had under their terms of reference to use the Law Reform Commission's reports as a basis for the preparation of reports.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the introduction of new technology in the House. I should like to draw the attention of the House, the Taoiseach and others to the fact that the position of technology officer in this House &mdash; a function which could save substantial funds in the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas by introducing cost-saving technology &mdash; has remained vacant for some time.  It is a pity and a waste of time to have expensive hardware without the technological advice on how to use it and without that office being filled.  I hope the Government will be able to respond to the suggestion made to them today by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that that office be filled at an early date.</P>
    <P>I thank the House and Deputies for the positive approach adopted, particularly by the Government, towards this motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 21 to 30, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where it appears to the Board that a restaurant in respect of which a Bord Fáilte Certificate is in force no longer complies with the standards specified in section 8 or, as the case may be, under section 12, the Board shall give or send by post to the holder thereof a notice&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  stating that it appears to the Board as aforesaid,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  requiring the holder to take specified steps within a specified <Col N="1910" /> period in order to bring the restaurant into compliance with the standards aforesaid, and</P>
    <P>(c)  informing the holder that, if the requirements in the notice are not complied with, the Board will cancel the Certificate.</P>
    <P>(2)  If the holder of a Bord Fáilte Certificate fails or refuses to comply with a requirement in a notice under subsection (1), the Board shall cancel the Certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment replaces subsections (1) and (2) of section 13 and most of the changes are drafting ones suggested by the draftsman.  It also clarifies a couple of procedural points where the question of cancellation of a Bord Fáilte certificate arises.</P>
    <P>The first point clarified is that the notice from Bord Fáilte to the holder of the certificate can either be given in person or posted.  Section 13, as initiated, stated that the requirements of the notice would have to be carried out in a time to be specified in the regulations.  There would be a whole range of requirements that might have to be complied with by different restaurants, for example, one restaurant owner might have to undertake major structural alterations while another might have to make only minor changes.  It would have been unreasonable for the regulations to specify a standard time to be complied with in all circumstances.  Therefore, under section 13, as it is proposed to amend it, the board will specify the period in which the requirement must be complied with in each case, the period in each case depending on the work to be done.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;24.&mdash;A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this part shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the Regulation shall not be made until a Resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> The regulations relating to special restaurant licences are of vital importance. While there is provision to annul the regulations within 21 days, this has already proved to be totally unsatisfactory. Because of the importance of the regulations we should have a provision whereby the regulations are confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas so that we will have an opportunity to examine the content of the regulations and, if necessary, debate them.  It may be that there will be no need for a debate and that we could confirm them on the nod, so to speak, but we should at least get the opportunity of having a look at the regulations, of discussing them if we feel it is right to do so and give the opportunity to both Houses to confirm these regulations provided we are satisfied with the content.  I have nothing further to say on the matter.  It speaks for itself.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 60, could I be allowed to correct a word in the first line to substitute the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; for &ldquo;order&rdquo;, if that is permissible?  The arguments in favour of this amendment have been advanced by Deputy Barrett in a similar amendment and in earlier contributions we have made it quite clear that all of us consider the regulations to be introduced for the purposes of laying the basis for the special restaurant licences to be of paramount importance to the whole working of this part of the Bill.  This issue is of such importance that it is reflected in amendments from Fine Gael, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party.  I understand from some of the contributions from the Progressive Democrats earlier on that they, too, would support the idea that in this instance these regulations, because of their importance to the whole working of this part of the Bill, must be laid before the House and receive the support of the House before they pass into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the regulations are circulated and it is then incumbent on the Opposition to table, within 21 sitting days, a motion of dissent for debate.  That is fraught with all the difficulties that were explained earlier, of finding the time and <Col N="1914" /> being prepared to forfeit valuable and scarce Private Members' time to such a debate.  Because this is a new departure in the licensing laws which will have a fairly significant impact on the licensed trade, we are all united on this side of the House in asking the Government to ensure an opportunity to discuss the regulations as and when they are introduced even on a limited basis.  I hope the Minister will agree to these amendments and that it will not be necessary to put the matter to the vote as we have indicated is our intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of these three amendments, that the regulations be laid before the House before they are approved rather than as expressed in the Bill which is the annulment procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendments could be to delay the coming into effect of the regulations under section 12 prescribing standards for restaurants qualifying for special restaurant licences as well as regulations under section 9 amending the amount of the fee payable for a special restaurant licence.  Thus, if the standard regulations were made at a time during the summer when neither House of the Oireachtas was sitting, the end of the summer recess would have to be awaited before the regulations would come into force.  This would delay the coming into force of the provisions of the Bill regarding special restaurant licences and that is a delay I am sure nobody would want, particularly those anxious to obtain licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted very carefully the views expressed by the Members having regard to the real importance of the regulations. Because of the conditions laid down under which licences can be obtained, I would be doing something by accepting the amendments which has never been done in the Oireachtas, and that is having a discussion before regulations are brought in rather than moving a motion for their annulment.  I accept the thrust of the amendments.  I am not too sure if the wording is technically correct and I <Col N="1915" /> would need advice on this, but I accept what the movers of the amendments, Deputies Barrett, Taylor and McCartan say.  It will put more pressure on me which I will have to deal with &mdash; but that is my problem &mdash; in having the regulations up front well on time so that we do not get caught in the trap of the summer recess.</P>

In fairness, I have good broad shoulders but I do not think they are round enough to take the abuse I would get if I went to the Seanad on that basis.  One of the consequences of accepting the amendment is that it would have to go before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I said earlier, in reply to Deputy Kelly, that the regulations were practically ready.  I feel confident that between now and the summer recess it will get to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I accept the concept of what is involved in the three amendments but I need to discuss the matter with the parliamentary draftsman to find the <Col N="1916" /> proper form of words for Report Stage, if that is agreeable.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  on St. Patrick's Day, where that day falls on a weekday, before the hour of half-past twelve o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of eleven o'clock in the evening, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate several Deputies called for a change in the permitted hours on St. Patrick's Day so that they would be the same as on any ordinary weekday where St. Patrick's Day falls on a weekday.  The purpose of this amendment is to go most of the way towards that call.  The amendment to section 25 will mean that when St. Patrick's Day falls on a weekday it will have normal weekday opening hours except that opening time will be 12.30 p.m. instead of the usual weekday opening time of 10.30 a.m.  I would see little <Col N="1917" /> demand for having licensed premises open any earlier than 12.30 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day.  When St. Patrick's Day falls on a Sunday, normal Sunday opening hours will apply.  The amendment to section 26 will apply the same new St. Patrick's Day permitted hours to registered clubs.  The amendment to section 9 will apply normal special restaurant weekday permitted hours to those premises on St. Patrick's Day when it falls on a weekday.  The amendment to section 28 deletes a superfluous exemption between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day when it falls on a weekday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall that during Second Stage the Minister seemed to agree that the reference to St. Patrick's Day in the Bill was superfluous.  I recall that I made the point that I could see no rationale for keeping St. Patrick's Day as a special day and treating it as Sundays.  It was on that basis that I put down several amendments to delete the words &ldquo;on St. Patrick's Day&rdquo;.  So far as the Minister has done that in relation to other sections I welcome it.  In this instance, where it falls on a weekday I cannot understand the rationale behind what the Minister is doing.  He is creating yet another hybrid type of opening hour where if St. Patrick's Day falls on a weekday no licensed premises may open before 12.30 p.m. and must close at 11 p.m.  Is there no reference to summer time?  Why are we not falling in with the normal licensing hours?  I do not understand the rationale behind it.  If it is that it is a feast day and people are expected to go to Mass then we would be doing the same thing on many other feast days.  I am taking a very partisan view on that.  I am looking around for a rationale and some reason because the Minister has not supplied one and perhaps he can enlighten me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister when he is dealing with restricted hours how this applies to early closing licences?  Will these licences be restricted as well?  There are approximately some 240 such licences in the country and while I appreciate that they got an opportunity <Col N="1918" /> in 1960 and again in 1964 the then owners of the licences did not avail of the opportunity given to them.  Will the Minister consider a small amendment now?  I am asking him to bring the six-day licences, or early closing licences, up to seven-day licence status.  This, I believe, would earn considerable interest for the Exchequer if the Minister would agree some kind of a converting rate with the vintners' and other associations.  Because of the change of time it would be very easy for the Minister to make this adjustment now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 43 and 44, and in page 12, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Every person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  allows or permits persons to remain on the premises for the purposes of consumption of intoxicating liquor in contravention of this section shall be liable upon summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £300, or in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, a fine not exceeding £600 or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) in fact sells or exposes for sale any intoxicating liquor or who opens or keeps open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable upon summary conviction thereof, in the case <Col N="1922" /> of a first offence to a fine not exceeding £400 or in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding £800.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am attempting to differentiate between two offences if possible and I am trying to get a word in to do it.  The Bill as it stands imposes a fine of £400 for a first offence and £800 for a second or any subsequent offence for persons either found on a licensed premises after the permitted hours or a person serving alcohol after the permitted hours.  The two offences are different.  It is a far more serious offence for somebody to serve drink after 11.30 p.m. on a weekday than for somebody to be found on such a premises after 12.5 a.m., yet the same maximum fine applies to both.  I have tabled an amendment to reduce the fine to £300 for persons found on the premises and £600 for subsequent offences and I have left the fine of £400 where a publican is caught serving drink after the finishing hour.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree to this amendment.  It gives us an opportunity of expressing our opinion as to the seriousness of an offence and I think it far more serious that somebody serves drink after a permitted hour than that a publican is trying to clear his premises and not supplying drink after the permitted hour.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the penalty which may be imposed on licences for allowing persons to be on licensed premises during prohibited hours or for selling drink during prohibited hours.  It is an offence under section 29 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962 to permit a person to be on licensed premises during prohibited hours, the penalty for a first offence being £20 and for a subsequent offence not more than £40.  In addition the offence is endorsable. I note that the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to change the nature of the offence from permitting a person to be on licensed premises to allowing or permitting persons to remain <Col N="1923" /> on the premises for the purpose of consumption of intoxicating liquor.  This qualification of the provision would make it extremely difficult to prove offences in such cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett also proposes that a fine for a first offence should be increased to a maximum of £300 and for a subsequent offence to £600.  In deciding on the amount of the fine it must be borne in mind that the offence is endorsable but that under the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, the endorsement is now at the discretion of the court.  I am also bearing in mind that the Bill already provides that the penalty for selling drink during prohibited hours is being increased to a maximum of £400 for a first offence and a maximum of £800 for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>Bearing all these considerations in mind I am disposed to agree with the proposal in the amendment that the fine for allowing persons to remain on licensed premises during prohibited hours should be increased to a maximum of £300 for a first offence and a maximum of £600 for a second offence.  I note also that the second part of the amendment would make some changes in the description of the offences of selling drink during prohibited hours now provided for in section 2 (2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927.</P>
      <P>To summarise in relation to this amendment, I would be disposed to agree with Deputy Barrett's proposal that the amount of fine for permitting a person to be on licensed premises during prohibited hours should be increased, but it is not clear that the wording of the amendment would improve on the text of the existing provision.  I would like to take up that matter with the draftsman and have it further considered before Report Stage. I can accept that part of it.  I am afraid I cannot accept the other part of the amendment because it would create a number of difficulties.</P>

      <P>In page 13, before section 28, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;It shall not be lawful for any person to compel or attempt to compel any employee of a licensed premises to work hours longer than those worked prior to the coming into effect of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment tries to establish the position of employees by reason of the increase in the licensing hours. Employees should not be compelled by law to work extra hours by reason of the increase in the licensing hours.  This is <Col N="1925" /> crucial from the point of view of the licensed trade workers because their history has been one of a struggle to gain reasonable and decent working conditions and to achieve hard won gains. We are concerned that, by extending the hours, these rights would be substantially eroded.  I do not want to take any more time because I know we are near the time appointed for taking the remaining sections but I should like to hear the Minister's response.</P>

The propose of this amendment, which follows in this respect the 1924 provisions, is to make it clear that no change is intended in the categories which may be made liable.

      <P>I move amendment No. 74.</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (3), to delete lines 6 to 8, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) £250, in the case of a first offence,</P>
      <P>(b) £500, in the case of a second offence, or</P>
      <P>(c) £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment, or both such fine and imprisonment in the case of a third or any subsequent offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> This amendment is an attempt to bring the level of penalty up to a more realistic level in view of the serious nature of the offences we are considering.  We propose, in general terms, a provision of increased fines in the first and second instance of the offence and on the third offence, in addition to the fine, the imposition of a term of imprisonment.  On the Second Stage debate, many Deputies indicated &mdash; and this view should be strongly addressed &mdash; that the sale or provision of alcohol to people under the age we consider undesirable, amounts to peddling a drug.</P>
    <P>The fines contained in the sections do not in any way reflect this.  Even on a third offence, there is no threat or sanction of imprisonment.  We are dealing with people who, on the whole, are experienced and sensible in their line of business, who should know what they are doing and who should fully appreciate the consequences of handing over, for gain, alcohol to children of 15 years or under.</P>
    <P>The situation is very serious, particularly in urban areas.  It is illegal but, nonetheless, in cities and provincial towns alcohol is sold to young people on a systematic basis.  For that reason, a monetary fine is not enough to deter the persistent offender.  There should also be the availability of the endorsement of his licence.  As the Minister and many Deputies know and appreciate, signing over to nominees is an avenue available to the threatened publican, licence holder, as a means of avoiding the ultimate endorsement requiring the suspension of the licence.  Therefore, it is not a useful or foolproof way of imposing sanctions.</P>
    <P>The other important aspect of the proposal, certainly for a third or subsequent offence &mdash; I made this point on Second Stage &mdash; is that by leaving open the option of a term of imprisonment the court not only will have the opportunity to mark its serious view of the persistent recurrence of the offence but will have the opportunity of compelling the offender, <Col N="1928" /> namely the licence holder, to be committed to community service work.  That is a very useful mechanism available to courts as an alternative to imprisonment but under the scheme of community service legislation, it cannot be imposed except as a substitute or in lieu of a term of imprisonment.  For that reason the court must have available to it the possibility of the imposition of imprisonment and to go on then to consider, as an alternative, community service work.  I cannot think of a better way to get people who persistently offend the code we are seeking to introduce to appreciate the harm they can visit on communities, the consequences they can impose on young people who imbibe alcohol than to have them do some useful work in those communities such as maintenance, redecoration, refurbishment or upkeep of a community centre often frequented by those young people at night time for their drink parties.  They could be put working in youth clubs which are used as a place of entertainment by young people.  We have always made the point that it is not possible to legislate away the problems we face.</P>
    <P>It might seem odd that The Workers' Party, who consider themselves to be to the forefront of the progressive movement of enlightened civil liberties, are making an argument for increased sanction and penalty but we must have a balance between the good of the community and the sanction to be visited on an offender.  In this instance we say that fines must be increased to a more realistic level and, for the persistent offender, our courts must have available to them the option of imprisonment.  We cannot think of a better person to be sent to prison, if ever a person is to be sent to prison, than the person who persistently peddles and for gain alcohol to young people.  We are suggesting that for a third, or subsequent offence, such a sanction should be applied.</P>
    <P>When considering the other amendments to be taken in conjunction with this it is worth noting the fines involved. For the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 years a fine of £50 is <Col N="1929" /> imposed for the first offence.  I must suggest that is not a realistic sanction for somebody who is engaged in business and making good money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the suggestion that the fine for a first offence should be £250 and, by the multiple of five, the fine for the second offence should be £500 and for a third offence £1,500.  They are not unrealistic.  If one looks at recent road traffic and misuse of drugs legislation one will see that the penalties are greater than the fines I am suggesting, even on a multiple of five. For a first offence for driving without insurance cover the fine is of the order of £1,000.</P>

      <P>In practice if one does not appear in court one can expect to get the works but I do not think the figures I am suggesting are unrealistic.  We must remember that in sections 31 to 33 we are trying to deal with those who are running lucrative businesses and making good incomes out of the sale of alcohol.  If we are to restrict ourselves to monetary sanctions they must be such as to hit those people in their pockets, an expression often used in our courts.</P>
      <P>Section 34 deals with the exclusion of children from licensed premises.  The range of penalty for such an offence is £50 for a first offence and £100 for a second offence.  We are suggesting that the fine for a first offence should be increased to £100 and for a second, or subsequent offence, to £250.  I do not believe they are unrealistic figures.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister indicates his attitude to penalties I should like to draw his attention to Deputy Colley's proposal in regard to them.  It is the last amendment on the sheet.  But by the way things are going I do not think it will be reached.  Will the Minister indicate if the Department have given consideration since Second Stage to an alternative to prison sentences and fines?  In my view fines have been low because as far as most publicans are concerned endorsement was the most severe penalty.  They are not concerned about £50 or £100.  In relation to the penology of the Bill, will the Minister say if the Department have given any thought to the question of suspension because I am convinced that, as set out in Deputy Colley's amendment, it would be the most effective sanction we could impose?  If we told the owner of the average pub in Dublin that he would be closed for a month he would not make a mistake again.  I am told by Deputy Colley that the vintners agree that that would be preferable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the biggest offenders are the owners of off-licences.  I accept that some publicans supply young people with intoxicating liquor.  I am aware of a person in my constituency who was serving drink to under-age people and was taken to court by local residents who had the support of the Garda.  The district justice stated that the evidence before him was not sufficient to convict <Col N="1931" /> that person.  He said it was necessary to produce photographs of young people leaving the premises with drink in their possession.  Off-licences have caused serious problems in Dublin and we have had a lot of vandalism caused after cider parties.  In many areas bus crews are refusing to operate because of drunken teenagers, and gardaí have to accompany them.  The fines should certainly be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for what they have said on this subject, not just tonight but when speaking on Deputy Barrett's Bill and on Second Stage of this Bill.  I accept the thrust of Deputy McCartan's amendment.  I am a bit worried about the multiple of five, but I accept that the amounts specified in the Bill are far too low.  It must be said that 99 per cent of publicans have no interest in selling drink to under-age people but there are the cowboys who will do it and these are the people we want to catch. The ordinary publican will not be in trouble because he will have respect and regard for young people and will not try to profit from their problems and weaknesses. We must be in a position to deal with the rogue operator and I am satisfied that the fines laid down are not good enough.  I will do something about it on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy McDowell's comments on an amendment by Deputy Colley, I have not been very successful in getting support on the question of suspending licence holders.  It is a matter we are still considering.  It was fairly well aired on Second Stage.  There is general agreement that we should focus our attention on protecting young people from unscrupulous licence holders.  These include off-licence holders, publicans, hoteliers and people who run discos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw the amendment in view of the Minister's agreement to look at the question.  A number of Deputies have addressed the question of third and subsequent offences <Col N="1932" /> being open to the sanction of imprisonment. I accept that we are talking about the 1 per cent who are rogues and I also accept Deputy Barrett's point that in the city area these are more often off-licence holders than publicans.  We are talking about people who are peddling something which is potentially as lethal as drugs and causes so much crime and vandalism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>This type of provision presents no threat or worry to 99 per cent of publicans and off-licence holders.  On the north side of the city the rogue operators are to be found in Phibsborough, in Fairview and along the seafront in Clontarf. They are readily identifiable and we can no longer tolerate their activities.</P>
      <P>I believe in the sanction of community service.  I am not interested in locking people up.  A good lesson for a publican or an off-licence holder would be to give him community work for a day or a month in the area where he is making trouble. The only way we can do that is in substitution for the penalty of imprisonment. If the Minister wants to insert one month instead of 12 months I will not object.  I simply want to enable a court to impose the sanction of community service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to admit that the penalties here are similar to those in my Bill and I was struck by the contributions of a number of Deputies relating to the level of penalty.  I would not object to an increase.  The problem about fixed fines is that £100 or £200 could be a considerable amount to a rural publican but to a city publican it is only a drop in the ocean.  Often such fines do not have the intended effect.  I sympathise with <Col N="1933" /> the point made by Deputies Colley and McDowell in relation to some sort of alternative punishment.  The suspension of a licence has an equal effect right across the board.  I take Deputy McCartan's point that a community service order might be appropriate.</P>
      <P>This House has shown its commitment to doing something about people who insist on serving alcohol to people as young as 12 or 13 years of age.  Most of this occurs in off-licences.  We now have an opportunity to do something about it. The public who sent us here have been asking for action long enough.  The penalty should be of such severity as to make it unprofitable to engage in that type of activity.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment, dealing with an exemption on a licensed premises. The section seeks to prevent those under the age of 18 being on premises while there is an exemption.  In general I would agree with this but there are situations where it could cause difficulties. For instance, children could be in a hotel attending a wedding.  Another instance is that of a hotel where, for the purpose of the Licensing Act, the whole premises would be licensed, including bedrooms.  There could be young children in those bedrooms and an interpretation of this section as it stands could mean that these children would have to be ejected from the premises if there was an exemption order.  I realise this is very technical but I do not think the Minister would wish it to have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is more or less restricted to hotels where the exemption order <Col N="1935" /> might apply.  It would also affect a restaurant with a special restaurant licence where an exemption order applies and a wedding party is taking place.  Under those circumstances there are children who should legitimately be allowed to be on the premises.  I would add that this should be in the company of their parents of guardians.  My two amendments were designed to take account of those situations.</P>

The Bill provides, in section 33, that persons under the age of 18 years will be prohibited from purchasing or consuming alcohol.  The whole point of the exemption order is to enable intoxicating liquor to be consumed outside the permitted hours.  If we were to accept Deputy Colley's amendments, we would be making a bad situation much worse.  How will the licensee know who are the parents or guardians of those young people of 17, or who are accompanying them?  It will lead to terrible problems and will bring about an impossible situation.

The definition of a licensed premises or a hotel covers the whole structure.

They would be trespassers in a private place and it would perhaps be important also to cover that situation.  I am proposing an addition to section 37 by means of my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that amendment. It makes very good sense.  In urban areas in many of the places mentioned by Deputy Taylor people trespass who have intoxicating liquor with them.  It is a useful amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern which may underline this proposed amendment.  However, I can show by illustration that the adoption of the amendment would make the effect of section 37 impossibly wide.  That section enables the Garda to seize containers of drink where it is suspected that certain offences under Part IV of the Bill have been or are being committed.  Let us take the situation where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects that the young person had consumed drink in a licensed premises and at some later date the <Col N="1938" /> Garda is aware that the youth concerned is in a private house in which the Garda suspects the youth is trespassing and has a container of intoxicating liquor.  If those circumstances obtain, the effect of the amendment would apparently be to give the Garda the right to enter that private house to seize the container of liquor.  I suggest that this would be an unreasonably wide extension of section 37.  If a Garda sees a youth or youths in a public place with bottles he may be reasonably certain that the bottles contain intoxicating liquor.  If however, they are in a private house it would be difficult for him to be reasonably certain of that.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies that when this provision was being drafted a large variation of the provisions now in section 37 were considered and it was decided that the provision in the Bill as it stands was as far as we could reasonably go in this matter.  In the light of what I have said perhaps the Deputies can understand the difficulty I am in, and that while I appreciate what they are trying to do, I am unable to accept their proposition.  By accepting their amendment I would widen the scope of the section to a degree I had not anticipated.</P>

      <P>That is precisely what I am trying to achieve by this amendment &mdash; the widening of the section.  The Minister has his problems with the section but we have problems on the ground with actual cases.  I do not know how it is in other constituencies but in many parts of mine there is a plethora of vandalised, abandoned houses and people are congregating in them regularly night after night, causing the most appalling problems. Are we going to leave those problems now that we are dealing with the thing?  Now is the time to deal with this and this is the very section that covers it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 87:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (1), between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) and such member may, in addition, where necessary to preserve the public peace arrest without warrant any person he suspects, with reasonable cause, to have committed an offence under sections 31, 32, 33 and 37 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> I am moving this on behalf of The Workers' Party.  This is a very sticky provision. When a member of the Garda Síochána confronts one of these unlawful assemblies or drinks parties &mdash; I do not want to use the term &ldquo;cider parties&rdquo; in deference to the cider trade, as we agreed on Second Stage &mdash; he is unable to arrest on the spot without warrant those persons he suspects with reasonable cause to have committed an offence under a number of the sections in this Bill.  This point is often missed in legislation of this sort.  The last time I came across it was in dealing with trespassers on the railway line.</P>
    <P>If we want the Garda Síochána to be of use in enforcing the law we are seeking to introduce, we must give them the power to arrest when necessary.  If a member of the Garda Síochána is called out to the scene of one of these unlawful assemblies by irate neighbours or people worried by them, the powers under this section enable him simply to seize, detain and remove, without warrant, a bottle or a container.  In other words, he can confiscate the alcohol.  What would happen is that these people would head off post haste to the off-licence or to the pub to replenish their stock and then they would go back to the waste ground and continue the party.  Alternatively, they would scatter, either dropping the drink or carrying it off, depending on the opportunity to escape, or they would stay and adopt a drunken or brazen attitude, taunting the Garda, knowing they cannot be arrested.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the garda sent to deal with this type of problem should have the power where he can identify the ringleaders, to isolate them, to take them in and make them answerable for the offences committed, to allow them to cool off in a prison cell for the night and face a court and judge in the morning. That is the only effective way to nip the problem in the bud in many of these instances.  If these parties are scattered they will just reassemble.  We must be a bit more realistic and try to address the outdoor drinking assemblies that are the real problems in this area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 89:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 39, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;39.&mdash;Every person over the age of 18 years shall be entitled to obtain from a member of the Garda Síochána, duly authorised by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for this purpose, a card displaying details of name, address, date of birth, photograph of <Col N="1944" /> the person applying for the card, signature of such person, and signature or stamp of the authorised garda; such card may be presented to a licensee by such person over the age of 18 years where the licensee requires it.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended, as is Deputy Barrett's amendment, to allow for the issuing of an identification card.  My amendment particularly does not require presentation of the identity card in each licensed premises.  It allows for it to be produced if the licensee demands it.  That is a reasonable approach to the issue.  I would not like to have something imposed on every 18-year old or on everybody over 18 but my amendment is reasonable.  I am aware that many public houses already operate their own identity card systems.  The Minister indicated on Second Stage that he would look at this point and perhaps he would do so now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment, amendment No. 90, is to enable the Minister to make regulations providing for the issue to any person, on request, of an identity card.  I deliberately worded my amendment in that way so as to keep it as simple as possible.  I was very pleased with the debate which took place on Second Stage of this Bill and on my own Bill on this issue.  We managed to get above the hysterical point where people begin to rant and rave as if by issuing identity cards we were going back to the time of the last World War and stamping people with numbers.  What I am endeavouring to achieve in this amendment is a compromise where identity cards would be issued on a voluntary basis, whereby if I wanted an identity card I would be able to go into the Department of Justice and obtain one in the same way as I could go into the Department of Foreign Affairs and obtain a passport, if I so wished.  I think we would find that young people would avail of that opportunity because they would find it is very handy to have an identity card.  There would be no compulsion on them to do so and it is very important to stress that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> The second part of my amendment would oblige the Minister to lay the regulations before the House for approval.  That would provide this House with an opportunity to discuss the regulations the Minister may make on the issuing of identity cards.  I ask the Minister to take on board my amendment because it adopts the right approach and would give us time to consider the ways and means of setting up a procedure for the issuing of identity cards by way of ministerial regulations.  Again, we would have the opportunity of debating those regulations when the Minister would bring them before the House.  I want to stress that what we are trying to achieve in this amendment is a compromise where it would be possible for people to obtain identity cards on a voluntary basis.  I am quite confident that young people would avail of such an opportunity.  It is evident from letters to the newspapers that young people would have no difficulty in accepting the principle of carrying an identity card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered this issue The Workers' Party do not go along with the idea of carrying an identity card. While the amendment seeks to achieve the issuing of identity cards on a voluntary basis, we believe that such a scheme would leave those who opt out at a disadvantage.  I believe that the carrying of identity cards is unnecessary as we have removed the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from the legislation and have placed a responsibility on the shoulders of the proprietor to find out if a person seeking a drink is over 18 years of age.  As we have said time and again, if there is any doubt in the mind of the proprietor the thing for him to do is not to serve a drink to the customer.  There are other ways and means by which a person can get some form of identification.  For example, every person at some stage must obtain a birth certificate and this can very easily be carried in a pocket or in a handbag and produced if necessary.  There are any number of ways and means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; has been deleted and the responsibility now rests on the proprietor to find out whether the person seeking a drink is over 18 years age.  If the proprietor is in doubt he should not serve the drink.</P>

    <P>During the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill and the earlier debate on Deputy Barrett's Private Members' <Col N="1947" /> Bill there was wide consensus that those who are expected to enforce the law should be helped in some way.  As was said here on a previous occasion we are all concerned about Big Brother.  I have given this matter a lot of thought as to how we should go about dealing with it. At first I thought we could adopt the approach as outlined in Deputy Colley's amendment but having given the matter some consideration and having taken advice on it, I think the approach adopted in Deputy Barrett's amendment would be more suitable as it would give me the power to introduce regulations which would have to be brought before the Oireachtas for approval.

      <P>I must point out that this section, if amended as proposed, would not constitute a coherent provision.  This is because the essential feature of this section is to give the Garda power to enter and search the premises of a registered club.  If the Deputy's intention is that this section should be amended so as to give the Garda power to enter and search premises of special licensed restaurants, then further amendment of the section would be required.  I would invite the Deputy's attention to section 3 of the Bill, the effect of which will be that it will be construed together with the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1988, that all those Acts shall be construed together as one.  A special licensed restaurant will be a <Col N="1950" /> licensed premises as required in section 1 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927. Accordingly, any member of the Garda Síochána will have the same power to enter the premises of special licensed restaurants as he had in relation to other licensed premises.  Therefore, the provision the Deputy is seeking is there already.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 95:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 43, but in Part V, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>43.&mdash;(1)  Subject to subsection (2) of this section a person shall not publish, or cause to be published, any advertisement drawing attention to any function to be held on the premises of a registered club.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the publication of a notice inside the premises of the registered club in which the function is to be held, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any advertisement in so far as it relates to a function involving any sport, game or physical recreation, or</P>
      <P>(c)  any circular issued by a registered club to its club members.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where there is a contravention of subsection (1) of this section then&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the registered club,</P>
      <P>(b)  every person entered in the register of clubs as an official or member of the committee of management or governing body of the club at the time the advertisement is published, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> (c)  any person who published the advertisement or caused it to be published</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  £300, in the case of a first offence, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  £500, in the case of a second or subsequent offence.</P>
    <P>(4)  In a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it shall be a defence for a person mentioned in subsection (3) (b) of this section to prove that the advertisement was issued without his consent or connivance and that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the publication of any such advertisement; and</P>
    <P>(b)  it shall be a defence for a person mentioned in subsection (3) (c) of this section to prove that he is a person whose business it is to publish or arrange for the publication of advertisements and that he received the advertisement in question for publication in the ordinary course of business and did not know and had no reason to suspect that its publication would constitute an offence under the said subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of this section an advertisement published by displaying or exhibiting it shall be treated as published on every day on which it is displayed or exhibited.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; includes every form of advertising, whether in a publication or by the display of notices or by means of circulars or other documents or by an exhibition of photographs or a cinematograph film, or by way of sound broadcasting or television or by inclusion in a cable programme service, and references to the publishing of an advertisement shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> The purpose of this amendment is to restrict the advertising of functions in registered clubs.  Functions in registered clubs should be for the entertainment of members and their guests.  Any Deputy who picks up a paper and looks through the entertainment columns, or even the special or personal notices, will see advertisements for functions such as discos. These are aimed at the general public and not specifically at club members.  There is great potential for abuse of club certificates in these public advertisements and this amendment recognises that fact. The provisions will not apply to notices posted inside the club premises or to circulars to club members because both of those methods of advertising are legitimately aimed at club members.  Also the provision of the section will not relate to a function involving any sport, game or physical recreation.  Any contravention of the provisions of the section by a registered club, a club official or a member of the committee of management or a person who publishes the advertisement will be deemed to be an offence carrying a maximum fine of £300 on first conviction and a maximum fine of £500 for the second or subsequent offences.  The provisions of subsection (4) provide a defence for club officials and persons who publish advertisements.</P>

The line of defence being made available in this subsection appears to me to be very generous indeed.  I wonder if ever a prosecution could be seriously mounted if the line of defence provided there is so readily available.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 96:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 43, but in part V, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>43.&mdash;The reference in section 5 (d) of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, to twenty-five members shall, as respects objections to the grant after the passing of this Act of a certificate of registration under that Act, be construed as a reference to one hundred and fifty members.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, enables intoxicating liquor to be supplied in a club to members and their guests.  A court may refuse to grant its pre-registration certificate if the number of club members is fewer than 25.  During the Second Stage Debate Deputy Seán Barrett proposed that, to help prevent a proliferation of clubs whose main objectives and purpose would be the supply of intoxicating liquor, the minimum number of members should be increased.  I accept the validity of the argument.  Accordingly, this amendment proposes to increase the minimum number from 25 to 150 members.  This should ensure that <Col N="1954" /> genuine clubs only, with a genuine purpose for existence, will gain certificates in the future.  Of course, renewals for existing clubs will not be affected by this measure even though their membership be fewer than 150.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 97:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 43, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;43.&mdash;(1)  This section shall apply in relation to any premises in which intoxicating liquor is not sold for consumption on the premises, but in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises on foot of an off-licence or a wine on-licence and in which commodities other than intoxicating liquor are sold by retail.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section shall not apply in relation to any premises where the only business carried on is the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises and the sale of commodities ancillary to such business, such as cigarettes, tobacco, cigars, matches, confectionery, and beverages other than intoxicating liquor.</P>
      <P>(3)  In any premises to which this section applies, intoxicating liquor shall not be sold by self-service methods and shall not be sold otherwise than from an intoxicating liquor counter.</P>
      <P>(4)  If in any premises to which this section applies, there is a contravention of the provisions of this section, the holder of the licence in respect of the premises shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
      <P>(5)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;self-service methods&rsquo; means any method of sale allowing a customer to supply himself with the article sold on or before payment therefore;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" />&lsquo;intoxicating liquor counter&rsquo; means a counter, or a separate portion of the licensed premises concerned from or at which commodities other than intoxicating liquor are not sold or paid for.:</P>
    <P>(6)  This section shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate the point was made, especially by Deputy Davern, that the sale of intoxicating liquor alongside household commodities in premises such as supermarkets could lead to impulse buying of alcohol.  It was also pointed out that, where alcohol was paid for at the same cash desk and at the same time as other commodities, there was very little real control over such sales.  I agree with those sentiments.  There is no doubt that there is scope for abuse of the ban on the sale of alcohol to under eighteens under the present methods of sale of alcohol in some shops and supermarkets. Subsection (3) is intended to do something about those circumstances by banning self-service sales, ensuring that intoxicating liquor will be sold only from a special intoxicating liquor counter.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) restricts the application of the provisions of the section to premises which sell alcohol for consumption off the premises on foot of an off-licence or a wine-on-licence.  Most supermarkets and shops that sell intoxicating liquor do so under one or other of those licences.  It also restricts the provisions of the section to ordinary mixed trading premises.  The provisions of subsection (2) exclude ordinary off-licences whose only business is the sale of intoxicating liquor, that is apart from the sale of such ancillary products as cigarettes, tobacco, cigars, matches, confectionery and beverages. The provisions of subsection (5) provide a maximum penalty of £500 on being convicted of contravening the provisions of this section.  Subsection (6) is self-explanatory, and subsection (7) will require a commencement order bringing the provisions of the section into operation.  This is to give shops and <Col N="1956" /> supermarkets time to make the necessary alterations for compliance with the provisions of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The enumeration of the different sections by the Minister and those contained in the amendment do not seem to tally.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that as I speak.</P>
      <P>I welcome this amendment and commend Deputy Davern for having drawn it to the Minister's attention.  It is one of the problems many of us encountered in trying to deal with the question of the sale of alcohol to young people, having identified the ease with which alcohol can be taken from the shelves of supermarkets and open-shelf shops.  Now that we are imposing such a rigorous code on the proprietors of shops, off-licences and other places &mdash; in terms of the non-sale, delivery or provision to persons under the age of 18, the question arose: how did one address the problem presented by the open-shelf shop or supermarket? Clearly this amendment goes a great distance in addressing that problem and is to be welcomed by everyone in this House. Because of the scale of the problem, and the significant role these types of shops have played in the past perhaps the level of the penalties to be imposed warrant further consideration.  Am I correct in thinking that the endorsement of licences is not a sanction readily available in respect of the supermarket or the open-shelf shop.</P>
      <P>In the context of our earlier discussion would the Minister consider the imposition of a penalty, by way of imprisonment, as a means of implementing the community service regime about which we spoke?  That is something the Minister might consider between now and Report Stage, within the overall context, because it is my belief that the fines are unrealistically low.</P>

      <P>The other point I want to make refers to sweets retailers off-licences which I never knew existed.  I understand that a number of the shops which are causing a great deal of the problems in relation to under-age drinking have sweets retailers off-licences. Apparently this licence may be granted, renewed or transferred by the excise authorities without the production of a court certificate.  The licence expires on 30 September and the excise duty payable is £50.  I understand that many of the main offenders who sell drink to under-age teenagers hold these sweets retailers off-licences.  It is time we did something about them.  I want to know if the Minister can bring an amendment forward on Report Stage to deal with this.  Now that we are tightening up the area of under-age drinking, the Minister should bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to deal with this.  I believe these licences should be abolished.  It is crazy how these licences are got; they can be transferred all over the place.  I have been told that it is this type of shop which is selling the bulk of the cider and so on to under-age drinkers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 99:</P>
      <P>In page 22, before section 44, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;44.  &mdash;(1)  Where a court has convicted a person of an offence under the Acts and such offence is deemed for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act of 1927 to be an offence to which that part of that Act applies, the court may in lieu of, or in addition to such endorsement, order that the licence relating to the premises shall stand suspended during such period as shall be specified in the order, being not less than one day and not more than thirty days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a licence is suspended under subsection (1) during a period, the premises to which it relates shall not be used for the purposes of sale or of consumption of intoxicating liquor, and in any proceedings arising out of the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor on the premises during the period of such suspension, it shall not <Col N="1961" /> be a defence to show that there was a licence in being authorising such sale or consumption.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We referred to this earlier in the context of penalties under the Bill.  I know the Minister has given some consideration to it and has undertaken to do so further between now and Report Stage.  I want to emphasise again the importance of having a penalty which affects licence holders evenly, equally and is a real deterrent.  Earlier we discussed the fact that endorsement in the end can be got out of and licences can be transferred so it really is not the ultimate penalty it is considered to be.  Suspension could be very effective in this area and I earnestly urge the Minister to find some way around any difficulties that are being perceived at present.</P>

    <P>The point was made very forcibly by Deputy Davern on Second Stage that the fine for being found drunk in a public place or a licensed premises was totally out of line with modern monetary values. The present maximum fine of £2 was <Col N="1962" /> set in 1872 and doubled to £4 in 1924.

      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the manner in which the privatisation of school transport might affect employees in Bus Éireann.  Deputy Higgins has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to you and the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 12 May, I sought, by way of supplementary question to my question, not of that day, to elicit information on the proposals of the Minister for Education on the implications for Bus Éireann and their staff of her decision to withdraw the contract for school transport from Bus Éireann on a pilot basis in Counties Clare, Laois, Sligo and Cavan. On that occasion the precise information I sought was not forthcoming and circumstances over which I had no control intervened to stop me getting the information I required.  I would now, this evening, like to repeat my demand for an answer to some basic questions as to the implications of the Minister's decision in relation to the pilot schemes and her announced intention, if successful in the pilot schemes, to extend this privatisation of school transport on a national basis. There is some urgency attached to this matter in view of the fact that at the moment redundancy notices are, as I speak, being prepared for 93 drivers in the pilot areas and for perhaps as many as 42 other workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 May 1988 Mr. L. Walsh, who enjoys the title of manager of human resources in Bus Éireann, sent a letter to the trade unionists who are involved in this part of Bus Éireann's activities.  He said in the course of that letter that the company had since examined the matter further; that as explained at their meeting there was no prospect of redeployment for the school bus drivers in four counties where 93 drivers out of the company's <Col N="1964" /> total of 730 school bus drivers were employees; that consequently so as to comply with the requirements of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act it was now necessary for notices of dismissal due to redundancy to be issued to the 93 school bus drivers concerned; and that the notice would be issued by the local district manager to be effective from the last day on which the particular school service was required or expiry date of the prescribed notice, whichever was the later.  That was the main paragraph in the letter from the manager of human resources of Bus Éireann to the different trade unionists who are involved in this part of Bus Éireann's activities.  So we are dealing with the reality of approximately 135 notices.</P>
    <P>Let me mention in passing that this is in direct contravention of assurances given in 1986 on the occasion of the breaking up of CIE into the three new companies which came from it.  It is also in contravention of the spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which spoke of the avoidance of compulsory redundancies.  It is stated in this letter, which I will have no difficulty in placing in the Library of the House, that Bus Éireann have said they cannot redeploy the people concerned.  By the way, there is no economic saving for the Department of Education involved because, having established that these people are to be made redundant, the cost of the redundancies will be approximately £7 million, and I am being conservative in my estimate of that.  If the scheme is extended nationally, the number of people who will be let go will be 1,118 at least.  If one took 1985-86 figures this 1,118 would be made up of 739 part time drivers, 26 regular drivers, 6 executives, 16 senior clerical officers, 45 clerical officers, 9 shorthand typists, three typists, five temporary clerks, 53 inspectors, 19 maintenance supervisors, 5 shop clerks, 130 engineering craftsmen, 54 engineering operatives and 8 apprentices.  There is little less than job destruction involved in this, because what is proposed by way of pilot scheme with the possibility of further <Col N="1965" /> extension is threatening the livelihood of the people who are involved.</P>
    <P>I would say, and this is something I will come to in a moment, that there are issues that are raised by this that go beyond the issues of school transport themselves.  For example, Bus Éireann's rural service is already being curtailed in a number of areas including the areas in the constituency which is represented by the Minister of State and myself.  Only last week I got news of the people of Moyard in North Connemara having their service cut whereby on four days of the week they will have no service at all affecting people's ability to get to the clinics and to different services, and the people affected by that kind of cut in rural transport are people who are too poor, too old, too young to use their own private motor cars.  Let us be in no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>The removal of this business, the removal of the Department of Education contract from Bus Éireann, will have the effect of removing £18 million in revenue from Bus Éireann, should they lose this contract, will without doubt have to come back immediately and double the amount of the subvention requested if it is to continue to supply rural services.  I will say something in a moment about the madness of all of this.  Bus Éireann operate this provincial bus service in an integrated way with the school transport service using the same garage facilities, using the same service costs and so forth, and there may be a cost of up to £10 million in addition required by Bus Éireann if they are to lose that proportion of service costs which is now being carried by the school transportation scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals are not coming at a time when the cost to her Department for the service has risen in any remarkable fashion.  The fact is that over the last three years the costs of the scheme have not risen appreciably.  The school transport scheme, in 1985, carried 169,500 children to and from school daily in 855 special school buses owned by the Department of Education and driven mainly by part-time drivers together with <Col N="1966" /> approximately 1,610 privately operated vehicles of mainly small capacity.</P>
    <P>In regard to what CIE will be losing, let us take the main points of the argument. They will be losing £18 million in revenue. If the scheme is extended nationally the job losses will be 1,118 with associated redundancy costs of about £7 million.  In addition to that, revenue of £2.4 million earned on all CIE schedules services will be placed at risk.  I have spoken already about the threat to the very nature of Bus Éireann itself.  The fact is the implications for the road passenger services are disturbing because there will be a loss from a scheduled service revenue of about £1.7 million. Additional costs of £4 million will arise from the loss of the benefit of sharing costs of school transport.  This will lead to the elimination of a wide range of services and the further loss of many jobs if the necessary actual support is not forthcoming and I do not see any indication that there will be a rush to provide Bus Éireann with additional finance if this contract which is so necessary for its future existence, is removed.  As Bus Éireann is weakened by the removal of the school transport contract those other private bus operators who last year took £3 million by creaming the best, most dense and heavily travelled routes, will be absolutely delighted as they prepared to move into the vacuum of a weakened Bus Éireann.  What is happening is all the more scandalous in that the scheme established in 1967 has been acknowledged by inspectors in the Minister's Department as being one that met their requirements in terms of safety and that it has been updated over the years. Approximately £2 million had been spent on increasing and developing facilities and about £200,000 on improving the computer facilities so as to eliminate delays which all elected representatives are familiar with, in the issue of tickets and so forth.</P>
    <P>There are serious implications for CIE and the devolution of the administration of the scheme would undoubtedly lead to a weakening in the existing accountability, consistency and uniformity of <Col N="1967" /> application achieved by CIE and so essential over the years to the transportation scheme.  In relation to accountability, the Minister has not yet said what the terms of the contracts or the tenders will be.  She said that CIE will be free like everybody else, to tender for this work. This makes absolutely no sense so far as the fleet is owned by the Department of Education.  A point I will develop in a moment is the question of where the buses will come from.  The cost of fleet replacement is at the base of this scheme. The Minister has come up with a totally cracked figure regarding the cost.</P>
    <P>Most of the private bus operators who are waiting in the wings buy secondhand buses in Britain costing in the region of £8,000 to £10,000.  There is nothing to stop the Department of Education doing the same and painting them yellow or green or having shamrocks on them, depending on what the Minister likes. For purely ideological reasons she is hellbent on destroying a State company, a company in respect of which there is a breach of trust of the honour of this House because in 1986 the workers involved were told on the occasion of the passing of legislation affecting the old CIE that their jobs would not be in danger.  This is now the destruction of their jobs by stealth.</P>
    <P>CIE have, over the years not only spent the money to which I referred but have developed modern techniques for maximising efficiency such as the computerised system which I have already mentioned and which has already been applied in the primary school transport scheme.  If you move away from such a centralised scheme onto the kind of devolved and decentralised type of transport officer arrangements which the Minister suggests, it is difficult to see how use could be made of that facility upon which we have spent nearly £250,000. There is a matter of wasting the expenditure that has already been made.</P>
    <P>The lack of capital provision for school buses would lead to a position where the vast majority of school children &mdash; in the conceivable future &mdash; will be carried by <Col N="1968" /> private operators.  PAMBO, the organisation claiming to represent many private operators, have made many unrealistic demands over the years, all with the objective of increasing the remuneration of contractors to the maximum extent possible and thereby increasing the cost of the scheme.  In the new situation, PAMBO's hand would be strengthened considerably in pursuing such demands.  Although there is no indication, because they would have to carry some of the socially necessary parts of the transport system, that they would automatically bid for those.  The tender systems will make it possible for those who are already creaming the system to apply for the better parts and no doubt people will turn around for the suitable State duck to take the rest.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised also that practically all suitably located buses in the private sector are already engaged in school transport and, therefore, to cater for the additional work would involve the acquisition of vehicles from outside the State.  The effect of the Minister's proposal is to say to them: &ldquo;I will not buy the buses from anywhere, you buy the buses from England and operate them privately&rdquo;.  Obviously, the costs involved in extending or replacing their fleet will have to be reflected in the charge for services which will ultimately be borne by the Department of Education.  I find it very difficult to understand why the Minister is going ahead with this proposal, a proposal which, in a diluted form, had come before the Cabinet in 1986 and was blocked by the Labour Ministers after a meeting attended by the CIE group of trade unions and the Parliamentary Labour Party.  At that time two pilot schemes were proposed but they were blocked, abandoned. There had been an embryonic version of this proposal floating around in Fianna Fáil for about ten years.  That proposal was for one pilot scheme.  The implications of these proposals for workers who began work in CIE are little less than catastrophic.  The control of the scheme will be weakened by the fragmentation of administrative responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> In summary these are the questions I want the Minister to answer.  How does he justify the forced redundancies involved within the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i> How does he justify the proposed forced redundancies in the pilot schemes?  One of the people who is chairing the group of bus drivers affected is a near neighbour of the Minister.  If he wants to contact him he will have no difficulty whatsoever as the man lives in Gort and he will be able to tell the Minister the effect of these proposals on his members.  I doubt if he will tell him that he welcomes these proposals. Where precisely is there any economic saving for the State?  If there is no economic saving for the State what answer is there to the suggestion that these proposals are being put forward for purely ideological reasons?  What indications are there that PAMBO will provide the fleet?  What is so wonderful about PAMBO buying English buses and blocking the State from providing them?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would ask his senior Minister why she has refused to meet the CIE group of trade unions who wanted to discuss with her the destruction of their jobs.  They have written to her repeatedly asking for an opportunity to discuss the impact of these proposals.  She has refused to meet them. She had not scheduled a single meeting with any of the unions involved in the old CIE and who are involved in Bus Éireann.  She had hoped to slide up to the end of this session of the Dáil and when the redundancy notices had been issued and would be coming into effect on 1 September the men would be gone, would be in different places, and in the autumn she could say that she would extend the scheme nationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said she will use CEOs, that she will extend their functions in relation to transport.  The Local Government and Public Services Union are against her proposals and have instructed their staff involved not to co-operate in their implementation.  The TUI have done likewise.  All the CIE trade unions are against these proposals. Where is the public demand for them?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> There is something that is most important to me, irrespective of what I have said tonight.  There is need for improvement, particularly in the transport arrangements for carrying the handicapped to their different schools.  This is a matter which has been neglected for many years.  I am aware of people being collected in their homes in Tallaght at about 6.45 a.m. and arriving out in Dundrum at 9.05 a.m.  I am aware of cerebral palsy children who are unsteady being placed on the inside of other children with nobody establishing insurance responsibility for carrying them.  Drivers cannot include it in their cover.  The owners of the buses refuse to be responsible. The Minister, who owns the bus, refuses to be responsible.  Is she telling me that when she has taken a semi-State company out of the business of carrying people for the Department of Education and broken it down around all these different private operators, she will have addressed or improved that issue of safety?</P>
    <P>These proposals are a monstrous attack on working people and their lives.  More than those relying on and entitled to free transport are involved.  In Dublin city those under 16 are entitled to a 60 per cent reduction in fares and those over 16 to a 50 per cent reduction.  The same is true of the country areas.  It was worth last year £1 million by way of subsidy in rural areas and £3 million in Dublin.  Is she or her Minister of State telling me that the private operators will want to give £3 million in subsidy for children's tickets in Dublin or £1 million in the rural areas?  It is a disgrace and a sad day when a Fianna Fáil Minister would want to wreck jobs in CIE and deprive the public of a good and accountable service which has served us well since 1967.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Higgins for his very forceful contribution to this debate.  At the outset I would like to clarify what is intended in relation to the question of changes in the operation of the school <Col N="1971" /> transport service in the school year 1988-89.</P>
      <P>I should say that the Department of Education have a responsibility to ensure the satisfactory delivery of transport services to approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We also have the responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service.  This is particularly so in the current economic circumstances where all services have to be rigorously examined for cost-effectiveness and because of the major expense of the scheme itself &mdash; approximately £36 million in the current year.  Concern has been expressed over many years and from many quarters at this level of expenditure and I consider it our responsibility to explore all possible means of reducing the drain on our financial resources while continuing to provide a satisfactory level of service to our children.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the day-to-day operation of the school transport scheme is carried out by Bus Éireann as an agent for the Minister for Education. This function has been discharged efficiently by the company since the inception of the scheme in 1968.  In the intervening 20 years, generations of children have benefited by the scheme, many of whom would otherwise have had extreme difficulty in attending school on a regular basis.  Great care is exercised in all aspects of the operation and the expertise and good work of the company is worthy of our appreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is essential, as I have said, to explore all possible means of reducing expenditure and as part of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, the Government have had under consideration the possibility of introducing a system based on local arrangements. To enable further consideration of this possibility we have decided to introduce, in respect of the school year 1988-89, pilot projects with regard to devolved administration of the primary <Col N="1972" /> and post-primary transport operation in Counties Cavan, Sligo, Laois and Clare.</P>
    <P>Ths basis on which the devolved arrangements will operate has been given full consideration and it has been decided that the administration of the projects should be undertaken by the chief executive officers of the respective vocational education committees.  Under this arrangement, all matters pertaining to the organisation and day-to-day operation of the schemes will transfer from Bus Éireann to the CEO who wil act as director of the project and will consult with a local committee which will be representative of primary and post-primary schools in the area.</P>
    <P>The organisational and operational responsibility of the directors will include the determination of pupils' entitlement and the allocation of bus routes.  All routes will be put out to tender and it will be open to Bus Éireann to tender in the normal way.  The projects will be closely monitored and the question of a general application of these or similar arrangements will be considered in the light of experience of these projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the consequences of these projects for Bus Éireann and Bus Éireann staff, I would have to say that I am not unmindful of the difficulties as outlined by Deputy Higgins which may ensue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of Bus Éireann school transport employees in the counties concerned, that will, of course, in the first instance be a matter for the company.  My primary concern must be to ensure a satisfactory school transport service at the lowest possible cost to the State.  As matters stand the Department are a major customer of Bus Éireann and will continue as such for the coming school year.  In introducing the pilot projects we are, in effect, testing another model for the transport service and I consider that we are perfectly justified in doing this for reasons already given.  This will undoubtedly have some effect on Bus Éireann but I must emphasise that with the open tendering arrangement the opportunity will exist for the company to secure substantial business <Col N="1973" /> as a contractor in the project areas.  In general, however, it will be a matter for the company to adjust to changed circumstances, something which is an intrinsic part of everyday commercial activity.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to correct the impression that we are engaged on a drastic and sweeping scheme of privatisation.  Indeed, I might mention that a very substantial part of school transport activities is currently carried out by private contractors. Approximately 50 per cent of the total service is now being provided by private contractors.</P>

I take the point when Deputy Higgins interjected and said &ldquo;administered by Bus Éireann.  I would consider that Bus Éireann&rdquo; business is to be in the transport business rather than in the administration of it which might be carried out just as efficiently by others who are already in engaged in the education provision.</P>

    <P>Finally, I would emphasise again that we are talking about a pilot project.  I cannot predict what its outcome will be. I feel I ought to say, however, that the concept of the transfer of the organisation of the school transport service on the ground to local parties has been put forward by many interests over a good many years.  My view is that we shall never know how a devolution of the service to local organisations would work <Col N="1974" /> out unless we get around at last to actually trying it out on a pilot basis and I am sure the Deputy will agree with me in this. This, indeed, is all we are doing now.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one or two points the Deputy made in his speech.  He talked about purely ideological reasons for this change.  I refute that absolutely.  There is simply one reason, that the people of this State are entitled to services at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer.  Deputy Higgins mentioned the efforts by the previous Government to bring in this scheme, and he rightly pointed out that these efforts were thwarted by the Labour Ministers.  These represent just one of a number of efforts that were thwarted by the Labour Ministers which led this country almost to the point of being a banana republic when the previous Government left office.</P>

      <P>Let me be quite candid. Every time I have come into this House Deputy Higgins has called for this Government to spend more money.  That is exactly what has been happening in this country over the years and it has got us into the position we found ourselves in 12 months ago when we took over in Government.  I have nothing but admiration for the Bus Éireann operation in particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no reason they should allow any drivers to become redundant if they are capable, as I am sure they are, of competing in an open market economy with other people. They are much stronger then anybody else.</P>

If they cannot do it competitively they do not deserve to be considered.  As a company if they are not able to meet this challenge they are to blame if they have to allow their drivers to become redundant.  However, I am confident that will not be the case.

      <P>The total cost of printing commissioned by the Stationery Office from commerical printers in this period was £5,300,000 including services provided on a repayment basis.  In addition a substantial amount of urgent and confidential reproduction of forms, reports etc. was undertaken in the inplant unit within the Stationery Office.  The cost to the State of this work was of the order of £350,000.  The total cost of stationery and printing for the Houses of the Oireachtas was £1.1 million.</P>
      <P>The Stationery Office is now part of the Government Supplies Agency within the ambit of the Office of Public Works.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 21 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements for the EC Structural Funds are still at the drawing board stage in Brussels.  A series of detailed Regulations have to be put in place, which are not expected to be finalised until the end of the year.  We propose, however, to go ahead with our preparations without waiting for all of the details to be completed and to be ready to submit our proposals for drawing on the increased resources which will be available as soon as possible after the new system comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major implication of the new system is that a national development plan must be drawn up for Ireland in respect of the expenditure areas covered by the Structural Funds.  This plan will set out the priorities which Ireland will concentrate on in the period to 1992.  On the basis of this plan, the Community will indicate the amount of support which it is willing to provide to Ireland over the period. Subsequent to the national plan, a series <Col N="1765" /> of operational programmes will have to be developed spelling out in more detail how we are going to implement the plan. This is likely to be a mix of national programmes (for example for roads) and geographically based programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government are considering what special administrative arrangements may be needed to meet these new Community requirements.  As the Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach has already indicated that there will be close consultation with the social partners under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Work is already going ahead in relation to preparing programmes.  A steering committee for a programme for the Dublin area have already been established, including representation from the local authorities and the private sector. It is envisaged that the programme approach will be extended as soon as possible throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The question of the definition of the area to be covered by the programmes for greater Cork and the west is under consideration at Government in the context of our overall approach to the EC Structural Funds.  The inclusion of Kerry in the programme for the greater Cork area will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided recently that each Minister should initiate a programme to review the statutory and information requirements of his Department and the bodies under its aegis which impact on business and industry.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in carrying out such a review, which is being co-ordinated by the Personnel and Organisation Section.  As it will be some time before the results are available I am not in a position to give the Deputy any further details on the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>The new compliance cost assessments which have now been introduced cover the assessment of all costs (including administrative costs) to industry of compliance with any proposed new regulations or amendments to existing regulations which impact on industry. This compares with an earlier requirement in operation since March 1985, which covered only new proposals being submitted to Government and which called for an estimate of the direct industrial costs involved in the proposals.</P>

When the matter came to be decided at senior level in the Commissioners' Office it was found that the earlier information furnished to the Deputy was erroneous because the goods in question were not eligible to be imported duty-free under the travellers' baggage allowances and were not declared to customs on importation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's Finance Bill contains the changes in capital allowances which I announced in the budget as part of a major reform of the corporation tax code.  There will be a phased reduction in the first year capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings, from 100 per cent to 50 per cent.  Of course, the normal wear and tear allowances will be available to write off over a number of years the balance of expenditure which is not written off by the reduced first-year allowances.  The reduction in accelerated capital allowances has to be taken in the context of the parallel reduction in tax rates, which is the other major element of the corporation tax reform.  The new capital allowances will remain unchanged until 1991.</P>
      <P>Certain specific exceptions to the reduction in capital allowances have been allowed for in the Finance Bill &mdash; they will not apply to expenditure incurred under contracts entered into on or before budget day, or to projects which are approved by the industrial development agencies by 31 December 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For manufacturing companies which have of course the special low tax rate of 10 per cent, the reduction in capital allowances will be of much less importance <Col N="1770" /> than for companies liable at the standard rate of 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>A likely effect of the reduction in capital allowances will be to boost industrial investment in the short term as companies take advantage of the existing higher rates.  In addition, I would point out that our capital allowances have been, by any standards, very generous and they have led to certain distortions in favouring capital investment over employment.  The changes I have made will redress the balance.</P>

      <P>The Stationery Office no longer occupies any accommodation in Beggar's Bush and all the office's operations apart from the Government Publications Sales Office have been centralised in Bishop Street.  As such I propose to confine my reply to the Bishop Street premises.</P>
      <P>The cost of the new complex at Bishop Street for the Stationery Office is £8.55 million including fees for consultants, fitting out, floor covering and furniture. The fee simple of the premises was conveyed to the Commissioners of Public Works in 1978.</P>

    <P>The annual cost of heating, lighting, maintenance and repairs to this building is of the order of £196,000.

This agency consists of the Stationery Office, the Central Purchasing Section of the Department of Defence <Col N="1771" /> and existing central purchasing functions of the Office of Public Works.  The net out-turn of the Stationery Office Vote (No. 16) for 1987 was £9.136 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the implications for Ireland of the recently adopted EC directive which liberalises public procurement in the EC with particular reference to the opening up of the market to EC firms of all forms of <Col N="1776" /> Government purchasing and building contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Directive in the public procurement field to which the Deputy refers, namely, the revised supply contracts directive, was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 22 March 1988 and is expressed to take effect not later than 1 January 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Directive, which does not apply to works, e.g. construction, contracts, extends the scope of existing EC regulations on competitive tendering for certain Government, regional and local authority purchasing contracts.  It aims at opening up these contracts to greater competition by widening the type of contract covered.  As well, with a view to deterring discrimination on national <Col N="1777" /> grounds, it requires greater use of open competition and introduces advance advertising of purchasing needs and the publication of the results of contract awards.</P>
    <P>This is the first in a programme of measures which the Commission is undertaking designed to open up progressively to EC-wide competition all public-sector contracts both for purchasing and works.  Public sector procurement is estimated to represent up to 15 per cent of Community GDP and its liberalisation, which has been given a high priority by the Commission, is regarded as an essential step towards the completion of the internal market by 1992.  The other main measures in the programme comprise three draft directives dealing with, respectively, (1) the works area, (2) the means of redress for aggrieved firms generally and (3) the sectors at present excluded from the EC public procurement code.</P>
    <P>The implications of the recent Directive, in particular the move to the greater use of open tendering, and the new publicity requirements, must be considered in our case against the general background that (i) we already operate open tendering to a greater extent than other member states and (ii), given the nature of our economy, the import content of our purchases is in any event very high. The directive will, together with the other proposals designed to open up public procurement, present for Irish industry a challenge and an opportunity.  More Irish contracts will be opened up to foreign competition &mdash; and this may pose a challenge for the traditional sector of industry where public contracts in this sector are concerned.  However, more significantly in the context of the completion of the internal market, the move will provide greatly increased export opportunities from which firms in the new industrial base and in the traditional sector which are competitive should be well placed to profit.  In regard to the opening up of works contracts, the construction industry is considered to be sufficiently competitive to take advantage of the opportunities offered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> For most member states, as well as Ireland, the planned changes in regard to public procurement will present major opportunities as well as potential problems. Industries and individual firms that are competitive will achieve access to new Community markets while those that are uncompetitive will be at risk.  At Community level, the liberalisation is expected to have a profound effect on the structure of European industry, make it competitive at world level and enable it to face up to the challenge posed by its major trading competitors.</P>
    <P>Ireland shares the objectives of the liberalisation of public procurement while at the same time being conscious of the need, in looking at specific proposals to this end, to ensure that our particular circumstances and needs are taken into account to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure that assistance from the EC's Structural Funds, particularly the European Regional Development Fund, is used as effectively as possible, the Government have decided to move towards a programme approach for Irish submissions for aid from these funds.  The Government further decided that a study should be carried out to formulate a four-year programme for the Greater Dublin Area, primarily with the European Regional Development Fund in mind but making specific provision also for support from the European Social Fund and, as appropriate, from the FEOGA Guidance Fund and the other Community financial instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering committee have been set up to oversee the preparation and implementation of the study and, eventually, the programme.  The committee comprise representatives of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food, <Col N="1780" /> Energy, Environment, Labour, Industry and Commerce, Tourism and Transport; the Dublin City and County Manager: Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Commission of the European Communities. Departmental representatives will be accompanied by representatives of relevant State-sponsored bodies as the need arises.  The Chairman and the Secretariat are provided by the Department of Finance.  As the Deputy is aware, it is the convention not to name officials in the House and accordingly I do not propose to give the names of the members of the committee.</P>
    <P>The steering committee have drawn up a brief for the study, on the basis of which tenders were invited from consultants. The closing date for submission of proposals was 30 April and those that have been received are being examined at the moment.  It is envisaged that work on the study will commence in June with a final report being submitted at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The site of the ancient monastery of Durrow is a national monument and is protected under the National Monuments Acts.  The Church to which the cross fragment in question had been attached is not part of the national monument. Having fallen from the church some years ago, it was apparently removed to Durrow Abbey which is a private residence nearby and, as far as I can ascertain, is still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> It is most desirable that the cross fragment referred to should be protected in conjunction with the site as a whole and negotiations to this end are being pursued by the National Museum and the Office of Public Works.  I am aware that the cross was offered for sale outside the jurisdiction but this proposal was withdrawn when the illegality of such a transaction without the requisite licence was pointed out.</P>

      <P>Allowances, which are considerably in excess of those paid to individuals on training courses, are paid by FÁS under the Teamwork and social employment schemes to sponsoring bodies, usually local authorities or local voluntary community groups, towards the employment costs of each participant in these schemes.

      <P>The new tax clearance procedures which were introduced with effect from 1 March 1988, however, apply to grants payable under the disease eradication schemes.  Applicants are required to indicate the tax district dealing with their tax affairs, to furnish their tax reference number and to indicate that to the best of their knowledge their tax affairs are in order.  Where grant applications are for amounts in excess of £10,000, applicants are required to produce a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  The procedures for implementing these arrangements have been drawn up so as to ensure that delays, if any, in payment of grants are minimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A claimant in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance would not necessarily be disqualified from entitlement to the allowance solely on account of the earnings from a temporary job which lasts 2 or 3 weeks.</P>
      <P>In such a case, if the claimant is definitely only taking up employment for a 2 or 3 week period, the allowance would not be terminated on the commencement of the job and the income would be taken into account as part of her averaged means over the year as a whole.  The claimant must, however, inform the Department that she is taking up the temporary employment and furnish all the relevant details of the employment.</P>
      <P>In arriving at the weekly means of a claimant to unmarried mother's allowance:</P>
      <P>&mdash;her annual income from all sources is aggregated/estimated;</P>
      <P>&mdash;£312 (£6 multiplied by 52 weeks) is disregarded per child;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" />&mdash;the net total for the year is then divided by 52 to give the assessable weekly means figure.</P>
    <P>The appropriate weekly rate of payment is then assessed in accordance with the graduated scale of weekly means and related payments, as set out at page 20 of the Department's current rates booklet. It will be seen from this that a claimant may have means of £6 per week without having any effect on the rate of allowance payable to her and that an unmarried mother with one child could qualify for some rate of payment unless her average assessable means exceeded £60 per week.</P>
    <P>In cases where claimants take up longer duration employments, or where a temporary job might become extended, payment of the allowance may be terminated and the claimant would have to reapply if she again became unemployed. Termination of the allowance would take place where it was clear that the nature and duration of the job would place the claimant outside the means limit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the frequency capacity which is available to Ireland on the UHF system; the proportion of this capacity which is currently utilised; and the frequency management problems which, according to him, the continued operation of television deflector systems would create.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UHF frequency band 470 MHz to 960 MHz, which is allocated under the International Radio Regulations to which Ireland is a party for broadcasting, was planned at a European Broadcasting Area Conference in Stockholm in 1961.  Under this plan Ireland has <Col N="1792" /> frequency assignments at main transmitting sites to provide for four television channels.  However, considerable replanning of the UHF band and international co-ordination of additional frequency assignments would be necessary before four networks capable of giving nationwide coverage would be available, and even then there is no assurance that such co-ordination would be successfully completed.</P>
      <P>UHF broadcasting spectrum is currently being used for the RTE 1 and RTE 2 channels at main stations at Three Rock Mountain, County Dublin, Clermont Cairn, County Louth, Cairn Hill, County Longford and Hollywell Hill, County Donegal and at low powered stations at 11 other locations.  RTE will have further requirements for UHF spectrum for the purpose of providing further fill-in transposers as part of their ongoing programme to improve reception of existing services in areas of poor reception.</P>
      <P>The remainder of RTE's transmission network for RTE 1 and RTE 2, comprising ten main stations and 46 transposer stations, operates in the VHF band.</P>
      <P>In the longer term RTE's transmission network will have to be renewed.  European trends indicate that all of the next generation of RTE transmitters will have to be accommodated in the UHF band.</P>
      <P>The continued reception of UK television services (which operate solely on the UHF band) in this country requires that the channels used by these services which are receivable here cannot be interfered with.</P>
      <P>The UHF band is the only spectrum available for the foreseeable future to meet any new conventional broadcast terrestrial television developments in this country.  Any new services that might be contemplated will have to be accommodated in the UHF band.  If the available spectrum in this band is given over to rebroadcasting the introduction of any new national services will be precluded.</P>

      <P>The estimated capital cost of an MMDS subscriber installation, comprising of aerial, down-converter and decoder is £250 to £300 which will be provided by the MMDS operator.  As <Col N="1794" /> there is at present no market for direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers I have no reliable estimate of the cost to subscribers. The British project is scheduled to be operational late next year and a recent report indicates that the operators hope to have three television channels available before Christmas 1989, at least one of which would be a subscription service.  France and Germany also have plans to establish DBS services within the next year or so but it is likely that high gain non-standard reception apparatus would be needed here to receive the transmission from these satellites.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Eastern Health Board that they are currently assessing which of their staff should be offered vaccination; this includes staff working in health centres.  Vaccination has already been offered to health board dentists. Pending the outcome of this assessment any staff member who is particularly concerned about the occupational risk of contracting hepatitis B should contact their local director of community care/medical officer of health or the Dublin Medical Officer of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present making arrangements for the introduction from September next of pilot projects relating to the devolved administration of primary and post-primary school transport in Counties Cavan, Clare, Laois and Sligo.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the respective vocational education committees will act as directors of the projects and will be responsible for the organisation and day-to-day operation of school transport including the determination of pupil entitlement and the allocation of routes.  All routes will be put to tender and of course, it will be open to Bus Éireann to tender in the normal way.  It is not envisaged that grants as an alternative to transport facilities will form part of the pilot project arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision has yet been taken in regard to the future role of the buses <Col N="1802" /> owned by the Department but it will be my concern to ensure that their disposition will not confer an unfair advantage on any of the competing interests. My Department do not propose the acquisition of further buses in connection with the pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>The total revenue accruing to Bus Éireann in 1987 from the transport schemes was £36.286 million.  Of this amount £2.27 million was made up of direct administration costs and £30.205 million of running costs.  Indirect administration and other costs amount to £3.811 million.  The total number employed as school bus drivers was 2,359 of whom 1,631 were private contractors and 728 part-time drivers employed by Bus Éireann.  The number of whole-time job equivalents employed by Bus Éireann on administration was 380.</P>
    <P>In regard to the part-time drivers employed by Bus Éireann, I understand from Bus Éireann that it is the company's intention to issue redundancy notices in the near future.  The question of the continued employment of these drivers on school transport will depend on the contracting arrangements which may be made.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to alter the conditions of eligibility of pupils for school transport.</P>
