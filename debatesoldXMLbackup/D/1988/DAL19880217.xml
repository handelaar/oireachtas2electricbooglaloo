      <P>I wish to oppose the Order of Business particularly as set out in paragraph (a) which states that the speech of the opening speaker for each of the groups as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) (a) shall not exceed 40 minutes.  That is designed to exclude The Workers' Party from this area and I wish to register my objection to that.  In fact, The Workers' Party are the only party in this House who are organised both in Northern Ireland and in this State.  I wish to oppose the Order of Business.  I hope The Workers' Party will be given equal treatment with the other parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of recent developments affecting Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations and reaffirms its determination to take any and all action necessary to ensure the full use of the procedures and structures set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to secure the achievement of the goals of that Agreement.</P>
      <P>We have had some technological difficulties. Copies of my statement should be available by now to party leaders and very shortly available to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the House has been most anxious to have a further debate on the issues arising from the statement in the House of Commons on 25 January, 1988 by the British Attorney General, Sir <Col N="5" /> Patrick Mayhew, on the Stalker-Sampson report, and the judgment of the British Appeal Court on 28 January, 1988 upholding the convictions of the Birmingham Six.  I thought, however, it would be desirable to defer a debate until after the adjourned meeting yesterday of the Special Intergovernmental Conference had concluded.  I am very grateful for the co-operation and patience shown by the House in deferring further debate until today.</P>
    <P>In my statement I will also deal with my meeting with the British Prime Minister in Brussels on 12 February.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined to the Dáil in my statement of 28 January the sequence of events and the principal happenings in the Stalker affair, but let me remind Deputies briefly of them again because of their importance as the background to the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Six men were shot dead and one seriously injured by members of the RUC in three separate shooting incidents in County Armagh in the period November-December 1982.  Five of those killed were unarmed and they were killed from close range.  Weapons which were old, without bolts and useless, were found at the scene of the shooting of two others in a hayshed near Lurgan.  It was established that the security forces had the hayshed under close surveillance for some time and it has been suggested that these weapons may have been planted there by the security forces as part of a stake-out. These deaths naturally caused the greatest concern in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have to contemplate a situation in which six people were killed by the police and one seriously injured, all within three months.  Of these seven victims, five were certainly unarmed and there is reason to believe that the other two were innocent victims of a stake-out.  False evidence was given at a trial and there was evidence of an official cover-up to hide an undercover operation on the territory of this State. Police inquiry followed police inquiry at the insistence of the DPP, but no report was ever published.  A senior British police officer appointed to clear up the <Col N="6" /> matter says publicly that he was obstructed at a very high level and at the height of his inquiry he was removed in circumstances which strain credibility. Now in a statement to the House of Commons the British Attorney General has announced that evidence does exist sufficient to warrant prosecutions against members of the police for perversion of the course of justice.  But he has also said that, following consultations with unnamed persons, it has been decided that no prosecutions will be taken for reasons of national interest and that the report will not be published.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be an under-statement to describe this sequence of events as `remarkable'.  And it would certainly be extraordinary if the Irish Government, who have such a direct and vital interest in peace, stability and the rule of law in this island, North and South, were to consider the present situation satisfactory.  We simply do not.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government decided on Tuesday, 26 January, that because of the serious implications of the British Attorney General's statement for public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and for cross-border security co-operation, they would seek an immediate special meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference for the purpose of clarifying the issues involved.  The Government's concerns were put to the British Government, through the British Co-Chairman of the Conference, Mr. King, on 2 February in Belfast and at the resumed meeting of the Conference, held yesterday also in Belfast.  The two Ministers who represented the Government at these meetings, Mr. Gerry Collins, Minister for Justice, and Mr. Ray Burke, Minister for Energy and Communications, also had the opportunity of an informal meeting with Mr. King and his Minister of State, Mr. Stanley, in London on Wednesday, 10 February.</P>
    <P>I also had a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in the margins of the European Council in Brussels on 12 February.  At that meeting, I conveyed the deep concern and the <Col N="7" /> emotion aroused in Ireland by the developments of the Stalker-Sampson report, the Birmingham Six case and related matters and the importance I attached to an adequate response to the views and proposals put forward by the Irish side at the Special Inter-governmental Conference on 2 February. The Prime Minister stated that the formal response of the British Government would be provided through the Conference by Mr. King.  She listened carefully and courteously throughout to the views I put forward, confirmed her view of the importance of the relationship between the two Governments and made it clear that she considers the Anglo-Irish Agreement the best hope for the future. I said that I considered the response by the British Government so far to be unsatisfactory.  The British Prime Minister accepted that this way my view.</P>
    <P>The issues that we put to the British side at the first meeting of the Conference were:</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the Stalker-Sampson report be published;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the decision not to prosecute RUC officers identified in the Stalker-Sampson report against whom there is evidence of wrong-doing should be explained and the decision reconsidered;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that there must be a response on the absence of consultation in the Conference prior to the announcement by the British Attorney General that there would be no prosecution in the public interest;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that a full report should be provided on the covert operation by members of the Northern security forces in our jurisdiction on the night of 12 December 1982;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the trust and confidence which must exist between two police forces engaged in security co-operation has been seriously damaged;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the Home Secretary consider the use of the wide-ranging powers available to him in regard to the Birmingham Six;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" />&mdash;that there be an awareness of the importance for extradition of the handling of both the Stalker-Sampson affair and the Birmingham Six case because of the effects both these issues have on confidence in the administration of justice and on public confidence and that the requirements of the 1987 legislation be met.</P>
    <P>The response to these proposals was, from our point of view, inadequate.  We have been told that the Stalker-Sampson report will not be published and that there will be no reconsideration of the decision on prosecutions.  Nor has there been anything in the nature of a positive response to our concerns about the Birmingham Six.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, some progress has been made on other matters.  I understand that Mr. King will be making a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon dealing with the possibility of disciplinary charges and with changes in the structure and control of the RUC. The Minister for Justice will intervene later in the debate on this aspect.</P>
    <P>With regret, I have to conclude that no progress has been made on matters of grave concern to us.  We have reached an impasse for the present on these issues.</P>
    <P>Overall Anglo-Irish relations as such are not at an impasse.  There can and must be progress on other important aspects of Northern affairs in discussions in the Anglo-Irish Conference, such as fair employment and other matters of very direct and practical concern to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think it necessary at this point to explain clearly and in some detail to the House just why it is that we say the response on some of the main issues which we raised is unsatisfactory.  The Government believe that confidence has been seriously eroded and they believe that they should have been entitled under the letter and the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to be informed and consulted in advance of the Attorney General's statement on 25 January on issues which <Col N="9" /> have such a critical bearing on mutual trust and confidence as between the two Governments, between the two police forces North and South and between the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and the authorities who administer justice and who operate security policy.  This was not done.</P>
    <P>It is argued by the British Government that the Stalker-Sampson report is a police report and, to quote an answer which Mr. King has given in the House of Commons on a number of occasions, &ldquo;police reports of this kind are not normally published&rdquo;.  It may be that police reports are not normally published, but these are not normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is said to us that in considering issues of the public interest and of national security the British Attorney General acts and must act alone, that he is not subject to political direction and that he would refuse political direction if it were given.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on this view of the British Attorney General's role.  That is an internal British matter.  Our concern is that there is an agreement.  It is not an agreement with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State.  It is an agreement with the British Government.  It cannot be acceptable to us that matters which are of vital political importance, and in which our interest is formally recognised under the agreement, should be unexplained or unexplainable because, we are told, they are within the remit of the Attorney General's quasi-judicial role and a matter exclusively for him.</P>
    <P>It is said, too, that the British Attorney General acts in this and similar cases in a manner described as &ldquo;quasi-judicial&rdquo;. That in itself indicates that there is a political as well as a legal content to his consideration of these matters.  In fact, in his statement he acknowledges that he went outside the legal and judicial area and took political considerations such as &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;national security&rdquo; into account.  The Attorney General has consulted others on these aspects.  In his statement to the House of Commons he stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> I have consulted.  It is the right of those whom I consulted to indicate to me matters that in their view bear upon the public interest.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly this brings his statement and the decision into the political arena and amenable to the political process.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement the Irish Government too have clear and explicit rights in this matter and these rights have not been met.  Under Article 2 (b) of the Agreement for example:</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government accepts that the Irish Government will pur forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland within the field of activity of the Conference....  In the interest of promoting peace and stability, determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences</P>
    <P>This is clearly a matter within the field of activity of the conference.  Indeed, it goes to the heart of a major issue addressed by the conference &mdash; the need to ensure that the security forces and the system of administration of justice in Northern Ireland are such that they can command the support of both communities.  Yet, despite these explicit provisions, despite our additional interest arising from the subsidiary matter of an undercover operation on our territory and despite expectations raised by past comments by British Ministers at the conference and in parliament there was no consultation &mdash; there was not even an advance text before the Attorney General made his statement in the House of Commons on 25 January.  We simply learned after the event that although there was evidence sufficient to warrant prosecutions for perversion of the course of justice, the Attorney General had held &ldquo;consultations&rdquo; and as a result the DPP in Northern Ireland, who acts under his aegis, had decided that no prosecutions would be brought.  This, it appeared, was to be the end of the matter as far as prosecutions were concerned; and the <Col N="11" /> report which had been so long in the preparation, would not be published.</P>
    <P>I have to say &mdash; and I have said &mdash; the matter cannot be allowed to rest at that. It is not enough to speak of the position of the Attorney General; or that he himself must be the sole judge of who should be &ldquo;consulted&rdquo; on a matter where his consultations clearly extended beyond purely legal issues into the political field.</P>
    <P>The Stalker-Samson affair and the Birmingham Six case also impinge in a very direct way on extradition.  Although neither case itself involved extradition, both cases nevertheless have clear implications for confidence in the administration of justice and in the prospect of fair treatment for Irish people who might be extradited to Britain or the North.  Extradition is an issue about which there has been widespread and increasing concern in this country.  The major concerns have been that extradition should not be unreasonable or arbitrary and that a person who is extradited should get a fair trial in the requesting country.  The events of the past few weeks have demonstrated how well-founded these concerns are.</P>
    <P>It was to meet these concerns that the Government introduced the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, so as to provide vital new safeguards for our people in our extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland.  The principal safeguard, now enshrined in our law, is the requirement that the Attorney General must form an opinion concerning the existence of a clear intention to prosecute on the part of the requesting authorities and the evidential basis for such an intention.  The Attorney General, after he has completed his consideration of each case, is required to give a direction to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána not to endorse an extradition warrant unless he is of the opinion that there is such an intention and that this intention is funded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>The exercise of this important new function, is under the Act, a matter for the Attorney General and it is for him to consider in each case the information <Col N="12" /> which he deems appropriate to enable him to discharge his statutory obligation. On 17 December last the Attorney General wrote to the British Attorney General confirming the requirements of Irish law under the new Act.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this the Attorney General was informed by the British Attorney General that the latter would not provide any material relating to the evidence forming the basis for the British prosecuting authority's intention to prosecute.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that warrants in a number of cases to which the 1987 Act applies have been received.  I am informed by the Attorney General that a confirmatory note from the British Attorney was received by him in respect of one case but the absence of any material relating to the evidence in any of these cases means that the provisions of the 1987 Act have not been complied with.  The present position is that no warrants to which the 1987 Act applies have, as yet, been endorsed.  The implications of this situation are, of course, quite serious.  If the British Government persist in refusing to operate the new procedures in accordance with the Irish law, and the Attorney General does not receive the necessary information, extradition will not be possible at all in cases covered by the new Act.</P>
    <P>I want to give this House a solemn assurance that the new Act passed by the Oireachtas in December last will be strictly adhered to and the safeguards provided for will be fully implemented. The exercise of his functions under the Act is entirely a matter for the Attorney General and I have every confidence that he will exercise those functions fairly and effectively.</P>
    <P>I also wish to remind the House of my announcement in December that it is the intention of the Government to monitor the trial of persons who are extradited from this country.  Extradition is a very important instrument in the fight against serious crime and international subversion.  Extradition is also an inherent part of the international rule of law as it is <Col N="13" /> applied between civilised and democratic States.</P>
    <P>It would not be a solution to anything to allow extradition to remain inoperative.  Indeed to do so would create a grave problem in itself.  The prudent, practical course is to have extradition but only to have it subject to reasonable and effective safeguards in the interests of Irish citizens.  As I have already pointed out, these safeguards are now in place following the enactment of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 and it is on the basis of these safeguards, or not at all, that extradition will proceed.  That represents a balanced rational approach to the needs of the situation.  It is the approach adopted by the Government and the Oireachtas, as is our right.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention briefly another matter &mdash; the controversy about the intentions of the British Government in regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act which cloud the atmosphere further.</P>
    <P>Since the Act was first introduced in 1974 it has been renewable annually and it has been replaced by a wholly new Act every five years.  The current Act is due to lapse in 1989 and it is expected that a new Bill will be introduced in the British Parliament to replace it.  The Government have been informed that the present intention of the British Home Secretary is to propose that the Act will continue to be titled formally <i>The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act</i> and should continue to be renewable annually, but that the provision for replacement of the entire Act every five years should be removed.</P>
    <P>The British Home Secretary's statement in the House of Commons last night was a first reaction by the British Government to the report of the person appointed to review the Act, Lord Colville.  The Government have already expressed views to the British Government and to the reviewer, Lord Colville, on the content of the Act and on its day-to-day operation in Northern Ireland and in regard to Irish people in Britain.  We have been assured by the British Government that we will have an opportunity for full discussion of their intentions before <Col N="14" /> new legislation is introduced.  It should be realised that whatever about the purposes of this legislation, its implementation has been discriminatory and insensitive and has caused widespread resentment among law-abiding Irish people who rightly or wrongly view it as racist in its operation.</P>
    <P>I come now to the issues of security and security co-operation.  I want to make our position absolutely clear.  Responsibility for the security of this State and the obligations in the security field which we have towards our neighbours in Northern Ireland rest fundamentally on the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  The Garda Síochána are the police force of this State and as such are responsible under our laws and Constitution to the people and Government of Ireland.  They are not in any sense an Anglo-Irish police force.</P>
    <P>The resources that we as a State have committed, and are committing, to the security area in general are in place because it is our judgment that they are necessary in the interests of all of the people who live in this island.  We have put, and we retain, these resources in position, despite their very heavy cost, because we believe that it is right and necessary to do so.  Our commitment in this area is freely given, in the common interest of society, North and South, to ensure that the forces of terrorism &mdash; whether domestic or of international origin &mdash; will not prevail.  I want to emphasise that our determination and resolve to do everything in our power to defeat the men of violence and to maintain democracy and the rule of law will in no way be lessened by the unfortunate events and difficulties of recent weeks.</P>
    <P>To be effective, however, co-operation in any sphere demands trust and confidence between those who co-operate. Trust and confidence of a very high degree are most certainly an essential requirement between two police forces who are engaged on co-operation as sensitive, as complex and indeed as dangerous as that engaged on by the Garda <Col N="15" /> Síochána and the RUC.  Any sensible and responsible person must acknowledge that a certain amount of damage has been done to our common security concerns by the developments we are discussing.</P>
    <P>The events leading to the Stalker-Sampson report and the controversial removal of Mr. Stalker from his inquiries at a particularly crucial stage have cast a shadow over the reputation of the RUC for some time past.  But relationships between the two forces did improve over recent years because of our expectation that the Stalker-Sampson report, when it eventually came, would clear the air.</P>
    <P>The clear expectation, encouraged by numerous exchanges on the matter between Ministers and senior officials, was that all issues arising from the alleged shoot-to-kill incidents would be publicly aired, that those culpable in any wrong-doing would be identified and brought to justice and that the clearest possible signals would go out that events of the nature complained of could never again happen or be countenanced.  To the extent that it has now become clear that this will not happen, all the doubts have surfaced again and may indeed have intensified.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the appalling casualties suffered by the RUC.  Over 250 members have been killed or murdered, often in cold-blooded and callous circumstances, and hundreds more maimed or seriously injured.  I understand the suffering and loss endured not just by the victims but by the widows and families, colleagues and friends.  I am aware too of the determined efforts of the RUC in recent times to apply more even-handed policies, for example, in the control of parades.  These things were securing for the force a level of acceptance.  For this reason the recent decisions about the Stalker-Sampson report, which do so much to undermine this acceptance, cannot be in the ultimate interest of the RUC itself.  Confidence has been eroded, or possibly it might be more accurate to say, confidence in those who have responsibility for these matters had been eroded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> This has very real implications for the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána here enjoy virtually total community support.  This is one of the most valuable assets that any police force can have.  It cannot be allowed to be endangered.  A loss of confidence is not something that can be restored by direction; it is not possible to compel one force to have confidence in another or to give that full measure of confidential co-operation which should exist.  These things come only from motivation based on trust in the standards and integrity of the other side.</P>
    <P>It has been publicly stated that disciplinary proceedings may be considered, involving certain members of the RUC, arising out of findings of the Stalker-Sampson report and that certain structural changes may take place.  We will observe any changes under these headings and see what impact they may have on the restoration of trust and confidence between the two police forces.</P>
    <P>In the security area, we have two priority objectives: (1) the protection of the security of this State, and (2) the protection, to the utmost of our ability, of the interests and security of all the people of Northern Ireland.  It is those objectives that dictate cross-Border co-operation.  It is obviously in the interest of both communities that this co-operation should be as effective as possible.  Only the men of violence stand to gain from anything less.  As a civilised State we have an obligation to defeat the forces of terrorism and subversion and we will discharge that responsibility.</P>
    <P>These then are our concerns.  I have tried to give the House as clear an account as possible of just how serious they are and on what they are based; how far they have been met; and more significantly how far they have not been met; and what I believe our policy must be in face of this situation.</P>
    <P>These concerns are, I believe, widely shared in Northern Ireland and in Britain; and they are well understood and shared abroad by news media and others who take a serious interest in Northern Ireland and in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> I believe that the debate in the European Parliament last week was also a remarkable manifestation of European opinion as well as considerable moral support to the position of the Irish Government on these issues.</P>
    <P>Let me say before concluding how important it has been that the Government in presenting our case to the British Government were able to count on the full backing of this House.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dukes, made it clear in the debate we had on 28 January that he found the decision of the British authorities not to bring prosecutions for perversion of the course of justice &ldquo;astounding&rdquo;.  He felt too that disciplinary proceedings would &ldquo;not respond to the concerns that have been expressed in this House and elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Likewise, Deputy O'Malley in the same debate said that the announcement of the British Attorney General &ldquo;leaves in place within the RUC force in the North a cadre of police officers who are known to have perverted the course of justice and to have organised perjury and misinformation on a massive scale.&rdquo;  He too thought that mere disciplinary action would be completely inadequate.  Deputy Spring has also been strong and firm in asserting that what has happened is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The support in this House has done no more than reflect the strong feelings of Irish Public opinion on these issues.  We want to see the present difficulties resolved to our satisfaction in the interests of political progress in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The fact that this debate is beginning here this morning in advance of a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the one hand gives us in the House an opportunity to make our views known before that statement is made, although I am bound to say that on the record of the past few weeks it does not seem to me that it would be realistic to expect that what we say here will be listened to with any great attention in the House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> On the other hand, it puts us at some disadvantage since we in the House and the general public will not be aware until later this afternoon of what the British Government's response is to a number of the issues that have been raised by the Taoiseach and by two of his Ministers in recent days.  Timing is not perhaps as we would wish it to be.  Nevertheless it is important that we in this House should put on record our view of how and why we have arrived at this point and draw some conclusions from that as to our conduct in the future.  I do not intend to rehearse the events that have started off this whole process.  They have already been well detailed in this House and need no further elaboration.</P>
    <P>What I want to look at is the sequence of events since 25 January this year and what shaped those events.  There is a certain air of unreality about all the things that have happened since then.  It started with the extraordinary announcement on that date by the UK Attorney General &mdash; as the Taoiseach has reminded the House I found that announcement astounding &mdash; that no criminal proceedings would be instituted on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report.  But, following that statement, the publication of John Stalker's book and the revelations that he made in the course of numerous interviews and articles brought into the public arena and gave shape to a number of suspicions, doubts and questions which have surrounded the events of November and December 1982, the Stalker-Sampson inquiry itself and the circumstances of Mr. Stalker's removal from that inquiry.</P>
    <P>On the 15th of this month the public here learned for the first time, from reports which the newspapers said came from Government sources, that, as a result of objections on the part of the United Kingdom Attorney General, the British authorities have been sending extradition applications to our jurisdiction without any supporting evidence. We were told by the same reports that, notwithstanding discussions during the course of two meetings at senior official level and one meeting at ministerial level, the matter has not been resolved.  That <Col N="19" /> seems to give a fairly clear picture. However, the puzzling feature of this part of the picture is that it is apparently seen very differently by the British authorities. Again I am relying in what the newspapers call Government sources.  But I have been given to understand by such sources that the United Kingdom Attorney General and his officials for some time have been seeking a meeting with their Irish counterparts in order to work out the practical details of what has to be done in order to conform to our requirements following the passing of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that one or other of the Governments is not being entirely frank about this.  But it is possible that both statements are true and that this is yet another example of mutual incomprehension and of muddle caused by a lack of commitment and proper application to the Anglo-Irish process.  Our Government's complaint appears to be that the United Kingdon Attorney General is sending over warrants without any supporting evidence. Section 2 (a) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 surely places the onus on our Attorney General to specify what information he needs in any case in order to consider that information and allow him discharge his duties under the terms of the Act.  It seems to me that it is at least possible that there is an area there of simple, straightforward, mutual incomprehension that could properly be resolved or that should properly be dealt with by a correct commitment and use of the procedures set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>On Monday night last we heard of the latest twist in this whole affair with the news that the United Kingdom authorities intend to make permanent the provisions of the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act, making that Act a permanent part of United Kingdom law, as it was up to 1984.</P>
    <P>I have not included the decision of the Court of Appeal on the Birmingham Six case in this list of events because I do not <Col N="20" /> believe it properly belongs there.  Whatever our feelings about this case &mdash; and there are very strong feelings about that case in this House &mdash; it is not part of the group of problems and issues addressed by the Anglo-Irish agreement.  In my view it was quite wrong of the Government to raise this as one of the issues and present it as one of the five demands mde by the Ministers for Justice and Communications during the course of the Anglo-Irish Conference meeting last week.  This is a matter for direct contact between Dublin and London outside the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, not one to be passed through the secretariat or through the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who has no function in relation to that matter.  While mentioning that matter briefly I should like to say that I join with a good many other people, both here and in the United Kingdom, who feel that if people who have been investigating this case have information, who claim to have information to name people other than the six who are now in prison &mdash; who were involved in that crime they have an obligation to make that information available&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that, if it is the case that other people carried out that crime, they can be brought to justice and innocent people can be set free and vindicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these events, the sequence I have mentioned since 15 January last, have had a dramatic impact, bursting unexpectedly, as they did, on public opinion here.  The Government clearly knew about the problem in relation to extradition before that difficulty became public.  But it appears that the Government were just as surprised as public opinion in general by the statement last month by the United Kingdom Attorney General about the Stalker-Sampson report.  It appears also that the Government, again, were just as surprised as the general public by Monday night's news about the Prevention of Terrorism Act. <Col N="21" /> I must say that the Government must be faulted on both counts.  If the Government had been giving the proper and necessary attention to each of these areas it is hardly conceivable that they would have been so taken by surprise.  Had the Government, through the meeting and procedures of the Anglo-Irish Conference, been giving sufficiently strong and regular emphasis to their proper concerns with the Stalker-Sampson report it is inconceivable that they would not have foreseen, have had knowledge of or have been forewarned, in however confidential a way, of a substantial change in direction by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear again &mdash; lest there by any shadow of doubt about it &mdash; that the United Kingdom Attorney General's statement of 25 January last constituted a major change of direction on this issue.  As I have said before in this House and elsewhere, we had reason to believe, late in 1986, that a number of senior RUC officers would be prosecuted on foot of the investigations carried out by Mr. Stalker and Mr. Sampson.  I believe our Government did not devote enough time, resources or attention to the Anglo-Irish process during the course of 1987.  As a result I believe they failed to get information which a proper use of the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference would have provided.</P>
    <P>I believe much the same kind of thing can be said about the developments in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  The Act, in its present form, dates from 1984 and lapses in 1989.  As I understand it, the powers vested in the British Government under that Act fall to be renewed annually.  The British Government have been presented with a report which strongly recommends that the Act be made permanent.  They must, of course make up their own minds as to the appropriate course of action to be followed but they still have an obligation, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to consult the Irish Government, through the conference, on matters affecting the areas covered by the <Col N="22" /> agreement.  The operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in relation to people from this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland is very clearly a matter which comes within the framework of that agreement.</P>
    <P>The proposal now appears to be that the Act will be made permanent with effect from 1989 and that the powers vested in the British Government by the Act would continue to be subject to annual review.  To say that that means that the provisions of the Act are not being made permanent &mdash; as has indeed been said by the British Home Secretary and others &mdash; seems to me to draw a very fine distinction indeed.  Of course, the British Government's proposal immediately raises the question as to whether it is a matter of any significance that the decision be taken now or later in relation to the permanence of an Act which lapses in 1989.  Given the claimate which has surrounded Anglo-Irish relations since 25 January last it seems to me to be tactless, to say the least, to raise the issue in this way at this time.  A decision at any time to make that Act permanent, that is to revert to the pre-1984 position, would be a matter of some difficulty in discussion between any Irish Government and British Government of the day but to compound that difficulty by bringing it forward, when it does not seem strictly necessary, seems to be unnecessarily provocative.</P>
    <P>It may be that this is another example of muddle on the part of the British Government.  It is conceivable that the British Government arrived at the final stage of their consideration of this measure before the Attorney General made his statement on 25 January and that it has taken until the beginning of this week for the process of printing the Bill and the other paraphernalia which goes with it, to produce a Bill.  But even if that were the case, it was open to the British Government to make a decision to scrap the Bill as it was, to defer the consideration of a proposal to make the Act permanent until a later stage and simply to renew or review the powers, as they are required to do anyway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Here again our Government had warning that the matter was coming up.  As I said, the powers vested in the British Government under the Act have to be reviewed annually.  There is in existence a report which recommends that the Act be made permanent.  Had the Government been using the channels of the Anglo-Irish Agreement properly, had they been expressing their concern about the operation of this Act on a sufficiently regular and firm basis, they would surely have been in a position to divine the intentions of the United Kingdom authorities, and indeed, they might well have been consulted in advance.</P>
    <P>Last summer I stated it was my impression that the Government were not giving enough attention to the work of the Anglo-Irish Conference and that they were not devoting enough resources to the work of the Secretariat.  Nothing I have heard since then gives me any reason to change this view.  On that basis I can only conclude that the Government have missed opportunities to take action which might possibly have avoided, and would probably have lessened, the difficulties we are now facing.  These difficulties must, therefore, be attributed not only to insensitivity on the part of the British Government but also, in part, to inactivity on the part of our own.</P>
    <P>The statements and actions of the British Government must be considered against the background of the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and measured against the commitments and undertakings freely entered into by two Governments when they signed that agreement.  The United Kingdom Attorney General's statement of 25 January last clearly implied a step back by the United Kingdom Government from the obligations contained in article 7 of the agreement.  In so far as it gave priority to a particular view of the public interest and the importance of national security over the application of the rule of law in all circumstances to a police force, it moved away from the conviction expressed by the two Governments in <Col N="24" /> article 8 of the agreement on the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The British Government's move in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act certainly moves away from the obligation of consultation which is implicit in the structure of the agreement itself.  It also represents a step back from the obligations on the two Governments to consider together questions of security policy as provided for in article 7, and I would argue that it does not accord with the concern set out in article 8 with the improvement of public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Attorney General's position in relation to extradition, while less clear, must be viewed in the light of the specific provision in article 8 of the agreement that the Conference shall be concerned with policy aspects of extradition.  The actions of our own Government must also be examined in the light of the provisions contained in the agreement.  Article 2 (b) of the agreement specifies:</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government accept that the Irish Government will put forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland within the field of activity of the Conference in so far as these matters are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.  In the interest of promoting peace and stability, determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for believing that the present Government have not measured up to that task and, in that way, have been negligent in their approach to the operation of the agreement.  These deficiencies on the part of each of the two Governments must be remedied.</P>
    <P>I want to turn attention to the future and where we go from here.  The obligation on our Government and the prescription for their behaviour can be very quickly and easily stated.  They must take the agreement seriously and they must <Col N="25" /> approach the opportunities and obligations of the agreement vigorously and with determination.  They must use the facility given by article 2 of the agreement to the full.  They must use the structures and procedures set out in article 3 to the full and they must live up to their obligations under all the other articles of the Treaty without equivocation.  It is for these reasons I consider it essential to underline the emphasis in the motion before us on ensuring the full use of the procedures and structures set up by the agreement.</P>
    <P>It is clear that no further progress towards the peace and security which are the goals of the Anglo-Irish Agreement can be achieved without a proper and wholehearted response by the British Government.  A review and assessment of the events and statements of the last three weeks beside the duties and obligations of the agreement indicate the path that must be followed.</P>
    <P>First, the British Government must publicly recognise that their actions, whether intentionally or otherwise, have been direct causes of tension.  Second, they must agree to give our Government full access to the Stalker-Sampson report and full briefing on all aspects and angles of that report.  Third, they must give our Government a full account of the cross-Border incursions which have remained unexplained since the end of 1982. Fourth, they must immediately undertake disciplinary proceedings within the RUC so that those who have deliberately attempted to pervert the course of justice and to obstruct a valid and properly authorised investigation no longer play a part in the operation of the force.</P>
    <P>Fifth, they must quickly announce the changes in the structures and management of the RUC which the Stalker-Sampson report reveals as necessary.  In this regard there is an irony in the conclusion to which I think most of us have come on the basis of information we have so far, that one of the changes in the structure of the RUC must be to abolish the division in command between certain special units in the force and the main body of the police force itself.  For quite a <Col N="26" /> considerable period in discussing matters under articles 8 and 9 of the agreement, the British authorities and the RUC were anxious to press upon us the proposal that we should adopt in our Garda force the same kind of structure that is in operation in the RUC, a structure which it now appears had a big part to play in the incidents which took place at the end of 1982 and which caused so much trouble. We resisted that on the simple grounds that experience here indicated that to have units of a police force operating semi-independently, or almost totally independently, of the command structure of that force in a given division was a recipe for trouble, and that turned out to be the case in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the British Government must review their position in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act and enter into real and meaningful discussions with our Government both on the problems which, in the British Government's view, continue to necessitate the Act itself, and on the problems to which the Act gives rise in connection with public confidence in the administration of justice, particularly here and in Northern Ireland.  Seventh, I think it essential that the two Attorneys General meet very quickly to agree on the means by which effect can be given to the new provisions in relation to extradition.  It is time to stop what seems to be a slow hesitation waltz between the two Attorneys General.  Far be it from me to criticise holders of that office, either here or anywhere else, but it seems that there may be excessive concern with the formalities of positions on the two sides of the Irish Sea which are probably getting in the way of a proper meeting of minds to give effect to procedures which both Governments have agreed to put into operation.  Finally, the British authorities must take steps and indicate what those steps are to ensure that there are no further unauthorised incursions by British or Northern Ireland security forces whether on the surface or in the air.</P>
    <P>We in this House must make it very clear that there can be no question of any withdrawal from full co-operation on <Col N="27" /> cross-Border security matters.  Any such move would be utterly futile, endanger people in all parts of this island, give a clear signal to terrorists that they can step up their campaign of violence and, in a very short time, would put the UK authorities and ourselves in an absurd situation from which nobody else could rescue us.  I regret that the Taoiseach has prevaricated on this issue since 15 January.  In a statement to this House shortly after the UK Attorney General's statement, he indicated that cross-Border security might be affected.  In a later speech in Cork he indicated that it would be affected.  I have no doubts whatever on this issue.  Cross-Border security co-operation is vital for everybody in Northern Ireland and in our jurisdiction.  Whatever we might feel about UK Government policy and however much we may disapprove of it &mdash; and whatever steps we take to get the British Government to change their policy &mdash; cross-Border security co-operation is not a bargaining counter, a tradeable commodity or a means of retaliation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note, on the basis of his statement to the House this morning, that the Taoiseach seems to have come around and to have rejoined those of us who will not accept that we should further damage ourselves by reducing the ability of the Garda Síochána as well as the RUC to deal with the problem of terrorism.  It should be clear to all of us that there is a very serious and continuing threat from outside our shores.  The Provisional IRA seem to have access to large quantities of modern arms.  We all congratulate the Garda on their recent success in unearthing a large find of such arms.  It is equally the case that the so-called Loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland have access to similar types of arms and we must congratulate the RUC on their success in intercepting quantities of arms apparently destined for these terrorist groups.</P>
    <P>A large external supplier &mdash; if not more than one &mdash; is prepared to supply these arms to terrorists in this country.  Indeed, given the similarity between the arms contained in the recent hauls made by <Col N="28" /> the Garda Síochána and those found by the RUC, there seems to be room for speculation as to whether the one supplier or dealer is not trading with opposing groups of terrorists on this island. That would not surprise me since illegal arms traders have no scruples.</P>
    <P>We have had another hysterical reminder in recent days that the Libyan leader is still of a mind to cause trouble on this island, partly for reasons that have no connection whatever with us and partly on the basis of his frequently stated support for the Provisional IRA.  In the light of recent events, that can only mean he is prepared to supply arms or to facilitate their supply to terrorist groups here. In the light of all those considerations, no sane person with any concern for human life on this island could possibly contemplate any interference with the process of cross-Border security co-operation.</P>
    <P>As I said at the opening of my remarks, we may be in a position later this afternoon to have more information about the response of the British authorities to the matters that exercise us here today.  I hope at that stage that we in this House will be in a position to show unanimity on the path we need to follow from here. The motion stresses the full use of the procedures and structures set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and again stresses the importance which we attach to the achievement of the goals of that agreement.  On the basis that that formulation of our wishes had the agreement of all parties, I decided we would support that motion.  Some people appear to have had second thoughts in the meantime but that is not particularly important. However, the amendment put down in the name of The Workers' Party is the most unwise formulation that could possibly have been devised and one which will give aid and comfort to people who want to see the disappearance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, therefore, to take out of our system the most valuable tool we have been able to construct for many years to deal with the problems that face us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> My concern is that, whatever our view about how we have arrived at the present point and however we allocate responsibility between the British Government and the Irish Government for errors that have led to that situation, this House should be unanimous in deciding what path we follow from here.  We must make it absolutely clear that we are determined to use the instruments which the Anglo-Irish Agreement has given us to achieve peace and stability on this island, to do it in a way which respects the identities, traditions and the cultures of all the groups of people who live on this island and to give them their proper place in an island, which for too long, has been at the mercy of violent men and women who seem to care more for the traditions of the past, for the values of a society which never existed here and who are prepared to sacrifice their own brothers and sisters in the pursuit of that illusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House seems to be extraordinarily vague and I presume it is only intended as a vehicle to allow a discussion to take place.  It would be more appropriate to try to set out in a brief way the feelings of the House &mdash; and perhaps the country generally &mdash; in regard to the matters we are discussing at present.  I sought to do that in the form of an amendment but I understand it is not possible to move it. If it causes any difficulties to anybody or if there is any understanding to the contrary that our views would not be set out in a form like this, I am certainly quite prepared not to press it or to move it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, I want to read the amendment as a way of summing up adequately the present situation and some of the things that should be done.  After noting the developments in Northern Ireland and in Anglo-Irish affairs the amendment reads &ldquo;that Dáil Éireann deplores the decision of the British Attorney General in relation to the Stalker-Sampson report, and its adverse consequences for constitutional nationalism on this island; reasserts its strong commitment to the maintenance of the rule of law through <Col N="30" /> every means at its disposal, including maximum cross-Border security co-operation; and reaffirming its support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement, calls for the establishment of an inter-parliamentary tier as provided for, and urges an early summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister with a view to normalising Anglo-Irish relations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment expresses fairly clearly the views which many people hold in relation to things that have happened in recent weeks and it also sets out a number of the things they would like to see happening in the next few weeks to try to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's speech as delivered this morning and as is often the case there is nothing in it with which I would take issue.  What I do take issue with is what is not in it.  There is absolutely nothing said about what will happen or what should happen from now on.  It is a recital in some detail of what has happened in recent times.  It reflects with some disappointment, some anger and some sorrow on some of the things which have happened in recent times but it does not put forward any policy for this country in relation to it: it simply suggests that we will have more or less to wait and see.  Our own attitudes and policies should be far more positively and strongly expressed than has been the case on the part of the Taoiseach here this morning. I know he may not be as free to say all the things he might like to say, as are some other people in the House.  Nonetheless, he has an obligation to point more precisely and more positively in particular directions than what we have heard from him this morning.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to realise that three months have elapsed since the virtual unanimous consensus of views in both Ireland and Britain which arose after the Enniskillen outrage, a consensus that terrorism had to be defeated and that the people of both countries and both parts of Ireland had far more uniting them than they had dividing them.  There was plenty of earnest on the Irish side following that democratic Anglo-Irish consensus <Col N="31" /> against terrorism, that we were willing to play our part in pursuit of that ideal. Despite a bout of predictable verbal Republicanism from some of their backbenchers, the Fianna Fáil Party came around to endorsing the Extradition Act, the first Act of 1987, and bringing it into force on 1 December last.</P>
    <P>There was an unprecedented nationwide arms search shortly afterwards, for which I commend the Government and which had the unqualified approval of the great majority of Irish people.  Of course, the uncovering of bunkers and the discovery of arms then and since only underlines the fundamental necessity for this State to combat terrorism and the evils of the IRA in particular, not only because of the damage it is causing in the North but also because of the threat of destabilisation which it poses for us in the Republic.  That is why in part the Progressive Democrats have been rather dissatisfied with hints, suggestions, nods and winks emanating from the Taoiseach, and occasionally from unnamed Government sources, that there could be a pull back on cross-Border security co-operation.  That would be a most retrograde step and one which we would not at all countenance.  The amendment we have put down underlines precisely our concern in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the short speech delivered this morning by the Taoiseach three pages are devoted to security co-operation and to the difficulties the Garda are seen to face because of what has happened within the RUC.  The theory is put forward that the Garda would find it difficult to achieve the proper degree of co-operation with a force they felt they could not trust because there were within it people who had been identified by Stalker as conspiring to pervert the course of justice. That, with all due respects, is being a little bit precious.  The Garda Síochána are not shrinking violets, they have been out in the world for a long time. There are plenty of rough diamonds within the Garda Síochána, as there are within all police forces.  They all know that they all contain various kinds of <Col N="32" /> rough diamonds.  They all know, as we all do for six years, that all is not well within the RUC.  They have been able to co-operate very successfully with them to the benefit of all of us on this island for a long time and I think that that can continue to be the case if they cease getting signals which put them in doubt as to whether they should have that co-operation.  If any member of the Garda Síochána was in any doubt about some of the things that happen north of the Border &mdash; they have known since the time of the Dowra, for example, that unusual or strange things are liable to happen &mdash; I do not think they get too upset about it.  I would have preferred if today the Taoiseach had been more specific in what he has had to say on this matter rather than leave it in the realms of doubt even though he devoted three pages of his speech to it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately coincidence of events in recent times have heightened the perception of a concerted anti-Irish convulsion on the part of the British Government.  This is most unfortunate.  I do not believe it to be the case.  What is vital, therefore, is that we focus on the real targets where British insensitivity and intransigence are concerned and on areas which enable us to appeal for changed attitudes and a far more constructive response from the British side. In the process we can make a legitimate appeal to British public opinion, which should be just as concerned for the implications of civil rights in their own country that flow from the wrong decisions of their own Government.</P>
    <P>The Stalker-Sampson affair is pre-eminently the issue on which we must retain our focus, not only for the implications for the rule of law in the North and confidence on the part of the Nationalist minority in the RUC, but also for the integrity of that police force.  Allied to that was the attempted frame-up and fitting out of a senior British police officer, namely John Stalker, who was got at probably by MI5 and other elements of the British establishment because of his pursuit of the truth in Northern Ireland. The attempted framing of that man, a <Col N="33" /> senior British police officer, by a conspiracy that involved apparently his own Chief Constable, the head of the largest police force in Britain outside of London, and the Chief Constable of another major police force, the West Yorkshire Constabulary, has chilling implications for civil liberties in Britain which are a matter of concern not only for Irish people but which should and do concern mainstream British life.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to remind ourselves of the manner in which Mr. Stalker was removed and of the fact that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland apparently was not involved in that procedure.  He felt that the Irish Government had a very clear interest in the work which Mr. Stalker was doing and that they were entitled to have that.  I will quote briefly from page 165 of the recently published book by Mr. Stalker as follows:</P>
    <P>In the House of Commons on 18 July 1986 the Prime Minister declined again to answer questions or comment while the investigation continued.  Two days later the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, revealed in a letter to his Opposition counterpart, Peter Archer, that it had been Sir John Hermon who had statutorily approved my removal from the enquiry into his Force, after consultation with the Attorney General and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Laurence Byford.  This was the first official acknowledgement of the role played by Sir John in events surrounding my removal.</P>
    <P>Tom King also made it clear that the appointment of Colin Sampson to replace me as investigator was also made by the Chief Constable of the RUC.  Mr. King carefully emphasised that he personally had played no part in the decision to appoint Mr. Sampson to the Northern Ireland investigation. He said again, very forcibly, that &ldquo;The Irish Government naturally is taking an interest in this enquiry, which has a clear bearing on relations between the RUC and the minority community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> They share my concern to see that all issues are resolved as quickly as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems that there are very valid grounds for deep concern in Britain as well as here and in Northern Ireland at what has been done.  That is why, unlike the Taoiseach and some other speakers, I lay the primary emphasis on the Stalker-Sampson matter because I think that is what goes to the root of it.  The British Government legitimately claim that the decision in the Birmingham Six case, for example is an entirely judicial and legal matter and that they have no control over it.  I think that is true.  Its importance here is its contribution to the atmosphere and the sense of persecution almost which many Irish people feel in Britain.</P>
    <P>What is far more important from our point of view and from the point of view of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is the question of the Stalker-Sampson report, the removal of Stalker, the circumstances in which he was removed and the decision not to prosecute afterwards.  It is clear from the instances which I have given already, particularly section 3 of the order setting up the prosecution service in Northern Ireland in 1972, that all decisions in these matters are ultimately made by the Attorney General in Britain except, of course, in those matters which he delegates &mdash; which he is not interested in &mdash; to the DPP in Northern Ireland.  Let me quote from page 250 of <i>The Attorney General, Politics and the Public Interest</i> by J.L. Edwards where he deals with the relationship between the Attorney General and the DPP in Northern Ireland:</P>
    <P>This, he explained&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, Sir Peter Rawlinson who was the Attorney General at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to be found in Article 3 of the Order which ordains that during the currency of the Temporary Provisions Act, the Director in Northern Ireland shall discharge his functions under my superintendence and shall be subject to my directions in all matters.  This arises from my new role as Attorney <Col N="35" /> General for Northern Ireland and my answerability to this House in Westminster.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made after this announcement by the Attorney General in January to suggest that the decision had been made by the DPP in Northern Ireland and that it had been approved of in some fashion by the Attorney General who had no other function in it.  It is now clear that it was the other way around, that essentially the DPP had no function. If the decision was made at political level and after consultation &mdash; obviously it was consultation with other political people &mdash; it would give rise for legitimate concern as to how far up the line that matter went.  It would make it understandable that if there were to be prosecutions some of the defendants might claim they were acting under orders or authorisation from people who were superior to them.  It is and will remain the key factor in all of this.  It is as important within Britain as it is within Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is vital that there should be some way round the effective cover up which seems to be implicit in this so-called national interest decision of the British Attorney General to seek to suppress the report and any prosecutions.  I endorse the call which was made in the last day or two by the British Liberal Party's Northern Ireland spokesman, David Alton MP, for a select committee of the House of Commons to examine the Stalker-Sampson affair in the way such a committee examined the Westland controversy in Britain which seemed to get a lot of the way towards establishing the truth and as a result of which several very prominent heads rolled.  We must also impress on the British side the enormous damage which is being done to constitutionalism, nationalism, to the cause of peace on this island and to the furtherance of the political process by their Government's obduracy, intransigence and insensitivity.  As I see it the tragedy, and I have said it several times, is that only those who resort to violence can benefit from what is now happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> The attitude taken by the British authorities in recent times also has implications for the level of support enjoyed by the IRA in the United States.  Over recent years successive Irish Governments and the Department of Foreign Affairs have worked hard to inform Irish American opinion as to the true nature of the problems on this island and as to the need to build peace and understanding between people living on this island of both the Nationalist and Unionist persuasions.  It is not, as they have so often pointed out, a case of the simplistic &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; sloganeering which unfortunately was very dominant in Irish American circles in the United States ten or 15 years ago and which unfortunately is now likely to enjoy a resurgence in that country.  The importance of what Irish American opinion is in the United States is considerable because of the funds and other forms of aid which came from there in the past to this country and which largely had been blocked off in recent times.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see in recent weeks the consistent level of understanding emanating from so many British MPs, including various Conservative backbenchers, and most of the better quality British media which appear to realise that the Irish side cannot in this instance be blamed for the breakdown which unfortunately has taken place.  That is why I believe the time is now so appropriate to establish the interparliamentary tier of Members of the Dáil and Westminster as is provided for in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in respect of which preliminary meetings were held last year but which unfortunately do not seem to have come to anything.</P>
    <P>We need to re-establish the post-Enniskillen consensus on this island which extended to a great deal of positive understanding in Britain also.  This is now being strained and is in danger of being poisoned.  The Irish side have broadly maintained and worked for their bona fides in relation to amicable and constructive Anglo-Irish relations with a shared aim of defeating terrorism and affording the people of both Northern <Col N="37" /> communities the chance to enjoy a normal life.  It is time the British began to look very seriously at what has happened on their part over the past month and to realise that they have a very major part to play &mdash; 50 per cent &mdash; in achieving those objectives which I would have hoped and thought we all shared.</P>
    <P>One of the remarkable features of what has been going on over the last three or four weeks, with all the difficulties that have arisen and so on, has been the attitude of the Unionists in Northern Ireland.  Some of the recent speeches by Mr. Molyneaux are particularly useful, helpful and significant.  What makes them especially important is the fact that those views are being articulated at a time when Anglo-Irish relations at Government level have got tied up in very serious knots.  That might be a time when Unionists would have seen an opportunity to take advantage of an apparent falling out between the partners to the Anglo-Irish Agreement but they have not done that. The Taoiseach's response has been a very low key one and was to the effect that if representatives of any responsible body of opinion in Northern Ireland want to meet him he is available for such a meeting.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is his duty, and indeed his opportunity, to turn that around, act positively in regard to this matter and invite the Unionist leadership to talks.</P>
    <P>We are in a period of flux.  We need to have some fairly unusual and, perhaps, dramatic things to happen to change it. We have not had an indication of that up to now and we need it.  Obviously, while it is very desirable that communications be opened, at least in a semi-formal way, with the representatives of Unionist opinion and that we might hope to see them as frequently as we often see some of the representatives of Nationalist opinion in the North, the vital thing to be done in the short term is to have a full scale summit at Taoiseach and Prime Minister level to try to overcome the misunderstandings or whatever else that have arisen and have caused such anguish to so many people over the past month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> It has not been satisfactory that since the Taoiseach was elected to office just under 12 months ago he has not had a meeting with the British Prime Minister other than three brief meetings, lasting between 20 and 30 minutes each, in what were described as the margins of three of the European Council meetings, on the last occasion when Anglo-Irish problems had become quite serious in some matters, and when the European Council was bogged down in very severe difficulties and the British Prime Minister was obviously under enormous pressure in relation to that, there could be no hope that in a brief meeting in that context anything would be resolved.  This is something that needs to be sorted out now at that level.  The Anglo-Irish Conference in the last couple of weeks does not seem to be capable of doing that and I do not think it was designed for such fundamental problems as have now arisen. They are problems that could best be tackled by meetings at the level I have suggested.  That is why we have put forward that together with other proposals we think would reflect the view of many Members of the House and many people in the country.  They are expressed in a positive way with a view and a hope to having progress made and ensuring that the disappointments, and even the anguish that constitutionalists have felt on this island over the last month can be rectified.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Spring in that statement.  It was remiss of me not to have done that earlier.  I am delighted to see the Minister back and looking so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that there seems to be some confusion or lack of understanding in relation to the amendments, particularly <Col N="39" /> the amendment in my name and put forward on behalf of my party.  I should like to clarify the position in regard to our amendment.  We received the Government's motion last night and on looking at it I considered it inadequate.  On that basis I considered that an appropriate amendment should be put on the Order Paper without further discussion.  That was done.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
      <P>1.  &ldquo;deplores the present state of Anglo-Irish relations.  Dáil Éireann considers that the failure of the British Government to institute prosecutions on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report brings the British legal system into disrepute and is completely unacceptable. Dáil Éireann also rejects any intention to make the Prevention of Terrorism Act a permanent feature of British law. Dáil Éireann calls on the British Government to exercise its powers of clemency in relation to the Birmingham Six.</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann reaffirms its rejection of armed terrorism, and its commitment to the highest level of cross-Border security.  In this connection, Dáil Éireann calls on both the Irish and British Governments to ensure that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 is operated effectively, and that any difficulties of understanding or interpretation are resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reassess its approach to negotiations with the British authorities on these issues.  All future negotiations should take place against the background of an intensive diplomatic compaign aimed at ensuring that our position is understood by those countries which are both supportive of Ireland's interests and influential with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Dáil Éireann further resolves that in the current situation it is of critical importance that the Inter-governmental Conference should resume its effective role as provided for in Article 2 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and that consideration must be given to removing future negotiation on the issues mentioned in this resolution, and those alone, from the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, in order to protect the Conference from becoming embroiled in the existing impasse.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann reaffirms its commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement as the best available vehicle for the resolution of differences between the two Governments in relation to the government and administration of Northern Ireland, and the reconcilliation of the rights and identities of the two communities in Northern Ireland.  Further real progress in improving the relations between the two communities cannot be advanced without purposeful and committed dialogue being commenced between diverse political leaders of democratic parties in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  Dáil Éireann resolves that an unequivocal and open offer of such dialogue should be extended to all political leaders who have rejected violence as a solution in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In submitting that amendment on behalf of the Labour Party I considered that the Government's motion was inadequate. On brief consideration of the Taoiseach's contribution I must say that many of the fears I held last night have not been allayed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recited in detail the problems with which we are all familiar and recited the conduct of diplomacy in international relations for the last fortnight but should we be satisfied with the conclusions he has reached?  For example, the Taoiseach stated that the matter cannot be allowed to rest at that. We can all agree that the matter cannot <Col N="41" /> be allowed to rest at that but the questions that must be answered today are: what is going to be done?  What are we going to seek from the British Government and what initiative are we going to take given that we have made no progress?  If there has been progress or there is perceived to have been some, we have not been informed of it this morning.  The Taoiseach might clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>Responsibility rests firmly in this House with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence as well as the Government as a whole in relation to the security of the State.  If at any time a Government are not satisfied, steps are taken to remove people from office.  This happened in the case of a Government of which the Taoiseach was a member and also in the case of a Government in which I served.  If the responsible law officers are not conducting their affairs to the satisfaction of the Government, then the Government have power to intervene.  Questions which I had expected the Taoiseach to answer have not been answered.  I understand the Taoiseach will be replying to the debate and he may try to shed more light on these questions.</P>
    <P>The events of the last few weeks have given rise to something worse than an impasse in Anglo-Irish relations.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;impasse&rdquo; in this connection is a diplomatic expression.  If we are going to be truthful with one another, we must admit that those relations are now in a worse condition than they have been for many years.  We have to decide in this House where the fault for that situation lies, and what steps must be taken to remedy it.</P>
    <P>There must be no mistaking the importance of this debate today.  Good relations between this country and our nearest neighbour are of crucial importance for us and for the people we represent.  Good relations are only possible if they are built on an atmosphere of mutual trust and mutual respect.  It is not in our national interest, and it is not in Britain's national interest, for those relations to break down.  There is much more than good neighbourliness <Col N="42" /> involved.  Good relations between us and Britain hold the key to a great deal of what is important for us &mdash; ranging from continued economic development to the resolution, through peaceful means, of the centuries-old problem of division on this island.</P>
    <P>And when they are at the point of breakdown, as they are now, we must be prepared to ask hard questions.  It would be easy &mdash; may be too easy &mdash; to say that the fault lies entirely with the Government of Great Britain.  And there is no doubt that that Government have displayed a special kind of arrogance in their dealings with this Republic in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>But we owe it to ourselves also to ask whether there are things we could have done differently here, not only in the interests of preserving relations, but also to ensure that our own house is in order. In this connection, I have to say that I have found it increasingly difficult to avoid the conclusion that the management of this whole affair by the Irish Government has been amateurish &mdash; to the point where I am beginning to wonder if there is a real interest in resolving the matters in dispute.</P>
    <P>I intend to develop these points in more detail, but I want first to deal with some of the specific issues that have given rise to this crisis.</P>
    <P>We have discussed already in this House the grave issues that arise from the decision of the British Attorney General not to prosecute individuals against whom there is a body of evidence arising from the Stalker-Sampson report.  In another context I have already said that the Mayhew decision on that matter must rank with some of the other issues that have come in the eyes of many to personify the current administration in Britain &mdash; issues like the <i>Belgrano</i> affair, the Westland affair, and the Spycatcher scandal.  It has been gratifying to note that there is a growing body of opinion within Britain itself that regards the Mayhew decision as casting a slur on the entire British legal system, and that finds that decision both inexplicable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> In that connection I find it odd in the extreme that there has not been a concerted diplomatic effort to ensure that that opinion is consolidated and mobilised.  On previous occasions when the Irish Government had a point of view to put forward, a great deal of effort was put into ensuring that all sympathetic and influential opinion, not alone in Britain but around the world, was informed. That effort frequently led to a heightened understanding of this country's position, and was instrumental in securing a widespread acceptance of our point of view. There is no evidence that on this occasion any effort was made to keep Ireland's friends and allies fully involved in helping to seek a resolution of the problems, and that must count as a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I spoke in this House about the Stalker affair, I asked whether it was appropriate to proceed through the Anglo-Irish Conference on this issue.  I put forward the view then that we should examine the lead given by David Lange, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, in his dispute with France over the <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> tragedy.  Confronted with a situation that was not dissimilar in some ways to the Stalker affair, New Zealand took their case to the court of world opinion, and succeeded in winning the sympathy and support of the world for their case.  Instead of doing that, we sought meetings to clarify the situation, and it appears that those meetings were doomed to failure before they began.</P>
    <P>As a result of the failure of the negotiations that have taken place to date, we have been hearing ambivalent noises about cross-Border security.  Let me make it abundantly clear that there is no way that we in this House should tolerate any diminution in the effort to combat armed terrorism.  It would be diametrically opposed to the interests of our people that we should.  The use of security as a bargaining counter in our relations with the British would not only be unacceptable, it would be profoundly dangerous.  Its long term repercussions for the whole of this island, and especially for <Col N="44" /> the people whom we are directly elected to represent, could be untold.  Enough damage has already been done by all these events.  We cannot compound that damage by any slippage in our vigilance against terrorism.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to talk about cross-border security without dwelling on the subject of extradition.  When the Extradition (Amendment) Bill was before this House, speakers from the Labour Party warned about the dangers inherent in the Bill.  I would like to quote specifically from what our Justice spokesman, Mervyn Taylor, had to say on the Second Stage debate on that Bill:</P>
    <P>If we in law leave it to an individual, in this case the Attorney General, to decide what information he needs, are we not subjecting that individual to the possibility of intolerable political pressure before he makes his mind up? ...One way of avoiding pressure, from the Attorney General's point of view, would be to decide that no information was adequate.  The Attorney General who decided that he was going to stop all warrants might not be doing his job, but he might find himself a lot more free from political pressure.</P>
    <P>It was obvious to us from a careful study of that Bill that it was essential that any safeguards built into the Bill would have to be specific.  We argued that in the absence of specific safeguards the Attorney General, whoever he might be, would find himself most likely following one of two alternatives.  Either he would act to stop all warrants, or he would choose not to intervene at all.</P>
    <P>In considering the Act that is now the law of the land, the attitude of the British authorities only becomes relevant after one central question has been answered. The Act is only operable, with the best will in the world, if the law officers in Britain know with certainty what are the requirements of the Irish Attorney General.  In other words, they must know what he needs in order to be able to form an opinion about the warrant in front of him.  Since they cannot read his mind, there is a clear obligation on the Irish <Col N="45" /> Attorney General to tell them, clearly and concisely, what his requirements are. Once the British authorities know what the Irish Attorney General needs, they must comply, but they can only comply when they know his mind.</P>
    <P>The first question we have to ask, therefore, is: have the British authorities been advised of the Attorney General's requirements under the Act?  If they have not, then someone on our side has been guilty of dereliction of duty.  If they have not, then the suspicion must arise that it is the Irish Government, for their own purposes, who want to bog down the operation of extradition.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the British authorities are fully briefed about how the Attorney General will exercise his responsibilities under the Act, and if in that situation they are choosing to supply only the information that they deem appropriate, then clearly it is the British authorities, for whatever reason, who wish to stifle extradition between these two jurisdictions.  It would take extraordinary arrogance for any law officer to decide that he will operate the law of another jurisdiction in whatever way he sees fit.  I do not want to suggest that the British law officers lack arrogance &mdash; we have had plenty of evidence to the contrary &mdash; but what is puzzling is that any decision not to operate our law would be totally counter-productive from the British point of view.  I can think of no conceivable reason why they would want extradition to collapse.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach when responding will clarify whether since our Attorney General received a communication from the British Attorney General anything has been done between the two Attorneys General, for example, in relation to the practical operation of the Act at this stage.  Would it not be sensible for the Attorneys General of both countries to meet?  There is provision for this in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  They should get together in order to secure a working arrangement in relation to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  It is vital that we get firm answers to the questions raised.  The <Col N="46" /> absence of a proper and effective extradition procedure is not in the interest of either country.  If what is needed is a sharp direction to either or both law officers involved in this dispute, they should get that direction from their respective Prime Ministers.  If, however, we discover that our Attorney General has been remiss in carrying out the clear responsibilities that the Act of 1987 placed on him, we cannot let that pass without condemning that omission in the severest way.</P>
    <P>There must be many in Britain who were horrified at the announcement last night by the United Kingdom Home Secretary that it is the intention of the British Government to make the Prevention of Terrorism Act a permanent fixture of British law.  Anyone who is concerned about civil liberties must have the deepest possible reservations about that Act, even if its necessity has been argued for against a background of terrorism.  It is clear that the effects of the Act in combating terrorism have been extremely poor, and its justification cannot be measured in terms of a glorious success in preventing crime.</P>
    <P>However, of even more significance than the announcement was the timing of the announcement.  In the midst of a delicate situation, the timing can only be construed either as gross incompetence or as the result of a deliberate decision to add fuel to the flames.  Either way, it bodies ill for the development of the relations that we need.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me add, in fairness, that I welcome the announcement by the British Home Secretary that it is intended to continue the practice of requiring a positive decision in the House of Commons on a yearly basis in respect of the continued use of the powers in the Act.  I hope that the day will not be far away, when those powers will be unable to attract a majority in the Commons.</P>
    <P>I must now make some points that some Members of this House may not wish to hear.  At the start of my remarks I referred to the approach being followed by the Irish Government as amateurish. <Col N="47" /> That is the kindest of the many words I could have used.</P>
    <P>The criticisms that must be levelled at the Government's handling of this affair cover several areas.  First, there was a marked indifference to the procedures and structures of the Anglo-Irish Agreement throughout the first eight months of this Administration.  Those same procedures and structures about which we are being asked to reaffirm our determination today did not witness much determination in the period I have mentioned.  Instead, there was a distinct impression that this Government did not regard the agreement as high on their list of priorities at all.  Given Fianna Fáil's track record in relation to the agreement, that may not be surprising, but it must be said that closer attention to the agreement would have conveyed a different impression to the British Government about our commitment to the use of the procedures.  We must ask whether an impression was allowed to go abroad that we were not really serious about the procedures and structures in the agreement until trouble loomed on the horizon.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there have been many accusations in this House of insensitivity on the part of the British Government.  I concur &mdash; we have witnessed incredible insensitivity on more than one occasion &mdash; but have our hands been clean in this area?  Many people must have been puzzled, as I was, by the visit of a member of the Irish Government to the North of Ireland in a blaze of publicity within the last couple of weeks.  I must ask here, was this visit notified to the authorities in the North of Ireland?  Were they asked to provide security and other back-up for a private visit, with no advance warning that this was going to be used as an opporunity for an attack on their security arrangements?  I have some reason to believe that it was the latter set of circumstances that prevailed, and that that visit was seen as so provocative that it led to a postponement of the Inter-governmental Conference meeting.  This is something that needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is fairly clear that the <Col N="48" /> approach to negotiations in this area has been clumsy.  The Taoiseach has told us of the specific demands that were made, and the predictable and inevitable replies that were received.  He admits that the negotiations have resulted in an impasse. He must have known beforehand that they would, if approached in this way.  The situation he describes is the immutable force meeting the immovable mass.  That is not the way to negotiate.</P>
    <P>Why have we not been told of the contingency plans made by the Government in the event of the predictable replies being received?  Is it because there are no contingency plans?  Why were these negotiations approached in this way in the first place?  Surely it would have been infinitely preferable to avoid putting forward specific demands, inviting predictable replies?  The Government should have concentrated on conveying the outrage of the great majority of the Irish people, and ensuring that the onus to come forward with specifics was placed firmly and squarely where it belonged, on the British.</P>
    <P>In short, there is an impasse and that impasse threatens the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I cannot say for certain whether it could have been avoided by more astute negotiation, but it was inevitable given the clumsy approach that was taken.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, I referred earlier to the absence of any diplomatic background to this whole affair.  This makes no sense at all.  We have friends in the world, people who understand our position and are prepared to help.  Not only are they not being asked to help, I understand they are being kept in the dark as much as the rest of us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I regret to have to say to the House that we have been told nothing today that we did not know already.  I hope the Taoiseach will take the further opportunity afforded him when replying to this debate to clarify some of the questions which remain.  It is in the interests of all of us to seek consensus, the consensus which the Taoiseach looked for this morning, in relation to a very delicate matter, the relationship between this Government and the UK <Col N="49" /> Government.  Answers must be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It will be in the interests of this House and this country if consensus can be brought about in relation to the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That consensus was not present in this House on 19 November 1985 when the Taoiseach addressed this House on the debate as to whether we should accept the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I hope that in further contributions made by the Government some effort will be made to strive to achieve that consensus.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier was mentioned and there is provision for this in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  At the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Meeting which took place in April-May 1987, both sides agreed with the desirability of a Dublin-London parliamentary tier.  Will the Government confirm whether any progress has been made with the British Government in relation to the development of an Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier?  That would be of benefit to the agreement, it would provide a forum for politicians interested in avoiding the type of impasse we now have and it would allow for development.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to divide this House.  The matters are far too serious.  I know of the constraints surrounding the Taoiseach in matters of this nature but if the questions posed are clarified and if we can get some idea of the direction which the Government will now take it would be of help. For example, will the Taoiseach be seeking a full scale summit meeting?  I have stated publicly and I repeat this morning that the idea of discussing, not to mind solving, problems of a major nature which exist in Anglo-Irish relations at the margin of a summit meeting which was itself embroiled in problems of a nightmare scale in relation to the funding of the Community is not an adequate response and certainly not an adequate avenue for resolving these discussions. Perhaps the Taoiseach will inform the House if his intention is to seek a summit meeting at an early stage to try to put Anglo-Irish relations back on an even keel and the Anglo-Irish Agreement <Col N="50" /> back on a working track.  The impasse we have at present will not be resolved by a succession of meetings at ministerial level.  We have had three of them in the past fortnight and nothing has emerged from them.  In the interests of seeking consensus and unity in this House I will look out for directions from the Taoiseach in the course of this debate before deciding whether the motion on the Order Paper in the name of the Government has to be opposed.</P>

      <P>As a long term aspiration of any Nationalist politician must be a united Ireland in which all traditions of this country can find expression by agreement and in peace, those who believe this result can be achieved by violence are hindering progress along that road.  Not alone is violence abhorrent in itself, the measures which are necessary to deal with it are both a constant drain on limited economic resources and, unfortunately and all too frequently, impositions which are required to deal <Col N="51" /> with that violence can threaten the civil liberties which can be expected in any civilised society.  The path to progress must lie elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland issue has avoided instant solutions in the past and it seems unlikely to be amenable to instant solutions at this stage.  However, certain elements that must be considered in any approach to the question have been identified and bear repetition at this point.  First, any lasting solution must take into account the relationship between the communities in Northern Ireland.  The identities, needs and aspirations of both must be recognised and accommodated.  Respective traditions and interests must be protected and safeguarded if any change is to gain widespread acceptance.  Second, the rest of the country is clearly involved with the Northern Ireland issue and, therefore, must be involved in any solution.  An arrangement which would take into account only the internal situation in Northern Ireland could not be expected to prevail.</P>
      <P>The third and critical element as far as we are concerned here at this time is the relationship between the Government in Dublin and the Government in London. That relationship is central to forming a framework on which any solution could be build.  Close co-operation and willingness by both Governments to bring imagination, determination, goodwill and sensitivity to bear on the Northern Ireland problem would do much to help advance a solution and a resolution.  The present impasse in Anglo-Irish relations arises because the goodwill has been coming from one side only, from our side, while a singular lack of imagination coupled with an almost crass insensitivity is being portrayed by the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves of the efforts of successive Irish Governments in this decade to record progress.  The Summit in Dublin Castle in December 1980 between the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the present British Prime Minister gave a new momentum through the efforts of two sovereign Governments <Col N="52" /> in London and Dublin to try to address the problems jointly and find a common way forward.  A period followed in which various aspects of current relations between the two countries were examined in depth.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the New Ireland Forum brought together constitutional Nationalist politicians from all parts of Ireland and explored the possibilities of advancement.  In November 1985 the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Agreement between the Irish and British Governments set up an Anglo-Irish Conference chaired jointly by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with a secretariat in Belfast staffed by officials from both Governments.  The agreement did not fire Fianna Fáil with the same enthusiasm as it did politicians on the other side.  In Government, in spite of such doubts as had been harboured at the time of its conclusion, Fianna Fáil have actively and in good faith operated the agreement. It is extraordinary here today to hear speakers from the benches opposite questioning the degree of goodwill this Government brought to the agreement. The allegations made from the benches opposite on this matter are at the same time mischievous and inaccurate to the point of being untruthful, and I will prove this by reference to the facts.</P>
    <P>In spite of what has been said by Deputy Spring and by Deputy Barry outside this House and Deputy Dukes inside this House on the operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement since March last, the facts are as follows.  No meeting of the conference took place in the last three months of the Coalition Government and only one regular meeting of the conference was held in the period between June and September 1986.  There was, of course, as we are all aware, a special meeting of the conference in 1986 in July. This was requested by the then Coalition because of serious problems which had emerged during the marching season, particularly in Portadown.  This meeting was by way of a firefighting operation and was necessitated by a failure of the then Government on this side of the Border <Col N="53" /> to anticipate difficulties and use the conference and its secretariat effectively to head off those difficulties before they burst into flames.  There was no need for a similar special marching season meeting of the conference in 1987.  The marching season was quieter then than in the previous year, not because the Lambeg drummers and those who strut in their wake had exhausted their energies or enthusiasms nor because more positive pursuits presented themselves to them, but because the Government had effectively used the secretariat and the Anglo-Irish instruments to impress on the Northern authorities that there must be no repetition of the 1986 season's events. To their credit, the Northern Ireland authorities were conscious of the need to avoid the repetition.  The effective use of the secretariat and agreement by this Government was well recognised by the SDLP Chairman, Alban Magennis when he said:</P>
    <P>... that the (1987) ... marching season... was less troublesome and we welcome that.  The better management of parades is a net result of the working of the conference.  I think that Loyalists now accept that they can no longer parade willy nilly wherever and whenever they want.  That is history now.</P>
    <P>That proves that this Government have been conscious of the usefulness of the agreement and anxious to use it.  While use of the Anglo-Irish Conference in the closing months of the last Government was tardy, the same cannot in truth be said about the use of the agreement by this Government.  In the first six months of office the Minister for Foreign Affairs had three separate meetings with Mr. King, two within the formal conference format and one informal meeting took place in London.  That meeting took place literally within days of this Government taking office.  The British general election, the Single European Act referendum, the August period of break all intervened in the meantime and following these events were two further meetings of the conference followed by a series of <Col N="54" /> informal meetings between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Secretary culminating in a meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Home Secretary in the closing weeks of 1987 in which we had discussions on the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Maguire cases.  To say that this Government have not fully used the operations afforded by the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I upset anybody's sensitivies in this matter, I am not imputing the lie to any Member here but I will say it is a calculated untruth.  The fact that this calculated untruth is repeated here and elsewhere does not improve in any way the validity of the calculated untruth.</P>
      <P>I think it would be wrong for me not to recognise that the agreement has facilitated some positive achievements.  The conference which it established provides a useful mechanism whereby issues which have given rise to legitimate concern in the Nationalist Northern population can be ventilated.  Tangible progress has been made on a number of issues, and there has been an observable reduction in the tensions of the marching season, as I have referred to.  Supergrass trials have been discontinued and we look forward to progress with the implementation of a police code of conduct and the introduction of employment equality legislation.  These are the positive fruits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this positive background, however glacial the pace of the achievements, the recent body blows to Anglo-Irish relationships must be regarded not only as regrettable but as totally incomprehensible.  It would seem from the Irish standpoint that the British Government have embarked on a policy of being progressively, needlessly and destructively <Col N="55" /> provocative.  There seems to be a calculated attempt to perpetrate a new outrage virtually with each day that passes. The extraordinary statement by the British Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, that the Stalker-Sampson report was to go unpublished and, because of some considerations of national security, criminal proceedings were not to be pressed, in spite of the evidence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, was a body blow not just to Anglo-Irish relations but to logic. It was an extraordinary statement for any Attorney General to make in the House of any democratic parliament in any democratic State.  It offends logic and indeed if offends the rule of law.  Moreover, it was a blow which raises serious questions as to the British intentions with regard to the building of confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, one of the central aims of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  it showed also the beginning of a series of indications of total insensitivity by the British in Anglo-Irish matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes implied this morning that the Irish Government should have known that Sir Patrick Mayhew was about to make his statement on 25 January and should also have known the content of that statement.  I submit that all of the evidence flies against Deputy Dukes's allegation.  It would be reasonable to believe that the British Government would have informed the Irish Government as to their intentions in this matter.  The facts are that they did not and the facts were laid before us by the Taoiseach this morning.  Unless Deputy Dukes can prove the opposite is the case, he should desist from hinting that there was some foreknowledge in this matter.</P>
    <P>I was in the company of senior members from the main Opposition party when the Stalker announcement was made and to say that they were amazed and that it ran against all they had been led to believe in Government would be an understatement.  Not only was there amazement on this side of the Border but it is my information that there was <Col N="56" /> amazement and astonishment on the other side of the unfortunate Border also. There is clear evidence that as late as the Sunday evening preceding Sir Patrick Mayhew's statement journalists in Northern Ireland were briefed to expect that there would be a series of prosecutions. Indeed, even on the morning of the statement a journalist who was in the presence of senior RUC officers reported that there was an anticipation and gloom about the level of prosecutions.  It is very clear that there was a reversal of views on this matter at a very high political level in the United Kingdom, probably on the Sunday preceding the announcement.  It is equally clear, in the circumstances, that there could have been no forewarning to the Government here and it is unhelpful that the Leader of the Opposition should suggest that this was the case.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary statement by the British Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, that the Stalker-Sampson report was to go unpublished was the first of a series of major blows.  The second blow in so far as confidence in what is loosely to be termed British justice came later that same week in the judgment on the Birmingham Six case.  I do not accept the judgment in this case because it is so blatantly unjust, it runs so blatantly against the facts and it so blatantly and obviously influences the atmosphere with regard to Anglo-Irish relations.  I do not accept the suggestion that it is inappropriate for Ministers to use the Anglo-Irish context or any other context to bring this matter before the British authorities. I find it extraordinary that Deputy Dukes this morning should have faulted Government Ministers for seeking to promote the interests of Irish people who are held in British jails for crimes which all of the evidence clearly indicates they did not commit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows full well what I am referring to.  I am not referring to all persons of Irish nationality in all jails; I am referring to the Six, whom some of us have met, to the Four <Col N="57" /> and to Mrs. Maguire and her family who have been left out of much of the comment here today.  It is entirely appropriate that Irish Ministers and members of this and the other House should on each and every occasion seek to progress the case of those unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Deputy Dukes did not deny that this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read his statement closely.  The only crime they committed was that they were Irish and were in the wrong place at the wrong time.</P>
      <P>The undermining of Anglo-Irish relations by these two events was carried a step further by the revelation that the British Attorney General who had kicked over the hornets nest on 25 January was to take this matter a step further by in effect, rejecting the constitutional authority of the Oireachtas to legislate for Ireland by his refusal to operate the extradition rules introduced by the Extradition (Amendment) Act.  The commentary by Deputy Dukes on this issue this morning was incomprehensible, as indeed was the commentary by Deputy Spring.  As I have focused on the inconsistency on the former's approach on other issues I will deal with the inconsistencies of the latter's approach on this second issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring made an inference that somehow the Irish Attorney General should be responsible for this matter.  He did not produce a shred of evidence to support this serious inference but nonetheless he made it in a must unhelpful manner.  Whatever else we can presume about Sir Patrick Mayhew and his advisers, I think it is not unreasonable for us to assume that the man and his advisers can read.  The requirements of Ireland's Legislature are written down in the Extradition (Amendment) Act and Sir Patrick Mayhew can read the requirements there.  His obduracy in this matter should not be used as the basis for pillorying any servant of the Irish State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As if all this was not enough to sour relations, in a final piece of maladroit timing we had the announcement that the <Col N="58" /> Prevention of Terrorism Act &mdash; which has rightly been referred to by Deputy Spring as an odious piece of legislation which flies in the face of civil liberties &mdash; is to be made permanent.  In spite of the protests which have been made from time to time by British politicians, this odious legislation is not focused primarily on international terrorism; it is focused primarily on Irish citizens.  The major burden of this legislation is carried by Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite and Deputies on this side of the House have made the point and will continue to make it throughout this debate that Anglo-Irish relations have reached a sorry impasse, as indeed they have.  They have reached a sorry impasse because of bad faith, bad judgment and incomprehensible activities on behalf of another Government.</P>
    <P>I commend the activities of the Ministers who are handling this matter on the Irish side.  Their response to the provocation has been correct.  I do not accept the suggestions that were made outside this House this morning by Deputy Spring that a more provocative, gutsy and aggressive stance is called for.  In the face of blank obduracy, intimidatory activities and the total breakdown of logic on the part of another Government, it would not be appropriate for us to respond in kind.  We are above all a patient race. For over 800 years we have dealt with the idiosyncrasies of our nearest, closest and dearest neighbour and we have learned during that period, if we have learned nothing else, that we cannot expect that they will come instantly to their senses.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the Government's measured response is a correct response. The motion which is put before the House by the Government deserves support from all sides because the way out of this impasse is for us to subsume such differences in approach as may exist between us and to present a united front on this most serious issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must protest at the restriction of the time allowed to me to deal with this issue, but I will do the best I can to keep within the 20 <Col N="59" /> minutes allowed.  Nobody who wants to see progress towards peace and democracy in Northern Ireland, and that is certainly our objective, can be anything but appalled at the sequence of events over the past few weeks which have led to the present crisis in Anglo-Irish relations.  It is important to remember that just a few weeks ago the paramilitaries, and particularly the Provisional IRA were more isolated, demoralised and dispirited than at any time in recent years.  They were shaken to their foundations by the unprecedented demonstration of revulsion at the Enniskillen massacre by the majority of people, both North and South.  There was a feeling that at last sectarian terror could be defeated and that real progress could be made in Northern Ireland. However, the situation has changed in little more than a month.  A series of extraordinary decisions by the British Government which were at best enormous errors of judgment and, at worst, deliberate provocations, have given a kiss of life to the Provisionals and done serious damage to the struggle for peace and democracy and civil rights in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can hardly be that Mrs. Thatcher is unaware of the depth of public opinion caused by her decisions in all sections of the community in Ireland.  The only conclusion that can be drawn is that she has deliberately chosen to ignore it.  Mrs. Thatcher's lack of sympathy and understanding for Irish people, Nationalist or Unionist, has always been evident but in the past few weeks she has treated the people of this island with the sort of contempt that she normally reserves for the British working class and in particular the trade union movement.  She has behaved like some sort of medieval empress, ruling by diktat, prepared to bend the law to suit her own political needs and expecting the serfs in the far flung corners of her empire to meekly bend the knee and accept her imperial rule.  It is difficult to find any other rational explanation of these recent decisions of hers than a personal grudge and a desire for revenge against the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey. <Col N="60" /> Mrs. Thatcher has never forgotten the independent and neutral stance adopted by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, during the Falklands War, her imperial war, when he refused to go along with sanctions and he condemned the sinking of the <i>Belgrano.</i></P>
    <P>The first and most serious decision in the recent chain of events was the inexplicable and inexcusable decision of the British authorities not to publish the Stalker-Sampson report and not to initiate any proceedings against those involved in the 1982 shootings or the subsequent cover-up.  An acceptable police force in which the majority of people can have confidence is an essential prerequisite for political progress in Northern Ireland.  This decision did much to undermine the considerable progress that has been made in recent years towards achieving an acceptable police force.  It is worth remembering that a major objective of the civil rights campaign, which took to the streets in Northern Ireland 20 years ago and in which we were very much involved, was to secure the reform and disarming of the RUC.  These demands were largely conceded by the British Government but the progress made was literally blown away by the Provisionals when they launched their campaign of violence in the early seventies.</P>
    <P>The RUC have had a chequered career since then.  There were certainly events in the seventies in which their conduct was totally unacceptable.  However, there is little doubt that in the past ten years significant progress was being made in reforming the RUC.  In recent years, especially, the RUC had become increasingly accepted by the majority of people across the sectarian divide.  People in Nationalist areas were seeing the RUC more and more as a normal police force and were prepared to call on them to deal with normal petty crime, house breaking, car stealing etc. which has become such an unfortunate feature of urban life both in Northern Ireland and in the South.  As part of our constant campaign for a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland, The Workers' Party have always called for <Col N="61" /> reform of the RUC, the setting up of an independent complaints procedure and the placing of the police service under civilian control.  The killing of six people by the RUC in dubious circumstances within a period of a few weeks in 1982, quite rightly shocked many people in Britain and Ireland.  The decision to hold a full inquiry into the 1982 shootings was a welcome development but unfortunately the way it has been handled since then is a disaster.  The paramilitary groups are the only ones to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the Deputy Chief Constable for Manchester, John Stalker, was removed from the investigation is a cause for concern, but the decision not to publish the findings of the inquiry or to take any action against those involved is a blunder of enormous proportions which will undermine the efforts of those involved in the difficult task of fulfilling civil rights in Northern Ireland. The British Attorney General in his statement to the House of Commons stated quite clearly that there are grounds for proceeding against persons alleged to have conspired to pervert the course of justice.  The decision not to do so on the grounds of security is quite unacceptable and simply illustrates the deplorable double standards that have become the hallmark of the Thatcher Administration.  Mrs. Thatcher's obsession with protecting her security forces is legendary, but on this occasion she has shown an unprecedented contempt for legality.  One must suspect that the real reason she wanted to put the lid on this affair was that publication of the report would, as the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> put it in its editorial last week, &ldquo;point to a trail leading to Downing Street,&rdquo; meaning, as Dr. Paisley, MEP said in Europe that the Prime Minister through MI5 had direct responsibility for the shoot-to-kill policy.</P>
    <P>The disquiet created by the British Government on the Stalker-Sampson affair was compounded by the verdict of the Appeal Court in the Birmingham Six case.  This was not altogether unexpected.  It was not so much the decision itself that created outrage as the manner in which the British establishment, in the <Col N="62" /> form of the Appeal Court judges contemptuously dismissed and rejected every shred of evidence put forward on behalf of the men and the immediate rejection by the British Home Secretary of any suggestion that he might consider exercising clemency in the case.</P>
    <P>Two further developments in the past week have made an already difficult situation almost impossible.  The decision of the British Attorney General to refuse to make extradition requests in accordance with the terms of the legislation passed by the Oireachtas is a challenge to the very sovereignty of this State.  It is extraordinarily hypocritical that a Government who have made such an issue of the alleged reluctance of this State to extradite persons suspected of being involved in terrorism, should now refuse to operate the legislation designed to facilitate the extradition of these very people.  Mrs. Thatcher seems to indicate that we have no right to legislate for the manner in which extradition should be implemented.</P>
    <P>The final turn of the screw was the decision to make permanent the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  In a submission last year to Viscount Colville, when he was reviewing the Act, The Workers' Party said:</P>
    <P>As far as The Workers' Party is concerned adequate provisions exist, in the common law and on the Statute Books, in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to deal with offences arising out of terrorism.  Emergency legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act only has the effect of alienating large sections of the population from those charged with administering the law and its existence makes a mockery of government concern for civil rights and justice.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party is totally opposed to all forms of terrorism and violence.  In our view terrorist activity has not only brought death and suffering to many families, but it has seriously inhibited the development of political and economic progress.  It has <Col N="63" /> deepened sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland and increased fear and mistrust within the community.  Our Party is very much concerned that terrorist violence should be ended.  We are convinced that the elimination of terrorism can only be achieved by combining a rigorous application of the normal rule of law with the development of democratic politics.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to the Prevention of Terrorism Act because it brings the rule of law into disrepute and because it diminishes the rights of all citizens. The PTA provides the government, the police and the army with powers which are unchallengeable in the courts.</P>
    <P>This then is the background against which this debate takes place.</P>
    <P>Before considering where we should go from here, there are two important points that should be remembered.  The first is that, while we have every right to be concerned at the actions of the British Government, we should not fall into the temptation of a ritual knee jerk anti-Brit reaction.  We cannot afford to be smug.  In this State we, too, have had our miscarriages of justice.  We, too, have our draconian laws, including the right to use the death penalty.  We, too, have had, under successive Governments, serious abuses of police power. People have died in this State in mysterious and unexplained circumstances while in Garda custody.  We should also acknowledge that those who have fought longest and hardest to establish the innocence of the Birmingham Six have been British and that it was a British policeman who, at great personal cost and risk to himself, tried to get to the bottom of the killings in 1982 and the subsequent murky cover-up.</P>
    <P>The second point is that we should remember that those who have been responsible for the overwhelming majority of murders and destruction in Northern Ireland since 1970 have been the Provisional IRA.  While we are right <Col N="64" /> to be concerned about any suggestion of a shoot-to-kill policy by security forces in Northern Ireland, the Provisionals have engaged in a murderous campaign of sectarian violence against the Protestant community in Northern Ireland and have had a policy of shoot to kill and bomb to kill and maim.  They have done this for 17 years and for much of that time public opinion in the South has remained quite indifferent and, indeed, at certain times, such as during the H Block issues, have been quite prepared to go a long way along the road with the Provos.  Indeed, The Workers' Party were almost the only political party to take a stand against the Provos and the H Block hysteria back in 1982.  The same paramilitaries continue to claim victims of their sectarian murder campaign.  We have constantly emphasised the sectarianism of the Provisionals' campaign.  Only this week, a young Protestant worker who was in the UDR, Alan Johnston, was cruelly murdered at his place of work.</P>
    <P>The central need for progress in Northern Ireland is peace.  This requires the total defeat of sectarianism and terrorism.  That cannot be achieved by security measures alone.  It cannot be achieved by allowing the security forces to bend the law.  It cannot be achieved by repressive legislation.  It cannot be achieved by refusing to acknowledge the errors of the past, or by further restrictions on civil liberties.  No legislation, no matter how draconian and no topping up of military measures, can be absolutely successful.  The ultimate total rooting out of terrorism will only be achieved through a combination of political, economic and social measures.  The objective of the defeat of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland must, despite our anger at recent British decisions, remain the foremost objective of this State and this House. Nothing should be done which is going to make this more difficult and we should be prepared honestly to look at anything that stands in the way of peace.</P>
    <P>The events of the past few weeks have exposed the glaring inadequacies of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It was evident from the very beginning that the whole <Col N="65" /> way in which the agreement had been negotiated and the contemptuous way in which the Unionist parties had been excluded by the Dublin and London Governments would lead to the total alienation of the political representatives of the majority community in Northern Ireland.  There may have been those who felt that this was a price worth paying in return for what they believed would be a more sensitive approach by the British Government to the feelings of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and a say for Dublin in major decisions affecting Northern Ireland. This clearly has not happened.  The Unionists have been alienated by the agreement, but the British Government have not delivered on the other matters.</P>
    <P>There should be no sacred cows allowed to block the path to progress. The crisis facing the people of Northern Ireland is too serious for that.  If the structures and institutions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement are acting as barriers to dialogue between the people of this island, then they must be confronted.  What is the sense in clinging rigidly to arrangements which may now be posing a major threat to the achievement of the agreement's original objectives of peace and devolved democratic government in Northern Ireland?  At least, we believe that those were the original objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We would be interested to know from the Taoiseach in his reply if, when he refers to the goals of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the motion, he regards the goal of that agreement as the achieving of democratic devolved government in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is pointless for any group to claim that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is written on tablets of stone and that it is unmovable or unalterable.  There have been signs that the Unionist parties are preparing to adopt a more flexible position, but there is a need for a response from Dublin.  Does the Taoiseach have the capacity and courage to grasp that nettle from which successive Governments have shrunk.  It is clear that there will be no progress in Northern Ireland <Col N="66" /> unless there is some concession to the Unionist parties.  The procedures of the Anglo-Irish Conference, which is the substance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, come up for renewal at the end of this year.  Why could the Taoiseach here today, before this debate ends, not invite the Leaders of the Unionist parties to meet him, as he has invited the SDLP, to discuss what changes are necessary in the Anglo-Irish Agreement to facilitate progress towards the important and generally agreed objectives of democratic government and a Bill of Rights?  Given the positive response of the Unionist leader, Mr. Molyneaux, to Mr. Haughey's comments in reply to my Dáil question last week, I am sure that a genuine offer of talks without preconditions would provoke a positive response among Unionist Leaders.  If they say that they will talk if he sets aside the Anglo-Irish Agreement, or suspends it for a period of three, four or six months, then why should we not suspend it or do whatever is necessary to ensure that those talks will take place?  The Taoiseach could hardly get a worse response from the Unionist parties than he has from the British Prime Minister over the past few weeks.  It has not stopped him talking to Mrs. Thatcher.  Why should he not begin to talk to political parties in Northern Ireland?  He should also be telling the SDLP to get off their high horse and enter into dialogue with other parties in Northern Ireland without preconditions and I mean Unionist parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring spoke of consensus in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement but, as with everybody who speaks of consensus down here, I presume that he was talking as usual, about consensus of Nationalist parties.  If we are talking about consensus we must have it with Unionist as well as with Nationalist parties.</P>
    <P>The long term objective of Irish unity remains a legitimate aspiration for this Government, for the Dáil, for the political parties and for the people of Ireland to hold.  But we must all acknowledge that unity means unity of our people, not just geographical unity and that this is <Col N="67" /> neither possible, nor desirable, without the free consent of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The only items on the immediate agenda are the issues of peace and democracy.  If politicians, North and South, are not prepared to do whatever is necessary to build strong, democratic structures in Northern Ireland, then they are surrendering public life in Northern Ireland without a struggle to the paramilitaries and when the next savage atrocity is inflicted on the community, then those who have failed to grasp the nettle and give the people of Northern Ireland the political leadership they are crying out for, will have to bear their share of the responsibility.</P>
    <P>I will end by referring to the extraordinarily serious situation which is developing and which has not been commented on in the context to which we see it.  I refer to the enormous finds of arms both with the Provisional IRA, the UVF and the UDA.  Someone somewhere is supplying enormous amounts of weaponry to both sides to promote a major sectarian war of Lebanese proportions in Northern Ireland.  Do we know who is doing that?  If Gadaffi is supplying the Provisionals, who is supplying the UVF and the UDA with precisely the same weaponry?  This is something that all parties here must look at very seriously to discover what has been happening during the past year and to look at the serious developments which could take place here if those weapons were used in the way they are used in Lebanon.</P>

      <P>Due to the unfortunate indisposition of my good friend and colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have been entrusted by the Taoiseach with a direct role in the Government's efforts to seek a solution to the very serious difficulties created by the decision of the British authorities in the matter of the Stalker-Sampson report.  I know, in reference to the Tánaiste, that both sides of the House will join with me in welcoming him back to full action.  The report is that he was in sterling form yesterday at Question Time, as Deputies on the opposite side will be the first to appreciate.</P>
      <P>Let me summarise the present position.  The decision of the British authorities to refuse to prosecute policemen against whom there is evidence of perversion of the course of justice in the investigation of these alleged shoot-to-kill incidents in County Armagh in November-December 1982, to refuse to explain the decision not to prosecute, to refuse to publish the Stalker-Sampson report or to provide any information on that investigation, and to fail to consult with, or even inform, the Government in advance of the decision announced by Sir Patrick Mayhew on 25 January, have the most disturbing implications for public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, for relations between the security forces and the Nationalist community, and for trust and confidence between the Garda Síochána and the RUC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> It is hardly surprising that the reaction in this country, and indeed elsewhere, to Sir Patrick Mayhew's statement of 25 January should have been one of utter disbelief.  The clear consequence born of this decision not to prosecute is that in Northern Ireland the rule of law must take second or third place to undefined reasons of &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; and of &ldquo;national security&rdquo;.  The famous Lord Denning once offered the following definition of British justice: &ldquo;Be you ever so high, the law is above you&rdquo;.  Not in Northern Ireland, not now.</P>
    <P>The concepts of public interest and national security are proposed as tombstones for the pain of one man who survived the shootings, for the distress of the families of the six men who died, for the widespread suspicion of a shoot-to-kill policy, for the efforts of the Northern DPP and honest policemen who sought the truth, and for the concern of successive Irish Governments, repeated insistently in the conference, in the secretariat and in many other contacts with British Ministers and officials.  This whole affair should be cleared up honestly.</P>
    <P>Since 1982 there has been great concern in this country that members of the police force in Northern Ireland, either with or without official sanction, were taking the law into their own hands and substituting a policy of &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; in place of, where possible, one of arrest and prosecution.  That concern was not confined either to Irish people or the Irish Government.  It existed and grew in many countries, not least in Britain itself and it led eventually to the setting up by the British Government of what was known initially as &ldquo;the Stalker Investigation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell at length on the many extraordinary happenings which occurred during the course of that investigation and which led to its eventual completion by Mr. Sampson.  Suffice it to say that successive Irish Governments reacted with forebearance and patience to events and delays which encouraged neither.</P>
    <P>I believe there is wide support both in Ireland and abroad for the way in which <Col N="70" /> we have approached the difficulties created by the British authorities' decision on the Stalker-Sampson report, that it has been measured, fair and reasonable. The Government have endeavoured to demonstrate to the British Government at two special sessions of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and at other meetings, that in this instance they are in the wrong and must remedy the problem they have created.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>We have got certain responses and public statements in regard to changes in the RUC and the question of the incursion into our jurisdiction on the night of 12 December 1982 but these responses do not touch on the principal issues at stake here.  The first is the issue of consultation.  Sir Patrick Mayhew is a distinguished lawyer who served as Solicitor General at the time of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  He is familiar with the agreement and its procedures. He could explain why the views and proposals we put forward within the conference were ignored or, if not ignored, put aside in favour of other unknown considerations.  He has not done so nor has any other British representative explained it on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have explicit and formal rights under the agreement in regard to relations between the security forces and the community, in regard to security policy and the security situation, in regard to the enforcement of the criminal law, and confidence in the administration of justice.  The British Attorney General could explain why these rights were disregarded.  He has not done so nor has any other British representative explained it on his behalf and this is plainly intolerable.</P>
    <P>There are other features of the British Attorney General's role in this affair which raise deep concern.  Sir Hartley Shawcross in his statement of 1951 made it clear that in making up his mind on these matters i.e. prosecutions, he had the advice of the DPP and very often of Treasury Counsel as well and had hardly ever, if ever, refused to prosecute when they advised prosecution.  The central <Col N="71" /> question, therefore, is what were the views of Sir Barry Shaw, the Northern DPP on prosecutions at the point when he consulted the Attorney General?  I do not know but I think a brief consideration of what facts are known to us would strongly suggest that his inclination was certainly in the direction of prosecution.</P>
    <P>Sir Barry Shaw has a reputation for independence.  He is the DPP who considered that there was sufficient evidence of the commission of murder to warrant prosecutions against four members of the RUC involved in the incidents in Armagh in November-December 1982 and who gave directions accordingly.  I recall here that the judge in the trial of one of these cases, actually criticised the bringing of the prosecution.  He is the DPP who demanded an RUC investigation into whether there was evidence to suggest perversion of the course of justice in the light of statements of a police cover-up made by Constable Robinson in court. I recall here that, by an extraordinary omission, the trial judge did not refer to sworn statements of Constable Robinson to the DPP.  He is the DPP who exercised statutory powers to initiate the Stalker inquiry because he believed he had been misled by the internal investigation conducted by the RUC itself.  He is the DPP who, on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report, considered there was evidence of the commission of offences of perverting or attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</P>
    <P>What was the point of all of this activity over several years by the DPP if he were not interested in pursuing the requirements of the law to the full?  He could simply have satisfied himself with the findings of the internal RUC investigation and closed the files a long time ago.  He did not do that.  The revelations of John Stalker demonstrate that his misgivings were fully justified.  Surely then Sir Barry Shaw's strong inclination at the end of this long process as he consulted the Attorney General on the public interest aspect of the affair must have been to prosecute?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> It would appear from these considerations and from the evidence of the Attorney General's own statement that the DPP's decision not to prosecute can only have stemmed from whatever directions, instruction, advice, information &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; he received from the Attorney General.  In terms of the Shawcross description of the Attorney General's role in these matters he said he had rarely, if ever, refused to prosecute when the DPP had advised it.  The eventual decision in this case is, to say the least, very unusual.  Even within the definition of his role which the Attorney General has himself espoused and quoted, this decision requires an explanation.</P>
    <P>It is the Attorney General himself who is responsible here, not the DPP.  The decision finally attributed to the DPP, with which the Attorney General says he agreed, is not surprising.  The present holder of the office in Northern Ireland has a reputation for independence.  But his formal position is one of dependency on the Attorney General.  Under statute &mdash; the Prosecution of Offences (NI) Order, 1972, and the Constitution Act, 1973 &mdash;&ldquo;he shall discharge his functions under the superintendence of the Attorney General and shall be subject to the directions of the Attorney General in all matters....&rdquo;  Whatever may be said to be the practice of the relationship between the Attorney General and the DPP, it is impossible to believe that a matter touching security police and high politics should not be decided in the end by the Attorney General.  It is impossible in turn to believe that, whatever the formalities, the views of the Attorney General on the public interest and national security are not guided by the competent members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The lack of consultation with us has already been offered by the Taoiseach in his contribution this morning but it is quite clear that, under specific articles of the agreement, we have rights, of consultation in these matters and those rights were ignored.  The whole question of the failure to consult or communicate through the permanent institution of the <Col N="73" /> agreement is a most serious matter. However, in relation to that and the other items we decided to respond within the spirit and the framework of the agreement.  We convened the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which were held. The position and views of the Irish Government were fully explained to the British representatives.  It was pointed out that the decision not to prosecute members of the RUC against whom the British Government's own appointee, the DPP for Northern Ireland, found sufficient evidence of grave criminal offences but instead to allow them to remain actively involved in law enforcement can only undermine, if not destroy, whatever confidence is reposed in the RUC by the Northern minority.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that to ignore evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice further perverts that course.  It was pointed out that until the administration of justice in Northern Ireland is not only fair and impartial but seen to be so can we ever hope to isolate and remove the virus of terrorism.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to use disingenuous references to public interest and national security to hide from the House the disappointing outcome of our meetings.  All too often in recent decades those responsible for security in Northern Ireland have snatched moral defeat from the jaws of terrorist outrage.  It has happened again.  What therefore can we do?</P>
    <P>In 1945, Eamon de Valera was pressed to respond to what many saw as a grossly provocative and offensive speech at the end of the war in Europe by the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill.  In a radio broadcast he finally responded as follows:</P>
    <P>I know the kind of answer I am expected to make.  I know the answer that just springs to the lips of every person of Irish blood....  I know the answer I would have given a quarter of a century ago.  But I have deliberately decided that this is not the reply I shall make tonight.  I shall strive not to be guilty of adding any fuel to the flames of hatred and passion which, if continued <Col N="74" /> to be fed, promise to burn up whatever is left by way of decent human feeling in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to add any fuel to the flames of Anglo-Irish dissent which have been fanned into life during the last week. We can understand why the former Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has called on our Government to shame and embarrass the British Government on this matter. We can understand, but cannot and will not adopt that course.</P>
    <P>There are, however, some things which must be said.  Like Eamon de Valera, I shall try to say them as dispassionately as I can.  If the members of the RUC identified in the Stalker-Sampson report as having conspired to pervert the course of justice are not prosecuted, it will be difficult for a long time to say that the law is applied justly in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government will be pressing through the Anglo-Irish Conference for much more rapid progress in ending discrimination against the Northern minority and in bringing about the other reforms so widely talked about in 1985.  Our patience, and more important the patience of the Northern minority, is not unlimited and it would be a mistake for anybody to assume that it is.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 was hailed by many as providing supposedly a panacea for all problems existing between our two countries.  Any expression of caution about either its significance or its likely effects were denigrated and denounced.  It is ironic but forgiveable that those who most exaggerated its significance are now the most surprised by its limitations.</P>
    <P>I listened with dismay this morning to statements by Deputy Dukes, Deputy Spring and other Deputies accusing the Government of not working hard enough on the agreement.  It is dismaying that those who authorised the agreement should now be attacking it.  We had our doubts about the agreement in Opposition.  We did not see it as the panacea for all our ills.  We had the more sober and realistic view of its potential.  Whatever our doubts, the Taoiseach made it <Col N="75" /> absolutely clear on entering office that we would honour it and that we would work it.  In the year we have been in office we have had three regular meetings of the conference, and two special meetings, the last of these in two lengthy series devoted to the Stalker-Sampson affair.</P>
    <P>In the same period, the Taoiseach has met Mrs. Thatcher twice, the Tánaiste has met informally twice with Mr. King and has also met with Sir Geoffrey Howe and Mr. Hurd.  The Minister for Justice has met separately twice with Mr. King's Deputy, Mr. Stanley.  The Minister for Justice and I had a further informal meeting with Mr. King and Mr. Stanley in London on 10 February.  There has been frequent contact by telephone or letter between Ministers and, of course, there has been contact at official level in Belfast, as well as contact in Dublin and London.</P>
    <P>I do not need to remind Deputies that all of this activity took place in a year when general elections were held in both Ireland and Britain which naturally disturbed the rhythm of conference meetings.  I could answer the Opposition by pointing out that no meetings of the conference took place in their last three months in office, but I think it is pointless and unwise to engage in this kind of backbiting and minor squabbling when great national interests are at stake.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret that in a situation where the Irish people as a whole have been wronged, Irish political leaders should be seen to fight for an illusory short term political gain and so divert the spotlight from where it should be &mdash; on the failures of London.  This is a time for a rallying together on the high ground that we have.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem here which must be overcome.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement is an agreement between two Governments, not between one Government and part of another.  It is perfectly clear that the role of the British Attorney General in this matter touched on political as well as purely legal matters.  The Government should have been consulted on the political aspect of the role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The Leader of the Opposition questioned earlier the wisdom of raising the case of the Birmingham Six with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, given the particular responsibilities of Mr. King.  There are at least two answers to this.  In the first place, as the Taoiseach clearly said this morning, the Birmingham Six case has obvious implications for extradition between these islands and, as Deputy Dukes will be more aware than most, the political aspect of extradition is a matter which not only comes within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement but is specifically mentioned in that agreement.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in putting our demands to Mr. King, the Minister for Justice and I did so in his capacity as a member of the British Cabinet.  We made it clear that these were the views and proposals of the Government which we were putting to him as a member of his Government and which required a Government response. There is no question, therefore, but that we were perfectly entitled to raise this matter with Mr. King in the Anglo-Irish Conference and that we would have been failing in our duty to operate the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement actively, forcefully and to their maximum potential if we had not done so.  It is only right that we should do so.  The fields of activity in which the Irish Government are entitled to put forward views and proposals in relation to consultation, generally amount to a definition of the elements of the public interest in Northern Ireland.  It refers to protection of human rights, relations between the security forces and the community, security policy, the security situation, enforcement of the criminal law and public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Now that all of us have a realistic view of the state of Anglo-Irish relations and how much still needs to be done to achieve justice both in and for our country, we can renew the task with even greater determination and strength of purpose.</P>
    <P>Unlike other problems which our Government have been able to tackle <Col N="77" /> decisively since taking office, a solution to the Northern problem is not achievable by any Irish Government alone.  The problem was created over centuries; it will not be solved overnight.  I cannot promise Deputies any instant solution or any instant progress.  I can and do assure the House that regardless of any setback or disappointment we shall press on, resolute and convinced that in the end justice will prevail.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 5, and 39, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> There were 12 sheriffs appointed to take over from the county registrars the function of executing tax certificates under section 485 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I propose to circulate their names, and the amounts of tax and interest paid over by each of them to the Collector-General, on a separate table in the Official Report.  The aggregate amount received to date from the new sheriffs is, in round figures, £21.7 million.</P>
    <P>The fees and expenses payable to sheriffs are set out in the Fees Orders made by the Minister for Justice under section 14 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926.  These fees and expenses are levied on the defaulter and are retained by the sheriff to meet the costs of executing his office.  Sheriffs account monthly to the Collector-General of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of tax and interest but are not required to return particulars of fees and expenses levied under the Fees Orders.  Consequently, statistics of these amounts are not available.</P>
    <P>There are at present no plans to appoint additional sheriffs.</P>
    <P>Detailed statistics of amounts of tax held by sheriffs are not available.  Sheriffs are required to transmit to the Collector-General the moneys received in full <Col N="80" /> settlement of a certificate in a month by the middle of the following month.  The sheriff is required to provide, in relation to each payment, the date he received the amount from the defaulter.</P>
    <P>Interest earned on moneys in the hands of sheriffs pending transmission to the Collector-General accrues to the benefit of the sheriff.  The sheriff is not required to provide particulars of this interest in the monthly return he makes to the Collector-General and, consequently, statistics of the amount of the interest are not available.</P>
    <P>Though the new sheriffs have the sole responsibility of executing tax certificates under section 485 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, they were appointed under the statutes relating to civil debt collection and are officers of the court.  In the exercise of their function they are bound by the laws and regulations governing the collection of civil debts of any kind.</P>
    <P>The sheriffs operate under general guidelines from the Revenue in relation to administrative matters such as the time taken to process warrants and the transmission of moneys to the Collector-General.  However, in relation to the execution of warrants they are constrained by the provisions of the civil debt collection law and would be answerable before the courts for any breach of that law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I understood him to say that where there are warrants with the sheriff to recoup tax, if those against whom such warrants exist pay their taxes, the amnesty will apply to any interest that would have accrued on the taxes due. May I ask the Minister in circumstances in which people have paid their taxes in full without the issue of a warrant but where they have subsequently been billed for interest &mdash; prior to or subsequent to the Minister's budget announcement &mdash; what are the Minister's intentions with regard to that interest?  I draw to the Minister's attention the fact that the <Col N="83" /> suggestion arising from his proposal would be that those for whom the Revenue Commissioners had to obtain warrants will now be exempt from interest whereas those people who brought their taxes up-to-date but who have not yet made interest payments &mdash; and who are now being billed for interest because they brought their taxes up-to-date &mdash; will have to make those interest payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I get the Deputy's point.  I understand he is talking of people whose cases have not been with the sheriff at all, people who have done their own business but who have not paid interest. If interest is being levied on them now even though all the capital &mdash; if one likes to call it such &mdash; all their tax due has been paid, then, as long as all of their taxes due under the terms of the incentive are paid, the interest will be waived in those cases.</P>

It appears from the inquiries they have made that there is a great deal of confusion in the Revenue Commissioners as to what approach they should adopt.  Will the Minister clarify for the Revenue Commissioners what approach is to be adopted in the context of such interest demands being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had done so in response to the Deputy's previous question.  I would hope that it would be operated accordingly by the Revenue Commissioners.  Even though what I say is correct, perhaps what the Deputy or some of his constituents say may be correct also, because perhaps there are further tax liabilities in relation to those cases in addition to the interest with which they have been levied and, therefore, they would not be entitled to a waiver of the interest.  That is the point. That is where the problem as regards <Col N="84" /> qualification under the incentive might arise.  Obviously, we all want to see clarification in relation to that matter, from the point of view of the individual taxpayer, the Exchequer and the operations of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Furthermore, will he agree that the Revenue Commissioners will rapidly find themselves before the courts if they go ahead with the collection of interest payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 19 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for the early retirement scheme was initially confined to persons working in areas where developments had made particular groups of staff surplus to the needs of the public service but was subsequently extended to the over-50s in most areas of the public service. Within these broad parameters it is a matter for local management in the first instance to determine how widely the terms of the scheme will be offered in particular organisations and the criteria to be applied in deciding whether or not to accept applications.</P>
      <P>The approach adopted in any particular area of the public service will depend on the circumstances of that area including the financial allocation within which they must operate and whether they have staff surplus to requirements. In the case of the Civil Service for which I have direct responsibility, the terms of the scheme allow local management to refuse applications from persons serving in key positions in their organisations.  In order to do so, however, they require the express approval of my Department.</P>
      <P>In considering proposals to refuse applications, the Department of Finance has regard to the following considerations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> (1)  Whether the grant of the application would reduce the strength of the cadre concerned to a non-viable level.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whether direct net Exchequer receipts would be put in jeopardy by the grant of the application.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whether public safety would be put at risk, or genuine hardship caused, by the grant of the application.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whether an applicant in a situation where one of the above criteria applies has specialist or technical qualifications and/or experience for which it is not feasible to compensate by redeployment.</P>
    <P>My Department are under instructions to facilitate applicants wherever possible. In pursuit of this policy, Departments wishing to refuse applications have, in many instances, been advised by my Department to defer doing so pending efforts to secure a replacement.</P>
    <P>Information on the numbers and categories of applications received in the public service is not available in my Department.  In relation to the number of people who have accepted the voluntary redundancy and early retirement terms, I am circulating a tabular statement showing the number of employees who have left under the scheme in 1987 and in 1988 to date, by sector, and the average costs involved for 1987.  Briefly, 1,135 employees left the public service &mdash; including local authorities &mdash; in 1987 at an average total severance cost of £10,182. Figures are not yet available on average annual pension entitlements for all of the sectors involved.  A further 1,611 employees have left in 1988 to date.  As I indicated in my Budget Statement last month, the redundancy terms will continue to be available during 1988.</P>

What justification does he see in paying a public servant 25 years accelerated pension, in advance, plus a lump sum and severance payment? It is nonsensical in terms of getting rid of thousands of public servants who could be doing their work normally in a productive way, contributing to the economy and to the public service instead of spending £80 million to £100 million on such ridiculous so-called redundancies.</P>

It is not on offer broadly across the Civil Service except for those over 50 years of age, about whom the Deputy was complaining previously.  If we do not get sufficient numbers, we will have to think about making the scheme available to people of 45 years of age.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance his views on the conclusion <Col N="94" /> of a media report (details supplied) to the effect that the national debt in 1986 was over-estimated by the following amounts due to the following factors: (i) by £530 million in respect of deposits held by the Exchequer in overseas banks which was included in the national debt, although not properly a debt at all (i) by £1,784 million in respect of amounts of loans raised by the local authorities by the local authorities loans funds which in turn raised the finance from general Exchequer borrowing which constituted double counting and (c) £857 million in respect of Government stock held by Government Departments themselves and hence money owed by the Government to itself and not properly debt; if he has revised the national debt figures in respect of any or all of these factors; and if he will give the current national debt, for the latest available date (a) without the exclusion of the above factors and (b) after exclusion of the above factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The national debt statement forms part of the Finance Accounts which are prepared annually on a gross accounting basis.  The total national debt figure in the statement as at 31 December 1986 (Account XXIV in the Finance Accounts) was not overestimated and valid comparisons with previous years' figures can be made.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to assume that the amounts on deposit outside the State do not properly constitute a debt.  It is also incorrect to assume that all stock shown in Central Bank statistics as held by Government Departments represents money owed by the Government to themselves.  A substantial amount of this stock is held by funds such as the Post Office Savings Bank fund where the liability is to depositors, not to the Government.  To the extent that assets were held against the amounts referred to at (a) and (c) of the question under reply, these were shown in the Statement of Capital Assets &mdash; under &ldquo;Proceeds of Foreign Borrowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;National Loans Sinking Funds&rdquo;&mdash; in Account XXVI of the 1986 Finance Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> With regard to the amounts raised by local authorities from the Local Loans Fund, I informed the House on 15 October, 1987 during the debate on the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill that there would be a technical accounting adjustment to the national debt figure following the enactment of that legislation.  This will result in the amounts previously shown by way of footnotes to the national debt statement being netted off within the statement itself and so reducing the total debt figure significantly.  It will be necessary to revise statements for previous years in order to maintain comparability between them.  As the national debt statement is being recast to cover the changes in the Local Loans Fund, my Department have been looking at the composition of other entries to see if a clearer picture of the position can be presented.  Departmental consideration of this matter is at an advanced stage and I would hope to be able to incorporate the changes in the presentation of the statement when the 1987 Finance Accounts are presented to the House before 30 June 1988.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing considerations, I do not consider it useful to give figures for the national debt on the basis suggested by the Deputy.  I would also like to reassure Deputies that if a different approach is taken to presenting the national debt for 1987, figures will also be prepared on the same basis for earlier years and quoted in the Finance Accounts for comparison purposes.</P>

In fact, it is money owed to the Government.  Why should that sum, put at £530 million by the economist who wrote the article in question, be included as debt?

Will he not agree that in respect of his personal finances he would not calculate his debts &mdash; if he had any which, hopefully, he has not &mdash; in this way?  He would not present them on a gross basis; he would take any money owing to him into account as long as that was capable of being quickly obtained. Will the Minister go a little further than simply asserting that this is the way it has always been done as if that was sufficient justification?  In regard to the £857 million in stocks held by Government Departments, will the Minister give an indication of how much of that is of the Post Office Savings Bank type, where there is a counterpart liability to the public, and how much of it represents money held by Government Departments solely for the purpose of dealing in stocks?</P>

That report refers to the debt stabilising at 163 per cent of GNP and I should like the Minister to clarify now, or subsequently, the yardstick he intends to use when referring to this in the future.  If the tables are corrected as a result of the Local Loans Fund Bill, 163 per cent of GNP falls down to something in the region of 140 per cent or 145 per cent.  If the tables are corrected fully in accordance with the suggestions Deputy Bruton is making, the debt stabilises at about 135 per cent of GNP.  We should all use the same yardstick when measuring progress.  There are three different sets of figures now for debt-GNP stabilisation depending on whether we are looking at the traditional tables of account, those that have been modified and will be further modified by the Minister from I May when the Local Loans Fund Bill is implemented by order, and the full rationalisation that Deputy Bruton has talked about has effect.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in reply to a previous parliamentary question which he put down on this subject, a considerable amount of work would be involved in the consolidation of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the related provisions of the 26 Finance Acts subsequently enacted.  A consolidation measure would also, ideally, embrace the capital gains tax and corporation tax legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in my Budget Statement of 27 January last I announced that the Government are undertaking a number of fundamental changes in tax assessment and collection procedures.  These changes include the introduction of key steps to facilitate the move towards a scheme of self-assessment, the integration of the collection of levies and PRSI from the self-employed into the new system, an incentive measure for taxpayers to bring their tax affairs up to date and important alterations in the corporation tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limited resources of the Revenue Commissioners are at present fully committed in the preparation of the legislative and administrative measures needed to implement these proposals, proposals which will require significant changes in procedures both for taxpayers and the Revenue authorities and which will constitute, perhaps, the most radical improvement in the administrative system since the introduction of PAYE nearly 30 years ago.  In these circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners have been unable to allocate the necessary senior staff to continue the work of consolidation and, accordingly, no commitment can be given as to when <Col N="99" /> the consolidated Bill is likely to be introduced.  In any event, the major changes to which I have already referred and which will be put in place over the next few years should be reflected in any legislation to consolidate the income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax provisions.  To attempt a meaningful consolidation while these changes are taking place &mdash; even if this were possible in the context of limited resources &mdash; would be premature.</P>

Will the Minister also agree that the changes he is proposing to make will create further difficulties in understanding the intricacies of the income tax code and that these changes make it even more urgent that a codified income tax law be published?  I would ask the Minister to give this matter considerable priority following the enactment of this year's Finance Act.</P>

One hundred and eight licensed premises were found to have these bogus spirits in stock.  The Minister will agree that these are highly dangerous to health and they were described by the managing director of Caldon Chemicals, who make vetichol, as an illicit and potentially harmful product.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline his policy in regard to the encouragement of mobility between the public and private sectors; the success or otherwise of his endeavours in this respect to date; and the logistics applying in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy is to encourage and support exchanges of staff between the public and private sectors. Since 1979 an agreed mobility scheme has been in operation to encourage temporary transfers between the Civil Service and the private sector.  Following contact with a wide range of companies and detailed discussions with some of them, exchanges have been arranged involving nine companies, six Departments and 16 personnel.</P>
      <P>The mobility scheme is designed to develop the individuals who take part, to provide and intake of special skills and to improve communication and understanding between the public sector and the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister wholeheartedly support mobility between the public and the private sectors and does he agree that the benefit to the public sector should at least partly increase productivity at all levels in the service and not just at the highest levels?  We have some instances in the public service where private enterprise has been introduced, for instance, in An Post and in An Bord Telecom, but that is only at the highest level.  Does the Minister agree that we should have exchange at very many levels before that?  Could the Minister name the Departments which were involved in the exchanges which have taken place to date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said.  The grades have been from AO and AP generally.  I am disappointed with the response from the private sector in relation to exchange.  I fully support the Deputy's view and I am doing my best to encourage exchange. The Departments concerned were the DPS, Finance, Communications, Tourism and Transport, Labour and Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that even if there has been a poor response from private industry, the response from the public service has been even poorer and that those who have <Col N="103" /> attempted to go on exchanges with the private sector have been prevented from doing so by their own Departments and that in cases where people applied they have been refused because there has not been enough staff in the Department? We know that that is not true.  Will the Minister agree that there was a poorer response in the public service than in the private sector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. There are thousands on career breaks of <Col N="104" /> one kind or another, some of whom have gone into jobs in the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the interest rate attaching to the loan of money from the Central Bank to finance the Government's redundancy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The money which the Central Bank has agreed to provide in respect of the funding of the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme is by way of an advance payment of surplus income to the Exchequer and not by way of a loan.  Thus the question of an interest rate attaching to the money does not arise.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House in answer to a question by Deputy Desmond on 9 December last, in the normal course the Exchequer receives from the Central Bank each year the surplus income earned by the bank in the previous year, less certain appropriations to the reserves of the bank.  Under the arrangements now agreed with the bank the Exchequer will receive in 1988, in addition to the normal payment of the surplus income from 1987, an advance payment out of the surplus the Central Bank will earn in 1988.  The additional surplus income from the Central Bank will come into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue in the normal way and has been included as such in the budgetary figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The advance by the Central Bank will be repaid.  Repayments will be financed out of the annual savings to the Exchequer from the redundancy programme.  Therefore, the exceptional lump-sum payments financed by the Central Bank will not increase the national debt or the cost of servicing it.  The repayments will take the form of four equal annual deductions by the Central Bank from the normal payments of surplus income for the years 1990 to 1993 inclusive.  This repayment period was agreed by the bank so as to allow the full impact of the savings to come through to the Exchequer and to ensure that realised savings are adequate to meet repayments to the bank.</P>
    <P>The bank also provided £8.4 million in 1987 to finance the lump-sum payments which arose last year under the scheme. Similar financing and repayment arrangements to those that I have already outlined, in respect of the 1988 Central Bank advances, will apply.  This amount has also been included as non-tax revenue in the outturn for the 1987 budgetary figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm whether this is a unique procedure or whether there are precedents in any previous administration?  In relation to the revenue from the Central Bank which would normally go to the Exchequer on the non-tax revenue side, is the Minister referring to a three year period and will <Col N="109" /> that leave a shortfall then in the non-tax revenue available to the Exchequer, and will there be tax implications in making up that shortfall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is the reason for the period from 1990 to 1993 &mdash; to allow a fund of savings to build up so that they can be repaid without additional taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Do I understand the Minister to say that the payroll savings which he thinks this redundancy scheme will throw up are going to be put in a special fund out of which the advances from the Central Bank will be repaid from 1990 to 1994?  I did not think there was any suggestion of this.  The Minister is presenting this as if there was going to be a special fund.  The Deputy is quite correct to say that the Minister is borrowing from the next administration, and whoever is in Government from 1990 to 1994 will have to find a significant amount of tax revenue to replace the profits which would normally come from the Central Bank to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say whether in the normal course of events this revenue would be available to the Exchequer from the non-tax side and <Col N="110" /> would be spent in the normal way?  If that is the case it will not be available between those years indicated.  There will be a shortfall in those years and there must be a tax implication to the Exchequer in that event.  How can the Minister argue otherwise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing on the basis of the savings that will accrue.  I will give an example.  A person on £20,000 a year last year will be on £10,000 this year because he is on pension, so that is £10,000 of a saving and so on.</P>

      <P>What was the Central Bank surplus for last year and what is the anticipated surplus for this year and if it is the Minister's contention that this is merely an advance payment of a surplus which would otherwise arise, to what extent was it understood that the Central Bank would in the course of 1988 have a surplus of £80 million?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will quantify in terms of Irish punts the savings which have accrued to the State with regard to the repayment of interest on dollar delineated loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind the effect on interest payments of the fall in the value of the dollar.</P>
      <P>The cost in Irish pound terms of paying interest on the Exchequer's dollar denominated debt during 1987 was about £10 million less than it would have been if the end-1986 Irish pound-dollar exchange rate had applied over the whole of 1987.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the full year effect on Exchequer interest payments of each one percentage point fall in the value of the dollar is somewhat less than £2 million.  Since the US dollar represented less than one quarter of the Exchequer's foreign debt, changes in other exchange rates have also to be taken into account. In 1987 the overall impact of exchange rate changes on the cost of servicing the Exchequer's foreign debt was a reduction of about £8 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give details of the report of the wildlife inspector who monitored the coursing meeting at Macroom, County Cork on 11 October 1987; the number of hares killed; his views on whether this is a satisfactory situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give details of the functions of forestry and wildlife officers when monitoring coursing meetings; the necessary procedures regarding the release of hares after coursing meetings; the evidence that is available that hares are actually released; if he will investigate whether or not these procedures were followed at the coursing meeting held in Blarney, County Cork on 13 October, 1987; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The coursing meeting at Macroom on 11 October 1987 was not attended by any officer of the Wildlife Service.</P>
      <P>The function of officers of the Wildlife Service when attending coursing meetings is to ensure compliance with the Wildlife Act, 1976, at regulated coursing matches held in accordance with the rules for such matches which are for the time being both published and approved by the Irish Coursing Club pursuant to the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.</P>
      <P>The official rules of the Irish Coursing Club do not contain any provisions in relation to the release of hares.  The formulation of these rules requires the consent of Bord na gCon as the ICC are subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that under the Wildlife Act, 1976 &mdash; I am quoting what the Minister said on 9 <Col N="113" /> December 1987, as recorded at column 1384 of the Official Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy, quotations at Question Time are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act provides that a report must be given to the wildlife section of a coursing meeting.  How can coursing meetings be monitored if officers in the wildlife section fail to attend the meetings?  Further, will the Minister agree that a letter from the Irish Embassy of 18 August 1987 to the World Society for the Protection of Animals &mdash; I can give the Minister a copy if he is not aware of it &mdash; states that the release of hares into the wild is strictly supervised by officers of the Forestry and Wildlife Service?  Can the Minister now confirm that that is not the case, that that does not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, the Deputy has referred to reports.  The fact that wildlife rangers did not attend one coursing meeting does not mean that there are not visits to coursing meetings and reports made available to the wildlife section of my Department. On the contrary, we attend as many as possible, taking into account the resources available and the multifunctional jobs that must be done by the wildlife rangers.  As regards the letter of 18 August, I do not know what Embassy the Deputy is talking about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the point, is the Minister's policy to ensure that hares once coursed are released into the wilds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> If his policy is to ensure that, what procedure does he use to ensure it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy is to ensure that wildlife are treated properly.  I do not lay down the rules under which coursing matches take place.  They are laid down by the Irish Coursing Club under the direction of Bord na gCon.  Specific rules and regulations pertaining to coursing are agreed between the Irish Coursing Club and Bord na gCon.  Those rules are published and available to the public, and I and my Department are satisfied that these rules are adhered to.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the report in <i>The Corkman</i> on 6 November 1987 in relation to the Macroom meeting about which I have a question down, the secretary of the Macroom Coursing Club admitted to re-coursing hares at that meeting, which was not, of course, attended by a wildlife officer? Is he aware of that statement, is he concerned at it, and what action does he intend to take in relation to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the statement.  I have not seen <i>The Corkman.</i> If the Deputy has any allegation or complaint he wishes to put forward to my Department I will be only too delighted to have it fully investigated.  Again I refer the Deputy to the rules which have been agreed and are laid down for the Irish Coursing Club under the Greyhound Industry Act and supervised by Bord na gCon.  I suggest that he study those rules <Col N="115" /> to see if there is any conflict in them and if he has a specific complaint I will have it fully investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have raised a number of points and the Minister has no knowledge of any of them, does he feel that his Department have not the resources to monitor coursing meetings? He is not aware of things that are a matter of public knowledge.  Will he try to make his endeavours in this regard a little more effective in future in the interests of wildlife, as he said he is concerned about it? Finally, what responsibility has the Minister regarding the implementation of the rules he wants me to study?  He is the Minister.  What responsibility has he in relation to ensuring that those rules are implemented properly?</P>

      <P>I presume the question relates to companies in State ownership who have share capital and whose structure would therefore facilitate the form of worker participation which the Deputy mentions.  At present, by far the greater part of the shares in all such public sector bodies are held either by myself or, a relevant Minister or by a ministerial nominee.  The transfer of such shareholdings to private ownership &mdash; whether <Col N="117" /> to employees or others &mdash; is not proposed at present and the question posed by the Deputy does not therefore immediately arise.  Should the situation in this regard change at any time in the future, the issue raised by the Deputy is obviously one which will be addressed.  Likewise in the case of statutory corporations without share capital: it would only be in the event of a restructuring which involved the introduction of share capital that the question of shareholding would arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together Questions Nos. 15 and 49 which is a priority question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> The national debt as of 31 December 1987 is provisionally estimated at £26,345 million, comprising £16,649 million of domestic debt and £9,696 million of foreign debt.  I have set out in a table, which I will circulate in the Official Report, details of the currency composition of the foreign debt as of 31 December 1987.  In accordance with normal practice I do not propose to publish a forecast of the national debt as at the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of servicing the national debt charged on Central Fund services in 1988 is £2,173 million and the comparable figure for 1987 was £2,091 million.</P>
    <P>The debt &mdash; GNP ratio at the end of 1987 is estimated to have been 151.6 per cent, as compared with 150.7 per cent at the end of 1986.  This increase is only a small fraction of the rate of increase in recent years and reflects the considerable progress already made in restoring balance to the public finances.  For example, during the five year period ending on 31 December 1986 the debt/GNP ratio grew at an annual average rate of over 11 percentage points.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the estimated rate of increase in the cost of servicing the national debt in 1988 is one of the smallest for many years.  Debt service payments, however, still constitute a heavy drain on the public finances and in 1988 will be the equivalent of 12.2 per cent of GNP as compared with 6.4 per cent ten years ago.  As a result there is no alternative to continuing with the present policy of reducing Exchequer spending and borrowing.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I will give the Deputy a tabular statement in relation to the breakdown of the debt.  I have this information; nobody is trying in any way to keep from the House or the public the position that will pertain after the Local Loans Fund issue.  I will take the figures for 1985 and 1986.  It was 150.7 per cent of GNP at the end of 1986 and 133.2 per cent of GNP at the end of 1985.  As I said in my reply, that was up to 151.6 per cent at the end of 1987.  Adjusted for changes in the Local Loans Fund, for 1985 the figure goes from 133.2 per cent down to 123 per cent and the 150.7 per cent becomes 139.6 per cent.</P>

This assurance was given by me and is reflected in the proposed changes in the corporation tax code announced in my Budget Statement of 27 January last, specifically as regards group relief.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 24 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>In her announcement to which the Deputy refers, the Minister of State for European Affairs stated that:</P>
      <P>in order to ensure that Ireland would avail of European Community funding possibilities to the maximum possible extent under the new approach set out in recent proposals under the EC Commission's `Delors Plan', the Government has decided to move towards a programme basis for applications for assistance from the Community's development or Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State went on to say that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the Commission proposals are still under way in the Council of Ministers and for this and other reasons, the final position in regard to programmes and their shape and content remains unclear.  The preparation of programmes for a number of areas would provide an opportunity, with the assistance of the Commission, to establish the requirements for the contents of programmes and how best to go about the task of <Col N="128" /> drawing them up and implementing them, as the future regime became clearer with the movement of the current negotiations towards a conclusion.</P>
    <P>While last week's European Council decided on some of the major issues, other detailed provisions have still to be laid down in the implementing regulations.  We are therefore moving forward against a background of some uncertainty.</P>
    <P>As of now, preparatory work has commenced in connection with the proposed programme for Dublin, and a steering committee has been established under the chairmanship of my Department to oversee this programme.  This committee includes representatives of the relevant Government Departments, the city and county manager of Dublin, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Commission of the European Communities. The relevant State-sponsored bodies will also be represented as appropriate.  The committee is at present drawing up detailed terms of reference for the preparatory study for the proposed programme.</P>
    <P>Subject to the outcome of the continuing negotiations, it is proposed to adopt organisational structures similar to those established for the Dublin programme for all future programmes of this type.</P>
    <P>The Government have not yet taken a decision on the other areas to be the subject of a programme approach. However, it is envisaged that eventually Irish requests for aid from the European Community's structural funds will be predominantly on a programme basis that will cover all areas of the State.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the view of Comhdháil na nOileán that the islands should be treated as one region in this connection. I might mention that the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, who are respectively Chairman and Secretary of the Ministerial Committee on off-shore Islands, are today meeting representatives of Comhdháil na nOileán.  I can assure the Deputy that the views <Col N="129" /> expressed by an Comhdháil will be fully considered when the Government consider this issue further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Can I take it from the Minister's reply that his Department intend to have an integrated regional policy for the whole country and that he has not yet delineated the areas and he is going to use the Dublin model as the basis for the integration around the country?  Is that the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the basis of any future programme rather than, as has been the case, as the Deputy knows from his former days as Minister, on a project basis.  That does not rule out the possibility of presentations for assistance for projects, but it will be predominantly programmes in the future as soon as all of the procedures are worked out in Europe.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Anglo-Irish Relations:" RHead="Motion (Resumed.)">
    <Title>Anglo-Irish Relations: Motion (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach today:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of recent developments affecting Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations and reaffirms its determination to take any and all action necessary to ensure the full use of the procedures and structures set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to secure the achievement of the goals of that Agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>1.  &ldquo;deplores the present state of Anglo-Irish relations.  Dáil Éireann considers that the failure of the British Government to institute prosecutions on foot of the Stalker/Sampson report brings the British legal system into disrepute and is completely unacceptable. Dáil Éireann also rejects any intention to make the Prevention of Terrorism Act a permanent feature of British law. Dáil Éireann calls on the British Government to exercise its powers of clemency in relation to the Birmingham Six.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann reaffirms its rejection of armed terrorism, and its commitment to the highest level of cross-Border security.  In this connection, <Col N="179" /> Dáil Éireann calls on both the Irish and British Governments to ensure that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 is operated effectively, and that any difficulties of understanding or interpretation are resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reassess its approach to negotiations with the British authorities on these issues.  All future negotiations should take place against the background of an intensive diplomatic campaign aimed at ensuring that our position is understood by those countries which are both supportive of Ireland's interests and influential with Britain.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann further resolves that in the current situation it is of critical importance that the Inter-governmental Conference should resume its effective role as provided for in Article 2 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and that consideration must be given to removing future negotiation on the issues mentioned in this resolution, and those alone, from the framework of the Inter-Governmental Conference, in order to protect the Conference from becoming embroiled in the existing impasse.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann reaffirms its commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement as the best available vehicle for the resolution of differences between the two Governments in relation to the Government and administration of Northern Ireland, and the reconciliation of the rights and identities of the two communities in Northern Ireland.  Further real progress in improving the relations between the two communities cannot be advanced without purposeful and committed dialogue being commenced between diverse political leaders of democratic Parties in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  Dáil Éireann resolves that an unequivocal and open offer of such dialogue should be extended to all political leaders who have rejected violence <Col N="180" /> as a solution in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Spring.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only once during the past year intervened in debates in this House.  I have decided, however, to do so again on this occasion because of the gravity of the issues at stake.</P>
      <P>I believe that it is of vital importance to this State that we approach these matters in a calm and dispassionate way.  I regret that the part of the Minister for Communication's speech that I heard in this House this morning sounded far from dispassionate.  I do not believe that it is of any advantage to us that a member of the Government dealing with this issue should use such emotive, and even in Britain, sinisterly evocative phrases as &ldquo;our patience is not unlimited&rdquo;.  Our objective here should be to concentrate on ensuring that any actions taken following the events that have given rise to this debate will be in the best interests of the security of the State, and peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>These events began with three shooting incidents involving the security forces in Northern Ireland &mdash; one at least of which involved cross-Border activities by members of the Special Branch of the RUC.</P>
      <P>The fact that these three incidents occurred in quick succession and were neither preceded nor followed by similar incidents provides <i>prima facie</i> evidence that they involved a temporary change of tactics on the part of elements in the RUC.  As Mr. Stalker has said, these events do not necessarily imply a &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; policy decision at the top level of the RUC or at a higher level.  They are, as he has suggested, explicable in terms of a change of tactics, involving the &ldquo;hyping up&rdquo; of those concerned in the face of the IRA's and the INLA's policy of murder directed against the majority community in Northern Ireland, through attacks on members and ex-members of the security forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These events, however, cannot be dismissed, as some people in Northern <Col N="181" /> Ireland have attempted to do, by suggesting they are simply accidents attributable to nervousness on the part of RUC officers in the face of this campaign.  Such an explanation is not compatible either with the quick succession of these incidents and their equally sudden cessation, nor with the subsequent cover-up within the RUC.  If these events had been accidental, as in some other cases in the past, information about them would have been furnished to the DPP who would have decided whether to prosecute or not, and if a prosecution were initiated, the question of the degree of culpability, if any, would have been determined in the normal way by the courts.</P>
    <P>The fact that this normal process was not followed but that, with the involvement of people higher up in the RUC than those directly concerned, it was decided to initiate a conspiracy of silence involving large scale perjury, makes it clear that more was involved here than a regrettable series of accidents.</P>
    <P>There followed, after a long period of time, the Stalker inquiry, and later the removal of Mr. Stalker from that investigation, and the appointment of Mr. Sampson to continue his work.  Few people now believe that Mr. Stalker's removal was occasioned by the sudden emergence of evidence of malpractices on his part within the Manchester Police Force.  The subsequent course of the investigation into Mr. Stalker, and its outcome, makes such an explanation credible only to the prejudiced or naïve.</P>
    <P>But, equally, some of the theories that have been propounded to explain his removal from the case, in my view also, lack credibility.  It is frankly very hard to believe that the Inspectorate of the Constabulary of the United Kingdom could be moved into action of this kind simply by pressure from the RUC to abort or divert the investigation into the events of 1982.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, on the British Government's own statements, the then Attorney General of England and Wales and Northrn Ireland, was in fact involved in this decision.  It seems that Mr. Stalker's insistence on pursuing his investigations <Col N="182" /> at the highest levels in the RUC in the spring of 1986 created grave alarm in other circles as to the capacity of the RUC, if this investigation were pursued in a manner Mr. Stalker proposed, to deal effectively with the problem posed by the Loyalist marches and demonstrations then envisaged for the summer months immediately ahead.  It is not difficult to imagine someone, somewhere, deciding at that moment that the interests of Northern Ireland and indeed of Ireland as a whole, and of Great Britain would be best served if in some way the investigation into the events of 1982 could be diverted or strung out, something which Mr. Stalker himself refused to contemplate.  If this was in fact the scenario then we would have to face the brutal fact that maybe we in this island, North and South, have been the principal beneficiaries of the clumsy, and possibly panicky actions, which have had the effect of leading to Mr. Stalker's retirement from the police force and which have been the source of so much agony to himself and his family.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to believe that it was not the intention of the British Government during this period to abort, as distinct from postponing, prosecutions of members of the RUC involved in the events of 1982.  The assurance we received from a high political source as late as towards the end of 1986 by way of explanation for the non-publication of the Stalker report, namely, that there would be prosecutions involving senior RUC officers for serious criminal offences, was, I believe, given in good faith.  So also, I believe, were earlier assurances that when the investigation was completed we would be given a full report on the circumstances of the cross-border incursion, or incursions, that had been revealed in court during a murder trial arising from the events of 1982.</P>
    <P>What is not explicable, however, and has not been explained, is the decision of the present Attorney-General of England and Wales &mdash; and, because of direct rule, of Northern Ireland &mdash; in relation to these prosecutions.  If I am right in speculating that at the time the decision <Col N="183" /> to remove Mr. Stalker from the investigation was taken the intention was to postpone or string out the investigation rather than to abort it, and if I am right in my assumption that the assurances given to us at a high political level that prosecutions would ensue was genuine, then it has to be said that Mr. Mayhew's decision was totally out of line with all this.  That his decision did not reflect the earlier intentions of the British Government is also suggested by the fact that, if it had been intended all along to use the Attorney General's power of superintendence over the DPP in Northern Ireland to abort prosecutions, the decision involving the then Attorney-General to remove Mr. Stalker in the spring of 1986 would scarcely have been necessary.  For, given the manner in which this affair has in fact been strung out over a period of more than five years, it would seem that, even if his investigation had gone ahead in the spring of 1986, its consequences could have been postponed until well after the summer of that year and the power of superintendence of the Attorney-General could then have been invoked at a later stage, as it has in fact been by Mr. Mayhew.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, therefore to avoid the conclusion that we are now faced with the consequences &mdash; and they are serious consequences for this island &mdash; of muddle and confusion within the British Government.  I do not believe that we would have been given the assurance we were if at that time it had been contemplated that the power exercised by Mr. Mayhew would be used in the way in which it has been.</P>
    <P>It seems, moreover, that whoever Mr. Mayhew may have consulted, his decision was not communicated to or discussed by the British Cabinet, and there have been some circumstantial press reports, which I for one am inclined to credit, that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was given only minimal notice of this decision as, it has been suggested, was the Foreign Office. Apparently in consequence of this, but <Col N="184" /> also because this Government do not appear to have kept in touch with this matter through the Conference as our Government had done, the Irish Government received no advance warning of this decision, never mind an opportunity to discuss, through the Conference framework, the implications of the decision for confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It would thus seem that Mr. Mayhew, in exercising his function of superintendence of the DPP in Northern Ireland, totally failed to take account of the British Government's obligations under the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; of which he, as a law officer of the Crown, was one of the guardians.  Furthermore, it would appear that his concept of the public interest was so narrowly defined as to conflict most dangerously with the broader public interest of peace and stability in Northern Ireland, which ought, surely, to be the overriding interest of the British Government, as it consistently has been of the Irish Government.  There is also another public interest which Mr. Mayhew has not take into account &mdash; the public interest in the maintenance of confidence and trust between the British and Irish Governments, which has been put seriously at risk by his decision to falsify assurances given to the Irish Government in relation to these prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Faced with the serious damage which Mr. Mayhew's decision has inflicted on the public interest in peace and stability in Northern Ireland and on the maintenance and enhancement of confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, as well as on the public interest in the maintenance of confidence and trust between the British and Irish Governments, the British Government now have a duty to do all in their power to minimise the damage done and to restore the confidence that has thus been undermined.  Both Governments have a duty to give absolute priority in present circumstances to their common interest in securing the people of Ireland, North and South, against the threat of terrorism which has been so grievously heightened <Col N="185" /> by the massive delivery of arms and explosives from Libya to the IRA and from Libya, or wherever else it is, to the Protestant terrorists.</P>
    <P>For their part, the British Government must take immediate action to remove from the RUC the officers responsible for a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, the retention of whom in that force is incompatible with confidence by anyone in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I noted the statement of the Secretary of State in the Commons an hour ago announcing that Chief Constable Charles Kelly would investigate the cases involving people of the rank of Chief Superintendent and below and referring to the police authority in Northern Ireland on the question of whether there was an involvement of people higher up.  I regret that the method that the British Government have felt necessary to adopt involves a further delay in dealing with this matter.  The decision, which was simply one of referring it to somebody else, could have been done a long time ago.  The delay might have suggested that immediate action was going to be taken, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The British Government should also take immediate action to reform the structure of the RUC so as to ensure that never again can a unit of that force, acting independently of other law-abiding units be free to undertake the kind of activities which became the subject of a cover-up within the force since 1982.  The Secretary of State also referred to this in his speech. I have not had the opportunity of becoming aware of what he has said in this matter, so that I cannot comment further on it at the moment.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is worth remarking that during 1986, as part of the programme of work for the enhancement of cross-Border co-operation on security matters set in hand by the Conference under article 9(a) of the agreement, consideration was given by us to suggestions in relation to the organisation and work of the Garda Síochána.  We took into account suggestions made, most of which <Col N="186" /> appeared constructive, and gave effect to all but one of these.</P>
    <P>The exception was a proposal that would have introduced into our force a separation of function and responsibility in respect of certain matters at local level which, although quite different from that which gave rise to the incidents of 1982 in Northern Ireland, would have created dangers for the coherent operation of the force in areas near the Border.  We not only rejected this proposal but suggested, in turn, that our system, under which responsibility for all police activity in a given area is under the control of a single officer, should be introduced in the RUC. I trust that the British Government, in the light of the bitter experience of the events of five years ago, will now give effect to this suggestion, which we are entitled to pursue under this article of the Agreement, just as, through the channels of the Conference, questions relating to the organisation and work of the Garda Síochána were raised with us and we responded positively, except in this instance here, to the suggestions made. It is equally our right, and I feel our duty, to make similar proposals, through the Conference, in relation to the organisation and work of the RUC.</P>
    <P>The British Government should also take this opportunity to review other matters arising from the agreement. These include, first, the full implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 8 of the communique accompanying the agreement, which involved ensuring as rapidly as possible that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community, namely, the accompaniment of British Army and UDR patrols by the RUC; secondly, further consideration of the courts system, including the mixed-court concept referred to in article 8 of the agreement itself and, thirdly the publication of the code of conduct that was promulgated some time ago for the RUC, in accordance with paragraph 8b of the communique, as well as the promulgation of a similar code of conduct for the other <Col N="187" /> security forces.  An early timetable for the implementation of the anti-discrimination legislation by parliament should also be furnished to the Irish Government.  There is no shortage of matters that the British Government should take in hand at present with a view to undoing the damage done by recent events.</P>
    <P>Finally they must also fulfil their obligation and their commitment to the Irish Government to furnish them with a full account of the cross-Border violation or violations revealed in court.  I am not convinced that the Government have given sufficient emphasis to this matter at recent meetings of the Conference. The Government at this time have to face the reality that demands for a reconsideration of the Attorney General's decision regarding the Stalker-Sampson report are unrealistic and that attempts to press this issue at this stage, however strong the temptation may be to take this approach, can only prove counter productive.</P>
    <P>Another quite different matter has surfaced in the last couple of days, that is, the issue of the implementation of extradition.  It would be quite simply intolerable if people against whom there is evidence, and who might on trial be convicted of crimes of violence committed in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, should be allowed to continue to remain at liberty in this country, constituting a further threat to the lives of people in this State, in Northern Ireland or in Britain.</P>
    <P>Given the concern already felt here about the action of the Attorney-General of England and Wales and Northern Ireland in relation to the decision not to prosecute arising from the Stalker-Sampson inquiry, there is bound to be concern at the suggestion that the same Attorney-General has, by neglect of the legal process, inhibited the prosecution of suspected terrorists here.  But there must also be concern that the initial negative reaction of Mr. Mayhew to operating the law on extradition has been compounded by an apparent failure on the <Col N="188" /> part of our Attorney-General and our Government to respond over a number of weeks to a request from the British side for a meeting to discuss this matter, a discussion which appears most urgent, with a view to resolving this impasse, for which our Government appear to share responsibility.</P>
    <P>In this connection I note the Taoiseach's rider to his complaint about Mr. Mayhew's attitude to our extradition legislation, namely, that he was giving a solemn assurance that the new Act will be strictly adhered to and the safeguards in it fully implemented by the Attorney-General acting effectively.  This part of the Taoiseach's statement involves such a degree of adjectival and adverbial emphasis as to raise doubts in the mind of some of his listeners as to his intentions, doubts not totally stilled by his subsequent expression of concern about extradition remaining inoperative.  I hope the Minister for Justice can reassure us on the Government's intentions on extradition when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>Above all the Government have to repudiate any idea of weakening North-South security co-operation.  On the basis of their own statements about the scale of the importation of arms and explosives in recent times, and the arms finds already made by the Garda Síochána and the finds of bunkers, empty unfortunately, it is clear that this island now faces a greater threat to peace and stability than we have known for a long time past.  It is a threat which can be met only by the closest possible co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the RUC which, indeed, there is reason to believe has already been productive in terms of arms finds.</P>
    <P>An Irish Government who did anything whatever to weaken security co-operation on this island would deserve, and would be the object of, the contempt of our people if, as is morally certain would be the case, such a decision contributed to the loss of lives on either side of the Border.  An island that has already suffered 2,650 deaths, almost all of them <Col N="189" /> at the hands of or provoked by the activities of, paramilitaries, and a State whose security forces have already suffered significant losses at the hands of the IRA and INLA, does not need, nor will it tolerate, any other kind of Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable to me that any responsible Government of this State could adopt a suicidal policy of making it easier for those who have murdered so many people on this island and in Britain to multiply their efforts in the months ahead.  The preservation of national security and of lives are the first duties of any Irish Government, to which nothing else may ever be given precedence.</P>
    <P>It is true, tragically true, that the decision, the consequences of which we are discussing here today, has reduced confidence in the administration of justice, and in the security forces in Northern Ireland.  Our task in the face of such a situation must, however, be to seek urgently and with dedication to undo the damage that has thus been done unthinkingly to the security of the people of this island and under no circumstances perversely to aggravate this damage by making it easier for those who have murdered so many people on this island to take advantage of the situation thus created.</P>
    <P>The tone of one paragraph of the Taoiseach's speech gives rise to some concern in this context, that is, the paragraph in which he speaks of the importance of not allowing the Garda Síochána's asset of virtual total community support to be endangered.  No one, of course, could fault the sentiment itself but the manner in which the point is made and the particular emphasis given to it, together with the subsequent comment about the impossibility of compelling one force to have confidence in another or to give that full measure of confidential co-operation which should exist, is capable of being interpreted as a hint about the Garda Síochána being capable of being damaged by too close co-operation with the RUC. The Minister for Justice must repudiate this interpretation unambiguously in his <Col N="190" /> reply.  There must be no ambiguity whatsoever on this issue from an Irish Government addressing the Parliament of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach outlined to the House this morning the firm stand taken by the Government on what can only be described as a most extraordinary and unacceptable decision by the British authorities to cover up the most serious issues raised by the Stalker-Sampson report.  I think it is useful to remind ourselves just how serious those issues were which prompted the investigation by Mr. Stalker and later by Mr. Sampson.  Concern has been expressed throughout Ireland and internationally and I would like to say a word on the situation that prevailed in 1982.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Border region in the latter half of 1982 was one of insecurity and fear with serious allegations that the RUC had adopted a deliberate shoot-to-kill policy.  Six people were shot dead, and one seriously injured in three separate incidents in County Armagh during November and December of that year. On 11 November, Eugene Toman, Gervaise McKerr and Seán Burns were shot dead at a road-block near Lurgan.  Less than two weeks later, on 24 November, again near Lurgan, Michael Tighe, a 17 year old youth, was shot dead and his friend, Martin McCauley, was seriously injured.  Shortly after this on 12 December both Séamus Grew and Roddy Carroll were shot dead near Armagh.  The RUC were involved in all three incidents. Five of the men were unarmed when they were shot while in the case of the 17 year old, Michael Tighe, and his friend, Martin McCauley, the circumstances were such as to indicate that unusable firearms may have been planted in the hayshed where they were shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three court cases resulted from these incidents.  During these trials, further evidence came to light which caused deep concern and unease among people on both sides of the Border.  During the trial of Constable Robinson for the murder of Séamus Grew, it emerged that several of <Col N="191" /> the shots which had killed Mr. Grew had been fired from a distance of less than three feet.  Constable Robinson in his evidence pointed to the existence of a cover-up by the RUC on the entire affair designed to conceal the fact that members of the RUC Special Branch had been operating illegally in this State on the night of 12 December 1982.  The trial of Martin McCauley provided evidence that RUC officers had lied in their statements and they in turn claimed that this had been on orders from &ldquo;higher up&rdquo;. The conduct of these trials was certainly less than satisfactory.  In one case the court judged that Constable Robinson had been firing in self defence.  It will be recalled that Constable Robinson had emptied his magazine into a car of unarmed men, had reloaded and continued to fire into the car.  The comments by Justice McDermott and by the late Lord Justice Gibson during these trials gave cause for considerable alarm.  The entire affair proved to be so insidious that the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Barry Shaw, requested an inquiry into the entire affair.  The results of the RUC investigation were not satisfactory and a full investigation was requested to be carried out by Mr. John Stalker, then Deputy Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police.  I think many Members of the House here today will have read Mr. Stalker's extraordinary account of his investigation and of what appears to have been an organised attempt to frustrate its successful conclusion.  The circumstances surrounding his removal from that investigation and his replacement by Mr. Colin Sampson appears to have been a murky affair indeed.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding these shootings, the extraordinary and bizarre circumstances surrounding, first, the investigation by the RUC and then the subsequent investigations by Mr. Stalker and Mr. Sampson, leave a whole host of questions to be answered.</P>
    <P>However, as is clear from recent events, none of these questions is going to be answered by the British Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> What is at stake here &mdash; among many other things &mdash; is the fundamental concept of the primacy of the rule of law. The notion that those charged with the guardianship of that law can in any circumstances be above it themselves has the most frightening and far-reaching implications.  The question arises, for instance, as to where this ends.  Does it mean that the same could happen again? If a similar incident were to take place again would the policemen involved be entitled to regard that, in the public interest, they should be immune from prosecution, and thus above the law? What kind of a signal does all this give to a police force operating in what everybody agrees is an extremely hazardous situation?  What attitude can one expect of the community being served by such a police force?  Can one realistically speak of public confidence in such a situation? Can they expect that a cover-up story will be fabricated to assist their escape from the due process of the law?  Is in any wonder that this entire affair has shaken public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and indeed has caused deep concern among the British public and among human rights commentators throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I think every Member of this House will appreciate the depth of feeling which this decision has aroused, particularly in the Border areas.  The people in the Border regions have lived for over 60 years with the effects of Partition which has done untold economic damage to communities on each side of this artificial barrier.  In more recent times, the campaigns of the paramilitaries have led to a further deterioration in the economic life of the Border regions and, more important, have engendered deep feelings of insecurity and fear, particularly for those living in isolated areas.  The implication arising from the entire Stalker-Sampson affair that the Six County forces of law and order could have descended to the level of the paramilitaries in their campaign of violence has served to further heighten fears and uncertainty to a new level in the region.</P>
    <P>The paramilitaries act with no normal <Col N="193" /> human constraints.  We only have to see their acts of barbarity of the type we saw recently in Enniskillen or here in the South during the O'Grady kidnap.  The only constraint which operates is the constraint imposed by the security forces North and South of the Border.  Both the Irish and British Governments agree that co-operation between these forces is essential if we are ever to defeat the men of violence.</P>
    <P>Indeed the British Government have been particularly forceful on this point and have, in recent times, been full of praise for the spirit of co-operation between the security forces on both sides of the Border.  But the success of the security forces is based on public confidence.  Without public trust and confidence they will be denied information and without mutual confidence between the two forces, co-operation will be inhibited.  This is not to imply any change in Government policy on security co-operation.  What I am stating is a simple fact which must be clear to any observer.</P>
    <P>In the light of this, I find the decision of the British Government on the Stalker-Sampson report totally inexplicable. They have, at one stroke, severely undermined public confidence in their own security forces.  I think we all know the unfortunate legacy of the RUC which must naturally inspire mistrust among Nationalists, particularly in the Six Counties.  That legacy cannot be ignored; it must be faced up to fairly and squarely if the RUC are ever to be an acceptable police force for Northern Nationalists.</P>
    <P>It serves no useful purpose to pretend that this legacy does not exist or to brush uncomfortable or inconvenient facts under the carpet.  This does a serious disservice to the many men in the RUC who have been making real efforts in recent years to try to implement a policy of even-handed and impartial policing. One wonders what these men feel now about this decision.  Are they to be tarred with the same brush in order to protect some undesirables in the force?</P>
    <P>Whatever public interest was involved in arriving at this decision, it would certainly not appear to include the best <Col N="194" /> interests of the RUC.  The decision has, to my mind, only served to give a shot in the arm to the men of violence, has undermined confidence in the security forces in the Six Counties and has further heightened feelings of fear and insecurity in the Border area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach this morning gave a clear account of the discussions which the Government have had with the British Government in recent weeks.  I think it will be clear to all in this House that it is now for the British Government to redress this deplorable situation which they themselves have created.  The decisiion of the British Government not to proceed with prosecutions arising from the Stalker-Sampson report, not to publish the report, not to provide information as to the reasons for the decision not to prosecute in the public interest, has grave implications for public confidence in the administration of justice in the Six Counties and for cross-Border security co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that there was no prior consultation with the Government of our own sovereign nation.  The absence of any prior consultation is contrary to the spirit as well as the letter of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which provides in Article 5 that &ldquo;the Conference shall concern itself with measures ... to protect human rights&rdquo;; it provides in Article 7 that &ldquo;the Conference shall consider security policy and relations between the security forces and the community&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Conference shall consider the security situation at its regular meetings and thus provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events; and provides in Article 8 that &ldquo;the Conference shall deal with issues of concern to both countries relating to the enforcement of criminal law...&rdquo; and that &ldquo;...the two Governments agree on the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice&rdquo;.  We have a vital interest in the matters considered by the Attorney General and we have a formal right to be consulted.</P>
    <P>If the British Attorney General had argued that it was purely a judicial <Col N="195" /> decision then perhaps there could be some debate on the issue but he stated that it was in the public interest and for security reasons that the Stalker-Sampson report was not being published.  I can see no judicial justification for this decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes questioned the wisdom of the Birmingham Six case being raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Obviously the decision in that case has implications for extradition.  I believe the Birmingham Six are innocent and this belief has been reinforced by the many eminent people involved over a number of years in the prison service who have expressed the same opinion.  It appears that their conviction was based on very faulty evidence.  Many witnesses who gave evidence at the first trial were discredited at the recent appeal.  I would also comment on the lack of sensitivity in the presentation of the result of that appeal which showed a total lack of any feeling or any sensitivity in Britain towards the Irish.  Of course, that is nothing new because we witnessed it four years ago when the Gillespie sisters, who had served ten years of a sentence when their father died, were denied the right to attend their father's funeral even though they had only six weeks left of their prison sentence.  This is an indication of discrimination against Irish prisoners in the UK.</P>
    <P>The men are appealing to the House of Lords and if that appeal is unsuccessful the British Government have a wide range of options open to them to dispel the negative effect which this case has had on public confidence in British justice.  It is of note that the Appeal Court has traditionally been very reluctant to act positively when the Home Secretary has referred other cases to it.  In the seventies, in the case of Cooper and McMahon, successive Home Secretaries referred the case no less than four times to the Court of Appeal.  The court declined to reverse the convictions and the Home Secretary finally took the action of releasing the men in 1980.</P>
    <P>The British Government, through <Col N="196" /> their decision on the Stalker-Sampson inquiry, have seriously undermined public confidence in the administration of justice in the Six Counties, seriously damaged relations between the security forces and the Nationalist community, cast a shadow over the good co-operation which has been developing between the police forces on this island, and acted contrary to the spirit and letter of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  As I have said, it is for the British Government to take the necessary measures to put matters right.</P>
    <P>The British have indicated that they will implement some limited measures &mdash; disciplinary action against certain RUC officers, reorganisation of the force to prevent any recurrence, a detailed report on the incursion of 12 December, etc. These do not represent a satisfactory response.  The problem is of the British Government's making and they should respond further.</P>
    <P>The implication which arises for cross-Border security is not caused by any change in Irish Government policy.  We remain fully committed to cross-Border security.  We will co-operate in the fight against crime and subversion.  We will continue to determine our security requirements in the interests of everyone in this State and indeed on this island, as was stated by the Taoiseach this morning. The danger posed by the British Government's decision to such co-operation is specifically in its effect on the trust and confidence which the Garda Síochána can now feel in the RUC &mdash; a force which has suffered much at the hands of men of violence and which has been making efforts to win confidence and trust in recent years.  The decision is a blow to the efforts which were being made by the RUC.  Many RUC men resent this elaborate and continuing cover-up and would welcome publication of the report and a clearing of the air.</P>
    <P>These events completely justify the Government's decision to introduce safeguards into our extradition arrangements with Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Government remain committed to the implementation of extradition in the <Col N="197" /> fight against all types of crime but the British Government must comply with the new safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Terrorism Act, seen by many to discriminate against the Irish, is to be made permanent.  In my view that further erodes any confidence in the desire of the British Government to seek a political solution to the serious problem obtaining on this island.  It is counter-productive to arrest a number of people, to detain them for up to seven days and then release the vast majority of them without bringing any charge whatsoever. I might quote some figures in this respect. For example, in 1976 1,066 people were arrested of whom 986 were released without any charge whatsoever.  In 1980, 537 people were arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 450 or whom were released without any charge whatsoever.  In 1986 there were 147 people arrested of whom 109 were released without any charge whatsoever.  It is my belief that the continuance of the Prevention of Terrorism Act is totally counter-productive and is only playing into the hands of the men of violence.</P>
    <P>It is my view also that the British wanted security only from the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We can witness the increasing evidence of the security &mdash; again counter-productive &mdash; in the number of troops now placed in South Armagh while no efforts have been made to deal with the issues undermining confidence, such as the RUC, the UDR and the Diplock courts.  Those are the issues that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach was the first Taoiseach, in 1980, to raise the issue of the Six Counties to inter-governmental level.  Since assuming office one year ago he has dealt with the affairs of Northern Ireland with fairness and responsibility, particularly in relation to the problems that have arisen recently, and has behaved in a statesmanlike manner.  We are fortunate at present to have a man with his insight into the position to deal with what is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>The issues involved were put to the British Government and have been enumerated many times.  These are, first, <Col N="198" /> that the Stalker-Sampson report be published; second, that the decision not to prosecute RUC officers identified in that report &mdash; against whom there is evidence of wrong-doing &mdash; should be explained and the decision reconsidered; third, there must be a response on the absence of consultation within the Anglo-Irish Conference prior to the announcement by the United Kingdom Attorney General that there would be no prosecutions in the public interest; fourth, that a full report should be provided on the covert operation by members of the Northern Ireland security forces in our jurisdiction on the night of 12 December 1982; fifth, that the trust and confidence which must exist between the two police forces engaged in security co-operation has been seriously damaged; sixth, that the Home Secretary should consider the use of the wide-ranging powers available to him in regard to the Birmingham Six case and, lastly, that there be an awareness of the importance for extradition in the handling of the Stalker-Sampson affair and the Birmingham Six case.  We can add to that our concern about the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  There is now an obligation on the British Government to make a positive response.</P>

      <P>Of the several matters the Taoiseach mentioned in his opening remarks this morning there was one in which he merely hinted a dissatisfaction but expressed no definite or explicit complaint about it, that was the matter arising from the Appeal Court hearing in London in regard to the Birmingham Six case.  I do not want to waste time on the question of whether it is proper for a Government by merely mentioning something or hinting dissatisfaction but without explaining just exactly what their dissatisfaction consists of, to leave the thing hanging in the air.  But, since the Taoiseach left it hanging in the air, I do not propose to advert to this matter at all.  I intend to deal only with the other three matters with which he did deal, namely, the British Prevention of Terrorism Act &mdash; about which the Minister opposite has just been speaking &mdash; the <Col N="199" /> report of the Stalker-Sampson investigation, associated question of the role of the British Attorney General and the difficulties which have arisen over the Extradition (Amendment) Act of last year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, it is very important for this House and Government to bear in mind a simple rule of advocacy which I learned when I went to the Bar 30 years ago.  It is this: if you have two points, one a good strong point and the other a weak one, leave one outside the court, do not bring it in with you because, in advancing a weak point and in seeing it discredited, you will merely drag down your good point also.  It is not simply out of a desire to do justice to the British as well as to everybody else, although even the British are entitled to justice, it is not simply out of a desire for that but out of a desire also that the legitimate concerns and complaints of the Irish Government &mdash; those which this House in general supports &mdash; should get due regard and should have, if possible, success that I have urged the Government not to make a meal out of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I consider that the United Kingdom, like ourselves, like any other sovereign state, is fully entitled to take whatever measures it thinks fit, whenever it likes. Provided they are in conformity with fundamental European acceptance of the idea of human rights, the rule of law, it is fully entitled to protect itself and its people against terrorism.  In fact, a Government in any country in the world are not doing their duty unless they take whatever measures they think fit &mdash; within the four corners of human rights &mdash; in order to protect their people.  We must acknowledge that right in other countries, just as we expect them to acknowledge it in us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acts of terrorism have been perpetrated on the soil of the neighbouring island, not just by Irish groups but by others as well.  Nevertheless, the Irish connection alone amounts to a frightful record.  Merely from my memory &mdash; and I am certainly forgetting some episodes <Col N="200" />&mdash; let me remind the House of the Birmingham bombings themselves in which 21 innocent people died, of the Oxford Street bombing, of the murder of Airey Neave, of the murder of Norris McWhirter, of the Guildford pub bombing, of the motorway coach bombing, of the Winchester barracks bombing, of the bombing of ceremonial cavalry men and their horses, of the periodical campaigns of letter bombing and of the Brighton Hotel bombing which was aimed at the British people's elected leader.  We did not elect her here; possibly she would never get a quota in any constituency in this country, but the people nearest to us elected her as their leader.  She was the person against whom that outrage was directed.  It did not succeed in injuring her but it killed four other people.</P>
    <P>If we in this State had experienced a similar series of horrors &mdash; apart from others which I cannot remember at present &mdash; would we not take drastic steps to protect ourselves, possibly even more drastic than we see incorporated in the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act?  I want to remind the Minister opposite that there is still in force in this State &mdash; requiring only an order of the Government to bring it into operation &mdash; an Act, namely, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act of 1940 under which people on a ministerial warrant and without the intervention of any court can be interned indefinitely, not just for seven days but indefinitely.  Deputy Blaney up there, whom I do not wish to irritate&mdash;I name him only because he is a convenient reference &mdash; sat as a member of a Government which did operate that part of that Act.  It was last operated here within fairly recent memory, in 1961 and 1962.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not condone, would not excuse or make apologies for the discriminatory or unreasonable operation of that Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain or any other Act or law.  The Taoiseach did hint this morning that it had been unreasonably or discriminatorily operated.  If so, I do not want to say anything to palliate the perfectly justified grievance which can arise from <Col N="201" /> such a process.  There appear to have been, and I accept that there have been, cases in which the provisions of that Act may have been abused but, in fairness and in justice I have to say &mdash; and I owe them no less &mdash; that although I myself have landed in Britain or arrived at a British port, I suppose, 50 or 60 times in the 14 years since the Prevention of Terrorism Act came into force, I have never been troubled by it.  I never recall seeing my fellow passengers on an Irish plane, or arriving at Holyhead or at Liverpool being troubled by it either.  I have, of course, been asked to fill up cards.  On a few occasions I have been asked my destination verbally.  Am I to get into a flap about that?  Am I not a guest in their country?  Are they not entitled to make whatever arrangements they thing best to secure themselves against the kinds of outrage I have listed?</P>
    <P>A few Ministers, Deputies and Members of the European Parliament of Irish nationality have made silly asses of themselves by making a fuss at being asked to go through these details.  They will go through treble that number of formalities in other countries which they accept like a lamb but because the British, who have suffered a series of outrages nominally carried out under our tricolour, impose these trifling restrictions &mdash; by calling them trifling I do not excuse the abuses of that Act &mdash; they are supposed to be unreasonable.  That is what I mean by the weakest point, it should be left outside the court and not used to discredit the strong points.  In the context of security we should all acknowledge the maxim that it is better to be sure than sorry.</P>
    <P>Have we not ourselves in this State under the guidance and direction of the Government, which I support in every particular in this respect, laid down a process no later than last November when tens of thousands of innocent homes in this country were visited and searched? The privacy of tens of thousands of innocent families was disturbed and invaded in order to track down a relatively small number of criminals and to turn up a relatively small number of arms caches. <Col N="202" /> How many people have complained about that?  Naturally, if you send thousands of soldiers to conduct searches and the same number of police, there will be occasions when men who are tired or inexperienced &mdash; some less tactful and more easily irritated than others &mdash; will invade people's privacy under cover of this power less politely and more extensively than may be necessary.  However, reasonable people expect that to happen and they do not complain.  For us to be making a fuss about this measure when there are other things that should be complained about, is weakening the parts of our case that are strong.</P>
    <P>The Stalker-Sampson case is in a quite different category from the Prevention of Terrorism Act and anything we have to say about that case is weakened by bleating about the English provisions for their own security.  Even here, there is a certain dimension of the Irish argument which, again, would be better left outside the court.  There is a suggestion, which has not been articulated here, which I have seen and heard in the last fortnight that the prosecution function in Britain or any other country is a sort of machine that automatically churns out an indictment as soon as the prosecuting authority has available to it a certain quantum of evidence.  That is simply not so.  I agree that the prosecuting authority, for the arguments I am trying to make, encompass more than simply the Attorney General or a Director of Public Prosecutions.  It stretches down to the police level.</P>
    <P>There have been instances in our own jurisdiction where it is not the case that evidence has been available in a certain context and that a prosecution has automatically followed.  There were ten or 12 years during which it appeared to be the law that divorces obtained outside this country were not regarded here as valid. That is no longer so but it obtained from about the mid-fifties to 1969 or 1970, I cannot remember the exact dates, during which that appeared to be the law, rightly or wrongly.  During that period, therefore, anybody who was divorced in some other jurisdiction and who came back to <Col N="203" /> Ireland and got married might have been charged with bigamy because their original spouse was still alive.  Yet, as far as I know, the police never brought such a prosecution or if there was one it was the rarest of birds.  I see two members of the legal profession on the other side of the House, and I am willing to give way to them if they want to contradict me but I think I am right in saying that bigamy prosecutions were exceedingly rare.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in cases where there was a question of deceit or allurement of some unfortunate woman who did not know that she was being asked to marry a man who had a wife in every port, it was a different matter and I would regard it as an extremely serious offence but even where the parties both knew what they were doing it was still, under the old law, bigamy.</P>
    <P>Equally the law is not and has not been enforced in regard to homosexual acts between men &mdash; unless the papers which seem in other respect to have thrown off all wraps decided in those instances not to report proceedings.  That is the case unless there is some dimension of violation of public decency, corruption and intimidation.  However, in the ordinary sense, that law has fallen asleep and the plaintiff who challenged it four or five years ago &mdash; although he admitted he might be vulnerable to it &mdash; also admitted that he had never been troubled by it.  I could multiply these instances, not perhaps by many more such conspicuous examples, but there are many instances in which our criminal law does respond to a certain discretion which we would call a discretion corresponding to a perception, for one reason or another, of the public interest.  It is not correct to say that the public interest may never intervene.</P>
    <P>My complaint about what has happened in Britain &mdash; and the Government would do very well to stick to this &mdash; is not based on the fact that the British Attorney-General acknowledged that a discretion of this kind should exist &mdash; it exists here too.  I am not disturbed about the existence of a discussion to prosecute based on a perception of the public <Col N="204" /> interest &mdash; what upsets and disturbs me and ought to disturb the Government &mdash; and I believe it does &mdash; is that this discussion was invoked in a context so explosive with a lack of feeling and commonsense so lamentable, and to establish a precedent so intolerable, that the parties in this House will be at one in supporting the Government in their complaints.</P>
    <P>Naturally no Government like to reveal their security arrangements and I do not blame the British for being shy about this.  We do not want to reveal ours either.  However, there are other values in this setting.  No British Government should have been willing to impair what appeared to be the incipient acceptance of the RUC by the Northern Ireland minority, nor should they have given that minority the feeling, as the Minister opposite said a moment ago &mdash; although I would not endorse all his expressions which I thought were unnecessarily abrasive &mdash; that when gross abuses such as perversion of justice arose, the delinquents would find a safe shelter once more behind the same screen of public interest.  The British should realise that there is more at issue for themselves, as well as for the rest of us, than the secrecy of their security arrangements and that, by this decision, they might have seriously weakened the chances of bringing peace and order quickly back to the North.</P>
    <P>On the question of extradition, after all the misunderstandings and all the duff British warrants &mdash; which it is not cricket for the Irish courts to subject to the ordinary test of scrutiny &mdash; after our Supreme Court has had to cut several large corners off the previous law in order to deprive terrorists of a shelter in that law, this last episode is the last straw.  In this instance, unlike the others, our Government must bear some share &mdash; I do not want to exaggerate it &mdash; of the blame for the extradition process having seized up.  The Taoiseach said this morning that our Attorney-General wrote on 17 December to the British Attorney-General confirming the requirements of Irish law under the new Act.  As soon as this letter <Col N="205" /> was replied to with a rejoinder indicating that these requirements effectively would not be met, when the first warrant arrived which did not meet the requirements and when the Attorney-General accordingly reported this to the Government, as I presume he did, why was a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference not immediately demanded two months ago in order to straighten out this conflict? Why must we wait until this matter surfaces in the form of the present disastrously timed shouting match?</P>
    <P>There was a time in my career here when I would have been inclined to attribute this disastrous timing to deliberate manipulation on Fianna Fáil's part because I would have been inclined to say that they would naturally welcome a good fat grievance, a good fat chance to beat the British in the three or four days coming up to their Árd Fheis.  I would have been reinforced in that feeling by the somewhat truculent tone the Taoiseach showed on a couple of occasions this morning when he told us with emphasis, as though anyone had ever contradicted or doubted this point &mdash; even in Britain &mdash; that the Garda was not an Anglo-Irish police force.  That is the kind of phrase which certainly will bring the backwoodsmen to their feet.  The Taoiseach may possibly regret he did not save that up for the Árd Fheis next Saturday or Sunday.</P>
    <P>I am trying very hard to believe, and I am disposed to believe it because of the way things have gone here in the last year, that he does understand he is handling a matter too important and too deadly to harness to any such petty purpose.  Either the Intergovernmental Conference is there &mdash; this is what I am trying to compain about in regard to what I think has to be interpreted as Government slowness and Government laxity in this matter &mdash; as a framework in which the parties can consult, co-ordinate their actions, can keep one another informed and, above all, can forestall public misunderstandings and foul-ups or it has no useful role at all.  The Government must emphasise that point relentlessly in <Col N="206" /> regard to the disease which has hit Anglo-Irish relations in the last month.  The British should not be left with an excuse for insinuating faults on our side which are, in fact, the product of their own neglect.</P>
    <P>These persistent misunderstandings, the persistent impasses and foul-ups in Anglo-Irish relations, illustrate something which, unfortunately, is a sort of datum, a starting point, in relations between these two Governments in regard to Northern Ireland.  They illustrate that Irish affairs do not have, and I suppose cannot have, a high priority on the English agenda whereas they are right at the top of ours.  That is an unalterable fact of life.  The British have a much larger country and there are much greater interests for them in their way at looking at things than Northern Ireland, an uncomfortable offshore province which no doubt they bitterly regret ever having bothered with.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the reflection, if the Chair will allow me to intrude a mere reflection at the tail end of my few words on this motion, that in a curious way we would have been better off in the Dáil had Stormont still been in existence, even Stormont warts and all.  I was as jubilant as anybody when it was wound up in 1972 but in a curious way I wonder whether we gained all that much from the destruction of that forum, corrupt though it was and corrupt though the politics were which underlay it.  At least at that time there was there a single, recognisable and unmistakable Unionist leadership.  It was one that was difficult to deal with, at least until the time of Captain O'Neill who was, as soon as he showed signs of realising that this was the 20th century, pulled down by the savage backwoodsmen around him.  At least there was an authority there at the top of whose agenda Irish affairs also figured.  There was an authority there which had responsibility for security in the North of Ireland and Irish affairs was at the top of their agenda also.</P>
    <P>I think and I am sure no Deputy will differ from me in saying this, that the first priority in trying to get the affairs of these islands back on an even keel is to produce <Col N="207" /> some kind of authority in the North of Ireland, a native North of Ireland authority, I hope a power-sharing one which is the only one I would feel appropriate or acceptable, with whom we can deal across the Border face-to-face knowing we are talking to people whose own daily lives are bound up with the very same problems that we are showing concern for.  Until that day comes we are going to be exposed to the persistent bothers of misunderstanding and foul-up which the last few weeks in Anglo-Irish relations have displayed.  I hope the Government, in trying to get us out of the current phase of bitter relations, will keep the objective of restoring something like a recognisable native Northern Ireland authority firmly in view.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly's contribution was colourful and good and I concede, as well I might, that the British are entitled to introduce whatever legislation they feel is in their best national interest.  However, that is where I depart from Deputy Kelly in regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  That Act may be good for Britain but it is a lousy piece of legislation as far as our citizens are concerned and as far as the Irish community in Britain are concerned.  It is the type of legislation which allows the security authorities to engage in trawling. They throw out the net, take in 20 or 30 Irish citizens and out of that number they may get one individual whom they may detain for the mandatory seven days under the Act before releasing him or her.  It is a trawling piece of legislation which allows the British authorities to willy-nilly cast their nets abroad and bring in decent law-abiding Irish men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen that Act in operation at first hand.  Like Deputy Kelly I have travelled to the United Kingdom on many occasions since the Act was introduced following the Birmingham bombings in 1974.  When people like Séamus McGarry, the President of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain, suggests that the institutionalising permanently into British law of the PTA is a bad thing from the point of view of <Col N="209" /> the Irish community in Britain that is good enough for me.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to Mr. McGarry, a voluntary officer presiding over Irish societies in Britain, for the tremendous contribution he has made to the welfare and good reputation of the law-abiding Irishmen and women who live in Britain.  Séamus McGarry indicated on radio the other day that by doing what they have the British have given the security authorities <i>carte blanche</i> to bring in whom they want, when they want and how they want on a haphazard and unsignalled basis.  I agree with Deputy Kelly's proposition that the British are entitled to bring in their own laws but where their laws affect the best interests of Irishmen and women we are entitled to make a comment in relation to the efficacy or otherwise of those laws.</P>
    <P>I am a very strong supporter of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and have been since its inception.  I do not see anything on the political horizon to replace the agreement as it stands.  In those circumstances I should like to see the agreement continuing.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary insensitivity of the British Government to Irish affairs and the concerns of Irish people, particularly in their recent actions, has been amazing but if we put it into proper context we can understand the British establishment attitude to this country.  I would not go so far as to say that it is almost racist but they see us and have seen us historically as second-class citizens within the empire over which they ruled, certainly up to 1922.  There has been an historical lack of understanding over the centuries.  They have not yet begun to learn that at least part of the island of Ireland is a sovereign nation with its own independence and its entitlement to make decisions in its national interest.  Britain has not begun to understand that yet.  When it does it may have a deeper appreciation of the need to be more sensitive in its dealings with successive Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the Stalker-Sampson affair and the willingness of the British Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, to collude in the subversion of justice in <Col N="210" /> the British national interest.  We cannot begin to understand why the British dealt with the Stalker-Sampson report in that manner.  The large majority of people here have always regarded the rule of law as sacrosanct.  The British gave us their common law and it has been part of the jurisprudence of this country over hundreds of years.  Yet, the very country which in the past has advocated the primacy of the rule of law now ignores it because it suits them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for an Irish person to understand why perverting the course of justice does not attract the sanction of the criminal law, particularly at a time when the need for an even-handed approach to both sections of the community in Northern Ireland is vital.  The bland manner in which the British engage in damage limitation is simply not good enough.  They send over people like Mr. Mates, the suave, affable and able Member of Parliament, to come on Irish television and tell the people that the British are concerned.  His task is simply to keep the lid on the pot.  The British are past masters at this form of damage limitation.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the RUC officers who engaged in the official or unofficial shoot-to-kill policy should merely be disciplined is making a nonsense of the law.  I would respectfully suggest that the Irish Government should continue to seek the publication of the Stalker-Sampson report and the prosecution of the RUC officers involved in the killings in November and December 1983.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is in place to facilitate argument and discussion about what should be done but it now appears that Britain over the past few weeks has been coming empty-handed to these discussions.  They should not be allowed to come empty-handed to these discussions; they must give something in return.  The British should publish the Stalker-Sampson report and prosecute the RUC officers involved in the shoot-to-kill policy.  In addition to the publication and prosecution process, the RUC should be restructured and the Diplock Courts <Col N="211" /> should be strengthened from a one-man court to a three-man bench.</P>
    <P>The British should also consider as a matter of urgency the appointment of a new chief constable in the mould, for example, of Mr. John Stalker.  Mr. Stalker came here to publicise his book, which effectively gives the Stalker half of the Stalker-Sampson report up to the time of his dismissal.  It is a very worthwhile book.  The type of person who should replace Sir John Hermon when he retires, as I believe he will, in the not too distant future should be an individual in the mould of Mr. John Stalker.  Mr. Stalker comes across as a man of integrity who is concerned with reaching the solution to a problem in an honest fashion. He is a good British copper in the best traditions of good British policemen.  I believe the appointment of the next chief constable in Northern Ireland should come from without the North rather than within.</P>
    <P>Failure to do all of these things, particularly failure to publish the report and prosecute, might indicate to our Government that the time has come to internationalise the Stalker-Sampson report. The Irish Government, with all the diplomatic machinery at their disposal, should internationalise the British failure to publish and prosecute.  They should go to the European Community.  The matter has already been raised in the European Parliament.  It could also be internationalised at United Nations level.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement is internationally binding. Such actions on the part of the Irish Government might indicate to the British that we are very serious about the need to publish and prosecute.  We should use the fora available to us as a sovereign independent nation.  The matter could be raised right across the world in the event of the British continuing to be intransigent and obscurantist in their failure to publish the report.</P>
    <P>In the event of failure to prosecute, the European Court of Justice should be open to the relatives and dependants of those persons who were shot.  I realise <Col N="212" /> the British might not seek to be represented at such proceedings and that it might turn out to be a rather empty exercise.  If the British continue to fail to prosecute these officers, the due processes available under the European Court of Human Rights should be available to the relatives and dependants of the individuals shot under the shoot-to-kill policy.</P>

      <P>By and large the British media adopted a low key and responsible approach to events in Ireland last week. The same cannot be said about a number of journals, most particularly the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Sunday Telegraph.</i> That newspaper organisation has long been the organ of the more extreme Tory view of the Conservative Party.  Last Sunday week's <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> exceeded itself.  The extraordinary and defamatory insults to our Attorney General appear to have been made with malice aforethought.  I realise that the Attorney General has his own remedy in civil law and I hope he pursues it because if he does he will succeed in both jurisdictions.  That type of journalism is very wrong and it is inexcusable.  Because of this I propose that no facility should be afforded to the journalists of that newspaper by the Government press office and interviews should not be given by Members of this House until an appropriate apology is offered.  It is no coincidence that in today's <i>Guardian</i> an almost as vicious attack is made on the Minister for Energy and Communications.  Whatever about the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> and their pathological anti-Irishness we might have expected more from the <i>Guardian.</i> It makes one wonder whether there may not be a concerted attempt being made to use the UK media to vilify the Irish Government and thus allow the British Government to evade their responsibility to the rule of law.  I do not want it to be alleged that I am engaged in Brit bashing but it appears <Col N="213" /> to me that the Irish Government in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and more particularly over the the past number of weeks have acted with admirable restraint and dignity in the face of the gravest provocation.  When the British are offside they are notorious for blaming members of the other team for putting them into their predicament.  In this instance they have slandered our Attorney General and our Minister, Deputy Burke.  They try to undermine the reputations of the individuals involved in the negotiating process and by doing that they seek to lower their esteem in the public mind.  That is totally unacceptable and although others may not think so I think it is worth putting on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's safeguards in the Extradition Act have been seen to be proper, and who can say now that the Government were not correct in introducing safeguards into our extradition arrangements with the UK and Northern Ireland?  It is important that extradition be ongoing for the ordinary decent criminal and for the political offence merchants.  In this respect the British must comply with the safeguards.  Sir Patrick Mayhew is entitled to express a view on our extradition proceedings, but our Attorney General must operate the law as he sees it and our Bill gave the Attorney General certain statutory powers within the law and the Attorney General has no option but to operate the law as he finds it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity in his address this morning to tell the House what he and the Government intend to do to resolve the undoubted impasse arising from the Stalker-Sampson affair and extradition.  I would separate the Stalker-Sampson affair from the Birmingham Six and the prevention of terrorism issues because Stalker-Sampson is one issue under the Anglo-Irish Agreement where the Irish Government have guaranteed rights.  I interrupt my speech now to indicate that I would like to give five minutes of my time to Deputy Desmond.</P>
      <P>Stalker-Sampson is the one area under the Anglo-Irish Agreement on which the Irish Government have guaranteed rights.  It is unanimously agreed that the Stalker-Sampson affair is a disgrace and a perversion of the rule of law.  It is also unanimous that the British Government have acted against even their own interests in this matter in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to the role of our Government in the Anglo-Irish impasse I wonder if mistakes were made and if such mistakes were culpable.  If such mistakes were made we should learn from them. The British Government's breach of the letter and spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was by no means an accidental misjudgment or a marginal misreading of the situation.  We are driven to the conclusion that it was a conscious decision to breach the agreement, or else that the reaction in Ireland was not anticipated.  If the former is the case we should act accordingly in future, but if the latter is the case we must ask ourselves how the Government failed to convey in advance to the British the destructive potential of their action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context we must ask whether the Anglo-Irish Conference was adequately used to nail down firmly the Irish Government's determination that no action would be taken on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report without recourse to the <Col N="215" /> process of consultation designed to bring about an agreed approach on the matter. We must ask and are entitled to ask in this House did this Government at any time since their accession to office raise the question of the Stalker-Sampson report either at the Anglo-Irish Conference or through any other political channel with the British Government at any time prior to Sir Patrick Mayhew's recent statement to the House of Commons, and if so how often and on what terms?  Secondly, did we convey formally or informally to the British Government that the Irish Government expected to be consulted before any decision was announced on foot of the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and if so, how often and on what terms?  Thirdly, did the Government express their concern at the delay in being consulted on the report or at the removal of John Stalker from the inquiry? These are crucial questions to be answered by the Government.  Unless they can be answered clearly and satisfactorily there must be a grave reservation over the manner in which the Government have acted, or failed to act, in this affair.</P>
    <P>If this House is assured that the unilateral decision of the British Government to announce through their Attorney General their own decision on the matter was itself a breach of a special and explicit agreement other than the terms of Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, we must draw the conclusion that the Government relied on an implicit understanding that they would be consulted.  If we relied on an implicit understanding, between whom was that understanding reached? Was it a continuation of an understanding with members of the last Government? Why was it not renewed?  Why was it not made explicit?  If the far reaching consequences of the decision taken by the British Government ought to have been clear to them in advance, does it not follow that they should have been equally clear to our Government?  If the delay in completing the report and the strange circumstances of Mr. Stalker's suspension meant anything, surely they <Col N="216" /> must have warned the Irish Government that powerful interests were working at high levels in Britain to secure the outcome announced by Sir Patrick Mayhew. It seems strange indeed that a clear and explicit communication of our vital interests in the matter was not conveyed to the British Government at a level at which it could have had effect.  Unless this House is satisfied that a clear, explicit and unequivocal communication of our expectations in this matter was made clear to the British and acknowledged, we must draw the conclusion that there has been a serious and culpable failure on the part of this Government in the conduct of foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Of course, it can be argued that hindsight gives a very different perspective and that the breach of faith by the British was so gross as not to justify any anticipatory diplomatic action, but where vital interests are at stake and a ready channel of communication is available, is there any excuse for relying on assumptions or implications?  Why was no explicit understanding reached and acknowledged?</P>
    <P>We must also view this breakdown in understanding in a broader perspective. Why has there been no Summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister since his election?  Hurried fringe meetings at European Council meetings are no substitute for structural and detailed diplomacy.  The failure of the Taoiseach to meet Mrs. Thatcher for a whole year in circumstances that would have permitted him to raise the Stalker-Sampson report before the damage was done is inexcusable.  Britain and Ireland must co-operate in relation to Northern Ireland.  Co-operation must be detailed and thorough.  A serious and lengthy Summit meeting between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher might also have created a sense of obligation and understanding which would have prevented the recent disruption of Anglo-Irish relations.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has, by his statements and behaviour, created such a sense of doubt about his intentions as to weaken seriously his position and that of his Government.  His <Col N="217" /> original deepseated and public ambivalence on the Anglo-Irish Agreement passed on to him an onus to work tirelessly to prove his commitment to make it work.  This he has manifestly failed to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney and some of the Taoiseach's erstwhile political associates in America seem to have received explicit commitments that the extradition process would in some sense wither away during last year.  Even allowing for some wishful thinking on their part, it seems clear that for backroom political purposes the Taoiseach was prepared to talk &ldquo;green&rdquo; and discount the importance of extradition which was clearly envisaged as a central part of the Anglo-Irish process.  The hasty, cobbled together attitude of the Government as evidence by their amending legislation on extradition and their unwillingness to state their intentions on the matter clearly in advance were not calculated to show a consistency of purpose and intent to the British Government.  Indeed, the failure of the Government's diplomacy and the cynical attack on the Leader of the PDs, among others, with the veiled suggestion that this party's stance on extradition was being improperly influenced by the British Ambassador, called into question the skills and judgment of the Taoiseach in some diplomatic matters.  As the record shows, we did not flinch from our commitment to bring about adequate safeguards.  It was the Taoiseach who changed his posture dramatically in the last year.</P>
    <P>The well publicised antics of the Minister for Tourism and Transport in south Armagh and the loss of verbal control, to put it mildly, on the part of the Minister for Justice showed that the Government are very weak, uncertain and uncoordinated in their behaviour on Northern Ireland.  The failure of the Government to act decisively in our relations with Libya has reached a point of seriousness which merits further debate and action.</P>
    <P>The Government have twice informed this House that they did not anticipate that the contents of the Stalker-Sampson report would be made public.  This was <Col N="218" /> stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and co-chairman of the conference on two occasions.  On 16 June in answer to Dáil questions last year Deputy Lenihan stated: &ldquo;My understanding is that police reports of this kind are not normally published&rdquo;.  He used the same form of words again, as can be found in the Official Report on 4 November.  At no time did the Government take the elementary step of asking to be consulted on the implications of any decision to be taken on foot of the Stalker report.</P>
    <P>There is then clear evidence that this Government have failed in a number of respects.  They have not demonstrated complete commitment to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  They have not established by Summit meetings or diplomacy a clear understanding between Dublin and London.  The Taoiseach has acted and spoken on Northern Ireland, security and extradition in a manner which suggests ambivalence and absence of clear strategy.  Collectively the Government are unconvincing and uncoordinated in their various stances on issues relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have sought to maintain consensus in this country in order to encourage the further development of the Anglo-Irish process.  Unfortunately, the performance of the Government is deficient in this area and it is essential that their weaknesses should not be allowed damage our national interest.  We regret very much that these things must be said in a debate such as we are having today, but they are said not to bring about divisions or disunity in this House but, on the contrary, in order to oblige the Government to improve their performance, and give more time to create confidence in their future capacity to sustain the Anglo-Irish process.</P>
    <P>I am forced to raise these questions to clear the air.  I agree this is the time for us to rally together on the high ground following the Stalker-Sampson affair.  I was disappointed that the Taoiseach said not spell out the &ldquo;all and any action necessary&rdquo; that he needs now in order to end the current impasse.  I hope he will do that when replying to the debate this <Col N="219" /> evening.  Two things should be pursued immediately by the Government.  They should sort out the extradition issue straight away, and they should insist that those persons who conspired to pervert the course of justice in the RUC be removed from the RUC forthwith.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kennedy for enabling both our parties to have a second speaker in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a very distinguished former Member of this House, the late James Larkin.  Many a time I was at a union conference with him with an employer and he used to say across the table to all of us, as only he could say with such authority: &ldquo;There may be a strike,&rdquo; and he would look the employer straight in the eye and look back at his own shop stewards and add: &ldquo;Let us not talk ourselves into one anyway&rdquo;.  Regarding the current political situation between ourselves and our neighbour, the UK, we should not talk ourselves into an impasse, a deadlock, a political climate which would be conducive to fostering the aims of the Provisional IRA and the other paramilitaries equally vicious in Northern Ireland and fostering the remnants of anti-Britishism which, let us be thankful, are now being excluded from this House. Therefore, I ask, where do we go from here?  How do we stop talking ourselves into further trouble?  In the first instance the obligation lies with the Government. I do not cavil at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Northern Ireland section thereof.  They are effective.  I have the highest regard for the Secretary to the Government who has been heroic in his service to succesive Governments, in particular in the complex negotiations relating to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. He deserves the enormous respect of this House and of his counterparts in the UK. It is imperative that those men within the Government service and the Department <Col N="220" /> of Foreign Affairs be brought back on to centre stage.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong view abroad that the Taoiseach has sidelined the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That view has been prevalent for a number of years. The exceptional role that that Department played in Anglo-Irish relations in the constant, incessant and necessary briefings of their counterparts is, I fear, so diluted at present that the impact of that process has created a vacuum, and where a vacuum of the State exists inevitably mistakes are made on both sides and the climate becomes more and more sour.  Therefore, I urge that the governmental processes here should be put back on to the kind of normality that had worked so effectively.  I and my colleague, Deputy Peter Barry, with whom I served in Government, know how effective that process was.  I was proud to be part of that process as a member of the Government between 1982 and January 1987.  The two Attorneys General must get together immediately and sort out the extradition mess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is imperative.  It is utterly wrong that the warrants for people who are required on charges which are sent by the British authorities should lie fallow, unexamined, untreated and signed away by an Irish Attorney General.  That is not in the interests of justice in either this country or the United Kingdom.  It is certainly not in the interests of security because those situations must be dealt with.  I regret the ambivalence in the Taoiseach's speech in that regard.  I presume that it was meant for the Ard Fheis and everything would be all right next Monday or Tuesday and we would be back to normality in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a summit between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in two or three months time. That summit must be properly structured and carefully prepared and it should be subject to intensive prior negotiation, discussion and consultation between both <Col N="221" /> parties.  Only then should the summit take place and not on the fringe of a Council meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have happened six months ago but now is the time to prepare for it.  We should put that forward on a progressive basis.  We must within our country &ldquo;cool it&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice made an excessive remark which I think he regrets.  I regret it.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy John Wilson, made a mistake in the manner in which he conducted a private visit which resulted in retaliation. That was a mistake and he should cool it and not do that again.</P>
      <P>We should break off diplomatic relations with Libya.  There is a huge question mark about that.  Since the <i>Eksund</i> was intercepted it has been alleged &mdash; and I have no reason to doubt the information I received &mdash; that the Libyan Minister for Information was in this country.  These kind of contacts &mdash; which do not go unnoticed by the security forces in other countries &mdash; should cease. It is imperative, as a matter of political hygiene, that we break off diplomatic relations with that country because there are at present in Ireland, North or South, at least 800 weapons of modern calibre which are quite capable of wreaking further destruction, bloodshed and mayhem on the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point in relation to a separate matter because I regard the Birmingham Six question as a separate matter.  Many people have paraded on television, radio and in the newspapers about that disastrous incident which was created by the IRA.  Let us put clearly on the record that that incident would never have happened were it not for the IRA. Those who have information relating to the alleged names of those involved in that appalling incident should bring it to the notice of the security authorities because that kind of ambivalence, no matter from what quarter it comes, is intolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> I urge that there should be no let up on the continuing close co-operation between the Garda, the Army, the RUC and the British Army in their efforts to seize weapons and bring those who have them to justice.  I hope that there is not the slightest ambivalence on our part in that regard because if that should be so my party &mdash; and I have no doubt the other Opposition parties also &mdash; would be more than harsh in our reaction.  We would be greatly concerned if that should arise. However, I have no reason to believe that it will arise in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important and historic debate.  The motion before the House, as proposed by the Taoiseach, is a broad outline of what the Government and this House &mdash; with some notable exceptions &mdash; see as the future for this island.  Behind this motion lies a myriad of matters which are interlinked and known as Anglo-Irish relations.  Over the past few years these relations have touched both ends of the graph, sometimes at a high and other times at a low. In the recent past, the relationship has been fostered, culminating in the Anglo-Irish Agreement which has been <i>in situ</i> for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hiccups of the past few weeks have been very disappointing to this side of the Irish Sea.  We have carried out our side of the equation to the Agreement.  The relationship between both States is a two-way process and without the full co-operation of both sides the goodwill during the past few years will be put to nought.  It is imperative that all constitutional politicians ensure that relations are put back on an even keel otherwise the terrorists will resurrect their ugly heads.  The only people who are pleased with the present impasse are the men of the bomb and the bullet.  They have wreaked havoc on this island and across the water over the past few decades.  Whatever support they had in recent years has dwindled down to a very few, though powerful, fanatics.  The present political problems may lead to a situation where the support for these <Col N="223" /> paramilitaries will increase.  This is something which must be avoided at all costs and all sides should see this.  If they do not, then these islands will suffer more atrocities like the bombings at Enniskillen, Dublin and Hyde Park.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement was entered into by the two sovereign States and has been with us for the past few years.  By and large it has worked in the background quietly and calmly in order to better the relationship between the two States and to help bring about a better understanding between the Unionist and Nationalist people in the Northern part of this island.</P>
    <P>Because I come from a border constituency, I have on numerous occasions made representations on behalf of people who come from the far side of the Border and who have problems ranging from police harassment to property issues after the setting up of military posts by the security forces.  Every time I have made representations, I have literally had a direct line to the relevant authorities in the North.  I have had an immediate response to my problems and I was more than surprised in a number of instances by the actions that were taken.  For instance, within an hour of my contacting the Secretariat concerning someone from Armagh who had been taken to a barracks for questioning, I was able to reassure his relations that he was being treated well and would be released later that day, and he was.  I am making an instance of this case only in order to prove that the Agreement and the structure set up under it have for the first time given this part of the island a say in what goes on in the Northern part of the island. This illustrates how on the ground the idea of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is working.  Obviously, Ministers and former Ministers will be in a position to show how the agreement is working in the broader context.</P>
    <P>The various meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference are a new dimension to Anglo-Irish relations.  Undoubtedly, the agreement has given this part of the island a foothold into the affairs of the North, <Col N="224" /> something we have not had heretofore. To damage this foothold would be disastrous for this nation now and in the future.  This is why the events of the recent past will if anything reduce the effectiveness of the agreement and damage relationships within these islands.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Terrorism Act was brought into the British Parliament as a temporary measure initially in 1974 and was renewed every year since.  Quite a number of people have been detained, but only 180 have been charged.  While we on this side of the island and indeed Irish people living in Britain are by and large not happy with this legislation, we cannot, however, deny the right of a sovereign State to protect themselves as they see fit, within normal international law. However, we would expect that whatever legislation is enacted is used in an even-handed manner.  We would also expect that the views of any sovereign State affected would be taken into account. Making temporary legislation permanent is not the hallmark of a democratic society.  It is ludicrous for British politicians in their defence of this action to refer to measures adopted by us in the past to protect ourselves from terrorism. Any such measures were and still are expressed to be temporary and as soon as life in these islands returns to some sort of normality, I think it would be expected that these would be repealed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Birmingham Six trial, no one denies in a democratic society the separation of the judicial and legislative process.  If it were otherwise it would be catastrophic for any nation. Every individual may have his own views on legal decisions but at the end of the day it is the presiding judge whose view counts.  Having said that, I feel that the Birmingham Six decision cannot pass without comment.  In any criminal proceedings, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of any doubt.  It is plain to see that in this case there were many doubts raised by the defence, most of them without reasonable rebuttal by the prosecution.  The judges involved in the case decided that the points raised were not <Col N="225" /> sufficient in their minds to disprove the prosecution case.  Others may have decided differently.  We, as a Parliament, would not expect any Government to overturn a decision of their court.  We would, however, ask that that Government would consider &mdash; and I stress consider &mdash; using their wide-ranging powers in order to allay the fears expressed by many noted politicians, churchmen and other leaders.</P>
    <P>I feel those two topics are insignificant compared with the Stalker-Sampson affair.  In my opinion this affair is by far the most damning to public confidence in the administration of justice on these islands.  Quite apart from the actual incidents involved, which were horrific, the fact that a cover-up ensued at the behest of senior officials is not the deed of a healthy administration.  Further to this, the deliberate decision not to prosecute all the people involved from top to bottom, where there was an admission that there was evidence of perversion or attempted perversion of the course of justice, is astounding.  For any sovereign State to run their affairs in this manner does not augur well for the future.  To hide behind the public interest or national security is indeed worrying.  Any future events could be treated in this way, and I believe the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, referred to this earlier.  Surely this type of attitude is not going to promote public confidence in the administration of justice in the UK or Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The reply to our protestations by senior British politicians is to the effect that we should not expect politicians to be able to challenge decisions made by the Attorney General.  I say this decision could not have been made by the Attorney General alone.  In his statement he said he acquainted himself with all the relevant circumstances.  Surely this would have entailed contact at all levels in the administration of justice. a rot that set in at the start on the occasions of these particular incidents involved, was compounded right up the line.  To expect anyone to have confidence in an administration which involves itself in this is just expecting too much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I will now come back to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which expressly allowed for these type of issues to be discussed between the two States.  No prior consultation took place between the two Governments before this decision was announced by Sir Patrick Mayhew.  This goes against both the spirit and the letter of the agreement.  Surely, any right-minded person could see that this type of decision can only undermine public confidence.  What must happen is that the report be immediately published with a proper explanation of the reasons prosecutions were not instigated.  The fact that it is admitted that the Northern Ireland security forces came into the Twenty-six Counties on the night of 12 December 1982 must be of grave concern to us.  The British Government should see why we have become aware of these facts and are worried about them.</P>
    <P>Have the British Government something to hide?  I am from a Border constituency and some of my constituents have had to put up with constant incursions onto their property by armed personnel from the far side of the Border. These people have had to live with this for the past number of years.  It is nothing new.  Some people have reported these incidents to the Department of Foreign Affairs, but the vast majority go unreported.  We heard recently about the British plane over Mullingar, but my constituents have helicopters over their houses every night.  Any reasonable person must admit that the decision by the British Government not to take the Irish Government into their confidence in matters which are of mutual interest, as laid down in the Anglo-Irish agreement, is an affront to this sovereign State.</P>
    <P>The entire Stalker-Sampson affair is a disaster from start to finish.  The removal of Mr. Stalker from the inquiry is in itself very questionable and that in itself would have been enough to make us uneasy about the affair but, to add to this the recent decision by the British Attorney General is more detrimental to the public confidence in the administration of justice both in Northern Ireland and in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is explicit.  It states:</P>
    <P>The conference shall consider the security situation at its regular meetings and thus provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incident and forthcoming events.</P>
    <P>Surely we have a right to full consultation under this article.  What has happened over the past number of weeks is not in accordance with the spirit of Article 7.  It is totally insensitive not to recognise the anxiety of the Irish people at this time. The timing of all matters may have been coincidental.  Other people may think they were timed purposely.  At the very best the timing was totally illadvised and insensitive.</P>
    <P>I cannot finish without referring to the problems that have been encountered with regard to extradition.  Sir Patrick Mayhew is becoming a central figure in Anglo-Irish matters.  His decision not to go along with the Irish extradition legislation is regrettable.  Again, I wonder if this decision being made of his own volition or is someone, as it were, pulling his strings.  The stated opposition by the British Government to our recent Extradition Act when it was going through the House, is now coming home to roost. The procedures as laid down by the House must be adhered to.  The British authorities must comply with these arrangements; otherwise terrorists will go free.  That is not in the interest of either State.</P>
    <P>Some people may feel that the Anglo-Irish Agreement may not have bettered relationships within these islands with a view to eradicating the blight of terrorism.  Some people in my own constituency feel it has only helped the British authorities to establish a military State, particularly along the Border.  The recent building of massive permanent security blocks along the Border with Louth might give credence to this argument.  So also may the recent announcement by the British of establishing a new force for security along the Border give credence to this type of argument.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Having the agreement in place should allow our views to be expressed on matters pertaining to the North of Ireland.  It is important that our views be listened to and given due consideration.  If they are not, what is the point in having secretariats and conferences?  What is the point in having dialogue between the two nations?  The people of this island deserve to be listended to because it is our country that is being torn asunder by the people who have most to gain from the political and constitutional difficulties that have arisen between both these States.  As our Taoiseach stated earlier in the debate, and previously, to allow matters to remain as they are would be detrimental to peace and stability on these islands.  I hope that commonsense will ultimately prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are having this debate and regret that the opportunities to debate Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish affairs are limited as they are in this House and that when we do debate them, it tends to be because of some particular concern which forms the backdrop.  The backdrop today is, of course, what has become known as the present impasse in Anglo-Irish relations.  I do not want to go into the details of the particular events that have given rise to that impasse, but rather to consider where we go from here.  That we find ourselves in our present situation is attributable to the ineptitude, the obstinacy and in some instances the willful neglect, of the British authorities.  That we find ourselves where we do has been substantially contributed to by the contributory negligence, as it were, of the Government in their handling of Anglo-Irish matters.  If the question is where do we go from here and if our anxiety is that we go forward from here, we shall do that best if we put some check on our sense of righteous indignation and then consider what we can do to advance the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> There are four issues which have dominated this affair and of those pre-eminent has been the Stalker-Sampson question. My quarrel with the British Attorney General is not that he considered the question of the public interest.  That seems to be a proper course of action for a prosecuting authority.  My quarrel with the British Attorney General is the view that he formed of what would best serve the public interest.  I do not believe that the public interest is best served by a course of action which has renewed doubts about the standing of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  I believe that the public interest would best have been served by a course of action which would have increased confidence in the security forces in Northern Ireland.  I believe confidence would have been increased by asserting that nobody was above the rule of law.  But that decision has been taken and however indignant we are at that and however much we wail against it, the practicalities are that that decision is not now going to be reversed.  If that is so, it behoves us to consider what alternatives might suffice, or if not suffice, might be very much a second best.</P>
    <P>It seems, as a matter of overwhelming probability, that that decision not to prosecute will not be reversed, but in the most unlikely event that the decision were reversed, I have considerable doubts as to what would happen in the prosecutions that would follow.  It seems that any jury before whom the cases would come &mdash; and I assume these would be jury trials; I do not imagine that the offences are scheduled offences &mdash; would be likely to take into account the circumstances in which prosecutions had eventually been taken, that the prosecutions had been brought at the behest of international pressure and of pressure from Dublin. That is something that would be unlikely to lead them towards conviction.  If prosecutions are unlikely to take place now, the question is: what should happen?  The one thing which is overwhelmingly clear should happen is that those people against whom everybody accepts that evidence exists should not remain members of a police force in a democratic society. <Col N="230" /> It is no longer a question of whether offences were committed &mdash; that is now common case.  The Attorney General himself has declared that he has found such evidence to exist.  In the case of the people against whom he and the DPP were of the view that evidence exists, they should be shown the door and shown the door as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The other issue perhaps might not have been germane but it has become entangled in this whole issue, that is the question of the Birmingham Six.  I was interested to hear Deputy Ahern's contribution about the independence of the courts and the separation of powers. What I would say on that is this: it seems unreal to expect the British Government or the British authorities, in the immediate aftermath of a decision of the Court of Appeal, to move to exercise their powers of clemency, more particularly while there is still some distance along the judicial road that the appellants can travel in terms of seeking leave to appeal to the House of Lords.  When that road is travelled &mdash; and I must say that I have little optimism about what the result will be &mdash; if those people still remain in custody, the question that must then present itself to the British Government is, what can they do?  The British Government have themselves, in the most spectacular fashion, shown a willingness to take on board the public interest in quasi-judicial matters.  Even if the highest courts in the land say that they are satisfied that the convictions are safe, if a substantial section of British establishment opinion remains unconvinced and if an overwhelming number of people in this jurisdiction remain unconvinced, the public interest in Britain would be best served by exercising clemency, because it cannot be in the public interest of the British authorities that doubts should continue to hang over convictions, with all the opportunities that that presents for souring relations.</P>
    <P>On the question of extradition, I have sought, try as I can, to see the other point of view in relation to each of these controversies and sometimes have not <Col N="231" /> found that easy but in relation to extradition it does seem that the stance taken by the British Attorney General is absolutely unsustainable.  I am not an enthusiast for the measures that were put in place here just before Christmas.  If worked to the full, they may well prove cumbersome, but they have been enacted, as we know, for a 12 month period.  That was on the basis that it was the desire of all sides of this House that we would see how they worked, whether they represented an unreasonable impediment to extradition, or whether they were to prove an adequate safeguard.  We were told that, while the British Government had their reservations about this, they would work the legislation to the full. That was stated in an interview by Mr. King and I understand that it was stated publicly by the British Prime Minister and, most specifically, by the British Ambassador, Mr. Nicholas Fenn, in his interview on RTE.  It is just outrageous that the British Government should unilaterally decide to put an end to extradition between these two countries because all of us have an interest in seeing to it that people against whom evidence exists in respect of serious crimes should stand trial, and ideally that they should stand trial within the jurisdiction in which the offence was committed.  What is clearly required is that the two Attorneys General meet immediately and sort this matter out once and for all.  The present situation is absolutely intolerable.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, we should maintain some sense of proportion.  We are entitled to be concerned about the operation of the Act over the years, the fact that it has been used in an insensitive manner and that it has been used to trawl for information.  However, that there should be legislation is not something that many of us will doubt.  There is the opportunity, between now and the legislation coming before the House of Commons, to see to it that our concerns can be taken on board.  What we should be doing now is taking advantage of the offences that have been committed, the wrongs that <Col N="232" /> have been done to us by the British Government, to push our case in other areas, and do it not on the basis of a tradeoff because the Anglo-Irish Agreement contemplated and demanded that a programme of work be put in place to increase confidence in the security forces and in the administration of justice.  That need, which was identified at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will draw my remarks to a conclusion.  If it was needed at Hillsborough, it is needed even more now in the aftermath of the decisions taken on Stalker-Sampson.  That means that the British Government should be prepared to move on the programme of work contemplated; it means that our Government should be pushing for movement on things like reforms of the Diplock courts, not on the basis of a tradeoff, but because those things were always necessary and are even more necessary because of the decisions taken by the British Government in the last few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally protest against the arrangements which leave me only ten minutes to express a view which is not expressed by anybody else here.  The others have been repeating the same views.  I have this very short time so I will not take up any of that time by protesting at the moment, but I will do so in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House I have been absolutely amazed &mdash; so much so that the few times I left it I went out to look around to see was I in the Parliament of this Twenty-six Counties &mdash; listening to the expressions of astonishment, surprise and disappointment from various speakers here <Col N="233" /> in the House about the manner in which our affairs have been dealt with by our occupiers, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Will we ever learn that in fact we are not dealing with a normal situation in any sense of the word, and never have been in all the centuries, and certainly not now?  When we express the views that we do about reasoning this and that and expecting different from the British, let us understand that we are occupied, and it is the occupier we are dealing with and that everything that is required, whether it is in regard to the misuse of the courts, the police, the Army, the subjugation of our own police force by the Anglo-Irish Agreement, is necessary and regarded as proper and right by the British in their occupation and continued occupation of this country.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement gave us what?  It gave us the right to make proposals and express our views and, at the end of the day, the British held on to the right to make the decisions.  In return for that what did we give them?  We gave them the signing of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism arising from which we gave them extradition in the most extreme form of any civilised country in the world, and we gave them £1 million a day of money we have not got to secure the Border for the occupier, not for our own protection.  Let us remember those things when we are talking about our amazement and astonishment, surprise, disappointment and anger when we get the result of the Birmingham Six appeal.  Did not the dogs in the street know that to allow that appeal would have brought into disrepute in an international way so-called British justice, that it would have been an admission of a wrong judgment based on inadequate information, on perjury, on all sorts of everything that the Brits say they do not have in their country?  That was what we were asking them to do, to condemn themselves in the eyes of the world, having horribly inflicted 13 years of incarceration on six innocent people.  That is what we were expecting and that is what we were surprised did not come through in that appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> In the Stalker-Sampson affair, what did we expect?  Did we expect them to prosecute even though there was sufficient evidence to maintain prosecutions?  Did we expect them to prosecute the officers upholding their occupation?  Did anybody consider that as a possibility at any time?</P>
    <P>All this weeping and wailing is now being done about taking every action that is possible under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to sort these things out.  Sort what out?  Why do we not put it down in our own motion that the only sorting out that will bring about cessation of hostilities and war, as has been said when it suits, is when Britain decides to get out?  That is the only answer and all this glib talk that we were sold and the public have been sold, even down to the point that they have been practically brainwashed into believing that Mrs. Thatcher is trying to break the agreement.  She has no agreement.  We are the people who made the agreement, committed ourselves to the absolutely ludicrous Extradition Act that was put through this House by the very party that condemned it when it was brought before us in 1986.  It was excused on the basis that there were safeguards, and the safeguards are now said to be working.  They are only working so long as the Government are annoyed at the treatment meted out by Mrs. Thatcher and the Attorney General does not confirm that they should be endorsed.  What happens if there is another Government and another Attorney General now or at any future date?  Where is the protection? Those same provisions cannot be challenged in law.  There is nothing in them that can be challenged.  There is nothing in the Extradition Act that can be challenged and that is the extremity to which we have gone in providing this Extradition Act to send people across to the Diplock courts, to people who have practised sending people away on forced confessions, the dawn jury, the one judge, the supergrass trials.  All of these things are there to ensure that justice is not done when it comes down to it.</P>
    <P>The question of an accused coming before those courts or the British courts <Col N="235" /> who can in any way be connected with disestablishing the occupation of part of our country might as well be likened to the extreme situation of the Nazi occupation of France.  Imagine how ludicrous would the public in France have appeared if they complained, when somebody accused of being in the underground was taken out and summarily shot, that they were not getting justice?  It is a similar situation here except it is more sophisticated and we are lulled into the belief that we are dealing with normal people in a normal situation, whereas we are dealing with the occupiers.  It is no different from the occupation of France and other countries under the Nazis.  There is not one bit of difference in so far as what we can expect from them is concerned. We are the fools who believe that in the Anglo-Irish Agreement we have got something, the right to make proposals, the right to express our views.</P>
    <P>Have we not always maintained that right?  Have we not always said our piece regardless of whether we had an agreement?  It is not a fact that we have an agreement that has had the effect in the last few weeks of damping down the views and the proposals that people might have expressed because the agreement must be protected, and let us not do anything to upset it?  The attitude now is that we have got to the point where we are afraid Mrs. Thatcher is trying to break the agreement and we should not let her do it.</P>
    <P>That is one of the views the Government have succeeded in bringing about. It is a most crazy view if one stands back a little bit and looks at it.  We are dealing with the occupiers of this country and, as Kitson said in a book which he wrote in the early seventies when he had gone from our shores, the courts, the judiciary are another weapon in the armoury against terrorism, and one can substitute terrorism for occupation.  Just like Mayhew in the British Parliament only a week or two ago, who talked about public interest and security and said that security and public interest dictated that those <Col N="236" /> prosecutions might not be taken.  Whose security and whose public interest are we talking about?  Substitute occupation for security and public interest and then one gets justice <i>versus</i> occupation, no dice, no contest; there will be no prosecutions. Is that not the real situation that we have codded ourselves into believing does not exist, for what reason I do not know?  As far as extradition is concerned, the party in Government condemned it roundly in November-December 1986 and then put it through.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Justice I am entrusted in a very particular way with responsibility for law and order matters, matters relating to the Garda Síochána, and questions of security and security co-operation generally.  It is to these aspects of the issues being debated here today that I intend to address my remarks.  These issues touch very closely on our whole security policy and effort and on the degree of co-operation with other security forces which is or should be part of that policy and effort. It is important that we should keep in mind throughout this debate just why this policy and effort is there.  It is, after all, costing us very dearly in terms of economic resources which we would all love to see being available for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda and other resources that this Government, and indeed previous Governments, have provided to cater for our security needs, are there because it is our judgment that they are vital to the <Col N="237" /> safety and security of the State.  They are there too because of the responsibility which we owe to the safety and well-being of our neighbours in Northern Ireland and because of the obligations which we as a civilised State incur towards the defeat of terrorism of all shades and manifestations.  As the Taoiseach said in his opening statement, we have put and we retain these resources in position because it is the right and necessary thing to do.  We do not intend to be deflected from doing the right thing just because of what others do or do not do.</P>
    <P>There is no need for us to be too high-minded about this.  We would be foolish to think that terrorist aggression is aimed solely at the North and that we here can keep our heads down and pretend that it really does not affect us.  In the first place I feel, and I believe that the vast majority of our people agree, that the killing or maiming, as the result of terrorist activity, of any person in any part of this island affects and diminishes us all and is an attack on each one of us.  Terrorists here, on both sides of the divide, have shown, as have terrorists everywhere, that they are no respecters of human life or human feelings.  We need think no further back than to Enniskillen or the O'Grady kidnapping if we want to be reminded of that.</P>
    <P>In the second place, there is the concern that terrorist activity directed from the North to here has affected us in the past and might well happen again.  Thankfully we have not suffered anything like the appalling tragedies and damage inflicted on the North but we remember only too well the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of some years ago as well as more recent &ldquo;missions&rdquo; carried out here by Northern-based paramilitary activists. The constant vigilance of our security forces is essential to keep this type of danger at bay.  Of inestimable value too in this regard is the co-operation which we have been getting from the Northern police force &mdash; the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  It is right that we should acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>The third point I would mention is the <Col N="238" /> real concern that has been engendered by the major arms shipments which are believed to have been landed here in 1985-86 prior to the interception of <i>Eksund</i> cargo.  The size of the consignments believed to have been landed and the sophistication of the weaponry and armaments involved, adds a new dimension to the threat to the entire country, North and South, which is imposed by terrorist activity.  We would be foolish to suppose that the threat represented by this escalation of terrorist endeavour is directed in some way that does not affect us here.  It is inconceivable that this could be so.</P>
    <P>What I have said is just designed to sketch out in a very brief way the importance that attaches to our security measures and policies.  It is, I am sure, obvious to all that to a very large extent the security concerns that affect us here are the same as those which affect the security forces in the North as well.  It must be obvious too, I am sure, that it is of very great benefit to the police forces on both sides that there should be a very high degree of co-operation between them in pursuance of their joint objectives.</P>
    <P>In recent years that co-operation has been showing a healthy growth.  It has to be acknowledged that the RUC, by their attitudes and action in recent times, have done a great deal to promote relationships of trust and confidence between themselves and the Garda Síochána.  It has been acknowledged on all sides that, up to the difficulties that have erupted in the past few weeks, confidence and co-operation were continuing to grow and in fact had reached a level above anything achieved in the past.  It is true that the concerns and unease caused by the events that gave rise to the Stalker-Sampson report, and indeed the controversy relating to the removal of Mr. Stalker from the inquiry at a particularly sensitive stage, were in the background all the time but the hope and expectation was that publication of the report and the prosecution of those against whom there was evidence of wrong-doing would finally clear the air and open the way to even greater trust <Col N="239" /> and co-operation between the two forces. This unfortunately, was not to be.</P>
    <P>The highly controversial decision taken by the British authorities not to prosecute those against whom there is evidence which would justify prosecution is the direct opposite to what we had a right, and indeed what we had been led, to expect.  Far from clearing the air and improving, the atmosphere of trust and confidence that is necessary for the Garda Síochána and the RUC to work closely together, they constitute a serious setback to much of what had already been achieved.</P>
    <P>I have no wish, nor is there any need, to over-dramatise the effects of what has happened.  The effects, so far as co-operation with the Garda Síochána is concerned, are real enough.  The Taoiseach has already made this point &mdash; the invaluable asset of virtually total community support which the Garda enjoy cannot be put at risk.  Where any member of the Garda Síochána loses confidence in the impartiality or integrity of those he deals with in the other force, the situation is not easily remedied.  Again as the Taoiseach said, it is not just possible to oblige one force to have confidence in another or to give the whole-hearted measure of confidential co-operation that should exist. These things come only from inner conviction and motivation.</P>
    <P>As you know, the Government lost no time in bringing these matters to attention.  Our concerns were very vigorously expressed at the special meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference held on 2 February 1988 and, at the same time, we set out our views and proposals regarding the measures necessary to remedy the situation.  What we said and what we proposed has already been stated here. We saw publication of the Stalker-Sampson report as essential to clear the air, as I have already mentioned.  Only if we see the report can we be certain that all that needs to be done is being addressed.  We saw prosecution of those against whom there is evidence of wrong-doing as the minimum that could be expected in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> You have been told that these proposals of ours were rejected and the reasons for this rejection.  We do not, of course, accept these reasons as satisfactory.  What we have been promised instead is that disciplinary proceedings may be put in train in respect of certain members of the RUC and that certain changes relating to the structures and controls within the RUC will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon in which he has outlined certain measures that are being taken under two headings &mdash; disciplinary action and changes in procedures, responsibilities and control within the RUC.</P>
    <P>On the disciplinary front, the Chief Constable of the RUC is, in effect, the disciplinary authority for ranks of and below chief superintendent.  The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland has advised the Chief Constable of those offences in respect of which he concluded there was evidence of the commision of offences.  In the present case the Chief Constable has asked the Chief Constable of Staffordshire, Mr. Charles Kelly, to consider whether disciplinary charges should be brought against members of the ranks of chief superintendent and below and, if so, what charges would be appropriate.  Mr. Kelly has appointed one of his Assistant Chief Constables to help him in this work, which has already begun.  The Chief Constable of the RUC has also decided that when it comes to the hearing of any disciplinary charges that may be recommended a different British Chief Constable will be responsible for that.  In other words, the investigation and the adjudication stages of the disciplinary procedure, which are distinct and separate, are to be undertaken by two different Chief Constables from the British police forces.</P>
    <P>The disciplinary authority for RUC officers above the rank of chief superintendent is the Police Authority for Northern Ireland.  The observations in relation to officers of these more senior <Col N="241" /> ranks which were contained in the Stalker-Sampson report have been conveyed to the Chairman of the Police Authority and the authority is now taking steps to address the matters which have been brought to their attention.  If disciplinary charges were to be preferred against officers above the rank of Chief Superintendent they would be heard by a tribunal cosisting of a single person selected and appointed by the Police Authority with the approval of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  One or more assessors would be appointed by the Police Authority to assist the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I might add that, in the case of disciplinary proceedings against all ranks, the punishments which may be imposed include dismissal from the force or requirement to resign from the force.</P>
    <P>The Stalker-Sampson report also addressed aspects of the circumstances following the shoot-to-kill incidents in 1982 which gave rise to concern about procedures and control within the RUC. The report recommended that there should be a special inspection by the inspectorate of constabulary in relation to this aspect.  The report of that inspection, the McLachlan report, was presented a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>One of the major concerns which the whole affair gave rise to was that the RUC Special Branch was in effect a force within a force, operating independently of normal command structures without proper control.  In particular it came to light that a very serious and unacceptable situation existed whereby, in relation to incidents such as those which occurred in 1982, the Special Branch was not accountable to the Criminal Investigation Department of the RUC &mdash; the powers of the CID were being over-ridden by the Special Branch and proper investigation of such incidents was being prevented.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has indicated that in 1983, at the request of the Chief Constable of the RUC, a special review was carried out by a former very senior security service officer into certain aspects of Special Branch management and its relationship <Col N="242" /> with the CID and that his recommendations were implemented in full.  In 1984 a new rank of senior assistant chief constable was created in the RUC and three appointments were made to that rank.  One of the new senior assistant chief constables was given responsibility for both the Special Branch and the CID. This change was designed to get over, in part, the problem of lack of accountability of the Special Branch to the CID.</P>
    <P>The McLachlan report now contains a number of detailed recommendations for changes within the RUC in organisation, structures, training, internal accountability, certain Special Branch practices, monitoring of Special Branch activities and the like.  It also contains recommendations on new arrangements about investigations of serious incidents where people are shot by the security forces being headed up by a chief constable from Britain.  New arrangements are also recommended about such matters as attendance of CID officers in the aftermath of such incidents, forensic and scene-of-crime procedures and attendance of CID officers at all <i>post-mortems</i> into suspected unlawful killings.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has said that the Chief Constable of the RUC has confirmed to him that he has accepted in principle all the recommendations of the McLachlan report. Action is being taken on foot of those recommendations to ensure that policies and practices in the RUC in future will reflect the paramountcy of the Criminal Investigation Department.  He has also indicated that discussions are now proceeding between the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable and the Deputy Chief Constable of the RUC about safeguards which will ensure that, in future, the information which is given to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the RUC in relation to incidents which might give rise to criminal charges is full and accurate, whether or not any security interests are involved in the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I would make about this and it takes up a point made by Deputy Dukes earlier in this debate.  We have had to listen to criticism for many months past that our Special Branch units were not properly organised and could not really be effective until we adopted the procedures and structures in use by the RUC.  We stoutly resisted this criticism and pressure.  It is indeed ironic that these RUC structures are now found to be in serious need of reorganisation.  It looks very much as if our stance all along has been clearly vindicated.</P>
      <P>The measures now announced by the Secretary of State are, I understand, designed to meet two requirements &mdash; that those against whom there is evidence of wrong-doing are dealt with in an appropriate way and to ensure that the controls in operation within the RUC are such as to prevent a recurrence of the events that have given rise to so much concern.</P>
      <P>We can only hope that the assurances which we have now been given on these matters will in fact be carried out and that they will go some way towards restoring the trust and confidence that has been damaged.  We will be watching these developments with great interest. It is imperative that whatever measures are to be taken be carried out in the shortest time possible.  Further delays in the resolution of this whole saga can only further undermine credibility and delay and restoration of normal relationships between all involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime one must ask: Where stands security co-operation?  I repeat what I said at the outset and which the Taoiseach said earlier to-day &mdash; there has been damage to the process of co-operation.  It is not of our doing and it <Col N="244" /> will not deter or discourage us from carrying out fully our security policies both in regard to internal security and cross-Border co-operation.  Nothing that has happened will lessen our commitment to do all in our power to defeat the forces of terrorism whatever its source or aims. I am convinced that our efforts in this regard will be enhanced by the restoration and growth of trust and confidence between the Garda Síochána and the RUC.  I cannot at this stage say whether this will take a long or a short time.  I believe that it is in all our interests that it should be in the shortest time possible.  We have done nothing and will do nothing to impair the process of return to good relations.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter to which I want to refer briefly, that is the question of the incursion that occurred on 12 December 1982 at a time when it is understood that two RUC officers were given approval by their superior officers to cross the Border into the Republic.  As has been stated already, this was one of the matters raised at the Anglo-Irish Conference, and at the resumed meeting of the conference yesterday.  We have been advised by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland of the circumstances of this incursion.  We were told that the two officers who made the crossing were in plain clothes, were unarmed and in an unmarked car without a radio.  We were told that the incursion was not pre-planned, not part of any deliberate or authorised system of incursion.  We were told it was for observation purposes only.  The British Government accept fully that this incursion was wrong and regrettable, and it is their intention that it should not happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment later on Mr. King's speech as delivered by the Minister because that is precisely what he has done.  The Minister has lifted chunks of Mr. King's speech in the House of Commons earlier today and read it into the record of this House without question or carrying out any critical analysis at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> In opening the debate this morning the Taoiseach had this to say:</P>
    <P>Let me say before concluding how important it has been that the Government, in presenting our case to the British Government, were able to count on the full backing of this House.</P>
    <P>That makes for a great change in this House.  We put through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, although one would not think so listening to speaker after speaker in this debate, with the exception of Deputy Blaney, and he is entitled, having held that view for a long time.  It was interesting to note that, when he spoke, he did not address the Government, he addressed these benches here as being, as he would see it, the prime instigators of the political efforts to find a solution in the North of Ireland and not the Government over there.  He is quite right to draw attention to the difference in attitude between Fianna Fáil in Government and in Opposition, including the disgraceful attack outside this country by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, trailing an inferiority complex going to Washington in the middle of delicate negotiations, trying to persuade the Friends of Ireland not to support the elected Irish Government in their efforts to bring peace and reconciliation to this country.  I am glad that at last they have come to their senses.  Deputy Dermot Ahern made a very good speech here about the value of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to the Nationalists in Northern Ireland and I advise the Taoiseach to read it carefully.</P>
    <P>A number of matters have been referred to in this debate, extradition, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the difference of opinion between the Attorneys General and the Birmingham Six, although it is hardly relevant to the subject under discussion.  Undoubtedly, the most important matter to be discussed this evening is the Stalker-Sampson report and the events that occurred in 1982.  When one of the police officers involved in 1982 revealed that there was an incursion across the Border and a <Col N="246" /> cover-up, the present Taoiseach summoned the British Ambassador of the day to explain matters.  I do not know if anybody on that side of the House reads what takes place in the Dáil or follows it up because on 5 April 1984 in Column 145 of the Official Report the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the verdict, the allegation of the cover up was raised with the British Ambassador at a meeting at which other aspects of the matter were also raised.  The ambassador was also informed of the seriousness with which the Government viewed these allegations.  The ambassador said the allegations of the cover up were being fully investigated by his authorities and would be conveyed to us as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>That is almost four years ago but it was not raised at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference last week. Why did they not pursue the results of that at every single meeting of the Conference which took place since it was set up?  When I was co-chairman these matters were raised and I was told at the time that they were tied up in the Stalker affair but that we would be given a response to that investigation.  We were also promised the result of investigations into incursions to this State.  The Minister got the result of the investigation yesterday from Mr. King who referred to it in the House of Commons this evening. I do not know why the Minister did not tell the House how unsatisfactory he found Mr. King's remarks in the House of Commons instead of reading, word for word, what Mr. King said. Mr. King said that two RUC officers were given approval to cross the Border into the Republic, according to the Minister for Justice, but very shortly afterwards the Minister said there was no pre-planned incursion.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister got a copy of Mr. King's statement earlier today or maybe even last night and I should like to ask if he pointed out to the British <Col N="247" /> authorities the seriousness of the contradiction by a Minister who is undermining the relationship between the two countries by that kind of statement in the House of Commons today.  Have the Taoiseach, the Minister or the respective Departments pointed out to the British authorities how inadequate that kind of response is and what damage a contradiction like that can do to Anglo-Irish relations?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice also read Mr. King's comments in relation to the Stalker-Sampson affair.  The exact same words were used by the Minister this evening as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland used in the House of Commons earlier on.  He said that the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary today announced that he has invited the Chief Constable for Staffordshire, Mr. Charles Kelly, to consider whether disciplinary charges should be brought in the case of the RUC officers of chief superintendent rank and below and, if so, what charge would be appropriate.  This man will merely consider whether charges should be brought but there is a further step beyond that in which there may be a hearing.  Will we see another three years of investigation while the Stalker affair and its damaging effects continue?  Its effects are not just damaging to Anglo-Irish relations and to the confidence of the minority in the security forces but to the morale of the RUC while officers of senior rank are at their head against whom there is evidence to suggest a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.  How long more will we hear about charges being brought?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice also quoted Mr. King's remarks about the Police Authority in Northern Ireland being the disciplinary authority for those above chief superintendent.  Those of the rank of chief superintendent and below were probably carrying out orders but above that were the policy makers.  Will we have to wait while the Police Authority consider this or until a chief constable is appointed to consider whether charges <Col N="248" /> should be brought?  Have the Government done anything in the past 24 hours to point out to the British Government how irresponsible and unsatisfactory their approach is?</P>
    <P>I have been stressing the importance of the Stalker affair for the last 12 months, since we left office.  Last June I made a speech in Limerick in which I said what the Government should be doing for the next year in Anglo-Irish relations.  I referred to the Stalker affair, how damaging it was to Anglo-Irish relations and that something should be done about it. In the summer the newspapers reported that this was being taken off the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.  I referred to this matter in further speeches, in questions in the Dáil and in the Estimates speeches.  Six weeks ago I said that no political sleight-of-hand regarding the Stalker affair would satisfy the Irish people and that it must be kept on the agenda of the conference.  One can see what has happened.  It was not on the agenda and the Government have shamefully neglected to keep the Stalker-Sampson affair on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know it is true.  On 3 September last I wrote to the co-chairman of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs; it was a private letter and this is the first time it has been made public.  I said that his comments after the last conference, that the Stalker affair would no longer be on the agenda of the conference, was causing deep disquiet in Northern Ireland and that many Nationalists, both North and South were extremely disturbed about the events surrounding the so-called shoot-to-kill policy.  I added that these people were given to understand and to expect that those responsible would be brought to justice by the investigating authority, particularly because of the appointment of someone of the calibre of John Stalker.  I said he must be aware that these were not matters purely <Col N="249" /> for the Home Secretary in London.  I said they were matters relating to Northern Ireland, to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and that they must be retained on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to me on 11 September last and, in relation to the Stalker-Sampson affair, he did not deny my charge that it was taken off the agenda.  He said I had referred to the Stalker-Sampson report and that he had been assured the Northern Ireland DPP had not yet reached a decision on the question of prosecution. He said he was concerned about the whole range of issues surrounding the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and that it was essential, from all points of view, that the matter be cleared up as quickly as possible.  There was no denial of my charge that the matter had been taken off the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The indifferent and lazy approach by the Government to the Anglo-Irish Agreement is directly responsible for many of the problems we now have.  Immediately after my speeches, and the correspondence with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Government started to leak through the Government Press Secretary to political journalists how much better Mr. Lenihan was getting on with Mr. King compared to the relationship with Peter Barry, what a nice fellow the British found Brian Lenihan to be as opposed to Peter Barry whom they found to be confrontational. Now we see the result of the cosy relationship that has existed for the last six months of 1987 in regard to the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and the lack of response from the British Government to our legitimate demands under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the attitude of Fianna Fáil in Opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement is affecting the thinking of the British Government.  They considered that because of Fianna Fáil's attitude in the two years before the change of Government the Agreement would be allowed to wither away, to quote Deputy Blaney quoting somebody on the far side <Col N="250" /> of the House.  They do not know Fianna Fáil as well as we know them.  They do not know that what they say in Opposition they rarely do in Government and that what they say in Government they quickly forget when in Opposition.  That would be good political crack in the normal course of events but this issue is much too serious.  We must remember that in the last 20 years 3,000 people in Northern Ireland have lost their lives and that virtually every family there has been affected one way or other by violence. Violence in Northern Ireland has cost us huge sums of money.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will recall that the New Ireland Forum attempted to quantify that cost.  The extra cost of security in 1986 over 1985 because of the violence in the North of Ireland was £160 million.  We estimated that we lost in the region of £1 billion in tourism revenue over the last 20 years because of the violence.  They are serious losses to us in our efforts to develop our economy, but far more serious are the wedges that have been driven between the two traditions on this island.  It was to redress that, flowing out of the New Ireland Forum, to which all constitutional parties in the House gave their support, that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was put into place.  It was an effort to reconcile the traditions on this island and bring an end to violence.</P>
    <P>In my view the Agreement had all the possibilities of doing that if it had been worked as enthusiastically in the last 12 months as it had been in the first two years of its existence.  I regret to have to say that an Irish Government could so neglect their obligations under an agreement that was so clearly of benefit to the Nationalist minority in the North of Ireland whom we frequently pay lip service to and just as frequently forget about.  Deputy Ahern bore witness to the benefit of the Agreement to the Nationalists.</P>
    <P>We must have a more adult attitude towards the British.  There is a section of our community who believe that Britbashing is a type of sport they can indulge in without doing us any harm.  We are a sovereign independent State and we do <Col N="251" /> not have to apologise to anyone for anything.  We can introduce laws which must be respected by other sovereign States. There is no necessity for the unfortunate attack which the Minister for Justice made on the British Attorney General in the last few weeks.  I am glad that the Taoiseach today dissociated himself indirectly from that attack.  There is no necessity for the childish behaviour of the Minister for Tourism in scampering over the Border on a &ldquo;private&rdquo; visit accompanied by television crews and reporters.  That type of immature behaviour does not do much for the possibility of having an adult relationship with a country that is not going to go away. Whether we like it or not there will be an island next door to us for all time.  We have common interests and we have problems that need solution and most of them relate to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have the framework in the Anglo-Irish Agreement for resolving those problems.  I regret that the events of the last four weeks should have been interpreted by some &mdash; I do not share that interpretation &mdash; as being capable of damaging the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I regret that the advantages that had been building up for the Agreement when we left office have been allowed to drift away because of the inattention by the Government to the possibilities of improving the lot of Northern Ireland Nationalists through the Agreement.  Our concern on this side of the House is to see the Anglo-Irish Agreement worked fully.  We want to see regular meetings of the Conference and the items I have listed dealt with.  The Stalker-Sampson affair has not gone away; it has been long-fingered again. We want to get the report we were promised on the cover-up referred to in the trial of 1984.  We want a more satisfactory response to the incursion into the State referred to by the Secretary of State in the British House of Commons today. We want to recommence the building of confidence in the police force which both countries are obliged to do under the Agreement.  We want to build confidence in the administration of justice in the <Col N="252" /> North of Ireland.  We want regular meetings of the Conference so that these matters can be tackled.</P>
    <P>We want to remove from the political agenda down here the kind of hysterics and attempts by some Members to use the Nationalists in Northern Ireland for their own political benefit.  That is not just common to the party opposite; it has been used in other places.  Our concern must be to see that the Nationalists in the North of Ireland can live a normal life and can be treated as equal.  We want to see the fear lifted from the lives of the Unionists.  We want to see relations between the two traditions on this island evolve without the men of violence having the opportunity to feed fears and suspicions on both sides.  One can understand how the fears and suspicions exist on both sides when one hears the Minister for Justice refer to their willingness to bring in large quantities of arms.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Taoiseach to use the influence he is alleged to have with the leader of the Libyan people and tell him that we do not want him interfering in our affairs, that we do not want him supplying arms to either one of our traditions.  He should tell him that we will have to break off diplomatic relations unless he stops those pursuits forthwith. The Anglo-Irish Agreement is a framework that can solve most of the problems of this island if it is worked with enthusiasm and dedication and is not allowed to drift along on the basis that if we do not have anything better to do we will operate it.  The Agreement must be worked at every day addressing the issues listed in the communiqué and in the Agreement.  We must never again be in the position where we will be debating the incidents that have caused such suspicion on both sides of the Irish Sea in the last 12 months.  The Government have the prime obligation in regard to that and I charge them to fulfil that obligation now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage there is a temptation for me to follow Deputy Barry and others down paths which I think might only be counter-productive. <Col N="253" /> I shall try to resist.  I would have to say, however, to Deputy Barry in all sincerity and honesty that for four years when he was the Minister responsible the Stalker report and all it entailed was brought to finality.  He did not succeed in having anything done about it, either through the Intergovernmental Conference or in any other way.  I do not think that it is credible for him now to attempt to say to this Government that we are lacking in zeal in regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>I will try to deal with the points raised in the debate and will do so, if I can, in a way that will maintain the broad consensus which prevailed generally today.  There are two aspects of this affair with which I might be expected to deal. One is the suggestion that this Government were not active enough through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Intergovernmental Conference to achieve progress on various issues.  The other matter is the question mark about security co-operation and whether there was an attempt to use security co-operation as a bargaining weapon or a card to be played in these affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it is just not true to say that we have not been active in putting forward views and proposals under the agreement as we are entitled to do.  It is easy and facile enough to say that, but there is one simple answer I could give to that whole contention.  No amount of activity in the conference could possibly have headed off the sudden, unexpected, unpredictable announcement by the British Attorney General in the House of Commons on 25 January.  Deputy Barry and others would have to admit that this is the position.  The one aspect of which everybody was agreed in relation to that announcement is that it was unheralded, unpredictable and not anticipated by anybody.  It is hardly valid in those circumstances to suggest that if we had been more assiduous in the conference we could have headed off this announcement.  That is just not true.  Nobody with any sense of responsibility &mdash; and certainly not Deputy Barry &mdash; could possibly <Col N="254" /> have anticipated or expected that this announcement was suddenly to be made.</P>
    <P>I can also prove very easily from the records that we did, in fact, avail of the procedures and mechanisms of the Intergovernmental Conference to the greatest possible extent.  I would have no doubt in saying that any impartial examination of the events, both when Deputy Peter Barry was co-chairman and when Deputy Brian Lenihan was co-chairman, would show that the level of activity continued without any great change.  We certainly used the conference actively and forcefully on a daily basis to convey our views to the British on a whole range of issues such as incursions, overflights, the towers in South Armagh, fair employment and cross-Border economic co-operation. The list is there and I am quite prepared to stand over our record in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the next question which is very much the key to the whole discussion today, i.e. security co-operation.  I thought I had put the matter very clearly today in my statement.  I set out the principles which guided us and the fact that we had two priorities, namely, the security of this State and our obligation to take all possible measures open to us to protect the lives, welfare and security of all the people in Northern Ireland.  These are the two principles to which we adhere and in my statement this morning I outlined exactly how we intended to adhere to them.  Security co-operation will continue.  We could not attempt, in view of our obligations as a civilised nation but perhaps more important in view of our obligation to the people of Northern Ireland, the Nationalist community and the Unionist community, to use security co-operation in any way as a bargaining counter.  That would be immoral.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry and others have been so adamant about the Stalker-Sampson report and the need for publication and action that I cannot understand how they could not accept and acknowledge that failure by the British Government to act in this regard will damage the quality of security co-operation.  It is bound to.  As far as we are concerned there will be no interference with the mechanical operations of security.  They must and will continue. In regard to the motivation for the quality of co-operation, I said and now repeat that the failure of the British Government to deal in particular with the matter of prosecutions must affect that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was criticised by Deputy Spring because he seemed to suggest that I had said matters had reached an impasse and nothing more.  I certainly did state, both in Brussels and here, that Anglo-Irish relations had reached an impasse on these issues.  I could have fudged that matter. I could have used diplomatic language and resorted to euphemisms and said that discussion was ongoing, that we were pursuing these matters and so on.  I did not want to do that because I wanted to give this House a full, complete and accurate picture of the state of affairs.  The simple truth is that in so far as these issues are concerned we are at an impasse.  There is no progress.  Certainly, the statement by the British Home Secretary in the House of Commons today did not bring <Col N="256" /> matters any further.  Several speakers, including Deputy Dukes, said that disciplinary action alone in this area will not suffice.  I also say that we are not going to leave matters where they are.  I have to acknowledge that we are at an impasse, but inherent in my acknowledgement is the necessity for us to take matters further, to avail of every possible opportunity, the Anglo-Irish Conference, bi-lateral, European Parliament, world opinion, every other vehicle open to us to resolve this impasse and to get Anglo-Irish relations moving forward on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>There was also some discussion about extradition.  In response to Deputy Blaney I must say that he was a member of the Government with me when we passed into law the 1965 Extradition Act. Deputy Blaney was a full, able and articulate member of that Government when the 1965 Act was passed, and that Act had no safeguards in it.  It was not just extradition, it was complete backing of warrants.  With the way the Supreme Court decision went, by the time we came to 1987, the political exception or the political offence had practically disappeared so that now having regard to the situation created by the decision of the Supreme Court the legislation we passed in 1987 puts Irish citizens in a far better, safer position than they were in under the 1965 Act and the subsequent Supreme Court decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring and Deputy Dukes wanted some clarification of the position of the Attorney General.  I do not want to say anything here that could exacerbate the situation, add fuel to the fire or create any further difficulties, but the position is absolutely crystal clear with regard to the respective positions of the two Attorneys General.  Up until these matters broke on the scene, the British Attorney General was quite clear and adamant in the view that he was not going to supply the sort of evidence and statements that our Attorney General would need under our legislation.  The last letter in existence is a letter from the Irish Attorney General to the British Attorney General setting out the position <Col N="257" /> and trying to resolve the difficulties that had arisen.  That is as far as I want to go in that area.  I hope I have satisfied Deputy Spring in that regard.</P>
    <P>Somebody on the other side of the House suggested that we were not doing anything to mobilise international opinion.  The simple answer to that is the very cogent resolution passed by the European Parliament at the instigation of Deputy Paddy Lalor.  That was perhaps the most direct and important step that could be taken to mobilise international public opinion on this issue.  We have been very active in other respects as well. American public opinion is quite alert to what is happening and is indeed quite favourable to the position of the Irish Government in the matter.  In that regard the criticism of us is not valid.</P>
    <P>The question of a lack of consultation was also raised, and again I reject criticisms in that regard.  It is difficult to understand why in the middle of this situation the British Government could come forward with their proposal about the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  It seems to me &mdash; and most Members of the House who know about legislation and parliamentary affairs would agree &mdash; that what is apparently proposed by the British Government is of a technical parliamentary nature, that the legislation will still be there in place, it will be reviewed annually and in effect nothing changes, except the psychological factor of the signing that it should be permanent legislation, if that is what they have in mind.  Why the British Government should decide to throw that additional spanner into the works at this stage is beyond comprehension.  I can only repeat what I said this morning, that we have been in touch about the matter and we are assured that we will have an opportunity to put forward our views before the legislation is finally decided.  We will certainly avail of that opportunity.  The British Government should realise that this legislation is a major irritant.  It is something which Irish people, law-abiding Irish people, both here and in Britain bitterly resent, because they see it as selective and discriminatory and aimed <Col N="258" /> against them.  We will put that point forward very strongly to the British Government when we avail of the opportunity afforded to discuss the matter.  I do not want to enter into a political debate at this stage because I am very anxious that the House would come to a unanimous conclusion on this and would unanimously accept the resolution which we put forward in all good faith on the basis that it had universal agreement.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to deal in a very nonpartisan way with the points put forward and to give whatever reassurances I can at this stage to the House.  I would like to claim this credit, that this Government have arranged this debate because we know that Deputies and the public are deeply concerned about these matters.  The House will have to agree that we have given the fullest possible information we can.  We have made all aspects of this available to the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Limerick Hospital Proposed Closure: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Molloy on Tuesday, 16 February 1988:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, disturbed at the <Col N="261" /> implications of the proposed closure of Barrington's Hospital, Limerick; mindful of the fact that it is a major public hospital facility in the mid-west region, with the busiest out-patient department outside Dublin city, treating approximately 45,000 patients annually, and being open 24 hours a day, seven days a week with 80 per cent of its in-patients being public patients; and in view of the fact that it is a highly cost-efficient hospital and that its facilities will have to be replicated elsewhere at heavy cost to the Exchequer, directs the Minister for Health to rescind his proposal to close the hospital from 31st March, 1988, since such an action is not justified on either financial, medical or social grounds.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>To add to the Motion:</P>
    <P>that if, however, in the opinion of the Minister for Health, the rationalisation of the health service in Limerick requires the closure of a voluntary hospital, Dáil Éireann considers that St. John's Hospital, rather than Barringtons Hospital should be closed, and in the event of such closure, Dáil Éireann being aware that private medical interests have offered to purchase St. John's Hospital with a view to keeping it in operation as a private hospital calls on the Minister not to inhibit this, or any other initiative along the lines.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I regret, as I said previously on the Adjournment matter, the decision by Fianna Fáil and the Government to close Barringtons hospital in Limerick.  It was a wrong decision and I do not think the Minister's speech last night has done anything to change it.  It was wrong on financial, social and medical grounds.  I spoke here previously on the Adjournment two weeks ago and not only did I draw attention to the virtues of Barringtons hospital, an excellent hospital, but I outlined my objections to the decision.  I would like to recite some of them again tonight for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly worried about the manner in which the decision was taken. I know from my experience in Government that Comhairle na nOspidéil had drawn up a list of hospitals to be rationalised and that they said either St. John's, Limerick, or Barringtons, Limerick should go in an amalgamation of both <Col N="263" /> hospitals.  Deputy Barry Desmond was Minister for Health then.  In a press statement he issued he referred to a number of the memoranda submitted to Government.  He recommended that St. John's hospital be closed in this rationalisation. I find it difficult to understand how the Department who recommended this to the previous Minister can now recommend the alternative to the present Minister.</P>
    <P>In November last year permission was given to take on student nurses as Deputy O'Malley said last night.  That would have been for a three-year course.  Surely one does not get permission to do that and then, four weeks later, to close the institution that is supposed to train them.  In October we debated here the Estimates that were presented by the Minister for Finance.  There were cutbacks in the allocation for both St. John's and Barringtons but an allocation was provided for both which would have been sufficient to run the hospitals for 12 months.  An amount of £1.6 million was allocated for Barringtons hospital.</P>
    <P>On 1 December the Minister came into this House and answered questions.  He gave no explanation last night which solved the question of why the Minister implied in this House that all announcements of a closure of acute beds had been made, that there were no surprises up his sleeve, but one week afterwards we got the decision that Barringtons hospital was to close.  The way the decision was taken is peculiar to say the least.  Any of us who have had experience in Government know that is not the way in which decisions are taken and that there is something the Minister has not told us about.  We are not getting the full information from him.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the ground covered by other speakers last night as my time is limited.  I have just ten minutes to outline the virtues of Barringtons hospital.  It is sufficient to say everybody in Limerick would recognise the virtues of the hospital, with an efficient medical staff that, over centuries, has provided an excellent health service, <Col N="264" /> marvellous nursing care, and in particular an enormous service as a public casualty hospital seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  This is the aspect of the decision which has caused such emotion in the city. While many people are hospitalised, many more go through casualty and in a year like last year when over 40,000 people received treatment in casualty in Barringtons hospital, is it any wonder that there is an outcry at the closure of the hospital?</P>
    <P>There is agreement, I think, not only in Limerick but in this House, that the wrong decision was made, so what would have been the right decision?  If the Minister felt he had to rationalise the health services in Limerick by closing a voluntary hospital he should have closed the other hospital, and people have said that here as well.  We have written that into the amendment we moved last night and we want it added to the motion.  If we think the wrong hospital is to be closed, we should not be afraid to say so and if we want to vote on something we should vote on the real solution.  Simplistic solutions to complex problems will not work and we should put our cards on the table, say what we mean, mean what we say and vote accordingly.  We know there has to be rationalisation of hospitals and if a hospital has to go in my city I think it should be St. John's rather than Barringtons.</P>
    <P>We have been heavily criticised for putting down this amendment but was anybody surprised?  Deputy Dukes, the Leader of our party, said in his Tallaght speech that we would put forward alternatives when we disagreed with Government decisions.  Did we not do this right through the last session of the Dáil?  In all logic can anybody be surprised that we put forward an alternative in our amendment?  On top of that we say that a private interest have already put a bid on the table for St. John's hospital.  We know that is the reality of the situation and if the formula we are putting forward is followed we can retain the three hospitals in my city &mdash; two as a charge on the public purse as public hospitals and one as a private hospital &mdash; not a luxury <Col N="265" /> Blackrock Clinic, which will cater for B and C VHI patients &mdash; and give approximately 80 or 90 beds at no extra charge to the Exchequer.  That is the solution and we have put forward that solution in this case as we have done on other occasions.  This is the straight and honest thing to do and I reject the criticisms of other parties that we were motivated by any other consideration.</P>
    <P>A protest vote in this House which calls on the Minister to keep Barringtons hospital open is not the solution when the Minister has said time and again, and on several occasions to me that regardless of how that vote goes, he will close the hospital.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy O'Malley say on the radio that it would be unconstitutional to ignore Private Members' time.  I remember that during the Fieldcrest debate on 29 and 30 June 1982 when Fianna Fáil were in Government, and Deputy O'Malley was a Minister in Cabinet, a motion was passed in this House during Private Members' time and the Government took no notice whatsoever of it. Are Fieldcrest nationalised?  He is the man who was in Cabinet and who has said it would be unconstitutional to ignore Private Members' time.</P>

I heard about the posters in the last election that said: &ldquo;Dessie can do it&rdquo;.  Maybe Deputy Noonan wants his name on the top of the next poster saying, &ldquo;Michael can do it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Looking at the debate from the outside, far away from Limerick and taking an objective view and considering the various propositions put before the House, I have to say, in relation to what Deputy Noonan has said about retaining St. John's hospital and letting Barringtons close, that St. John's hospital have already refused to sell their hospital to private interests.  It is presumptuous of the Deputy, of us or anybody else to assume that.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for an outsider with a totally objective view to try to make up his mind as to which way and in which direction various people are going.  I do not intend to get into the internal problems of the Progressive Democrats or of Fine Gael and who stands for what. Deputy Allen moved an amendment and spoke about it and yet when all the furore about the North Infirmary in Cork was going on we heard nothing from Deputy Allen.  I can understand the Limerick Deputies only because the hospital is in their constituency but being the people of high principles that they are I find their line very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to some of the phrases Deputy O'Malley used last night and they were very interesting.  He said <Col N="269" /> that Deputies in this House cannot have it both ways.  I think it is fair and reasonable to throw that back at Deputy O'Malley and say to him and his party &ldquo;You cannot have it both ways either, you cannot have your loaf and eat it.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Malley and his party know well the basis on which that party were founded. We all read with interest their election programme.  We know where their support came from.  It is very difficult to know in what direction they are facing. They want to get personal taxation down. That is a very laudable objective and one to which I would totally subscribe.  But Deputy O'Malley and everyone in his party knows as well as I do that there is no realistic way you can get personal income taxation down unless you cut overheads and expenditure.  There are two ways in which the Government get money, by borrowing and by way of taxation.  Where are you going to get the money?  You either have to cut your overheads, as any common sense businessman would do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is easy to throw out a figure off the top of your head.  The Deputy said it would cost £2 million to close the hospital but he did not back that up.  He spoke about the finances and <Col N="270" /> economics of keeping it open and yet he failed to elaborate on this magic £2 million.  It does not stand up and the Deputy knows that.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to get into the medical side of this question.  I have the fullest confidence in Deputy O'Hanlon to assess that aspect.  He is a practitioner in that area and he knows a hell of a lot more about it than I do so I will confine myself more to the financial side.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon is not a man, as Deputy O'Malley asserted in this House last night, to toss up a coin to see whether Barringtons hospital or St. John's hospital would close.  That is not the way Deputy Rory O'Hanlon does his business.  It is not the way he has done his business since he became Minister for Health.  He has had the courage of his convictions to stand up, knowing, as Deputy Clohessy rightly pointed out, that the party is over and that the day of reckoning has come and we have to pay for it.  If Barringtons hospital was situated in Dundalk, Wexford or Waterford and was closing down, would Deputy O'Malley come in here and set down a Private Members' motion?  I do not believe he would.  Deputy O'Malley sold himself and his party to the Irish people as men of integrity, righteousness and men who would stand up and take the tough decisions irrespective of the consequences.  Is it a fact that the Progressive Democrats are not what they said they were when they set out?  It is a fact that when they began to look at the political reality of what was happening in this House they changed course, which we were told they would never do?  Indeed, I am inclined to take that view at present, having read what Deputy Harney said in Cork very recently, that they were now moving towards the working class area.</P>

When I heard the statement made last night by Deputy O'Malley I wondered whether it was the Des O'Malley I used to know and sit around the table with, because what I heard him say last night was not the Des O'Malley I used to hear, to be quite open and honest about it.  A previous Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, closed a hospital in my town when I was in Opposition.  He will testify to this day that I did not come into Dáil Éireann and put down a Private Members' motion, or take the matter to the Fianna Fáil front bench so that I would get a Private Members' motion.  I did not put down special questions because I recognised the reality of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I deal with realities.  I deal in common sense.  There are three hospitals in Limerick, a city the size of Tallaght.  Deputy Harney lives out there and represents that constituency.  Is that party asking for those hospitals to be retained with more or less the same services in a city with the same population as Tallaght, despite the fact that in this city of Dublin which has over a million people there are two hospitals, north and south?  I did not see anybody coming into this House creating such an uproar when the Dublin hospitals were closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> I know the hype that the hospital charges got.  I know the hype that went on all over the place.  In fact, I visited a hospital on the southside of Dublin on the day the hospital charges were introduced.  I went in for an X-ray and paid my £10.  The little girl who took the £10 had a stack of money that high on the desk.  It was 4.45 p.m. and she was counting it out.  I asked her what all the money was for and she said &ldquo;that is what I got from collecting the £10 today&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid my £10, got my X-ray and left.  I sat into my car to drive away at 5.5 p.m. and I heard on a radio programme that no hospital charges were collected anywhere in the Eastern Health Board region on that particular day.  Yet, that little lady who took the £10 from everybody who came in had told me when I asked her that not a single person had cribbed about the charges.</P>
      <P>Action was taken by Deputy O'Hanlon with regard to abuse of hospital and ambulance services &mdash; and we all know that the ambulance services were abused in this city and in some cases used for rural transport.  Is that the way the Progressive Democrats would like the management of this economy to continue? I do not believe it for one minute and everybody knows full well that if this hospital was not closing in Deputy O'Malley's backyard he would not and neither would he allow his party to come in here with a notice of motion.  It is as simple as that.  They are the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality.  Let us come back to the job we are trying to do and where it impinges on reducing the health services.  If Deputy Molloy thinks I have not looked at any facts or figures, I ask him, because of his interest in the cost of our health services, to research and compare the cost of a public hospital bed in the UK with the cost of a public hospital bed here.  He would see exactly what the Minister is setting out to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided practically the same amount of money this year as last year.  The Deputy and everybody in this House know we cannot go on indefinitely spending money.  Where are we going to get it?  This service mushroomed but not with the right management in place which would have ensured value for money.  Very few Deputies with their hands on the hearts could say that we were getting the best value for money from our health services because we are not.  We had the highest rate of bed occupancy in Europe.  A start must be made not alone in the health services but in every other service.  That is exactly what this Government have been about since they came to office.</P>

If the country had been allowed to proceed along that road, there would not be enough money from taxation even to service the interest on the national debt which had doubled in four and a half years.  The actions taken were necessary.  When they hurt there will be screams from certain Deputies but the day of reckoning has come.

      <P>I shall address my final comments to people who should know more about what I am talking about, that is, the need to cut public expenditure, the need to get this economy back on the rails because it had gone off the rails. This exercise is only part of that.  We brought in a budget in 1987 with targets <Col N="278" /> at which people just sniggered, that the prophets said could not be attained.  They were achieved and not alone achieved but surpassed by £72 million.  That brought a return of confidence and the outflow of capital was reversed.  Interest rates came down and the inflation rate was the lowest in 20 years.  Trading accounts had a surplus for the second time and were heading for the greatest surplus of all time.</P>

      <P>Ballyforan had £20 million spent on it and the Coalition Government decided to scrap it.  The Opposition stand indicted on Ballyforan.  This is not the place to start throwing things.  They get thrown back.  Deputy Desmond O'Malley, Leader of the Progressive Democrats, should know what cutting public expenditure is all about.  He should understand what getting the economy back into shape is all about, should understand about changing the mould of Irish politics &mdash; what he set out to do.  In 11 months he has changed it all right; he set out on one road and has taken a different signpost.  I do not know where he stands, neither do those who supported him at the beginning.  It is not surprising that his support is disappearing as quickly as it appeared.  Deputy Harney <Col N="279" /> would try to move the party towards the left.  I do not know whether Deputy Molloy would move it towards the left or right.  Deputy Clohessy was the only sensible Deputy that I heard speak from that party last night.  He recognises the reality.  He as a constituency TD, will be making a case for Barringtons hospital, but making it in a different way from the colleagues in his own party.  His colleagues have a brazen neck to try to preach financial rectitude, the policy they reneged on.</P>

No sensible person could expect three hospitals to remain serving that area with £1.3 million to be spent on Barringtons hospital and a wild unsubstantiated statement of £2 million as the cost to close it.  The medical side and the social side were dealt with quite adequately, concisely and coherently by my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon.  No one should presume to tell us to ask that St. John's hospital be put up for sale.  The authorities took a decision not to sell it. That is their prerogative.  There stands the case and I fully support the Minister. This country will thank us at the end of the day for restoring normality, common sense and pragmatism to a health service that had gone wrong and for getting better value for money.</P>

I would suggest that now there are lies, damn lies, and Fianna Fáil health policy.  The experience of the country over the past 12 months shows clearly that what passes for health policy under this Administration is a sick joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party seek tonight to use this debate to lodge the strongest possible protest at the absence of any rational, sensible or even compassionate approach to the maintenance of our health services. I can best illustrate current Government policy in this area and the false propaganda which surrounds it by referring to a letter which I received in the past two days from two consultant physicians in my own constituency.  Both doctors, responsible as they are for medical care in Wexford General Hospital, make the point that the proposed closure of 24 acute medical beds will have a serious and catastrophic effect on the acute medical services in Wexford General Hospital and its catchment area.  They sincerely believe it is not workable and it will be impossible to give a service with this number of beds and that there is no way they can discharge patients any earlier without grave and potentially fatal consequences.  These remarks are not the comments of any wide-eyed political activist or political ideologue.  These are the genuine views of two senior members of the medical profession who are deeply worried by the developments which are <Col N="281" /> taking place in the health services in this country.</P>
    <P>This same attack is visible in every county in Ireland from Carlow, where I was last Thursday, to Kilkenny which is losing the gynaecology wing of St. Luke's general hospital, to Ardkeen in Waterford.  There is a crisis unfolding which threatens the well-being of the people of this whole country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce contributed to this debate in a most disgraceful fashion.  He flippantly addressed the issue.  In the few comments he made on the health issue he said it was a pruning of wasteful transport.  I am dealing with cases in Wexford of women in the late stages of pregnancy hitching in for pre-natal care to Wexford General Hospital.  I am dealing with people who are faced with bills which they simply cannot afford, and the Minister says nobody is cribbing over the health charges.  I do not know where the Minister is living.</P>
    <P>In the brief and infamous period this time last year when Fine Gael occupied the Cabinet room on their own, they introduced a budget which, among its other effects, cut the health budget to the bone.  That Estimate for Health was adopted by Fianna Fáil when that party came into office, and the situation was exacerbated to an intolerable degree in Fianna Fáil's Book of Estimates for that year when they cut a total of £72 million from an already seriously depleted health budget.</P>
    <P>I mention the successive budgetary cuts to make the point that the callous and irrational approach of Fianna Fáil to the health services has been compounded by the total hypocrisy of Fine Gael in relation to this whole issue.  Nowhere has that hypocrisy been more evident than in relation to the motion before this House tonight.  We have seen rivers of crocodile tears flowing from the Fine Gael benches in relation to Barringtons hospital.  Those crocodile tears cannot conceal the fact that it was Fine Gael who set up Barringtons hospital for the fate that is befalling it.  These are the basic facts.  When Deputy Barry Desmond was Minister for <Col N="282" /> Health the allocation to Barringtons increased from £1.789 million to £2.164 million.  The Fine Gael budget, adopted by Fianna Fáil, slashed that allocation by over 15 per cent in real terms to £1.897 million.  The 1988 Estimate reduced the allocation for Barringtons further to £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. John's hospital, the figures are the following: from 1982 to end of 1986 the allocation increased from £1.825 million to £2.037 million.  Fine Gael slashed the allocation by over 30 per cent in real terms to £1.588 million. The 1988 Estimate cut it still further to £1.3 million.  These are the irrefutable facts that demonstrate that even before Fianna Fáil had made up their mind about what to do in Limerick Fine Gael had shown them the way.  They do, in fairness, indicate clearly that Fine Gael would have closed St. John's first.  It was the St. John's budget that took the major cut in the Fine Gael budget, but they clearly embarked on a path which could only end in the closure of both hospitals.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that Fine Gael have behaved with such breathtaking cynicism in relation to this issue.  Not only in Limerick but all over the country Fine Gael talk about how they would do things differently, how they would operate with more compassion and sensitivity within the same Estimate.  Their behaviour, when it comes to the opportunity presented to us tonight to beat the Government and keep Barringtons open, puts all that sensitivity into focus and shows the truth.  Of all the cynical actions we have seen from Fine Gael in their frantic anxiety to avoid defeating the Government, nothing caps the amendment they have placed on the Order Paper for tonight.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to members of Fine Gael who simply do not understand why their party are carrying a torch for private medicine.  There are many members of Fine Gael and many supporters of Fine Gael who can see only too clearly the emerging two-tier health service in our country.  They can see how private medicine encourages waiting lists to grow. <Col N="283" /> They can see how it robs the overall service of very scarce resources and they do not believe that their party have any mandate to encourage further developments in this trend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan spoke tonight about Labour Party hang-ups.  We have no hang-ups.  I invite him to address the fundamental issue that has to be faced tonight.  Do they want the Government defeated?  Do they want Barringtons to be kept open or do they want to play-act and amuse us again?  Who, I would like to ask, has given Fine Gael a mandate to campaign for the closure of St. John's? Who gave them or any other Opposition party the right to come before this House and say that one hospital rather than another should be closed?  There is no such mandate from the people of Limerick, as far as I am aware.  I know for a fact, and so does every Member of this House who reads his mail, that the people of this country as a whole have given no mandate to anyone to dismantle our health services in the crazy and irrational way that is happening now.</P>
    <P>Everything I have said about the major Opposition party reflects a view that I know is increasingly widely shared.  But I am prepared to take back everything I said, and to acknowledge the sincerity of that party's concern for the health service if they will withdraw the spurious and cynical amendment before the House.  I would appeal to them to do so, and to join with the rest of the Opposition in ensuring that real pressure on the Government to keep Barringtons open is kept up.</P>
    <P>We should be under no illusion about what is happening to our health service.  It is essentially a cynical political exercise. Fianna Fáil are manipulating the inbuilt majority they have to cut and hack at public expenditure, and particularly the health service, together with other essential social services which we provide.  The captive majority which Fianna Fáil are manipulating may squirm, but they made a present of that majority to Fianna Fáil in Tallaght in the autumn of last year, <Col N="284" /> and Fianna Fáil are making the most of it.</P>
    <P>However, they are not doing so because they believe, as a matter of principle, that a leaner, fitter health service is in the national interest.  We all know that there are areas in the health service where substantial savings can be made &mdash; the continuing scandal of the common contract comes to mind.  Basically, Fianna Fáil do not care what kind of health service they have as long as its cheap.  They do not care how many highly-paid professionals are allowed to maximise their own earnings at the expense of the poorest sections of the community, as long as they do not have to foot the bill.  The consequence is that every day, beds, wards, whole floors of public hospitals are closing down.  The only growth area in health is among the suppliers of deep-pile carpet; which is now being sold by the square mile as public wards are dressed up to attract private patients.</P>
    <P>While this is happening, all of us in this House know of cases where families are being made to wait for months for simple tests, unless they can cough up £200 or more.  Our health service, which ought to be a national asset, is becoming a national disgrace, thanks to the conspiracy of collusion between the two largest political parties.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by placing some additional views on the record of the House.  They are not mine: they are the views of the group of consultants that offered to buy St. John's hospital.  They were contained in a letter that group sent to the Leader of the Labour Party.  In that letter, they said:</P>
    <P>We would far prefer to see the <i>status quo</i> maintained and the Regional, Barringtons, and St. Johns kept open and all facilities there used...from various Government statements we understood that St. Johns Hospital was to close.  It was for this reason that we offered to purchase St. Johns from the Governors...we have no interest whatsoever in establishing a luxury private hospital.  Our interest is to provide <Col N="285" /> for our current patients the same care which we can make available to them at present in the three hospitals in Limerick.</P>
    <P>If I take that letter at face value, and there is no reason why I should not, it says only one thing to every Member on the Opposition benches of this House &mdash; withdraw the spurious and cynical amendment in the name of the Fine Gael Party and vote to put pressure on the Government.  If it will assist Fine Gael, the Labour Party will withdraw their amendment so that the decks are cleared and there is just one issue &mdash; the motion in the name of the Progressive Democrats, a clear instruction from Dáil Éireann to keep Barringtons open.  I will withdraw the Labour Party amendment in that spirit so that we can have a united front, drop ideologies and keep Barringtons open.  I invite and beseech Fine Gael to find their conscience and do that honourable thing tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason this issue has arisen in this form tonight is that in the Estimates for 1988 which were adopted by this House &mdash; our party voted against them &mdash; there was a cut of £8.5 million in the hospital services for the mid-west region.  The Minister must implement that cut and he has decided, in the process, to close Barringtons hospital.  Tonight, as we talk, that policy is being implemented.  The Limerick Regional Hospital, with many specialties, will have 78 beds closed as of tonight.  Barringtons will be closed and probably privatised thereafter either as a nursing home or a private hospital.  The allocation to St. John's has been cut by £750,000 since I left office and it has lost about 30 beds.  It now has to survive on a much reduced budget.  In St. Camillus hospital, 30 beds have been closed in the paediatric unit; in Croom where there is a new orthopaedic centre 25 or 28 beds are being closed tonight; in Nenagh 30 beds have been closed; in Ennis the <Col N="286" /> number of beds has been reduced from 127 to 96 and in Caharcalla 30 maternity beds have been closed.</P>
      <P>The reality is that out of 1,200 beds that the Minister talked about last night 341, including Barringtons, will be closed.  That is the net effect of a reduction in the budget of £8.5 million for the mid-west region, including health boards and voluntary hospitals.  As a consequence of that, elective surgery for all practical purposes is being abandoned. As the Minister knows, orthopaedic lists in the area are growing, gynaecology services are being restricted, geriatric admissions to voluntary hospitals are down and in the regional hospital people are being turned away except in an emergency. That is the reality of health cuts.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister, this is not a transfer of services.  There are no services being transferred.  The budget for Barringtons has been cut from £1.6 million to £400,000 and staff are being fired.  This is not rationalisation of services.  It is not amalgamation of two voluntary hospitals. I effectively amalgamated two hospitals in Cork, the South Infirmary and the Victoria Hospital.  That example could have been followed in Limerick.  It was a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>There is being a deliberate cut of 90 acute consultant-staffed public beds out of the system because the Minister must find £1.2 million and he has opted for the nearest target &mdash; Barringtons.  Last night the Minister said I had been ambiguous about it.  I want to say to the Minister, and confirm to my colleagues with whom I was in Government, that I never proposed the closure of either Barringtons or St. John's.  I have two Government memoranda before me, one dated 6 January which led to my resignation.  It states that the Minister for Health will not accept the non-capital figure emerging from the draft Government decisions.  I resigned as a result because I knew that the inevitable outcome of a non-capital figure of that size would lead to the closure of the hospital we are talking about tonight and the kind of two-tier health system which is burgeoning in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. John's will have to operate as a <Col N="287" /> private hospital.  Its budget will be down to £1.3 million compared to £2 million when I was in office in 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that, like all my colleagues in Government at that time, if I did not get a hospital budget of sufficient magnitude to maintain services in that region the vulnerable hospital was St. John's, the hospital of lesser activity and I would have to close it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Noonan I want to say that in 1984, 1985 and 1986 these debates took place rigorously and trenchantly in Government and I got the money.  We kept the hospitals open.  I was pilloried in the Dáil for some of the rationalisation which I implemented on a more reasonable basis.  I was shocked the Minister did not, for example, amalgamate the two hospitals &mdash; as he could have done &mdash; even with a much reduced budget.  He could have effectively brought about amalgamation and kept the hospitals open.  St. John's will now have their activities reduced further, then half-privatised and Barringtons will be sold off.  As the Minister well knows we spent £500,000 on St. John's &mdash; the floors were falling in, they had no fire escape, we know all the horrors about it, and the Department spent £500,000 to keep St. John's going.  We bought houses on either side of Barringtons &mdash; to keep its expansion possibility alive &mdash; when the <Col N="288" /> hospitals could have been kept going on a reasonable basis.  But what happened? The health board budget has been slashed.  Seventy-eight beds are gone in the Regional hospital.  Two Ministers in Cabinet are in an acute state in relation to both Ennis and Nenagh and the allocations to both those hospitals will be cut because the Minister has got to try to carve out some money, give it to the health board to keep them struggling along.  That is the Minister's problem.</P>
    <P>I am simply saying that the budget for the mid-west region is not adequate. Equally I am saying there is no justification for taking out 340 acute consultant staffed beds in the region.  I say to the Minister that he should go and get the reports from his systems analyst sitting across from him, that there is no recommendation for such closures.  The departmental review has never said that there is an excess of acute hospital beds in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What seems and what is in departmental language can be dramatically different, as the Minister well knows.  Indeed Comhairle na nOspidéal have carried out a full scale review of the mid-west region.  Comhairle na nOspidéal have not said that there is an excess of acute hospital beds in the mid-west region.  We have this nonsense of coming in here talking about Limerick city.  It is not Limerick city we are talking about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about Limerick city, Limerick county, the county of Clare and North Tipperary, the region.  These hospitals serve that region to quite an extent.  I make an appeal to the Minister.  I have no objection to an amalgamation of the two voluntary hospitals.  If the health boards do not agree they can be told in crude terms: there is your budget, we are bringing <Col N="289" /> about an amalgamation and, if they are of a different ethos, so what?  I had a different ethos in the Victoria hospital and the South Infirmary in Cork.  They now run together on one budget, one budget centre, one section of acute beds, one degree or set of consultant staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister: this type of departmental Rambo-cutting by people who want to prove themselves to the Minister &mdash; I exclude those present with him this evening &mdash; is unacceptable. It is not rational, it is not amalgamation and is most unfortunate in timing.</P>
      <P>The policy enunciated by the Minister this evening is one which can be changed irrespective of the vote here this evening. We cannot support the contrived motion before the House from the Fine Gael Party.  Without in any way imputing motives in this matter, I can support the closure of St. John's hospital.  I went into Cabinet in December, 1982 and stayed there until 20 January, 1987.  In that period we kept St. John's hospital open. Even if there is private work being done in it it is still a public voluntary hospital. There is a group of rapacious consultants in Limerick who have not got a private hospital all to themselves yet; they will get two of them at the rate we are going. Because of that I cannot support that amendment.  I know that in the process the Government, if they abstain &mdash; as they now appear to do &mdash; on the first vote and then vote against the composite motion, it will be game, set and match for them on this issue.  Be that as it may, we are not going to be held responsible for the outcome of that decision.</P>
      <P>I implore the Minister to change his mind.  He can amalgamate the hospitals on a very controlled budget.  Why, in the name of God, do we have to put up for public auction Barringtons building&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will be allowed a minute from the next speaker as well which would give me five minutes.  I am grateful to Deputies Howlin, Desmond and the Labour Party for being sufficiently magnanimous in giving me time to contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing Limerick East I support the motion before this House which is short, clear, direct and unambiguous.  It reflects exactly the wishes of the people in relation to Barringtons hospital.  It also reflects exactly the wishes of the Barringtons hospital action committee.  For those reasons I cannot support the Fine Gael amendment.  Indeed I am disappointed and saddened that there is such an amendment before the House this evening.  That amendment is unnecessary and introduces extraneous matters which may well become issues at some future date. Nobody can say what the future holds for St. John's hospital; it may well become a private hospital at some future date.</P>
      <P>I see no reason whatsoever this House should encourage a concept of privatisation in health, medicine and the future development of a two-tier system of health services.  To introduce the issue of the privatisation of St. John's hospital into the matter of Barringtons hospital serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Indeed it is mischievous, cynical and is designed to split the opposition to the closure of Barringtons hospital, thereby allowing the Government to succeed with their plans to close that hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that the people who elected us to this House are not fools.  Certainly the people of Limerick will not be fooled by the manoeuvrings and brinkmanship in this House last evening and again this evening.  They know exactly what is going on.  The people of Limerick will not allow themselves be <Col N="291" /> fooled on this issue.  They believe that some powerful and influential interests have been at work in bringing about the closure of Barringtons hospital.  Contrary to what some people in this House may foolishly think or believe, this is not some trivial, local, petty, hole-in-the corner issue which will blow away in a few days. That is the rock some people will perish on if they think so.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about this: there will be a price to be paid if Barringtons hospital is allowed to close and that price will be high and painful.  The people of Limerick, especially the poor, will pay a price in terms of long journeys and long queues to the Regional hospital outside the city.  But the matter will not stop there.  Limerick East is one of the most volatile constituencies in the country; I should know that, I learned the hard way how volatile it is.  Indeed in the last general election two former Deputies of this House learned an even more painful lesson.  Deputies will learn a lesson in the future in relation to Barringtons hospital. I am not a prophet but I predict that a price will be paid in political terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Government and also the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about the crusade on which they have embarked to cut costs, save money, to try to introduce public accountability and value for money into public spending.  These are all laudable concepts; I go down that road with them. As a Socialist I go along with those concepts 100 per cent.  I believe in proper accountability and value for money. Nonetheless, one must ask oneself, how far have the Government gone?  There appears to be no crusade on the part of the Government in regard to unpaid income tax and value-added-tax.  There was a long list of tax defaulters published in most of the newspapers last week.  I am sure if the names of all tax defaulters had been published it would have taken up all of the space in all the newspapers, because they included clergymen, business people, professional people, including a judge, and many more so-called pillars of society.  If half those people paid <Col N="292" /> half their taxes all the hospitals could probably be kept open.  However, there is no crusade in relation to going after those people.  We have a selective morality.  Indeed, Lester Piggott, the champion jockey, is serving a prison sentence in Britain for tax evasion.  If he was in this country he would probably get a nomination for the Seanad because that is what we think of people like that.  Do not be fooled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To close Barringtons is a slap in the face to the people of Limerick because nobody there has supported its closure.  Some people have remained silent and their silence is significant but they have not spoken out in favour of closure.  Barringtons hospital has a good record of public service in the city, it has never closed its doors in its 100 years history and it has never turned its back on anybody.  This is a crunch issue for Barringtons and the people of Limerick and I will not turn our backs on the hospital.  If it is allowed to close, its spectre will haunt Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in Limerick for years to come.  Barringtons will remain a monument to broken promises, of which we had plenty in the last election campaign.  A power struggle is taking place in the House this evening.  I am not interested in power struggles, I lost my seat in the past on a certain issue and I would willingly do it again tomorrow to keep Barringtons hospital open.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, made it clear that prior to Fianna Fáil assuming office in March last year, there was no decision by the Department of Health or by the previous Administration on the closure of either Barringtons or St. John's.  I should like to reiterate that this is a fact.  Consequently, I was amazed to see that Deputy Desmond issued a statement which might be interpreted as an indication that there was a decision on his part as Minister for Health that St. John's would be closed. This, of course, is simply not the case and I welcome the opportunity to put the record straight on this point.  What Deputy Desmond referred to in his statement was his response to the Government of the day as to the likely impact of the allocation which the Coalition Government were proposing for health in 1986.  The possible closure of St. John's was simply listed to illustrate the effect which the proposed allocation for 1986 might have on the health services.  It was not a decision to close St. John's and it is erroneous to even suggest that it was.</P>

They will not be fired, as stated by Deputy Desmond.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the attitude of the Opposition on this issue.  In Limerick there are a number of hospitals within a few miles of one another and three more hospitals within 25 miles of the city, at Ennis, Nenagh and Croom. The area is generally acknowledged to be over-provided with acute hospital beds and it was clearly necessary that considerable rationalisation was needed.  In Limerick, there are two small voluntary hospitals within 400 yards of each other and it was evident that one of them would have to be phased out as a public voluntary hospital.  For all the very good reasons which the Minister outlined last night, he decided that St. John's is the most appropriate institution to be retained as a public hospital.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Fine Gael Party have accepted the inevitable and seem to accept that both hospitals could not continue to receive public funds although they argued that Barringtons should be retained instead of St. John's.  The attitude of the Labour Party does not surprise me but the stance taken by the Progressive Democrats is most surprising.  This is the party who preached the gospel of fiscal rectitude and campaigned in the most strident terms for a reduction in public expenditure.  This is the prescription they advocated for the economy at large and, of course, they are correct in this.  The Government are taking this course very successfully but the Progressive Democrats are not prepared to take hard decisions.</P>

      <P>I share my party colleagues' consternation at the Minister's decision to close Barringtons hospital despite the unanimous opinion in Limerick and the local region that this is the wrong decision to take.  It is absolutely daft when the local regional hospital is already so sorely stretched to imagine that it can easily absorb the thousands <Col N="295" /> of additional patients who must descend upon its doors if this retrograde move to close Barringtons goes ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, from local sources, that already a pattern is emerging in the regional hospital of discharging patients earlier than is advisable so as to free beds in anticipation of the extra demands that will be made on them if the Government get their way in relation to Barringtons. Nobody in the locality wishes to see any hospital close and there is an understandable emotional and job based interest in such an attitude.  However, the Progressive Democrats accept the pressure on the public finances and our stance is not unreasonable.  We do not claim that no hospital should close in Limerick but the wrong hospital has been chosen. Everybody in the region knew and believed for some time that St. John's faced closure and, so advanced was the assumption, that a group of local consultants made an offer of £1 million last autumn for the purchase of the hospital. This would have come to pass and only the extraordinary decision of the Minister to fly in the face of all local advice and the formal stance of his own Department on this matter brings us to this unacceptable position here tonight.  The substance of the Fine Gael amendment is totally unnecessary because they know full well that if they were to withdraw their amendment that what they are looking for precisely would come to pass. However, given that the Minister wants to retain St. John's as a public hospital and to close Barringtons, it is obvious that the real effect of the Fine Gael amendment is to underwrite the Government's stance.  This is the case because Fine Gael know full well that their motion cannot be carried and this House is left with no other conclusion but that the Fine Gael amendment is deliberately phrased to divide the Opposition parties and allow the Government to survive unscathed. This kind of play acting will fool nobody, we can either reduce this House to the role of a debating society or we can have <Col N="296" /> real issues and national policies determined by pushing matters to a vote of Members.</P>
    <P>Given the minority status of the Government, the Opposition benches have the power at any time to force the reverse of Government policy.  Of course, to do this on every issue that arises would be wrong.  Look at the situation facing us this evening.  It is the stated policy of all Opposition parties that Barringtons hospital should be retained in the public health arena.  That is the issue on which the House should vote. Fine Gael are fully aware of the implications of their amendment, to divide the Opposition parties.  If they are serious, therefore, in their stated stance to want to save Barringtons, they should also be anxious to ensure that all Opposition parties will vote accordingly but to deliberately frame an amendment that will have the opposite effect is really too glib to cod anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to state that I am amazed that Fianna Fáil would send in a senior Minister, Deputy Reynolds, to act the clown for half an hour because he had no valid arguments to put in support of their move to close Barringtons.  The House would have much more interest in hearing from other Members of that party such as Deputies Willie O'Dea and Síle de Valera or, perhaps, the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence, all of whom have sat silent in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cynical advice being offered to the Progressive Democrats in the debate by the Minister Deputy O'Hanlon, and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, and Deputies Bernard Allen and Michael Noonan of Fine Gael can only be treated with the contempt it deserves.  Alone among the political parties, the Progressive Democrats were the only party to publish detailed policies showing for the first time how cuts in State spending in each Department could be effected.  We were attacked by Fianna Fáil who were then in Opposition and we were attacked by Fine Gael who were then in office as members of the most <Col N="297" /> spineless Government the country had ever seen.</P>
    <P>Deputies Allen and Noonan would do well to remember their U-turn on teachers' pay in 1986.  The Progressive Democrats stood alone in Opposition on that issue in supporting the Government of Labour and Fine Gael who, of course, later caved in.  Fianna Fáil, then in Opposition, promised the teachers that the full arbitrator's award would be paid if they were returned to office.  That was just one of the hundreds of cynical opportunistic promises of a once proud party which, after losing their identity, desperately craved support from any and every quarter in a last ditch bid to survive.</P>
    <P>It is really quite pathetic to see Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael spokesmen telling the Progressive Democrats what approach we should take on this issue in order to adhere to our party's firm commitment to cut out waste and inefficiency in the public service and to reduce the State's involvement in so many areas of our lives. What authority do they have?  What moral right do they have to give advice on this matter?  If one looks at their voting record in Dáil Éireann in the past few years one will see a litany of contradictions.</P>
    <P>What example are either of them giving now with the country in a bankrupt state?  Millions are spent maintaining 30 Ministers in a Parliament of 166 Members with expensive cars, expensive offices and helicopters at their disposal.  Hundreds of civil servants have been diverted to do only political work in constituency offices for those Ministers, some even travelling to their constituency to do political work on the ground and we have an expensive Seanad system duplicating the Dáil work.</P>

      <P>The scandal of waste and abuse of office continues.  The taxpayer is being robbed to maintain this corrupt <Col N="298" /> system and still these Ministers lecture, believing they have subdued the public and that angry youth will emigrate instead of demonstrating against them. The Progressive Democrats have not only set the agenda for fiscal rectitude, they have shown the way by deed and example.  We know who voted down our Bill dealing with Ministerial pensions &mdash; Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Time and time again we have voted with the Government on issues they would have opposed had they been the Opposition party.  We have voted with the Government on twice as many occasions as Fine Gael have since the change of Government last March.  Fianna Fáil never gave a fraction of that level of support to a Government proposal while in Opposition.  Time and again we have seen Fine Gael sit on their hands and abstain on votes against the Government.  The PDs opposed the most recent pay increases in the public service because the national finances should not be further strained with this additional burden.</P>
      <P>It was the Progressive Democrats who voted with the Government on this year's draft Estimates.  It was also our party who voted with the Government on budget night and who voted with the Government last week on the Broadcasting Bill. On all those occasions Fine Gael abstained.  So much for all their talk about constructive opposition.  Of course, they would also sit on their hands tonight if they could get away with it but they have done the next best thing in putting forward an amendment which they hope will divide the Opposition because they are terrified of the prospects of defeating the Government.  This is their shameless stance no matter how serious or how fundamental is the issue facing the House and all of us in our role as legislators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats know what they are doing.  Our support for Government measures is not blind support.  We will not support blunders and expensive alternatives as is being proposed in the case of Barringtons hospital.  In this House now we have Fianna Fáil, the wolf in sheep's clothing, and Fine Gael, the <Col N="299" /> sheep in sheep's clothing. That is the reality and it makes a sorry picture.</P>

      <P>It does not make economic sense to close Barringtons because it will cost more than £2 million to provide facilities at St. John's and the Regional hospital that are already available at Barringtons.  That is the kernel of the issue and the reason for our stance on it.  It does not make sense on medical grounds because the staff of St. John's do not have great experience in dealing with the type of cases that form a big proportion of the work at Barringtons.  Nursing staff at St. John's are not familiar with many types of accident work; they rarely took in accident cases but referred them to Barringtons.  The theatre in St. John's is old, having been built in 1932, and is very small.  A little gynaecological work was done there in recent years and hardly any serious surgical work.  Has it not already been announced that the pathology department is being transferred out of St. John's to the Regional?  Is it not true that 82 per cent of the huge number of cases dealt with at Barringtons are medical card holders?  How in the name of God can these patients expect to receive adequate treatment in St. John's where already 60 per cent of the patients are private?</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister gave his reasons for choosing St. John's and I want to reply to them briefly.  He said that St. John's is a more spacious site.  That is not a valid argument.  In fact, the sites are practically of equal size and Limerick Corporation have also zoned an additional one-third of an acre to facilitate expansion at Barringtons.  Also, two houses were purchased with Department funds recently to enlarge the casualty and outpatient departments and to provide physiotherapy and other facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point the Minister made was that St. John's is a larger building and that it has a capacity of 120 beds.  In fact, Barringtons has a bed capacity of <Col N="300" /> 150.  The Minister gave an incorrect figure last night of 90, not having taken into account the extra bed capacity available at the nurses home, which is a concrete structure within floors attached to the main hospital building.</P>
    <P>The third point the Minister made was that St. John's provides better potential for adapting to the changing needs of hospital medicine.  The first thing one could say in reply to that is, why go to the expense at all of adapting when all the facilities already exist in Barringtons?  The Minister says that St. John's has a unit which is well suited for the provision of day hospital services. However, surgeons who worked in this unit during 1986 and 1987 say that it is quite unsuitable for theatre work.  To provide additional theatres, X-ray rooms, and the other expensive equipment needed for a modern operating theatre at St. John's could cost up to £2 million.  That would be an extraordinary waste of public funds when all these facilities are already available at Barringtons and in excellent condition.  One wonders what kind of chaos will exist at St. John's on 1 April when it has to take on the workload of Barringtons if the Minister proceeds with his proposed closure on 31 March next.</P>
    <P>The fourth point the Minister made in support of his case was that the St. John's hospital building and services, are superior to those in Barringtons and this was largely due, he said, to the fact that £500,000 was spent on improvements in recent years.  He omitted to mention that the improvements in question were largely spent on improving wooden floors at St. John's which were in a critical state and could have forced the closure of that hospital.  There is no way that St. John's could be deemed to be comparable in standard with Barringtons where there are concrete floors.</P>
    <P>In arguing that £500,000 was spent on St. John's in recent years the Minister conveniently omitted to mention that £500,000 was also spent on providing modern facilities at Barringtons since <Col N="301" /> 1982.  Engineering and medical consultants alike do not agree with the Minister's contention that St. John's building and services are superior to those in Barringtons.</P>
    <P>The last point the Minister made was that the mechanical and electrical services at St. John's are better.  This is a strange contention indeed as mechanical and electrical services at Barringtons hospital were brought up to standard in 1983 in compliance with the Chief Fire Officer's recommendations and had been deemed by him to be fully satisfactory.</P>
    <P>It can be seen, therefore, that in all the points relied upon by the Minister in seeking to justify his decision, none of them stands up to close scrutiny.  A major blunder has been made here and it must be reversed by Dáil Éireann.  It is another typical case of bureaucracy gone wild, where the people who provide the services and would know best are not consulted at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister also makes some cost comparisons to try to justify his decision. These I now challenge as being false and inaccurate.  The actual revised 1987 figures on average weekly cost per occupied bed for the hospitals is, Barringtons, £656; St. John's, £683 and the Regional hospital, £749.  Those figures, which have been certified by an accountant, are 1987 figures.  The Minister does not give any source for his figures.</P>
    <P>The acid test on cost comparability is the cost per discharged patient and in regard to Barringtons, the Minister last night admitted that the figure was £447, as compared with £672 in St. John's Hospital.  That settles the argument on cost, because Barringtons Hospital is seen to be £225 per patient cheaper than St. John's.  It is clear that on medical, social and financial grounds the closure of Barringtons Hospital instead of St. John's just cannot be justified.</P>

      <P>The computer facilities used by the staff in the office of the Collector General are based mainly on the Revenue Commissioners' large-scale DPS 90/92T computer supplied by Honeywell Bull and an office-wide telecommunications network.  Of the 700 visual display units attached to the network, 85 are currently located at Teach Earlsfort together with 22 personal computers which support a range of additional local services.</P>
      <P>PRSI data are collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the operation of the PAYE system.  These data are forwarded to the Department of Social Welfare on magnetic tape on a regular basis to be incorporated into the computer records held in that Department.  Although the computers in the Department of Social Welfare are supplied by a different vendor there are no technical barriers to the transfer of data on this basis in either direction.</P>
      <P>The present arrangements for the periodic bulk transfer of data is the most appropriate because of the substantial volumes involved.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation sought to purchase the property in question in late 1983 but, because the proposed purchase would have implications for the planning for further developments at the adjacent State-owned Beggars Bush complex, it was not possible to agree terms for sale until late 1986.  The legal formalities, which are somewhat complex, have since been processed by the Chief State Solicitor and the Corporation's Law Agent and a draft deed of transfer has been sent to the latter for his approval.  It is expected that the transaction will be concluded at an early date.</P>
      <P>While I am anxious that the formalities be completed as soon as possible, I am not aware of any anxiety being expressed by the adjoining residents in regard to the above matter.</P>

I hope that all of these projects will be completed by mid-1988.</P>
      <P>A detailed interpretative plan for the jail is also being prepared.  This will cover such matters as exhibitions, special features and tour routes and will form a brief for the architects and engineers to plan the necessary site works.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 43 together.  As the House is aware, when the Commissioners of Public Works were given responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals, they commissioned a firm of planning consultants to carry out a study to assist them in the discharge of their statutory duty to manage and maintain the canals as a public amenity.  That study has been completed and the consultants' report has been received and is now being examined by myself and the commissioners.  I expect to be in a position to publish the report very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants have recommended a management strategy and put forward specific proposals as to how each section <Col N="134" /> of the canals, including those in the Dublin region, might be developed. When the commissioners have completed their examination of these proposals, they will be compiling their plans for works to be carried out, not only from their own resources but also, it is hoped, with the co-operation of the various local authorities and voluntary groups who have already made a valuable contribution towards the realisation of the potential of the canals from the amenity and tourism point of view.</P>
    <P>Apart from the canals, the Commissioners of Public Works also have responsibility for the Shannon Navigation which is already a well-known tourist amenity and which they will continue to maintain and improve within the limits of the resources available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the value of revenue collected by the VAT anti-evasion branch in the years referred to by the Deputy was £4,482,000.  This figure does not include amounts of approximately £9 million drawn to the attention of the Collector-General by the branch.  These amounts would have been included in the Collector-General's normal collection processes and no details are available as to the proportion actually collected.</P>
      <P>The work previously undertaken by the VAT anti-evasion branch will now be centralised under the Chief Inspector of Taxes who has carried out the bulk of this work in the past.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there will be no loss of revenue by this redeployment and that the redeployment is, in effect, a concentration of the anti-evasion drive into the more productive area of arrears collection.  I understand in fact that this re-organisation will result in increased Exchequer receipts in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concentration of resources is in line with the Government's commitment <Col N="136" /> in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to improve collection and enforcement, stamping out arrears and ensuring prompt payment of tax liabilities.</P>

      <P>The figure of £42 million for &ldquo;special or other agreed pay increases&rdquo; represents, in the main, the cost of the final phases of increases being implemented under Clause 3.2 of the 1986 Public Service Pay Agreement, e.g. the teachers' 10 per cent increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 52 together.  The Government's current decentralisation programme is based on the original list of centres selected in 1980 when decentralisation of Government Departments to provincial centres was <Col N="137" /> first proposed.  These centres are at Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The decision to confine the revived programme to the centres selected in 1980 was guided by the ready availability of sites in many of these locations, and the degree of preliminary planning which had been carried out regarding both the accommodation required and the staff to be transferred.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation programme now under way is an ambitious one, and the Government's present priority is its implementation.  The Government will however at a later date and in the light of the experience gained be in a position to consider representations from other centres, including Cork, as further locations for decentralised offices.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that Cork already benefits from Civil Service employment with almost 1,400 staff serving in the Departments of Agriculture (400), Social Welfare (160), Justice (160), Communications (90), Office of the Revenue Commissioners (400) and others (170).</P>

    <P>A further £11 million commitments were received during 1987 in respect of multi-regional telecommunications development projects which cannot be broken down on a Euro-constituency basis.</P>
    <P>In addition in 1987 commitments of £38 million, £19 million and £194 million were received in respect of the Star and Valoren Community Programmes and the National Programme of Community Interest &mdash; Roads Development, respectively.  It is not possible to determine in advance the amounts of ERDF assistance which will be applicable to individual areas within the Programmes.</P>
    <P>The criteria which my Department uses in choosing investments which are submitted for ERDF assistance are:</P>
    <P>(1)  The investment must be one which is eligible for ERDF assistance in accordance with the Fund Regulation.</P>
    <P>(2)  The investment must contribute to the development of the area in which it is situated.</P>
    <P>(3)  The investment must have the approval of the relevant Government Department.</P>
    <P>ERDF commitments were received for a total of 72 projects in the Euro-constituency of Connacht/Ulster in the years 1985, 1986 and 1987.  This figure excludes the multi-regional projects already referred to.  Details of all 72 projects are as follows:</P>

      <P>As a result of the overall cuts in public expenditure which are necessary if we are to get our public finances under control, certain jobs are no longer required.  Staff in these jobs are being offered redundancy on a voluntary basis or redeployment to other jobs and there is, therefore no question of replacing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other areas, however, it is necessary, again because of the financial constraints, that numbers and payroll costs <Col N="145" /> be reduced.  The early retirement scheme is designed to achieve this reduction and also to provide opportunity for redeployment of redundant staff where appropriate from areas where there is no longer any work for them.  It would be totally at variance with the objective of the scheme if the vacancies created by allowing early retirement at significant costs were to be filled by the general upgrading or effective promotion of serving staff.</P>

      <P>A lorry containing 500 gallons of petrol in a concealed compartment was seized in County Meath by Customs officers on 15 October 1987 and removed by them to the Customs compound at Ardee Road, Dundalk.  At approximately 10.25 p.m. that night a number of men entered the yard in which the vehicle was held, having cut the lock on the gate, and drove the vehicle and its contents out of the yard. In the course of this action the intruders caused damage to the Customs and Excise premises and to two official vehicles.

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that the only areas where general revaluations of all rateable valuations within a district have taken place <Col N="146" /> are: Dublin County Borough, 1908-1915; Waterford County Borough, 1924-1926; Galway Borough, The Urban District of Ballinasloe, and the Electoral Divisions of Clifden, Gort and Tuam Urban, 1946-1950; Buncrana Urban District, 1950.</P>
      <P>The initiative in requesting a general revaluation rests with each local authority and, apart from the areas I have mentioned, no other local authority has requested a general revaluation.</P>
      <P>The annual process of revising individual valuations of specific properties ensures that a very significant number of properties have their rateable valuations revised each year.  The Deputy will be aware that the Valuation (Amendment) Bill, 1987, now before the House introduces a new system of continuous revision of valuations.  Consideration is also being given to the introduction of a single modern statute covering all aspects of the valuation code.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an authority or inter agency group to control and manage the River Shannon has been the subject of debate for some time now.  There are so many interests involved in this vast natural waterway, not the least of which are navigation and drainage which fall directly within my brief as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, that the proposal has obvious merits.  Nevertheless, I feel, it would be futile to set up such a body without providing it with the means to devise and implement a comprehensive plan.  Further consideration is at present being given to the proposal, but regard must be had to the current financial situation.</P>

Until these proposals are formally presented to the Council of Ministers and their contents become known I am not in a position to comment as to Ireland's attitude to them.

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in so far as it is available is set out in the following tabular statements. It should be noted that the figures for uncollected industrial and commercial rates are preliminary and subject to verification against final statements to be submitted by local authorities in due course. The figures given for unpaid agricultural rates are in respect of 1982 and earlier years since the levying of rates on land was discontinued with effect from 1 January 1983.</P>

      <P>, <i>(Limerick West):</i> The person referred to was discharged from the Permanent Defence Force, after 14 years service, on 19.3.87.  As he was not discharged on the grounds of disability the minimum service requirement for the grant of a pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes in his case was 21 years.  He did, however, qualify for a gratuity under the scheme and this was paid to him on 13.4.87.</P>
      <P>Following his discharge he applied for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts.  It is hoped to convey a decision on this application at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools industry link scheme based at Coláiste Eoin, Finglas, was funded by the Department of Labour through the Youth Employment Agency which provided approximately £12,000 for the scheme for each year from 1983 to 1986.  When this funding was discontinued at the end of 1986, because in the view of the labour agencies it was primarily a school based intervention, my <Col N="177" /> Department, as an exceptional matter, made an allocation of £10,000 to the scheme.</P>
      <P>No specific provision has been made for this scheme in the funds available to my Department in 1988.  I have, however, asked my Department to give every consideration to any case made by SILS for funding in the event of additional funds, for this type of activity becoming available as part of European Community initiatives.</P>
