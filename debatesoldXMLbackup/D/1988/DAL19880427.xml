    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="2142" /> SECTION 2</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;at or in the vicinity of any port or airport or the Land Frontier&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When progress was reported we had pretty well exhausted the discussion on this matter. The Bill as drafted confines the new powers being conferred on officers of the Customs and Excise to officers carrying out their duties at or in the vicinity of any port or airport or the land frontier.  There were two points which I made on this matter.  First, seeing that there are now so many ports and quite a number of small airports in this island country of ours and since this Bill does not distinguish between coastal ports and river ports on a wide interpretation of this section it could be taken to apply anywhere in the country.  For example, in the city of Dublin where one third of the population live, if one lives on the north side they are in the vicinity of Dublin airport, if they live in the centre city they are in the vicinity of Dublin port, if they live on the south side of the city they are in the vicinity of Dún Laoghaire and if they live on the west side of the city they are in the vicinity of Baldonnel.  It is difficult not to be near water in this country and where there is water there are boats.  Therefore, on a wide interpretation of this section it could be taken to apply to anywhere in the country.  If that is the case why not say that the Customs and Excise officers can exercise their powers anywhere within the country and why insert a restriction if no restriction is intended?  That is one interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Customs and Excise officers operate widely around the country. For example, Customs and Excise officers who are based at the land frontier <Col N="2143" /> on the Border do not confine their activities to the vicinity of the Border and quite frequently they become involved in activities far down the road to Dublin. What would happen if in the course of carrying out their duties they stopped a truck 30 miles from the border and, arising from a discovery of drugs, the defence subsequently argued that the Customs and Excise officers exceeded their powers because they were not operating in the vicinity of the land frontier or of a port or airport?  This is the exact opposite of the first point I have raised.</P>
    <P>I think it would be better to clear up this problem now rather than have it subsequently cleared up in court.  We should delete the words &ldquo;at or in the vicinity of any port or airport or the Land Frontier&rdquo;. This would mean that Customs and Excise officers would be able to exercise these powers anywhere in the country.  I believe that that should be the position. I do not believe that we should put the pretence of a restriction on officers of the Customs and Excise as I do not believe there would be any restriction on them. They can and will legitimately operate anywhere in the country.  The question as to whether they will be required to operate widely throughout the country on their normal daily activities does not arise as that is an internal matter.  For reasons of clarity and to take any pretence out of the Bill I propose that we delete the words as indicated in amendment No. 3 and then there would be no doubt about the import of section 2 and the new powers being given to Customs and Excise officers could be validly exercised anywhere within the State.</P>

      <P>The last day the Minister and Deputy Noonan indicated that because the intent of the amendments is in fact opposite they would have to be taken separately.  However, a Cheann Comhairle, I would go along with your <Col N="2144" /> feeling on the matter in that as they deal with the same issue it would be useful to discuss them together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment which seeks to achieve the very opposite of Deputy Noonan's amendment reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 3, on subsection (1), line 31, to delete &ldquo;the vicinity of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The net effect of this amendment would be to confine Customs and Excise officers to the specific geographical areas of their duties, namely, ports, airports or within the territorial frontier.  The ambiguities of the definition make it an unworkable formula.  Given the extraordinary powers we are conferring on Customs and Excise officers, given the fact that the Government do not propose a scheme of regulation similar to the one which applies to members of the Garda Síochána and given that we consider that their job is specific to the very definition contained in the name of Customs and Excise we believe they should be specifically confined rather than be given the broadest possible geographical scope, namely, the entire country.  We are poles apart from the proposers of amendment No. 3.  We say that we should be specific and clear in delineating the extent to which these powers can be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in the first intervention this morning on the amendments to express very deeply felt regret that the <Col N="2145" /> Minister of State has allowed the Government to agree to a guillotine on this debate.  Very intense concern has been expressed at all stages of this Bill about the impact of the provisions of the Bill and I think the Minister is fully aware and appreciative of that fact.  It is very regrettable that the 22 amendments still outstanding and to be decided upon are now being compressed into a two-hour or two-and-a-half hour debate this morning. I do not understand it.  We had experience in the last week or two of debating similar pieces of legislation on under-age drinking.  I wonder if the Minister would explain at some stage the necessity for this guillotine.  Why is he running away&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter as to how the measure should be dealt with has been decided earlier by this House and the Deputy should apply his remarks to the amendments under discussion.  The matter as to how we shall proceed has been determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that entirely although I regret it.  I wondered if the Minister could indicate the need for limiting the debate.  I do not understand it. There are very important amendments to be discussed but I accept what you have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined in very general terms the reason we approached this section in the way we did.  The basic principle is that no officer, peace officer, customs officer or otherwise, has a general power to operate.  We bestow on them their powers and authority.  In every legislation where we seek to give the Garda the teeth to deal with a problem, we must bestow on them the powers of arrest, of search and so on.  The general principles of freedom of the citizen from interference, from stop, from search and ultimate arrest and detention apply.  In considering the formula of powers sought to be introduced in the Bill we have had already a very wide-ranging debate on who will have these powers and it is not necessary to go back over them.  It is agreed, certainly on the Opposition <Col N="2146" /> benches, and the Minister has not fully dealt with this problem, that the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and the person who can use these powers is exceptionally widely drafted.  It has to be borne in mind how far geographically one allows those powers to be utilised.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that realistic powers and policing authority should be given at ports and points of entry to the country to deal not only with drug traffickers but also with the meeter and greeter at the airport, the person who is used as the pass-over.  The point has to be made that the fundamental arm of the authority of the State for dealing with drug dealing and trafficking is the Garda Síochána.  It is the departure from that scenario which is incorporated and embodied in this Bill that is of concern.  There must be major co-operation, consultation and on-going discussions between the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise, leading to a situation where, whenever an operation of surveillance, policing or detection involves substantial departure from the port, airport, or the land frontier, it must be under the guidance and supervision of the Garda Síochána.  They are the people with the expertise, the training, the discipline and the answerability to measure up to things that may go wrong, confrontations that may arise, or complaints that may emanate from these kinds of operations.  That training, experience, resource or answerability does not currently exist within Customs and Excise and it is not envisaged that it will be introduced.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally important to state that, if an operation of surveillance of detection goes beyond the immediate area of work traditionally confined to Customs and Excise, there must be a very active involvement, to the level of supervision, by the Garda Síochána, particularly when one realises and appreciates the extent of the powers being afforded to these people in the broad definition of what a customs officer is.  That is why we say there should not be writ at large.  Using the term &ldquo;in the vicinity of&rdquo; in no way effectively contrains the operation of Customs and <Col N="2147" /> Excise officers within our territory, given the large number of airports, aerodromes and ports that now exist.</P>
    <P>We do not agree with the point made by Deputy Noonan that virtually everywhere in the country is within the vicinity of one or other of those areas.  We say that powers, exceptional and extraordinary, as they are being given to Customs and Excise should be given in very clearly defined terms and that the clarity, which is what we should be looking for, must lead towards restriction rather than towards a writ at large.  Given the primacy of the Garda Síochána with all of their resources, that in no way could be seen to act as an undue restriction, an impediment or an interference with the effective workings of the Bill.  For that reason I hope the House will support the amendment of The Workers' Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are taking both amendments together I think it is fair to say that both of them would have diametrically different effects.  I will deal with amendment No. 3 first.  As I have already indicated to the House, the net effect of section 2 on the existing powers of search of the customs service it to allow searches of meeters and greeters to take place in the vicinity of a port, airport, or land frontier.  The customs service already have powers of search of travellers and of persons suspected of an exporting offence.</P>

    <P>On 2 March last Deputy Michael Noonan advanced a hypothetical case in which drugs were found in a vehicle which had crossed the Border but which was 30 miles into the State.  Existing powers of search would permit the search of such vehicle and its occupants for contraband, including drugs, since they would be, by definition, travellers.  The Government's intention here is that the powers of search without warrant already assigned to the Garda should logically extend to the customs service in respect of drugs in the vicinity of ports, airports or the land frontier, which is their focus of activity.  For these reasons, in addition to the question <Col N="2148" /> of the best application of the available resources, I ask the Deputy to take my point on this amendment.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 4 on which Deputy McCartan has spoken at length, it may appear that what I have to say is directly at variance with what I said on amendment No. 3 put down by Deputy Noonan but that is not the case.  While Deputy Noonan's amendment is very expansive, The Workers' Party amendment is far too restrictive.  The text of the Bill represents a <i>via media</i> between these two extremes.</P>
    <P>Very careful consideration was given to the appropriate wording here.  I want the House to bear in mind that the principal gap in the authority's powers of personal search lies precisely in the area of meeters and greeters.  It is vital that this gap be plugged and that persons who are not themselves travellers can be searched as the section says &ldquo;in the vicinity of a point of entry to the State&rdquo;.  I recognise, of course, that one may state that this term is not absolutely precise but we can be certain that these powers would be used by the customs service with discretion and commonsense.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will recognise that an artificial constraint on the power of the customs officer to search a suspected receiver of drugs only within the legal boundaries of a port or airport or at the land frontier will be exploited to the full by drug smugglers and the position of a customs officer at the Border will be particularly ludicrous.  A meeter who wished to avoid search under this section as amended need only remove himself a short distance from the land frontier to be immune from search for drugs by a customs officer.</P>
    <P>I want to restate that the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recommended that these powers in relation to drugs be assigned to the customs service.  That Select Committee of this House sat for a long time and spent many hours putting that report together. We are acting on their recommendations and it is imperative that we move on this very quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> I want to emphasise that fears of abuse of these powers are groundless.  Deputies need have no fear that hordes of customs officers are going to descend on the farm hinterland of every point of entry into the State to search people for drugs willynilly on the strength of this section.  That will not happen.  As I have said, the present text of section 2 represents a good halfway house and balance.  Accordingly, I regret I have to reject these amendments.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I can appreciate the Minister's objections to Deputy McCartan's amendment.  To frame the section conferring the powers at the airport, or port, or land frontier is too restrictive.  The airport hotel would be an obvious example where drugs could be passed from one person to another, and within the terms of this amendment, customs officers could not function&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think so.  I think it is in the vicinity of the airport.  Of course, it depends which airport we are talking about.  I appreciate that customs officers will not abuse their powers.  We never called that into question, but the powers in the Bill should correspond to the Minister's assurances. There is a divergence between what the Minister is saying when he explains how the section will operate and what is in the Bill.  The hypothetical example I gave was of a vehicle being stopped by customs officers 30 miles from the Border.  Of course, under existing legislation, customs officers have powers to search the vehicle but I was not talking about searching a vehicle.  I was talking about searching the driver.  This section confers powers on customs officers to search a person if they consider it necessary.  They can detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search.  There are restrictions on the methods by which the person can be searched.  He will have to be told why he is being held.  A person being detained shall not be searched by an officer or <Col N="2150" /> person of the opposite sex.  Where the search of a person being detained involves the removal of clothing, other than headgear, a coat, jacket, gloves or similar article of clothing, no officer or person of the opposite sex shall be present.  As I said, I am not concerned about the powers to search lorries, because the customs officers already have these powers.  I am concerned about the power to search people under section 2 of this Bill.  This is where I can see difficulties arising.</P>
      <P>I am not making a political point because as far as I can see there is no level of public interest whatsoever in this Bill.  Once drugs and drug dealing are the targets, civil liberties are not a major concern, but I am interested in improving the Bill.  In my view this Bill is flawed.  If customs officers search a person 30 miles from the Border and the case goes to court, and if it can be proved that they did not search the person within the vicinity of a port, airport or land frontier, that will be an adequate defence to get that person free.  There may be egg on certain faces when these people walk out of court because of a technicality.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his officials are being less than generous in their attitude to these amendments.  The case being made from all sides of the House is sincere and is being made with conviction.  Neutral observers would argue that the case being made on this side is more convincing than the defence being made on the other side. The points we are making are not being explained away or refuted.  I cannot see why the Minister has to dig in his heels and insist that the draft put forward by his officials is the only one possible when a better draft is being advocated on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that that could not be Deputy Noonan's view taking into account his comments on previous amendments, but there is public concern about the extent of the powers being given in this legislation.  While it is often very difficult for us because the point can be made that we are going soft on the fight against drug traffickers, I am not happy about the record of the Customs and Excise service in the area of policing.  I remember a series of articles run in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few years ago which raised substantial questions about the extensive powers and the apparent heavy-handed way those powers were implemented in the seizure of motor cars, for example, and other goods.  I recall an eminent reporter in <i>The Irish Times</i> whose motor car had been held by the Customs and Excise service for many months and he did not, apparently, have any redress.</P>
      <P>There are many complaints about goods seized and it is almost impossible to get redress or to find anyone to whom one can appeal or ask if a correct decision had been made.  The powers of seizure and retention by the Customs and Excise service are so summary that it is often very difficult to come to terms with them and very difficult to seek redress ultimately. That has been my experience when I have had to deal with Customs and Excise cases.  There is a very important dimension of civil liberties involved in this debate.  It is not one we should run away from, and it is not one I would be prepared to run away from.  Because of the very short time available to us, I will not dwell any longer on that aspect except to say there is concern about it.  I believe that the imposition of a guillotine on the debate this morning is an effort to stem a growing tide of concern that has begun to develop.</P>

      <P>In legislation of this type the term &ldquo;in the vicinity of&rdquo; is incapable of precise definition.  As Deputy Noonan said, it will provide an opportunity for an out in many criminal prosecutions which will emanate from the legislation.  I have seen that happen in road traffic cases.  In one case the point being decided was whether the forecourt of the International Hotel in Dublin was or was not within the curtilage of the airport.  The prosecution and the defence produced mappers and engineers and there was a lot of argument about what was within and what was outside the public area.  I have no doubt that will be exploited in regard to the legislation before us.</P>
      <P>My approach is to restrict because of the extraordinary powers being given to officials.  We have adequate powers and resources vested in the Garda Síochána. Is there an area in the country which the Minister can name that is not within the vicinity of the land frontier, airport or port?  I do not believe there is.</P>

      <P>Such arguments will be trotted out when charges are brought before the courts under this legislation. Any legislative powers or authority introduced on the basis that they will be implemented with discretion and common sense must be called for what they are.  I have never heard a debate in the House when draconian and widesweeping powers of authority were being introduced without the suggestion being made that the Garda Síochána, or the people who would be exercising the powers, would do so undoubtedly with discretion and common sense.  That will be so in 99 per cent of cases but as legislators we have a duty to ensure that our legislation is fair, is balanced and respects the liberties of the individual and is not legislation that has to fall back on the discretion or common sense of the people implementing it.  There will be those whose discretion will not be like that of the Minister or mine and whose common sense will be anything but common.  It is those instances that we must take into consideration in our legislation.  The Minister has refused to give a precise definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.  He has refused to give a direction on supervision of the exercise of the powers used by the Garda Síochána and he has left us in the position that we must attempt to restrict as far as possible the exercise of those powers. Incidents will occur where discretion and common sense will not prevail and I am concerned about that.</P>

We have a function in that area.  There is a conflict between what is proposed in the Bill and what is interpreted by many people.  The section before us seeks to confer the same powers on Customs and Excise officers pertaining to the misuse of drugs as it does on the Garda Síochána.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should accept that a meeter or greeter at an airport could turn on his or her heels and run with or without the drugs.  Deputy Noonan's worries in those circumstances are valid because, if such a person hops into a car and drives off, what are the Customs and Excise officials to do?  Are they to give up the chase at a certain point because they have no longer any powers of search once they catch him or her?  If they catch such a person and carry out whatever searches they are authorised to do under the section, will they be valid searches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest a way of arriving at a <i>via media,</i> to use the Minister's phrase.  I suggest that section 2 (1) should read that an officer of Customs and Excise who with reasonable cause suspects that a person at or who recently has been in the vicinity of any port or airport and so on.  That would give the right of hot pursuit.  It would give Customs and Excise officers the right to chase.  It would <Col N="2156" /> mean that they would not have to give up at some stage in the chase because they might feel that they were no longer in the vicinity of the place where they had seen the meeter or greeter receive and take into his or her possession and put about his or her person, the drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's worry is a valid one and the Minister should allow for hot pursuit cases.  The way to do it is to extend the right not only to those who are at or in the vicinity of a port or airport but to those who have recently been in that vicinity.  In that event where a Customs and Excise officer sees a meeter or greeter driving away from the airport and knows what that person has been doing he can give chase, apprehend the individual and exercise his powers when he stops that person.  In my view that reasonable compromise would deal with the worries of Deputy Noonan and, at the same time, deal with the concern expresed by Deputy McCartan that the Minister is giving a very extended power to search any person anywhere in the country.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii) Nothing in section 2 (1) (i) will prevent the use of X-ray equipment, in carrying out a search, if in the opinion of an officer of Customs and Excise there is reasonable cause for its use.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is the most significant in the Bill and we have been discussing it for the past half an hour.  The powers being conferred are those to search persons and also the powers to search any vehicles consequent on the stopping of a person.  Customs officers will be able to search persons if an individual customs officer considers it necessary for the purpose of preventing importation of drugs.  He will be empowered to detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search under certain conditions. I understand that the Minister already amended this section in the Seanad and has imposed further restrictions in regard to people being detained not being searched by a person of the opposite sex.</P>
      <P>The Minister also accepted amendment No. 2 (i) (C) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a search of a person being detained involves removal of clothing, other than headgear or a coat, jacket, glove or similar article of clothing, no officer or person of the opposite sex shall be present unless either that <Col N="2159" /> person is a designated medical practitioner or the officer considers that the presence of that person is necessary by reason of the violent conduct of the person to be searched.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 (i) (D) states that a search of a person may be carried out by a designated medical practitioner. Different kinds of searches are possible under powers conferred on the Garda Síochána, customs officers and other sections of the security forces, for example, prison officers.  It seems that when the Minister accepted these amendments in the Seanad he had in mind that, on occasions, a search would extend to intimate body searches.  If removal of clothing was not involved we would take it to mean that a person was simply emptying his or her pockets or being frisked by hand over their clothing as in a film when a gun is being searched for.  We are all familiar with the cinematic version of a person being searched up along the legs, down the back and round the front. That is one kind of search and the other is where the clothes are removed and searched individually by an officer.  The person's underwear is also searched because small quantities of drugs, which could cause great problems in the country, can be secreted in a very small space.</P>
    <P>Once the idea of a doctor being present is introduced and accepted by the Minister, we have gone beyond the removal of clothing, the search of clothing and the inspection of the naked body.  When a doctor is present, it seems to be envisaged that intimate body searches will take place.  Intimate body searches have been carried out in the prison system on occasions and they involve an examination of the orifices of the body.  If the orifices of the body are to be examined, it is proper that a medical practitioner should be present.  Indeed, the Minister goes so far as to say that the search may be carried out by a designated medical practitioner.  For the life of me, I cannot see why a doctor needs to be brought in to search somebody's clothes or to see if somebody's clothing is removed with dignity &mdash; if it is possible to remove one's <Col N="2160" /> clothing with dignity and appear naked in front of strangers.  The idea of a doctor being present must mean that there will be intimate body searches.  It is self-evident from the section and other Members may wonder why I am pressing the point. I am doing so because the Minister said previously that there was no question of the Bill involving intimate body searches. He said it was a total misinterpretation of the Bill and that it only involved searches of clothing and so on.</P>
    <P>My amendment might obviate the need for intimate body searching in many cases because I am asking that nothing in the section will prevent the use of X-ray equipment in carrying out a search if, in the opinion of an officer of Customs and Excise, there is reasonable cause for its use.  Someone could be X-rayed in cases where drugs are swallowed and this is an appropriate power to confer on officers of Customs and Excise.  It might, in practice, be a far more dignified method of search than the search of the orifices of the body as envisaged in the section as amended in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>If we went to the trouble we could all remember occasions when people were arrested.  We could all produce newspaper cuttings which show that such and such a person had swallowed cocaine in a plastic container and imported drugs into the country in that fashion.  Such stories and incidents have had common currency among police forces and officers of Customs and Excise.  Therefore, it seems one of the more obvious ways of bringing drugs into the country is to swallow the drug in some kind of sealed container which will not burst in one's stomach and kill one.  This has been practised extensively in the importation of narcotics.  Therefore, I am putting a saver into the section here where if in the opinion of a customs officer an X-ray is the appropriate way of searching a person, the designated medical practitioner may under section 2 (1) (b) (i) (D), X-ray the person.</P>
    <P>I am not as familiar with the abuse of drugs in this country as I was when I was Minister for Justice.  I am not sure how rampant the use of heroin is in inner city <Col N="2161" /> Dublin, for example, but certainly it was rampant in 1982 and into 1984.  Very strong action was taken at that time and people reputed to be leading drug importers got very extensive prison sentences, but I do not think the traffic has been stopped.  Nobody could say in this House or anywhere else that the actions I took as Minister and that the Garda took very effectively have prevented the importation of heroin, that there is not widespread abuse of heroine, for example, in the inner Dublin area and that that continues, although maybe in a less organised fashion.  Statistics from drug treatment units such as Jervis Street Hospital bear that out.</P>
    <P>Against that background it seems the answer I got from the Minister for Finance in reply to a question on Tuesday, 24 March, this year is surprising.  I asked the Minister for Finance the number of drug seizures made by officers of the Revenue Commissioners at or in the vicinity of &mdash; we are very familiar with that phrase now &mdash; ports, airports and the land frontiers in the years 1985-88 inclusive, the quantity and type of illegal drug seized on each occasion and if he would make a statement on the matter.  When I got the reply in tabulated form obviously that deprived me of the opportunity to comment or ask supplementary questions at Question Time because I did not know what was in it until after Question Time. It deals with cannabis, cannabis resin, cocaine, heroin and other drugs.  There were a certain number of seizures of cannabis, as one would expect.  Cocaine has never been a big problem in this country until recently.  Maybe it is an emerging problem now.  A combination of cocaine and its newer version, adulterated cocaine known as &ldquo;crack&rdquo;, may become an increasing problem.  Heroin is a problem and the drug problem here has always been heroin-related.  In my experience it was heroin one had to beat, particularly in Dublin city, if one was to make any kind of attack on the drug problem.</P>
    <P>Consider the number of seizures of heroin in 1985.  There were two seizures at or in the vicinity of Dublin Airport, 50 grammes in one and five grammes in <Col N="2162" /> another, and 50 grammes of heroin is a significant seizure.  At Cork Airport there were no seizures, Dublin Port no seizures, Cork Port no seizures, Rosslare Port no seizure.  In 1986 &mdash; I am confining myself to heroin again &mdash; there was one seizure at Dublin Airport of 28.54 grammes, again reasonably significant.  There was no seizure at Shannon Airport, no seizure at Cork Airport, no seizure at Dublin Port, no seizure at Cork Port, no seizure at Rosslare, Foynes or Kinsale. In 1987 at Dublin Airport there was one insignificant seizure, one gramme of heroin, at Shannon Airport, Dublin Port, Cork Port, Rosslare, Castletownbere, and Crosshaven no seizure.  In 1988 up to 22 March for which period information was available when I put down the question, at Dublin Airport, Dublin Port, Cork Port, Rosslare and Killybegs there was no seizure of heroin.  I am not too sure what the basis for the variation of the ports indicated in the table and whether that is where customs officers were active in drug prevention but there were no seizures.</P>
    <P>I want to pose two questions.  Is this an indication of a very low importation of heroin?  I do not believe that is right.  I think significant quantities of heroin are coming into the country and the evidence of that is on the streets.  If I am right and importation of heroin is significant &mdash; there is a significant level of addiction &mdash; how is it getting in?  Where is it coming from?  If it is coming through the authorised ports and airports, is it a problem with the law, staffing levels, practice, training or efficacy of the customs officers on duty?</P>
    <P>Where there is a problem on the ground, which problem I claim has diminished during the past three or four years, it is surprising, to say the least that the level of seizures is nugatory.  I would like the Minister's comments on that.  Should we look beyond the Bill?  If I put down a question next year when this Bill will have been in operation for 12 months, will we have similar statistics and a reply to the effect that no matter what powers Customs and Excise officers have they are so busy, that they have so many other <Col N="2163" /> things to do, that their information is so poor and that there is a lack of co-operation with police forces abroad?  Is that the explanation?  In effect, are we codding ourselves here?  Are we going through something of a charade?  Are we giving extra powers to people who over the past four years seized nothing of consequence except for the two seizures at Dublin Airport?</P>
    <P>I am asking the question in all sincerity. I am not making any kind of attack on customs officers who have a very difficult life.  It is curious that when the problem was still very serious, especially on the streets of Dublin, nothing of significance was seized at the ports by customs officers.  Could the Minister explain this? At the end of all our work and the time we have taken here, will nothing be seized either?</P>
    <P>We have talked about the problems along the Border and I have posed a hypothetical case of the difficulties there. As far as I can see, from the reply I have referred to there have been no seizures at all on the land frontier.  Is it reasonable to believe that no drugs are crossing the Border?  Certainly there are no seizures there.  Again, the Garda and the customs officers have problems along the Border other than drug smuggling, but it poses a bigger question and against that background I have doubts about the efficacy of what we are doing here.  The powers being conferred are necessary but I doubt if they will be any more effective than the powers which existed over the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>I am trying to strengthen this section. I think some drugs are imported as I suggested, by swallowing.  If those involved in searching, especially medical practitioners, have the power to X-ray people it would somewhat strengthen this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy again for his detailed contribution.  I appreciate very well the objective of Deputy Noonan's amendment, to equip as fully as possible the Customs and Excise service in combating drug smuggling. The Deputy's amendment would have the effect of allowing an individual customs officer to X-ray individuals stopped for search in the vicinity of a port, airport or land frontier.  This most certainly is not a power which the Government wish to seek.  I believe the X-ray of a person should only be for the purpose of medical diagnosis.  In such a case the danger of radiation damage is balanced by the higher good of the pursuit of the appropriate course of treatment for a particular illness.  In my view it would not be warranted to permit the X-ray search of individuals for other purposes.  Regular travellers could be exposed to a very unhealthy level of radiation over a period of time and there is obvious danger to them and to pregnant women in subjecting them to non-medical X-ray.  A balance must be struck between the rights of the individual and the needs of society as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the amendment I accepted in the Seanad following an excellent debate.  The State in any of its services or agencies has never used intimate body searches, nor does it contemplate it now.</P>

The Deputy has made some points regarding the success or otherwise of the Garda and the customs officers.  He has asked whether this Bill is a charade.  I submit it was because of his efforts that this Bill was initiated.  It is before the House as a result of his efforts.  If this is a charade then he created it.

We must update the law and synchronise the powers of <Col N="2169" /> customs officers with those of the Garda in the complex fight against drugs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It now transpires that the Minister's view on the effect of this section is different from the view of anybody on this side of the House who has been considering it up to now.  When I spoke on the last occasion I made it clear that I thought body searches of an intimate kind were involved and that this might, in certain circumstances, involve <Col N="2170" /> the search of bodily orifices.  From a layman's knowledge and some professional experience of what has and has not hapened in the drug scene in Dublin, I know there have been cases where drugs have been imported wrapped up in prophylactic condoms and sealed and swallowed or inserted into an orifice of whatever kind.  Are we now being told that if the Garda or the Customs and Excise officers suspect that somebody has drugs in those circumstances they have no power whatsoever to investigate the matter and no power to invoke the assistance of a medical practitioner to find out if it is the case?</P>
      <P>If they have top grade information that a man or a woman has inserted drugs into an orifice of his or her body, is it now being said that the Garda or Customs and Excise officers have no power to investigate the matter unless that person voluntarily submits to having that issue decided by a search?  That is very remarkable and if it is being stated here by the Minister as the law and the intention of the Government in bringing in this law then, in so far as the intention of any legislature is relevant, apart from what is written in the Act, it seems that a huge loophole is going to be opened up.  Are the Government now saying that there cannot be an intimate body search and that people who chose to be swallowers or stuffers, to use the Minister's phraseology, are to be given free entry into the country confident that they cannot be searched?  That is a remarkable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says the purpose of the section and its effect is that the designated medical practitioner &mdash; and it is not stated who he is designated by, which is a curious omission since in the Road Traffic Act where that phrase is used the person is designated by the member of the Garda Síochána who is carrying out the examination &mdash; can only carry out the search where that is requested as an option by somebody who is about to be searched.  That certainly does not leap out from this section.  The section states that a search may be carried out by a designated medical practitioner and I can <Col N="2171" /> tell the Minister that a court would interpret the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; and I think Deputy McCartan would agree with me &mdash; as equalling the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  If you say something &ldquo;may&rdquo; be done by a particular person it will be interpreted as &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not simply mean it is an option to be exercised by somebody.</P>
    <P>If there is an option, where is it stated in the section that it is the option of the individual?  It is not stated once that the person being searched may request to be searched by a medical practitioner.  Who will make the decision as to whom the medical practitioner shall be?  That is not stated in the section and as it presently stands I can assure the House that a judge &mdash; in so far as one can presume what a judge will do &mdash; reading that section for the first time would certainly not take it as giving an option to the detained person to decide whether he or she wants to be examined by a medical practitioner or a Customs and Excise officer and that the choice of medical practitioner lies with the Customs and Excise officer or with the person in question.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;designated&rdquo; in the Road Traffic Act means designated by the person conducting the compulsory process. The word &ldquo;designated&rdquo; in this section does not seem to suggest &mdash; unless I am wrong and I cannot see it in the definition section in this Bill &mdash; that it is a designation that is open to the person. The phrase &ldquo;designated registered medical practitioner&rdquo; is used in the Road Traffic Act and the word &ldquo;designated&rdquo; means designated by the member in charge of the police station.  The word &ldquo;designated&rdquo; in this section does not have any meaning.  Who is to designate the practitioner?  I do not believe it would be accepted for one minute that it means designated by the person who is detained. If the medical practitioner is not designated by the person who is detained, is the Minister claiming that this section will allow the Customs and Excise officers to select a doctor and allow the person to make a choice between being searched by that doctor or being searched by a <Col N="2172" /> Customs and Excise officer?  I do not believe that follows.</P>
    <P>Taking subsections (1) (i) and clause (D) together, section 2 reads &ldquo;An officer of Customs and Excise may without warrant search a person and, if he considers it necessary for that purpose, detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search provided that a search of a person may be carried out by a designated medical practitioner.&rdquo; How does that imply a choice for the person being searched?  I believe it does not and a court would certainly hold, ambiguous as it is, that if there is any ambiguity there is no right on the part of a Customs and Excise officer to search because it is clearly stated who can carry out the search of a person.  Section 2 (1) (i) (C) states:</P>
    <P>where a search of a person being detained involves removal of clothing, other than head-gear or a coat, jacket, gloves or similar article of clothing, no officer or person of the opposite sex shall be present unless either that person is a designated medical practitioner or the officer considers that the presence of that person is necessary by reason of the violent conduct of the person to be searched;</P>
    <P>If the Minister is now saying that the effect of section 2 (1) (i) (D) is effectively that, at the option of the person being searched, he can request that if be done by a medical practitioner, All I can say is that he has not made that into law and it is not the ordinary commonsense interpretation of that section as it now appears.  The Minister has to make it clear to the House, because he is bringing the legislation through and is responsible for amending it and making it workable, whether he is saying clearly to this House that under this section any person who secretes in any orifice on his body controlled drugs with a view to their importation and walks through an airport will be subjected to an intimate body search by anybody with a view to determining whether those drugs are on his person? If the Minister is saying he cannot be, is <Col N="2173" /> he standing over the proposition that our law, in this country, is to be that in future people are to be entitled to do that, immune from search, because we are afraid to give a right of search of an intimate kind in any circumstances to the officers of the Customs and Excise no matter how heavy the suspicion is?</P>
    <P>Those are propositions which this House is entitled to know about.  It is all very well for the Minister to come into this House on the section and say that he wants to amplify powers, but I would be very surprised and disappointed if the Minister is saying one cannot take any adequate step to detect the class he calls swallowers and stuffers and remove drugs from them when one knows as a matter of fact that they have drugs on them, when one may have a report of a person who has seen them swallowing or stuffing a drug into the various orifices.  That seems a remarkable state of affairs.  I ask the Minister to address the issue and to decide whether or not he is stating that under Irish law nobody is entitled to carry out such an intimate search.  If that is the case it is a very radical change.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Garda, under the Misuse of Drugs Act, believe that they have no such power.  I believe they have such a power and I believe that on occasions drugs have been found as a result of intimate searches, and those have been done under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Are we going to now discriminate between Customs and Excise searches and Garda searches?  Are we to be told that there are different powers for the Garda and different powers for Customs and Excise officers? The Minister had really better clear up this one because if one cannot search intimately at all, the law is a total farce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few preliminary points must be made.  Many references have been made to the debates in the Seanad.  I have looked at these and I must say I am very envious of the time and facilities and the good productive work that came out of the debate in the Seanad.  I find it an affront, as a Member of this House, that the same opportunity <Col N="2174" /> is not being afforded to us to tease out some of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Even on the two sections that we have dealt with so far, we have teased out remarkable misconceptions of definitions in the sections of the Bill.  In the first section on definition with regard to officers of the Customs and Excise, the Minister responded favourably to points made by circulating a memorandum.  We now find that the Minister has an incredible view in respect of the powers of search with regard to drugs, and I will come back to this very briefly.  What more lurks in this Bill that we are not now or are ever going to have the opportunity of exploring?  This is very regrettable.</P>
      <P>My second point in that context is that I wondered why the Order of Business was drawn up the way it was today.  Reference was made to the fact that when the vote is taken in a little over an hour and a quarter, only amendments in the name of the Minister for Finance will stand, I looked at the 22 amendments outstanding to be discussed and not one of them is in his name.  Now there has been circulated, in the last hour of our debate, an amendment from the Minister. That is no way to treat this House. The last time this Bill was discussed in this House was on 2 March.  Why, therefore, in the last hour of our discussion are we expected to consider an amendment from the Government as we are on our feet considering the implications of other amendments?  It is a disgrace that this House is being treated in this way in the context of this Bill.  I presume the Order of Business was drawn up with the agreement of parties on the Opposition side and it is terribly sad that that is the way business in this House is dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make on this section is that I am not fully convinced that Deputy Noonan's amendment is a sensible one for some of the reasons the Minister has advanced.  In regard to the use of X-ray as a means of detection, I understand that a drug secreted by swallowing is swallowed in such a way that it can be ultimately passed as waste.  Consequently it is constructed to look physically like waste.  An X-ray will not tell one way <Col N="2175" /> or another whether what one is looking at on the screen is excrement or a drug. For that reason there is a practical problem. If, on the other hand, the drug is not swallowed but stuffed, the application of digital pressure on exploration &mdash; and this is where the medical practitioner comes in &mdash; answers the question very quickly. I have to say to the Minister that this is going on on a daily basis in police stations.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to provide for a non-compulsory intimate search, he has to say so because it is not in the section, and he has to put in an amendment.  This must be done under paragraph (d) because any court reading that section as it stands would come to the immediate conclusion that a search of a person under paragraph (d) includes intimate searching. The section provides first that the officer may conduct a search, that a person may be detained for the purpose of the search, that a person should not be searched by a member of the opposite sex in any circumstances.  Then it provides that if there is a question of the removal of clothing it can be done, but a member of the medical profession, a doctor, can or should be present.  Finally there is a search of the person.  It goes from the general searching by the officer down to a partial clothing search involving an officer or a doctor, down to the search of the person and that will, inevitably, be defined by the court as meaning intimate searching.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to stand over his earlier statement that that is not the intention of the legislation, he must amend it and be clear about it, because what he is suggesting is not in the Bill. What is not in the Bill is non-compulsory intimate searching.  What is not in the Bill is any right of a person detained to opt for a doctor.  If the Minister wants that he must put it in the Bill because it is not there, and no amount of reading of it will put it there.</P>
    <P>I have to suggest that under the current law search, by definition, does not exclude search of the intimate parts of the body.  There is no judicial decision to <Col N="2176" /> that effect whatsoever.  There are pronouncements which suggest that there are constitutional rights to bodily integrity. In the balance of the common good, no court would have the slightest hesitation in saying that, if there is substantial reason to suspect that a drug is secreted in an orifice that search, in those circumstances, would allow for digital exploration by a medical practitioner. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. There is no judicial decision that would exclude the intimate portions of a person's body.  The point I am making is that paragraph (d) would be clearly defined by any court or judge as suggesting that that includes and allows for intimate exploration.</P>
    <P>If there is suspicion that somebody has swallowed a drug the next step, as I understand it, is for the doctor to administer a laxative and everyone sits and waits.  That happens and I have dealt with many cases where it has happened, and in instances where this procedure was unsuccessful within the confines of the police station, the person was followed afterwards, the business having to be dealt with, and the drug recovered elsewhere. That is what happens and that is where the doctor comes in in that context. The Bill allows for a person to be detained for a reasonable period for the purpose of the search.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the drug is not swallowed but stuffed, the doctor can initially, by simple digital pressure, fairly reasonably establish whether or not something is secreted, or digital penetration will very easily establish whether what is secreted or hidden away is of interest to the Garda.  These are reasonable powers.  I do not believe anyone on the Opposition benches would be arguing &mdash; and I would not be arguing &mdash; for that not to appertain.  It has existed and is in practice at present.  I believe that the Minister has got himself into a twist on this matter.  None of us, as Deputy McDowell has indicated, has read the section to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>Finally, if the Minister believes that the search should be much more restrictive he must be honest about it, put down <Col N="2177" /> his amendment and let us discuss it.  In regard to the specific amendment I do not believe it is an entirely workable one. It is incongruous.  There is the problem of where the X-ray would take place.  Is it expected that X-ray rooms would be established at all the various ports and points or does it mean that the person can be detained for so long as he or she can be conveyed to a hospital where the X-ray can be carried out?  I am not aware of a police force anywhere that uses or would have resort to the X-ray as a means of establishing or exploring the possibility of secreted drugs on the person &mdash; it does not work effectively.  There are other very simple common day means of dealing with it such as the laxative and the finger.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I interpret the section exactly as Deputy McCartan has interpreted it and as Deputy McDowell has indicated.  I have no problem with the section.  The powers being conferred by the section are appropriate. They are the powers which the Garda Síochána have at present under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I think that the customs officers should have that power also.  I have a huge problem with the Minister's interpretation of the section. If the section is to be interpreted by the courts, as the Minister interprets it, it would be better in the interests of the prevention of drug abuse in this country if the Minister withdrew the Bill.  If the Minister's interpretation of the powers of search are as he has stated, this is a serious backward step in the fight against drugs.  I do not believe the Minister is correct in his interpretation.  I believe that my two colleagues &mdash; and especially Deputy McCartan who has recited the section in great detail &mdash; are absolutely correct.  I put down this amendment allowing X-rays to be used in search because I wanted a detailed discussion on the powers of search in the Bill.  The Minister has expressed the views he expressed today at early stages of the debate.  He has said on a number of occasions that the section did not confer the power of intimate body searching.  I <Col N="2178" /> believe it does.  I want to focus on that &mdash; and I think I have successfully focused on it &mdash; by introducing the concept of X-ray to be used in the search.  I am not particularly wedded to the efficacy of X-ray or otherwise and if the Minister feels, and his advice suggests, that the use of X-rays would be inappropriate I have no problem with that and I am not pressing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Reasonably fair.  I want to be fair, too.  The position is that we are conferring powers on Customs and <Col N="2179" /> Excise officers.  They have the right, if they wish, to call on the Garda to assist them in any matter.  That right always has been there.  If they are dealing with somebody whom they consider needs to be detained or observed for a certain period they can call on the Garda Síochána as they have always done in the past. Co-operation has always been forthcoming. In that way the Garda Drugs Squad would be involved and the legislation under which they operate, would be used to detect, observe and to prosecute or, at least, to get a final decision <i>vis-á-vis</i> any particular individual or any particular situation.  I would not want any ambiguity or vagueness about the Bill; I would not want the Bill not to be clear but after due discussion in the Seanad I agreed that we would allow a designated medical practitioner to be involved.  I will clarify that again, by an amendment, if the House is prepared to accept it.  We will clarify section 2 (1) (i) (D) to read: &ldquo;A search of the person may, at the request of the person to be searched, or on the direction of the officer or officers present, be carried out by a medical practitioner designated by the officer or officers.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Nonetheless the Garda carry out intimate body searches without the consent of the person detained.  That has never been challenged and, I contend, in terms of the balances of it, could not be challenged.  The same situation will develop here.  A customs officer who comes into court and says: &ldquo;I suspected a secreted cache of drugs, I brought in a doctor and I informed him of my suspicions. I asked the doctor to proceed with an examination and he did so.&rdquo;  That would be a search within the permissible terms of the Bill as currently drafted. How do you percieve that it is not?  I suggest that if you want to specifically exclude compulsory intimate body searches, you simply say so in your amendment to paragraph (D), by adding the words &ldquo;to exclude&rdquo;.  I do not believe the Minister should want that but if he does, he should include it in his amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I believe that the Minister's explanation &mdash; like many of his explanations &mdash; has given rise to a further difficulty.  As I understand it the Minister's interpretation of how this would work in practice is as follows: the customs officers who had reasonable <Col N="2181" /> cause to suspect that a person at a port or airport was importing or exporting drugs could invoke the powers of this section and could search the person but they would have to stop short of intimate body searching.  If they felt they were dealing with a swallower or a stuffer, to use the Minister's phrases, they would call in the Garda Drug Squad.  The Garda Drug Squad under the 1977 Act would have the power of intimate body searching. That seems to be the implication of the explanation given by the Minister.  That gives rise to further difficulty because the section is drafted as follows: &ldquo;An officer of Customs and Excise who with reasonable cause suspects&rdquo; and the trigger to the whole process is that the officer of Customs and Excise must &ldquo;with reasonable cause suspect&rdquo;.  That is the way these powers are always conferred on members of the security forces.  I do not think that if the officer of Customs and Excise told the garda of his suspicions on the basis of inviting him in, it would follow that the garda would necessarily have reasonable grounds to suspect and could subsequently invoke the appropriate section of the 1977 Act.  I do not think the phrase &ldquo;who with reasonable cause suspects&rdquo; would extend to what in effect would be hearsay from the Customs and Excise officer to the garda.  A garda exercising power on the say so of the customs officer could find himself in conflict with the 1977 Act.  The Minister's explanation will cause another problem.</P>

      <P>In response to both of the Deputy's points I sought to put forward an amendment, and I thank Deputy Noonan for accepting it, which clarifies the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the designated medical practitioner or on the direction of the customs officer to seek a designated medical practitioner.  If the customs officers suspect they are dealing with an unco-operative person who may, in their opinion, be carrying drugs in the body, they can call in the Garda to assist under the Misuse of Drugs Act and under the various other powers conferred on the Garda and in particular the extra powers of detention under the 1984 Act. <Col N="2182" /> As Deputy McCartan said, people detained or observed and followed will pass those drugs eventually and then it can be proven that they carried them.  It is in order to ensure that continuity of the law exists, that co-operation will be available and that the rights of the individual are protected and also that the common good is protected that we have introduced these measures.  The definition of search that we referred to is what is allowable as normal practice under the Constitution and under the law at present.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> With respect, the difficulty is that whether it is the 1977 Act, the 1984 Act or this Bill, the starting point is that the individual must have reasonable cause to suspect.  I believe he must form that opinion on his own and I do not think that when a customs officer who has reasonable cause to suspect informs the garda of his reasonable suspicion that the power is then transferred to the garda.  I do not think the garda can act on the reasonable suspicion of the customs officer.  He has to have reasonable suspicion himself. Under the Minister's sequence of events when the customs officers reach a certain point and when they cannot get involved under the section in intimate searching they then call in the garda to do so.  There is a gap and I do not think the gardaí will be able to carry out the function the Minister expects them to carry out. Deputy McCartan may have a view on that matter.</P>

      <P>While we accept that the thin bottom line may be close to what the Deputy is saying, I think it is true that one customs officer must form his own personal opinion on any given individual or on any given situation.  If the customs officers were not able to do that, there would be no point in having them there at all.  In addition, there is always a higher customs officer in charge who can be consulted.  This allows for consultation <Col N="2183" /> with higher officers and other colleagues and they may form a consensus.  Also they may be acting on information available from international customs services pertaining to a particular individual or individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>An officer of Customs and Excise is an official who holds a commission or warrant issued and signed by a Revenue Commissioner.  The commission is issued under two statutes, section 4 of the Excise Management Act, 1872, and section 3 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  The basic entry grade to the Customs and Excise preventative service is assistant officer of Customs and Excise.  While such an officer is issued with a commission or warrant shortly after entry to the service this is done so that an officer can be legally covered while on the job training. As a trainee an officer is closely supervised and always works with experienced staff.  A trainee or any officer abusing the powers granted to him would be subject to disciplinary action.  A trainee is also on probation and any indication that he or she abused powers would result in the termination of his or her probationary appointment.  Assistant officers are appointed initially in an unattached capacity and move from station to station and from job to job within stations to ensure that they get the maximum training and the maximum opportunity to gain experience in their careers.  All the time he or she is formally monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes after six months he or she attends a month long formal course in all aspects of Customs and Excise.  Even after this course and for a number of <Col N="2186" /> years he or she would be regarded as a junior officer and is forbidden by instructions from engaging in strip searches or any other matter except under the control of a superior officer.</P>
    <P>I hope that clarifies the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought there would be a Report Stage debate and Deputy Noonan and I had discussed matters relative to Report Stage.  The position now is that this will become law today.  I am fortified because while the discussion was going on in this regard I took a look at the only textbook in Irish law on powers of search with relation to the control of drugs, which is Peter Charleton's book, <i>Controlled Drugs and the Criminal Law.</i> There is nothing in that to suggest that the Minister's interpretation of the powers he has given to Customs and Excise officers in this Bill is correct.  There is nothing to suggest that the wording as chosen in this Bill confines it to outside the body searches.</P>
      <P>The practice &mdash; Deputy McCartan knows this well and I also but from less experience than he of this kind of territory &mdash; is that garda carry out intimate searches and have not one extra shred of power under any law, as I understand it, to conduct a search of the inside of a person's body than the Minister is giving to custom officers under this Bill, not one extra shred of statutory authority to do this.  The powers the Minister is giving are exactly coterminous with the powers of the Garda Síochána.  They are not greater or smaller.  If the Minister is saying on behalf of the Government that his customs officers will not, when this Bill comes into law, have power to direct a body search by a medical practitioner, I am telling him that it follows then that the Garda do not have such powers right now.  There are no &ldquo;stuffers and swallowers&rdquo; provisions especially arranged so that the Garda can exercise additional powers to those that the Minister is now conferring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section with which we are dealing, clearly, closely corresponds to the exact powers given under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, as amended.  I am asking the <Col N="2187" /> Minister in those circumstances to withdraw the Bill now, not to proceed to enact it into law.  He would be doing so under a misapprehension of law.  I am not here to lecture the Minister on law and do not think that Deputy McCartan is attempting to do so either, but it seems that the advice which the Minister is receiving in relation to the legal consequences of this Bill becoming law is not correct.  This is the last opportunity for either legislative Chamber of this House to look into the matter.  It will become law if passed by the Dáil.  We are being told by the Minister, on advice which I consider to be incorrect, that this precludes intimate body searches.  If he is right on that, so do the 1977 and 1984 Misuse of Drugs Acts.  If he is right on that, as Deputy Noonan has said, the law is taking a step backwards.  I have no doubt that some inventive lawyer may persuade a judge to listen to this debate and to the Minister's arguments as to what the law actually means.  If a judge listens to the Minister's interpretation and if that is put in the weighing scales in some court case, as Deputy Noonan says we are going backwards.  We are giving a charter now to abuse the law by simple recourse to stuffing and swallowing.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  The Minister has told the House just now that an officer of Customs and Excise holds a warrant or commission.  It is all very well and that may be the law now, but the day this Bill becomes law an officer of Customs and Excise will be extended for the purposes of this Bill to include a member of An Garda Síochána and any person in the public service who is, for <Col N="2188" /> the time being, employed in the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has again told the House, unfortunately, something which is not the case, that an officer of Customs and Excise is a person who holds a warrant or commission.  This Bill proposes to extend that to any person who is for the time being employed by the State, either temporarily or permanently, to assist an officer of Customs and Excise. That is the unfortunate fact and there is no point in suggesting that the definition is not very wide; it is extremely wide.  I have made all these points before and there is no point in pressing them again but I think that the Minister is mistaken in this.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make an observation on this topic of an authorised officer.  While we debated this before, we withdrew from the debate on the undertaking that the Minister would look at the matter before Report Stage.  Deputy Noonan, for example, indicated at the beginning of March last that he would be bringing in an amendment specifically along lines to suggest that an officer who was warranted by the Revenue Commissioners be the term used.  On all the amendments and the issues debated so far in this Bill, the Minister at one stage or other indicated that there would be clarity by Report Stage and we proceeded in our discussions on that basis and in that direction.  The reason we are being denied the opportunity of debate on Report Stage is that the Minister does not have answers to some of the reasonable <Col N="2189" /> points that we have made.  This is a very regrettable development.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy McDowell in saying that because the Minister has got himself into so many twists on the interpretation and understanding of some of this legislation, perhaps it should be withdrawn. If it is not to be withdrawn and we want to make progress, at least the Minister should before 1.30 p.m. consider a motion, that would be agreed to without difficulty, that this matter be extended beyond the 1.30 p.m. period to another day so that we could explore some of the amendments and issues spoken about, including this one on the notion of designating in some way, authorising or warranting customs officers by whatever mechanism or control.  We have listened to the Minister on that and I think that he should listen to us.  I am beginning to worry if every time I stand up I am considered to be lecturing; I am not.  I am very concerned about this legislation which is falling asunder the more we debate it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Our difficulty is that we came in here under the impression that we were strengthening the legislation to prevent the importation of drugs into the country.  If the Minister's interpretation of the powers of search is correct, it will, as Deputy McDowell has said, run from this Bill back to the 1977 measure.  Not only will he not be giving the powers that we thought he was giving to Customs and Excise officers, but he will be taking away power from the Garda Síochána which they thought they had.  That is a very serious retrograde step.  It would be a pity that a debate which began with agreement that the most stringent powers compatible with civil liberties should be conferred on customs officers to prevent the scourge of drugs in the country should result in a situation in which the defences of the State are weakened.  They certainly would be if the Minister's interpretation that the Garda have not the right to intimately search those who are suspected of importing drugs is accepted in court.  If that interpretation is accepted we have a serious problem and this thing falls apart with the most extraordinarily serious consequences.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Whip is here now.  We have a very serious difficulty.  The interpretation of the Bill now is not in line with our interpretation of the section.  We are doing a serious disservice by insisting that the debate finishes at 1.30 p.m.  We should proceed, with the agreement of the House, to consider amendments but we should have a Report Stage subsequently because there are now serious and frightening difficulties.</P>

This Bill has been before the House for some considerable time.  I am sure Deputy Noonan will agree that it is in the interests of everybody that this legislation should be finalised as quickly as possible.  We have had an opportunity to go through the Bill on previous occasions and agreement has been reached to conclude all Stages.  I cannot see any reason why that should be changed.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Whip does not appreciate the difficulties. This is not just an impulsive intervention. The Minister has now defined the section of the Bill in a manner which suggests that the powers which the Garda have been exercising for the last number of years will no longer be available to them. That will be a serious breach in the defences against the importation of drugs.  We want this Bill to go through along these lines.  It does not answer our position to vote against it at 1.30 p.m. but we require explanations.  We would all agree a ready passage to the Bill.  We do not even want a prime time debate on it.  I will take it at any time, late into the night if that is what facilitates the House. I am not trying to hold this up but there is a serious issue now and I am sure our Whip will not have difficulty with it nor do I think will any other Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be worthwhile explaining to the Government Whip that this Bill started out on the basis of a fairly protracted debate on certain aspects of the powers to be given to certain officers. The Minister at that time informed the House that he intended meeting some of the objections raised, if possible on Report Stage.  Today we have settled down to discussing one particular power of search, and it now transpires that the Minister has told the House that his advice is that people who import, secreted in orifices in their bodies, drugs into the State are not capable of being searched under this legislation.  Looking to the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to <Col N="2192" /> 1984, if the Minister is right in this, then the Garda have no powers to do the same thing in relation to people walking the streets who are involved in the drugs trade.  If the Minister's legal interpretation is correct, it follows that people, by secreting drugs into an orifice in their bodies, can become immune from any form of search.  That is not the current practice.  In the interests of this House and in the interests of democracy, since this is the last occasion on which either legislative Chamber will look at this Bill before it becomes law, we should get an extra couple of hours at any time, be it midnight tonight or whatever, to tease out the implications of this and to have a proper Report Stage.</P>

That should be clarified in the Chamber so that the law is restored to what it should be.

      <P>The principal penalties for drug possession and dealing are set out in the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  These range from a small fine to life imprisonment. Subsection (4) of section 2 provides for a level of penalty where a person fails to comply with a requirement under the section.  For example, a customs officer may require a person to move a vehicle to a place more suitable for a search of that vehicle.  A similar provision exists in section 6 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984 in relation to a similar requirement made by a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of a search for drugs.  The level of penalty prescribed here is £200 and I therefore wish the same provision in section 2 to carry an identical penalty in the interests of equity.  In addition, the level of penalty proposed by the Deputy is too high for the offence which amounts to no more than a failure to comply with a requirement of a customs officer in the course of a search for drugs.  Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy would accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the principles I <Col N="2197" /> have seen the Legislature follow in relation to cases of drunk driving is that if you do something with the intention of evading prosecution you should be liable to the same penalty.  In other words, there should not be a bonus for a person who is brazen enough to drive his car off to makes it inaccessible or who fails to submit himself for a search and who is unco-operative in a search.  Such a person should not know that he faces a lesser penalty than he might face if he was discovered to have drugs on his person.  Summary offences are now attracting penalties in the region of £800 and £1,000 and I do not think this one should be an exception.</P>

    <P>On the Mexican-USA border there is quite a significant traffic of drugs through the use of model aircraft.  I would like to have more time to discuss this amendment but I think there is potential for the bringing in of drugs through the use of gliders, balloons and model aircraft. That is quite obvious.  The only issue which arises is whether we should allow the courts to extend the definition of &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; to include all flying objects or <Col N="2199" /> floating objects or whether we should decide to specify and, in specifying, exclude other types of aircraft which we had not the imagination to envisage.

      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 36, to delete &ldquo;or a Peace Commissioner&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at issue here is who will authorise a search warrant.  I am of the view that it would be more appropriate for a district justice to authorise a search warrant in <Col N="2200" /> each and every case rather than diminishing the power by extending it to peace commissioners.  At one stage in my career I was involved in the appointment of peace commissioners.  They are a very honourable body of men and are widely dispersed throughout the country, but I wonder whether they are the appropriate people to make a judgment on whether a search warrant should be issued which would trigger off procedures which could have serious consequences for those whose premises would be searched.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at this stage to refer to the amendments in the name of The Workers Party relating to the parts of the section which refer to a peace commissioner as an enabling authority for the issue of a warrant.  I support, as does Deputy Noonan, the view that we should not allow for the issuing of warrants by peace commissioners in these circumstances.  I understand the general thrust of the legislation is to draw a close analogy between the powers conferred on Customs and Excise officers and those of the Garda Síochána under the Misuse of Drugs Acts codes.  My understanding of the law, Deputy McDowell might help me in this, is that the enabling authority under those Acts is district justices alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>And peace commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected.  The practice is that they invariably have recourse to the District Courts, certainly in Dublin, for the issue of warrants because of their availability and because of the considerable doubts that constitutionally have arisen in the past with regard to the authority of a peace commissioner to issue warrants of this nature. That is a matter that has been agitated before the courts and I believe it is not yet finally determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third ground upon which I would press my amendment to the Minister is that from a practising point of view, in the area of the issuing of warrants, the <Col N="2201" /> signing of summonses and the authenticating or authorising of legal documents, I have found a number of disturbing facts I would like to refer to very briefly.  While I have no doubt that peace commissioners are honourable and upright people within the community, a certain laxity and a certain deterioration of standards have existed to the extent that we must question whether their position as a quasi-judicial authority should be endorsed or allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The first fact that concerns me came to light in September 1984 when I visited a Garda station in Lucan to see two clients who were detained.  I was conducted to a room where I noticed a rubber stamp on the desk.  I took an impression of it and it turned out to be a peace commissioner's stamp.  That worried me.  I retained four impressions and I have them on file.  That was a Sunday morning in September and the peace commissioner stamp was on a table in a Garda station.</P>
    <P>The next incident I recall observing was in an hotel, a public place in the city. Members of the Garda Síochána were standing at the reception desk and the proprietor, who is the local peace commissioner, directed his assistant to sign on his behalf the sheaf of summonses that were being presented.  It was inconvenient for him to sit down and sign the sheaf of summonses the Garda wanted signed.  I watched this happen in public view.</P>
    <P>The final fact relates to a practice that pertains at present in the city.  A peace commissioner, who is constantly and invariably called upon by the Garda Síochána at ungodly hours to assist in the Garda stations in the city, is a registered medical doctor who is almost whole-time employed by the State as a doctor in the investigation of medical forensic examination and examination under the Road Traffic Acts.  He is particularly wellequipped for dealing with the unsocial hours of both jobs when needed.  In the city of Dublin a peace commissioner, whose function is supposed to be a quasi-judicial one, where the person is independent and is called on to adjudicate on objective facts and give judicial <Col N="2202" /> decisions, is virtually, if not almost exclusively, an employee with a medical practice as a forensic officer of the Garda Síochána.  That is unsatisfactory.  I am not in any way seeking to impeach the integrity of the person involved.  I would not do that but the question certainly arises as to whether one could consider that person, moving from one function to another in a moment, as being objective and independent.</P>
    <P>Any time I have had to deal with peace commissioners in Garda custody cases, where they currently have the powers of dealing with custody, granting of bail and sitting at informal courts in Garda stations, they were invariably consulted outside the room by the officer involved and they then came in to decide on the issues they had been advised on.  There are no proper standards existing.  It is in that context that we must review more carefully the extent to which we give authority to peace commissioners where we expect them to act in quasi-judicial areas.</P>
    <P>Recently a piece of party political literature &mdash; not from my own party &mdash; was put through my door.  It was introducing the local team, one of whom is a TD and the others are three non-elected persons, each of whom is a peace commissioner. That political party had been in Government for a period of time and used the opportunities open to them.  We are all aware that peace commissioners are appointed through political patronage and no-one would suggest that that is wrong.  However, I do not think we fully appreciate the role and function that these people are supposed to conduct on our behalf.  They have very extensive powers.  They can issue warrants to search houses and to summon people to court and they can be called to Garda stations to convene and preside over informal interim courts until a person can be brought before a sitting District Court. In that context they can decide on bail and if they grant bail the terms of the bail and the suitability of the sureties.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to give peace commissioners authority to issue search warrants that can lead to the search of premises anywhere in the State, in the <Col N="2203" /> pursuit of a reasonable belief that drugs can be found.  In the course of that search a person found with drugs can be arrested and detained.  According to the Minister's amendment that was circulated this morning all the powers pertaining to section 2 in regard to search will, under section 3, apply there.  It is an extensive code of enabling authority and power. For the reason I have advanced I do not believe it is desirable, in the balances the Minister has been talking about earlier, that we vest that authority in the office of peace commissioner.  The powers are too extensive.  It is the view of the Fine Gael Party and my party that the Minister should consider the amendment put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my support to these amendments.  The office of peace commissioner dates back to 1923 or 1924.  As Deputy McCartan has said, the appointment of peace commissioners has become somewhat a matter of honour rather than a substantial office.  Everyone will accept that the Government line might easily be that these commissioners are an honourable body of men and women who give of their time to the State in a voluntary capacity and work in the interests of the community.  All those things are true, I do not want anything I say to reflect on any individual peace commissioner.</P>
      <P>I must accept as correct what Deputy McCartan has said, that is, that the office of peace commissioner has very substantial powers, some of which are of doubtful constitutionality &mdash; to order people to be detained in custody, to order the destruction of property and so on. The purpose of having peace commissioners was to interpolate in the administration of justice and the deprivation of civil liberties a single independent voice which would investigate incidents and apply objective controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience has been that peace commissioners do not adequately investigate matters brought before them. Some of them are inclined to carry out their functions as a matter of automatic <Col N="2204" /> process on request.  As I understand it, they are not given any formal training; nor are they given up to date documents showing them their powers at any given stage; nor are they brought together with a view to updating their information on how they should carry out their functions, such as, are they to give search warrants on the say so of a detective sergeant on a muttered oath and certain information put before them, and what questions should they ask when requests for warrants are made.  None of these steps is taken.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan that this Bill, when it becomes law, should mark the first occasion these powers are taken from these people and their office, because of its doubtful constitutionality, should be wound up in the near future. The office of Peace Commissioner has not proved to be an effective safeguard. It is a redundant office and, as far as controlling the interests of civil liberties is concerned, it is of very little effect.</P>
    <P>The powers exercised by peace commissioners should be given to District Justices or alternatively, the qualifications, experience and knowledge needed by peace commissioners should be specified in a formal amending Bill to ensure that, when appointments are made, the people in question understand the issues on which they are asked to exercise their decisive powers.  I agree with Deputy McCartan.  Admittedly some people may think it would be better to keep quiet on subjects like this, but I believe peace commissioners as a group, are not functioning adequately.  I would prefer to see the office abolished or proper law being brought into effect requiring them to meet, to apply judicial standards and to know the extent and the effect of the powers they are exercising.</P>
    <P>Since these are extensive powers, this should mark the first occasion when this House says that the office of Peace Commissioner is a failed experiment.  It may have had some function in the twenties but it does not work now.  It is not a safeguard.  On the contrary, it is undermining the safeguards which would be <Col N="2205" /> there if these powers were confined to District Justices.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am sticking with my amendments.  I do not think that in these circumstances a peace commissioner is the appropriate person to be involved in the issue of search warrants. I do not agree with the more widespread criticism because peace commissioners still have a role to play but not in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the amendments in the name of the Minister. I take it the Minister is agreeing to amendment No. 12 in my name, but using a different form of words.  In effect, it is an extension of the saver clauses agreed in the Seanad.  I presume the question will be put at 1.30 p.m. and I just want to clarify that the Minister is accepting the principle of amendment No. 12, but not my wording.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments have the same purpose &mdash; to confine the issue of warrants to customs officers to search premises for drugs to District Justices, whereas, as Deputies can see, the Bill provides for such warrants to be issued by a District Justice or a peace commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peace commissioners are appointed by the Minister for Justice under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, to perform and exercise the duties and powers as outlined under the Act.  These functions include the taking of affirmations, oaths, signing information in relation to passports, declarations in respect of land registry and registration <Col N="2206" /> of clubs, signing of summonses, and the signing of search and arrest warrants.</P>
    <P>Certainly in the case of Customs and Excise officers, the legal availability of peace commissioners to sign warrants has been extremely useful in the past and there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that peace commissioners were any less rigorous or more compliant than District Justices in their dealings with the Customs and Excise service.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances envisaged in section 3 &mdash; the need to search a premises for drugs &mdash; speed may very well be everything and it is therefore essential that Customs and Excise officers should have reasonably quick access to duly authorised persons when a warrant is required.  Furthermore, section 3 is practically identical to a corresponding provision in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, which assigns similar powers of search under warrant to the Garda Síochána.  In the 1984 Act the warrant is obtainable from a Justice or a peace commissioner. For obvious reasons it would not be wise to depart from an enactment already on the Statute Book which has not been the subject of complaint in this area.</P>
    <P>Various statements have been made, particularly by Deputy McCartan who criticised three cases pertaining to the office of peace commissioner but he did not tell us what action he took.  I do not think it is fair to condemn all peace commissioners because of three cases. Because a lawyer or a solicitor is found negligent and is struck off the register of the Incorporated Law Society is no reason for debarring solicitors from carrying out legal functions.  Likewise, we cannot condemn the general body of peace commissioners because of the misdemeanours of three peace commissioners. There must be an officer authorised to sign a warrant available in the interests of combatting drug abuse.  I regret that I have to oppose these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the alarming increase over the past year of the export from this country of works of art and art objects; and the steps which have been taken or are proposed, to discourage the continuance of this pattern or to reverse the trend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most concerned that there was a substantial increase in the value of heritage material exported from this country in 1987 as compared with 1986.</P>
      <P>The general scheme of legislation to control such exports has been prepared for some considerable time in my Department. The introduction of legislation to meet the particular needs of the situation has been delayed pending the outcome in the Supreme Court of the Derrynaflan case.  As that case has now been determined, I hope to introduce legislation in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, the loss in antiques in particular has been alarming in recent years.  It went from £2 million in 1982 to £7 million in 1986 and £11 million last year.  In view of that, will the Taoiseach endeavour to have the legislation ready for this session?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, a VAT rate of 25 per cent is imposed at <Col N="2211" /> the point of entry and there is no export tax, which means that it is very unfavourable as far as getting back goods to Ireland is concerned, even goods that have been exported from here for sale abroad.  Will he consider possible changes in that regard, particularly extending to heritage houses where paintings are displayed, the same tax concessions regarding imports as are available to the National Museum and the National Gallery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Taoiseach's intention to introduce legislation in this regard, will he consider, as an interim measure in respect of any proposed exports occurring during the next few months, using the powers he has under section 2 (2) of the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Exports) Act, 1945, to declare that particular drawings, documents, writings, maps or the like, cannot be exported without a licence from him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider that suggestion by the Deputy but the matter is complex and I would prefer to have carefully prepared legislation which would have the benefit of full discussion in the House.  One of the aspects, of which I am sure the Deputy is aware, is that it is not necessarily totally beneficial to prevent exports because we also want to have a situation where people will bring works of art into this country. Unless the export prohibitions are carefully framed, it could have the effect of preventing people bringing works of art into the country because they might fear they would never again be in a position to export them or to take them out again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the requirements for the issuing of a licence to operate as an export trading house; and the criteria being used by him to decide which <Col N="2215" /> groups should be issued with such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 11 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>There are many Irish manufacturers producing goods which could be sold on international markets if the company developed their own internal marketing capacity.  However, for a variety of reasons, such as size, expertise and financial resources, many companies do not have the strength to develop their own exports.</P>
      <P>In response to this situation, the Government introduced the special trading house scheme.  Under this scheme, the special trading houses will do the overseas marketing for the supplier companies.</P>
      <P>The special trading houses will engage solely in the marketing abroad of Irish manufactured goods (including software) on a wholesale basis.  They will not be the manufacturer of those goods.  The special trading houses will have to purchase and take title to the goods they intend selling and will not be allowed to operate on a commission basis.</P>
      <P>As manufacturing firms will sell their goods to the special trading houses who in turn will sell to the overseas buyers, in general there will not be a direct relationship between the manufacturer and the overseas buyer.  The special trading houses will locate, negotiate, agree and service the sales to the overseas buyers'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special trading houses and suppliers will determine for themselves the nature of their commercial relationship.  There is nothing in the legislation which restricts the exporting opportunities of the supplier. Through the relationship, supplier firms will improve their awareness of overseas opportunities and will develop their capacity to service overseas contracts. Greater access to overseas markets will improve the marketing skills of the supplier and should lead him or her <Col N="2216" /> to taking initiatives on his or her own behalf in developing more overseas sales.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which special trading house licences are issued are covered by the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1987.  In addition to this, I have had an information booklet prepared which clearly sets out the type of information which is required in support of any application.  I have arranged to have copies of this booklet available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The main criteria for judging an applicant for a special trading house licence is that the applicant should have the structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the overseas marketing of Irish manufactured goods. In this respect, the applicant for a special trading house licence must supply my Department with details of his expertise in relation to the target markets and product sectors in which he intends selling, the management structure of the proposed trading house, the source and value of proposed equity finance and a full strategic marketing plan.  Evidence of the commitment of manufactureres to supply the applicant with the proposed products must also be provided.</P>
    <P>Every application is critically examined. An initial examination is undertaken by a technical assessment group comprised of officials of my office and CTT.  Once this group are satisfied with the proposal, it is then examined by the special trading house management unit comprised of senior officials of my office, Córas Tráchtála and the Industrial Credit Corporation.  It is only on the recommendation of that group, and through them the organisations which the group members represent, that is the Irish Export Board and ICC, that the application goes forward for ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>The legislation introducing the scheme does not differentiate between private sector or public sector applicants.  Applications from either sector would be examined on their individual merits. However, the main points to remember is that licensed special trading houses cannot engage in any activity other than <Col N="2217" /> the export of goods which they have not manufactured and that the supplier companies from which goods are sourced must employ fewer than 200 people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the reply that State companies such as the Irish Sugar Company would be eligible to apply for special trading house facilities? Would such a company require to have a subsidiary especially established to do that or could, say, the sugar company operate through their existing subsidiaries, Gosfort Limited and Trilby Limited in the setting up of such a trading house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no special view on whether it is a public sector or private sector company as long as they meet the criteria laid down in the booklet I have published.  There is no reason why a company fostered by a public company could not apply for a licence, but they must strictly be doing the business of purchasing goods from manufacturers in the State and exporting those out of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give some more information on the level of equity that would be required for a company given that they must be the owners of the goods in which they are trading? Is any guideline laid down as to the ratio of subscribed equity in the company to ensure that the company are financially solid and do not themselves go under because of late payments by some of their customers relative to their overall turnover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no pre-set equity threshold.  The Deputy will understand that it could not be done that way. What is important here is that you have an appropriate level of equity.  Obviously, if your plans are small and your <Col N="2218" /> products not expensive you do not need a very high level of equity.  On the other hand, if you have very expensive products and long lee times in selling them abroad you need a different level of equity.  The booklet makes quite clear that there should be an appropriately strong equity base in each company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; is probably one of the most flexible words in the English language and that it would be desirable to ensure that the trading houses do not become possible methods of losing goods through unwise trading? The Minister himself should at least lay down some more specific guidelines as to what are appropriate levels of equity relative to value of turnover and average length of delay between supply and payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to judge that on a case-by-case basis.  I am fully satisfied that it is all laid out in this special trading house brochure which is available. There are seven main criteria before the trading house management unit, in which the ICC and the Irish Export Board are centrally involved, and all these criteria have to be met.  One of the criteria is that the sources and value of the proposed equity finance, bank facilities and all such information has to be made available.  That includes cash flow projections for the first three years, target markets, sales projection, overall sales strategy, list of intended suppliers, information on markets to be targeted, management structure and memorandum and articles of association.  I am confident that both the ICC and the Irish Export Board with their involvement in the trading house management unit can apply these criteria objectively to every application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know from his time as Minister for Industry and Commerce that many companies get IDA support for example and you cannot say that they are created by the Government.  These are companies for which tax incentives were offered but they are created by the private sector and their future will depend on how successfully they are run by the promoters. That is no different from any other company who may get IDA support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a number of the criteria laid down for judging who may or may not enter into the trading house business.  He mentioned the list of suppliers as one of those that must be looked at.  What role does he see the suppliers playing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the trading houses and the buyers on the export markets?  I would like him to <Col N="2220" /> address himself to the problem I see if a company in Ireland have, say, production laid out for the next six months, then the export trading house goes abroad and gets an order.  How does that fit in with existing arrangements with the suppliers here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That question has been asked many times.  The special trading houses are not compulsory.  If a manufacturer wants to sell goods to Germany he goes and sells goods to Germany.  If a trading house approaches the manufacturer and says, &ldquo;I can find another outlet for you whether in Germany or elsewhere,&rdquo; it is entirely a matter for the manufacturing company to say, &ldquo;Let us work out the details of how we will do this and we will do it efficiently&rdquo;.  There is no compulsion on any manufacturer. If he wants to trade directly with another company abroad we will encourage that. All we are doing is providing another export opportunity for manufacturers which does not tie them down in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please, Deputy Colley.  I indicated earlier that I was moving on to another question and I do not like being hindered in such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can. Is it not true that the IDA did a report on such trading houses in the late sixties and the end result was the indication that the only way they could successfully operate would depend on a real relationship between the suppliers and the end buyers?  How does the Minister believe he will get over this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a relationship because the trading house will come back to the manufacturer saying they will buy some items but not others.  That is sharp marketing feedback. There are thousands of small manufacturing companies here, the majority of whom are not exporting.  All we are doing is providing another vehicle for <Col N="2221" /> exports.  If they already have a cosy relationship with a foreign purchaser they are free to continue that.  This is a new mechanism to help additional exports.  I am totally convinced that there are thousands of small manufacturing companies who are unable to export by themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But they will remain free to opt out of these contracts.  There is no tie-in to the trading companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Deputy's philosophy, I am surprised that she should suggest I should interfere in the ordinary business relationships between a manufacturing company and a possible exporter.  If a manufacturing company want to export directly to Germany, this scheme does not interfere in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the reason it is proposed that, under the recently announced IDA proposals, board membership of grant aided companies may be a feature; the way in which this will operate in practice; if it will involve the IDA in additional financial liabilities; if such decisions are made by these companies; and if he will outline the thinking behind such a step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the greater emphasis on repayable forms of State aid and equity as part of the revised national industrial incentives announced on 7 April 1988.  The new emphasis is designed to achieve better value for State funding for industrial development and to offer a measure of direct return on the State's investment.</P>
      <P>The operational details of the new arrangements have been set out in a recent IDA publication entitled &ldquo;Your Partners in Development &mdash; Services and Incentives&rdquo; and fall within the day-to-day administration of the State industrial promotion agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in accordance with <Col N="2222" /> standard business practice, the IDA normally will seek an option to nominate a director to the board of a company in cases where it negotiates an equity stake. The negotiation of equity stakes in projects or the nomination of a director should not result in any additional financial liabilities for the IDA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the IDA appoint one of their own members to the board of a company, surely that person as a director must take on the normal liabilities which any director would have. Where is the demarcation between being an employee of the IDA and also a director of a company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of seeking equity stakes should not result in any additional financial responsibility.  Equity will be used as a substitute for grants or be sought free in return for a high level of grant support.  These are the two sets of circumstances in which equity would be used.  It would be another vehicle. Regarding the appointment of directors, obviously one has to be concerned about that matter and I will be taking a look at it.  The possibility that an individual director would find himself in that difficulty is pretty remote.  If we balance that remote and marginal danger against the need for the IDA to ensure that their equity is watched, we must come down on the side of the normal business decision of having the equity watched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is at pains to say what should not be involved but in reality these difficulties could quite conceivably occur.  Where is the division between an individual's responsibilities within the IDA and his responsibility as a director on behalf of the IDA?  There are liabilities if things go in a certain direction.  The Minister is indicating that he hopes they will not go in that direction. Normal business practice will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of dangers in normal business practice. There are many directors of private limited companies, some of whom have been <Col N="2223" /> appointed by the State.  The Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 which is in the Seanad will shortly be coming before the Dáil.  I assume that directors of private limited companies will all have the same responsibilities to carry.  The companies and the State appointed directors will have to abide by the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that section 107 of the Bill to which he refers contains a provision that a court may declare a director personally liable without any limitation of liability for any or all of the debts of a particular company if that company has traded in a reckless fashion?  In view of that provision which the Minister himself is promoting, can he say how it will apply in the case of directors appointed by the IDA?  Will it mean that the individual IDA officer who has acted as a director will be personally liable or will the IDA accept liability?  If the latter is the case, how can the Minister say there is no extra exposure for the State?  Would he not agree that if the IDA accept the new liabilities for their directors under the legislation the Minister is promoting there is extra exposure for the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>By extra exposure for the State I mean that the equity will be a substitute for grants or be sought free in return for a high level of support.  I did not interpret that question to mean the downstream possible legal situations.</P>

There is scope for amendment if the Deputy is worried about how the Bill <Col N="2224" /> would impact on State companies.  There were IDA directors during Deputy Bruton's period of office.  There were always potential personal liabilities for individual directors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 127 by Deputy Ivan Yates on 16 February 1988 in which I indicated that I was still considering what changes, if any, might be appropriate to the system of designating areas for higher level capital grant assistance taking into account the reports prepared by the NESC and ESRI and the changed economic situation including the need to get the best value for Exchequer resources.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's reply very disappointing.  There are other sources of information as well as the NESC and ESRI and I am sure the Minister has that information available to him already.  Is the Minister aware of the recent report on employment and unemployment in the Dublin area by the Dublin Business Innovation Centre, and is he aware that in this report there is a clear indication that, even at the time of the boom in the ten years from 1971 to 1981, 14,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in Dublin at a time when 37,000 were gained in the rest of the country? In subsequent years the losses in Dublin increased enormously.  Surely, if the Minister takes that into account, he will realise that the existing policy is deliberately depriving Dublin of jobs and that now Dublin has reached the stage of being the major unemployment area in the country?  Would the Minister take that into account in arranging his priorities in the designation of areas for priority?</P>

      <P>I want to tell Deputy Mac Giolla that the NESC report recommended that designation should be confined, for example, to areas covering at most 25 per cent of the national labour force and reviewed every five years.  The ESRI were then requested to determine the areas to be designated under the ESRI formula.  All I can tell the House today is that this whole area is being looked at at this very time by the Government.  As the Deputy is aware, the maximum grant in designated areas is 60 per cent and in nondesignated areas 45 per cent, although the average grant in those areas has come up to nothing like those figures.  The Government are very actively in the middle of a review of that designated area structure.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister, in looking at Dublin, to look at different areas.  First, Dublin may refer to the inner city which is obviously a deprived area that requires designation. Would the Minister also look at other separate areas such as what are known as the new towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown which have enormous unemployment rates at the moment, probably higher than any other area in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly undertake to do that.  This whole question of designation is one which one has to be careful about.  If we were to designate half the country, or three quarters of it, or all of it, we might as well not have the scheme but just class Ireland as a designated area.  One has to be careful about rolling out the designated areas schemes because that could become counter-productive.  I accept that the Deputy is worried about the Dublin area. I should mention that an extension of the designated areas in regard to urban renewal for areas of Dublin, such as Tallaght, and Limerick was announced at the time of the Finance Bill and that has been extended up to 1991.  That will help somewhat in the Dublin city area, as will the financial centre development.  A lot of very good work has been undertaken by local communities throughout Dublin city and county which I would like to applaud.</P>

Will he indicate the Government's position on liberalisation in regard to services contained in this round?  Will he further indicate his view of the proposal by the US in the context of this round that all aid of any kind to agriculture should be abolished by the end of the century?  Finally, does he agree that it would be desirable, given the central importance of the issues in this round, for a special debate to take place, if necessary with strict time limits on speakers and so forth, for perhaps two hours some time before the summer recess &mdash; on the GATT round specifically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are four key questions.  We do, of course, support the European Community direction in its approach in the GATT talks.  It is expected to take some time.  There is talk of three or four years before these things come to a head.  The Deputy can take it that we fully support the European Community direction on this, particularly in regard to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some members regard agriculture as a fast track priority and others do not, and we are very much in the league which <Col N="2230" /> says that one does not rush this approach in the agricultural area for reasons which I know are obvious to the Deputy.  We do support the EC, particularly in the agricultural area.</P>
    <P>At the opposite end of the scale to agriculture, I think it is unlikely that discussions on services will move for a long time on liberalisation.  Talks seem to be concentrated at the moment on means of achieving liberalisation of services.  It is very unlikely that that will move very fast.  I will certainly keep the Deputy informed about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the USA, again Ireland has a particular interest in the agricultural area.  We will ensure that the European Community are very well aware of Ireland's sensitivities in the agricultural area and we would be quite worried about the United States proposal in regard to agriculture and will ensure that action is taken regarding a special debate, that is something I would not be able to agree to without consulting the Whips.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the House in reply to a question on 2 March last, I have received a request for Exchequer support from the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  I also indicated that I met representatives of the association and explained to them that, because of the financial situation facing the Government, I was not in a position to make funds available to them.  The question of the allocation of funds to the association in the context of the 1989 <Col N="2232" /> Estimates will be examined when those Estimates are being considered.</P>
      <P>As regards the position in other European countries, the situation varies considerably from country to country and it is not possible, therefore, to be categoric as to the extent to which governments provide financial assistance to associations which would be similar to the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  While some countries in the European Community may provide assistance to organisations which might be considered similar to the Consumers' Association of Ireland many countries do not provide such direct assistance.  In some countries, public funding of consumer protection activities is done at local or regional level, or funds are given to umbrella groups broadly representative of various organisations which may include trade unions, environmental groups and women's groups as well as consumer organisations, or a financial contribution is made for the purposes of a specific project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last <Col N="2234" /> point first.  Borrowing for productive purposes is always an attractive proposition. Unfortunately, very often the definition of &ldquo;productive&rdquo; is not agreed to by people; some people feel it is productive if you get an X rate of return; others feel it is productive if you get X jobs while others feel it is productive if you get X exports.  The principle, as put forward by the Deputy, is that it is attractive to borrow for productive purposes.  The difficulty arises in the definition of &ldquo;productive&rdquo; because it can and is increasingly becoming a very subjective phrase.  I want to help the Deputy in regard to as many specifics as I can though I have some difficulty in this regard.  Approved investments between June 1986 and May 1987 came to £6.2 million.  Investments in that period totalled £5.7 million.  The total number of employees in companies in which these investments were made is 750.  At 14 May 1987, 29 companies were invested in.  I can also inform the Deputy that there is a figure of £6 million in the 1988 Estimates of which £1.5 million has now been drawn down.</P>

Further, would the Minister of State indicate if the corporation have made any significant investments in regard to tourism or long term production contracts in the agricultural sector?</P>
      <P>Would he further indicate if he would be prepared to ask the corporation that in future annual reports they give a breakdown of their investments by the listed functions that the corporation have been given individually in the Act rather than globally, so that one can see how they are implementing the individual parts of their statutory mandate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for national planning including regional development.  I have no plans at present to give any specific guidelines to the State industrial promotion agencies in relation to regional development.</P>
      <P>Under the Industrial Development Act, 1986 I am empowered, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to designate certain parts of the country for higher level capital grant assistance as a means of giving special encouragement to the development and location of industry in such areas.  At present, 11 counties along the western seaboard plus west Cork and part of County Limerick are designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's answer in one regard.  He says that he has issued no instructions with regard to regional development.  Is he saying that with the advent of regional application towards the EC and the single market he has no plans even at this stage or no ideas coming forward as to what is to happen in this area?  I hope that he has some plans.  Would he indicate what they are at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there are plans.  The question is whether I intended to give specific guidelines and also the basis on which priority status is allocated to various towns.  With regard to priority <Col N="2237" /> status, the factors taken into account are, for example, factory closures and the effect on the local economy, unemployment, availability of a suitable work force, suitability of town areas for further industrial development and realistic options for achieving industrialisation in the area.  Under the Industrial Development Act of 1986 the IDA have been given the role of fostering the national objective of regional industrial development. I am happy that the agencies in the field are taking account of regional development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the whole basis of the market is changing at the moment and that there is need for specific guidelines, not to increase bureaucracy but to define where we should be going now rather than waiting for a year or two?  Would the Minister accept that there is a need for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that completely. The increase in the European Community structural funds and increased access of Ireland to those funds will give us additional scope in the area of regional development.  The Government are looking very closely into this matter. One must be very careful also in this regard.  A large amount of those funds would obviously be allocated on a project by project basis rather than county by county.  Perhaps in many ways the latter might be a more sensible approach to take.  The Deputy is quite correct, the ballgame is changing because of the structural funds.  I am fully aware of that and we are planning accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an order in <Col N="2239" /> December 1987, entitled the Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, 1987.  This order, which came into effect on 10 March, 1988, requires that advertisements, which make references to the availability and cost of credit, and any publicity material about credit on display in premises where credit is available, must show the true cost of that credit by indicating the annual percentage rate of charge (APR).</P>

The main provisions of that directive are &mdash; first, an obligation to disclose all relevant information to the consumer, in particular as regards the true cost of credit; secondly, rules relating to early termination of contracts and repossession of goods; thirdly, joint liability of creditor and the supplier of goods and services acquired under a credit agreement under certain defined circumstances and finally, there will be provisions which relate to supervision and control of persons granting credit.  The legislation is being prepared at the moment.  I shall see if I can expedite it but am not aware of the Dáil schedule in these matters.,</P>

      <P>With regard specifically to moneylending, to which my question related, has the Minister any proposals with regard to controlling moneylenders or improving the legislation which controls them and the rates they charge?  Is the Minister aware of the device being used by some moneylenders whereby they simply offer credit and make a service charge for the provision of this credit which runs at something like 50 per cent per annum?</P>

      <P>I know the Minister for Social Welfare is active in this area.  I agree with the Deputy that this is a major social evil, one which the Government are determined to stamp out.  The new legislation will control persons granting credit and I interpret it as including moneylenders.  If that is not the situation I will communicate with the Deputy.  In a broad way I am aware of the device being used to get around the credit problem. I will certainly make sure that the Minister for Justice is fully aware, because the moneylenders Acts come under the ambit of the Minister for Justice. I will ask the Minister to consider what he can do to bring this practice to an end.</P>

If that is not the case, will the Minister agree that one of the main reasons this scandal of moneylending continues is that there is a division of responsibility with regard to consumer credit and the Department of Justice have so many other legislative priorities that they are not dealing with this matter as expeditiously as they should?  Would the Minister agree, if it is not already the case, to get a Government decision to allocate entire responsibility to his Department for the moneylenders Acts, so that all aspects can be dealt with in the legislation which he has just promised, <Col N="2241" /> rather than just the bits that emanate from the EC directive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has satisfied himself with the existing regulations, controls and legislation governing public health and safety with respect to the manufacture and sale of foodstuffs and consumer goods generally; if he has satisfied himself with labelling and description standards in this regard; his views on the use of technical terms to describe additives to such goods; and whether he intends to take any initiative in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibility in the matters raised by the Deputy's question extends only to the safety aspects of consumer goods generally and to some aspects of labelling.  Areas such as public health and the manufacture and sale of foodstuffs are the responsibility of a number of other Ministers such as the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> With regard to the safety of consumer goods I am empowered under section 44 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, to make orders prohibiting the manufacture, assembly or sale of products unless they comply with certain requirements specified in the order.  To date 17 orders have been made under section 44, each of which has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. They relate to such diverse items as babies' dummies, electrical plugs, children's nightwear, furniture, etc.</P>
    <P>Enforcement and surveillance of the Product Safety Regulations are handled by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  Laboratory testing services and technical advice are provided to the Department by EOLAS &mdash; The Irish Science and Technology Agency.  Surveillance is carried out at point of sale. Goods which appear suspect are purchased and a warning given at the time of purchase that the goods will be submitted to EOLAS for examination.  If, as a result of that examination the goods are found to be in breach of the regulations, the seller may be prosecuted.  If the goods are not covered by regulation then consideration is given at that time to the making of an order under section 44.</P>
    <P>A new Product Safety Bill is at present at an advanced stage of drafting.  This will create, for the first time in Irish legislation, a general requirement to trade in safe goods from the manufacturing or importation stage right through to the sale to the public.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of labelling I would refer the Deputy to a detailed reply which I gave in response to a similar question tabled by Deputy Harney on 2 March, 1988 &mdash; Question No. 14, Volume 378, Dáil Official Report, columns 1449 to 1450.</P>
    <P>As regards additives used in foodstuffs, under regulations which I have made, to come into effect in July next, the name of an additive or its identifying E number will be required to be given on a label in addition to the category to which the additive belongs.  I am satisfied that this will result in consumers being given the details necessary to <Col N="2243" /> enable them to identify particular additives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that the publication of an E number, a technical expression relating to a particular form of additive, perhaps printed in microscopic print on packaging, is a serious attempt to try to help consumers to understand precisely what additives are in food, some of which have damaging effects on health?  A much more sensible way of doing it would be simply to print clearly in plain English what additives were in the food and to ban additives that have a damaging effect on health.  In that context would the Minister say whether or not he is expecting us to be assured by what he has just told us, that we will have more technical gobbledegook, which at present falls far short of satisfying anybody anywhere in Europe?  I am looking for plain English so that the ordinary consumer can make a choice based on a rational analysis of the facts which will not be hidden behind a maze of technical jargon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy's objectives but we on this island do not live in isolation.  We live as part of a world trading block, the European Community, and the essence of the internal market and of the European Community is that we try to act together in these technical areas.  It is easy to say: &ldquo;Put on a label stating what is in the bottle&rdquo; but if one is dealing with 12 countries and thousands of manufacturers with different views of what those commodities are, it is difficult to be simplistic, and it is dangerous to be simplistic.  We are working within the European Community to make sure that products are safe and that the public know what additives are in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present legal requirements for the labelling of foodstuffs are set down in the European Community's regulations. These regulations, together with the EC Directive to which they give effect, require certain specified details to be given on the labelling of foodstuffs.  This <Col N="2244" /> is already happening in a lot of areas.  As well as that, in response to public demand for greater information about additives, the Minister made amending regulations on 31 July last which revoke existing derogations.  These regulations will come into effect on 1 July next and will require an indication of the specific name of an additive or its E number, in addition to its category name.  That is a genuine attempt to tidy up the information for the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be specific in telling us where in any EC agreement the Irish Government are inhibited from being explicit about information on additives, as well as perhaps publishing the E number on the package? Is there some bar on this Government acting with some degree of autonomy and responsibility as far as the consumer is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is in favour of harmonising these matters throughout Europe.  This means that we should be slow to go off on our own flight of fancy with it.  I would remind the Deputy that on 1 July next regulations will come into effect requiring an indication of the specific name of the additive or its E number in addition to its category name.  Specific information will be required after 1 July.  This has been undertaken in accordance with the whole EC.  I remind the Deputy again that a new Product Safety Bill is at present at a very advanced stage.  That legislation will for the first time introduce a general requirement to trade in safe goods throughout all stages of preparation.  I can inform the House that that Bill is at an early stage of preparation.</P>

Would he not agree that it might help in increasing public assurance in this area if the Consumers' Association of Ireland were represented on the standards body who do a lot of work in this area?  If the Minister of State is worried about harmonisation in an EC context, perhaps he would listen to the EC recommendation in this respect which, if implemented, would ensure that the Consumers' Association of Ireland were represented on the standards body as is the case in most other European countries.  Secondly, as the Minister of State is no doubt aware of recent deficiencies in funding for the same association, would he be willing to consider allocating some funds from the national lottery to this body?</P>

      <P>Before adjourning the debate last night I made the point that we need an adequate health education programme in our schools as an increasing number of young people are getting involved in drinking.  I have before me the results of two surveys which have been carried out.  The first survey which has been referred to by some of the previous speakers was carried out in 1986 by the ERSI.  Approximately 3,000 young people aged between 13 and 17 years of age were surveyed.  It was found that the medium age at which the first drink was taken was 12.8 years.  About 17 per cent had taken their first drink before the age of ten and 7.6 per cent and taken their first drink alone.  Thirty-seven per cent were regular drinkers and this compared to a figure of 12 per cent in 1970.  These figures prove that there is an alarming <Col N="2292" /> increase in under-age drinking, especially in the younger age groups.  Since 1970 there has been an increase of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>In a more recent survey carried out in Galway, using a sample of 262 young people aged between 14 and 17, it was discovered that the average age at which the first whole alcoholic drink was taken was 13.2 years with 82 per cent consuming their first drink before the age of 15 and 9.2 per cent of ten-year olds doing likewise.  That survey also showed that 91.5 per cent of under-age drinkers bought alcohol without any form of false identification, that 28.8 per cent took alcohol from home without the knowledge of their parents and 23.7 per cent had obtained drink from friends.</P>
      <P>Those surveys prove conclusively that we have a problem with under-age drinkers and this Bill is one way of facing up to that problem.  Last night I made the case for an adequate health education programme in our schools and I believe such a programme should be integrated into the full curriculum.  Previous efforts to introduce an effective health education programme in our schools have failed if we are to judge from the effects which they have had.  If they had been effective we would not now have the problem which we have.</P>

    <P>It is also important that we introduce a public health education programme and the media, especially television, can play a major role in this respect.  Indeed, television tends to glamorise drink: it gives the impression that drinking is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing and it portrays people drinking and having a lot of good fun.  Probably the best advertisements on television are the ones which relate to drink.  I think all drink advertisements should be accompanied by a statement similar to the one carried on cigarette boxes, stating that too much alcohol can damage your health.  In any public campaign we should use sports and music personalities as examples for our young people.  For example, personalities such as Stephen Roche, Jack O'Shea and Eamon Coughlin, who did a good job in getting Kaliber off the ground, could play a major role in influencing our young people not to <Col N="2293" /> drink or if they do drink to drink in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>Not enough money is spent on preventive measures.  For example, every year the Government take in over £400 million in Customs and Excise duties whereas this year they will spend a little over £1 million on a health education programme of which only a fraction will be allocated towards educating people on the proper use of alcohol.  I think it is time that the Government spent more money on preventive measures.  It is estimated that we lose £1 billion each year on absenteeism and one-third of this is alcohol related, either through hang-over or physical or emotional effects after the night before.  This is another major factor that we should take into consideration.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to expand their budget for health education which amounted to £2 million last year and amounts to only £1 million this year.  That reduction in allocation is inexcusable. The one body who are actively fighting abuse of alcohol are the Irish National Council on Alcoholism and they are facing serious cutbacks at present.  For example, this year they received £62,000 to run their office and their campaign. Next year that amount will be reduced to £42,000.  No doubt they will find it impossible to pursue their preventive programmes.  The Government will have to increase the funding and ensure that that body can continue their very effective programme.  I appeal to the Minister to make representations to the Minister for Labour to increase funding for this body who are doing very effective work.</P>
    <P>Funds are available at present from the national lottery.  I compliment the Minister for Sport on his efforts to provide recreational facilities but that alone is not enough.  We have to provide the expertise to use these facilities properly. We have to put more money into the training of leaders and instructors in order that the young people cannot alone use these facilities but know how to use them.  The provision of facilities alone will have little effect if the proper leadership qualities are missing and if there is not proper instruction.  Again, I appeal <Col N="2294" /> to the Government to use the national lottery funds intelligently and constructively. I am not satisfied with the way much of that money is being spent. It seems it is being spent in a piecemeal and fragmented fashion.  We need a more clearcut policy on the way it is spent.  If it is to have the desired effect on our youth we would have to draw up some kind of national policy over a five year period showing where we intend to spend the money during that time, our principal philosophy behind spending the money and what we hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>All sectors are concerned about under-age drinking and are anxious that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; be removed from the Bill.  It was very hard to bring about convictions when this word was in the legislation. However, too much pressure will be put on the publication to prove that people are over 18 years.  I suggest that some system be devised which the publican can call on to ensure that people being served alcohol are over 18 years. As was mentioned earlier, young people mature faster nowadays and they can present themselves in ways that make them look much older than they are.  I have always been in favour of and advocated the use of ID cards.  Some simple system of identification will have to be devised.  The objection to this would be at what age would a person not need an ID card or should everybody have one.  I am in favour of that system but the people who are opposed to it would say that it would introduce a police State.  An ID card system could be used in a very positive way.  It could only be of help not alone as regards underage drinking but also in other areas.  I know this matter has been discussed but I ask the Minister to expand on the whole idea of excluding the ID card system from this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to restaurant licences.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland fear that the livelihoods of existing publicans, who are finding it very difficult to survive at present, will be affected by this measure.  A number of publicans have requested that the restaurant owners be allowed use up existing licences that are now dormant.  I would <Col N="2295" /> suggest that the Government take those licences out of existence and even buy them if they have to.  There are too many licensees in this country at present and some publicans are finding it very difficult to make a living.  Restaurants are allowed serve alcoholic drink on Christmas Day and that gives them an unfair advantage over the publican.  Some publicans also have restaurants on their premises and those people will have an advantage over everyone else.  I would like the Minister to comment on this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  As I said last night, this is the first effort that has been made to introduce effective laws in relation to the abuse of alcohol.  We should follow this up with further legislation at a later date.  As I mentioned last night, hygiene is not mentioned in this Bill.  I know hygiene in public houses is covered by other legislation but nevertheless we are dealing here with licensed premises and it would be no harm if certain regulations governing the hygiene of premises were introduced in intoxicating liquor Acts. Hygiene in public houses leaves a lot to be desired and there is definite room for improvement.  At a time when we are trying to encourage tourists to come to our country the highest standards should prevail.  I compliment Deputy Seán Barrett for introducing a Bill to cover under-age drinking and I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the members of this House for the very valuable contributions they have made to the debate.  At the outset, I would like to repeat what I said in my opening remarks, that during the course of Committee Stage of this Bill I will be more than prepared to sit down and discuss the merits of any amendment.  I say that in particular having regard to Deputy Colley's contribution last evening in which a number of very important points were made and I say the same to Deputy Deenihan now.  There is room for improvement in this Bill.  It is something that we all want to see.  On behalf of <Col N="2296" /> the Government party I am more than prepared to do what I can in the interests of having better legislation, bearing in mind the problems we are trying to deal with.  I accept, as does everybody else, that we cannot legislate for morality, and thank God for that, but we can do our part in helping to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made as to how we can make the legislation more effective, particularly having regard to the problem of under-age drinking.  Some suggestions made by members of all parties are worth further consideration.  If we could have informal discussions, even before Committee Stage, with Deputy Colley, Deputy Seán Barrett or anybody else on what attitudes might be to certain proposals, we could go a long way towards producing very worthwhile legislation at the end of the day.  When I say &ldquo;the end of the day&rdquo; I am not talking about months but perhaps a couple of weeks to consider amendments and then come back to this House.  Of course, this is subject to agreement between the Whips.  There is an acceptance between all parties that the Finance Bill will be discussed over the next two weeks, but perhaps we could deal with this matter the following week.  We should give this legislation the priority it deserves.</P>
      <P>There is another reason for moving rapidly, that is, have the licences for restaurants considered.  It is important that this legislation be brought in as quickly as possible so that the restaurants will be able to have their licences and be operational for the summer tourist season.  As far as I am concerned, there is no division among us.  I did not agree with some of the comments made from this side of the House and when one of my party colleagues made points with which I did not agree, I told him I could not go along that line for very good reasons which I would spell out on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I met with representatives of the interests involved &mdash; hoteliers, restauranteurs, vintners &mdash; and I advised them to speak to the spokespersons of the other parties, Deputy Seán Barrett <Col N="2297" /> and Deputy Colley.  I had not heard the comments from other Deputies at that time.  Some of the suggestions made may be worth taking on board, they are certainly worth considering.  I hope Deputies have taken my suggestion to heart and will make their submissions in a matter of days.  As I said to the people I met last night, and as I said in this House yesterday, with regard to amendments one has to be very careful that one sectional interest does not take from another.  If we are not we will have an unmerciful tug-of-war and we will fall down with regard to getting fair, worthwhile and proper legislation on the Statute Book, which is what we all want to see.</P>
    <P>There is very great concern about under-age drinking.  I want to publicly express my appreciation to Deputy Seán Barrett and to all the Members of this House who participated in the debate on this subject over the last few weeks.  The fact that there have only been five or six prosecutions over a period, is no reason to believe the problem does not exist.  Of course it exists and we are expected to do something about it.  We can only do a certain amount and I hope from the publicity given to these debates that parents will be reminded that they, too, have a very serious part to play, something they seem to forget.</P>
    <P>Like every other Deputy I want to see legislation which will be enforced fairly and squarely right across the board.  I want to see legislation that will be respected by the general public and by those engaged in selling alcohol.  This is very necessary.  Last night, one of the Deputies said the law with regard to the ten minute drinking up time was not being enforced, that it was impossible to enforce.  That is generally accepted.  We see there is a problem there and we are trying to do something about it.  Deputy Davern outlined many difficulties in enforcing existing legislation.  We have to clear obstacles out of the way of the law enforcers and ensure that there is no reason the law is not observed.  We all want to see the law observed.</P>
    <P>My argument when speaking to <Col N="2298" /> interested groups and to Deputies and Senators, when we were discussing fines was that the law must be enforced.  Some people say the fines are too severe and others say they are too low.  There would be no need to discuss fines if people observed the law.  Why should we worry about fines if intoxicating liquor is sold only during the hours set down in legislation? Already people are saying a fine of £400 for a first offence is too severe. Of course it is, if a person flouts the law. It is meant to be a penalty, not a reward.</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper that a certain establishment had 100 plus people on the premises on Christmas Day and the judge could only fine the licence holder £40.  He would make that in ten or 15 minutes. We should have a real disincentive.  In Northern Ireland, he would be fined £1,000 and probably get 12 months in jail.  I think we are being very moderate and we are doing it this way to get the co-operation of the trade.  I am satisfied that those in the trade do not want an illegal after hours business.  They want to finish at 11.00 p.m. or midnight, but if there are loopholes, where one establishment serves drinks after hours and another follows suit then everything mushrooms and there is no control. Those days are gone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned severe penalties on those selling drink to under-age persons.  I look forward to discussing this section on Committee Stage and to hearing proposals from any side of the House. I think we will find support for such a measure right across the board.  If Deputies suggest any way to deal more effectively with this problem I will be prepared to consider it.  Last night Deputies said if we were positive about tackling under-age drinking we should have a system of identification.  I have no hang-ups about that.  Having regard to what was said in the debate, and taking into account my views on this matter, I am prepared to give that suggestion very serious consideration so that we can work out a fair and equitable system.  I recognise that there are people outside who will shout &mdash; they shouted at Deputy Seán Barrett and wrongly so &mdash; that Big Brother will be <Col N="2299" /> watching.  I resent Big Brother as much as anybody and, because of my job, I probably know Big Brother better than anybody.  I would be as watchful of people's rights and privileges as anybody else but we must, and can do something in this area.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Colley mentioned this as did her colleague, Deputy Quill, two weeks ago.  I did not agree with the details of the scheme spelled out by Deputy Quill but that does not matter as long as we agree in principle and do not hold up the Bill.  By way of an amendment, we might consider an enabling provision which would help us along the way. There is room for our collective wisdom to see if we can deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with the problem of cider parties and the fall-out from these parties, we should use our common sense and frame legislation to see how we can deal with it.  I believe we can do a very worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>A number of Members had reservations about allowing children in pubs with their parents or guardians while others welcome the change.  It is not an easy question to deal with but it is a matter of getting the balance right.  For instance, nobody suggested that we should allow children unaccompanied in pubs or that we should ban them from pubs.  The latter would seem to be going to the other extreme.  We are trying to strike a proper balance in regard to that. If Deputy Deenihan, while on his way home to his constituency of North Kerry with his wife and family, would like a sandwich in a pub he will be able to bring his family with him.  It is nice to see the family staying together rather than what happened when we were kids, the children remaining in the car while Daddy went into the pub for a sandwich and a bottle of beer and mother was lucky if she got a cup of coffee in the pub.  In my view we are going in the right direction in trying to strike the proper balance.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the ban on persons under 18 years of age being in the part of a licensed premises in respect of which a special exemption <Col N="2300" /> order is in force.  That provision will not, of course, apply to the premises as a whole but only to the particular part to which the exemption applies.  Accordingly, there is no question of those under 18 not being allowed, for example, in hotel premises where an extension is in operation.  The provision will merely prevent such persons being in the ballroom or wherever else the extension applies. We can deal with such matters in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A strong case was made by Deputy Davern and others, about the way drink is sold in supermarkets.  I accept that there is a problem there and I am prepared, during the course of Committee Stage, to pool our resources to try to deal with it.  It is not funny that in this day and age when alcohol cannot be sold through licensed outlets on Good Friday one can walk into a supermarket, or back up a truck and take it away if one can afford to pay for it.  There is no question of any proper supervision on who goes into such sections of a supermarket or what they do when they get there.  I am prepared to look at that and see to it based on our own experience, that they cannot be outlets for the sale of alcohol to under-age people.</P>
    <P>On the question of a notice about under-age drinking provisions the point was made that licensed premises should have to display notices about the provisions relating to under-age drinking. Sections 34 and 36 already require the posting of notices regarding the provisions excluding children from bars and excluding those aged 18 from late night extensions.  Whether one should go further and require notice about other provisions in Part IV is something that we can look at again but my first reaction is that the law regarding the supply of drink to the under aged will now be so well known to everybody, both licensees and patrons of licensed premises of whatever age, that further notices will be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of discussions on the question of making it an offence for those under 18 to be in the possession of containers of drink.  One thing we ought turn <Col N="2301" /> our minds to is that those over 18 who supply drink to under-age persons, or those who supply drink to those over 18 years of age who in turn pass it on to young people, should be dealt with.  We should watch out for that loophole on Committee Stage and do what we can to deal with it.  There is a strong consensus in regard to under-age drinking and our responsibilities in regard to that problem. I am pleased about that.  There are problems and there will be problems.  The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is being taken out of the old legislation and that will put a greater responsibility on licensees to make it their business to check the age of the person who is buying the drink.  We will have to see how best we can deal with that problem on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many points were raised about the new system of restaurant licensing.  In my view the policy of licensing good quality restaurants should be accepted by all reasonable people.  In replying to points made during the debate I intend to refer only to aspects of the proposed system.  A number of Deputies felt the fee of £3,000 was too low while others maintained it was too high.  Suggestions as to what would be an appropriate figure ranged in the last number of months from a low of £500 to a high of about £10,000.  Those suggestions were made to me when I was trying to put this package together.  In my view the licence fee should be related to requirements for obtaining the licence and what the licence will enable the holder to do.  Thus, it will not be necessary to extinguish an existing licence but it will be necessary for the applicant to have a good quality restaurant.</P>
    <P>The licence fee of £3,000 should be quite small relative to the cost of acquiring, equipping and running such a restaurant. On the other hand the holder of a special restaurant licence will be allowed to sell a full range of intoxicating liquor in association with substantial meals and possession of such a licence should generate a considerable income for the holder.  Being a licence to sell intoxicating liquor the fee should be more than just the nominal amount of a few hundred pounds.  On the other hand it <Col N="2302" /> is a restrictive licence in the sense that intoxicating liquor can only be sold with a substantial meal and at certain times of the day.  On weekdays a restaurant will be permitted to sell liquor from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 12.30 a.m. In all the circumstances a fee of £3,000 is not excessive.  The fee will be a once off one and the excise duty for the annual renewal will be the same as for public houses, £50.</P>
    <P>Restaurants with special restaurant licences will not be able to serve drink during the afternoon.  I appreciate that some restaurants may find this restrictive but in deciding on the time during which restaurants should be allowed to serve drink I considered that these times should coincide with the times most people could reasonably be expected to want a substantial meal in a restaurant.  Generally speaking these times are lunch time and the time of the evening meal.  It has been said that some people eat their meals in restaurants during the afternoon but most people eat substantial meals at lunchtime, tea time or later in the evening.</P>
    <P>I will have to have regard to the danger of a licence being abused if there was allday opening.  I should emphasise that the intention is that special restaurant licences should not enable the holders to carry on pub trade.  On the question of opening hours it has been said that public houses will be at a disadvantage because restaurants will be able to stay open until 12.30 a.m.  The closing time of 12.30 a.m. is already the standard closing time for any premises such as a registered club, licensed restaurant or licensed hotels that serve substantial meals to the public.  As a restaurant with a special restaurant licence will be in the same category it is only fair that they should have the same closing time.  That is already the case for public houses that have obtained restaurant certificates under which they serve substantial meals to the public.  The intention is that restaurants with special restaurant licences will not be in competition with public houses.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of restaurants, there is some dissatisfaction that the word &ldquo;bar&rdquo; has been defined so strictly.  It is <Col N="2303" /> central to the whole concept of the special restaurant licence that premises obtaining such licences cannot get involved in a bar trade.  Therefore, there can be no question of alcohol being served across counters or barriers or through hatches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Barrett wanted to know whether it would be necessary to place notices in newspapers regarding the applications for the granting of a special restaurant licence.  The answer is yes.  The licence will be renewable annually and under the law attracts all the conditions attached to it.  The granting of these licences can be objected to by any persons for the same reasons and in the same way as objections can be made to granting any liquor licence.  In addition, a Garda superintendent can object to the renewal of a special restaurant licence on the grounds that premises have not been bona fide and solely used as restaurants within the meaning of the Act.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies said that it is practically impossible for the Garda to enforce the law because of the way some of these restaurants operate.  Members of the House have said that, in trying to do so, the Garda may come to the door of a restaurant which is closed and cannot gain admission.  They are often left for ten or 15 minutes before they are allowed in to see that the law is being observed. I know that in one such place in recent times a man outside the door had a way of communicating with those inside and he was able to tell them that the Garda were coming, thus ensuring that everything was shipshape when they arrived. I will have discussions with the Garda Commissioner before Committee Stage to see how we can ensure that this obstacle in the way of the Garda can be dealt with.  It is not good enough and we cannot accept it.  It may even mean that the Garda superintendent will make this point in court at the hearing for the renewal of the licence so that the judge will take it into consideration.  It is a serious problem and is not confined to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Davern said that a requirement for late night exemptions is <Col N="2304" /> that a meal must be served.  Up to now the price of a meal was £2 but, as I said already, we propose to considerably increase that figure.  Deputy Davern also said that, in many of these places, meals are not served.  That is not how the system is meant to operate.  The Garda, up to now, have been unable to deal with this problem and we must ensure that food is served if restaurants have a licence.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the operation is to hold disco dancing and that drink is sold &mdash; it can only be sold if food is supplied &mdash; we must insist that food is supplied.  If there is a problem in this regard, we will deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley raised the question of St. Patrick's Day.  Someone else mentioned New year's Eve and I have no hang-up in regard to these two days.  It is a long time since I celebrated on the streets of the capital city on New Year's Eve but I would prefer to see people enjoying themselves in a disciplined fashion indoors than being rowdy outside. I will do anything to help commonsense to prevail, even on the most joyous occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that a smaller fee should be imposed on the seasonal restaurants as she thought the sum of £3,000 was excessive.  I gave this matter very serious consideration in trying to justify how a small restaurant in Waterville, Dingle, Ballybunion, Kilkee or Westport should pay the same fee as, say, Ernie's in Donnybrook which is open for six or seven nights of the week.  However, the same could apply to public houses or hotels that are closed for a number of months and I am advised very strongly that there is a better chance of having proper legislation if there is a degree of uniformity.  We all know families in different parts of the country who provide a lovely service for foreign and Irish tourists and they may operate for only half of June, July, August and may be a week or two in September.  It does not appear to be fair that they will have to pay the same fee as large restaurants open all year but I did consider the matter very seriously, as I was asked to do by the restaurant trade early in the year, and if that had <Col N="2305" /> not been a factor the fee would have been at a much higher level.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Seán Barrett expressing doubts regarding the abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  However, in fairness, he said he only had doubts and that he was open to convincing.  As the debate went on, I am sure his doubts vanished because none of us likes to see people staying on in licensed premises and getting to a stage where they cannot look after themselves.  In the new legislation, there will be an increased penalty for the licence holder who supplies drink to someone who should not have been served.  There is a responsibility on the licence holder not to serve alcohol to somebody who is not in total command of their senses.  The fact that the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; is to be abolished will not lead to any great excess in alcohol consumption because the principal factor governing such consumption is the amount of cash in the pocket.  There is also a very high awareness now among young people in regard to the dangers of excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>If people are found to have more than the permittted level of alcohol in their blood stream when driving a car they will immediately be put off the road.  It has taken a while for that message to get through but it is finally dawning on people that we are serious in this regard.  In other countries, the amount of permitted alcohol is even less than that permitted here and perhaps we should be thinking along those lines.  An advertisement a couple of years ago said &ldquo;two will do&rdquo;&mdash; I did not think very much of it &mdash; and I would prefer those who drive not to take any alcohol.</P>
    <P>I do not see the logic of saying that an extra half an hour's drinking-up time will lead to a higher rate of drunken driving. Most people, particularly those in charge of cars, recognise the consequences of driving if they have consumed too much alcohol.  They know that their safety &mdash; and that of others &mdash; is threatened and that they will lose their licence, which, in turn, will mean in many cases that they will lose their jobs.  The Garda are to <Col N="2306" /> be complimented on the way they have enforced the law.</P>
    <P>It is about 20 years since the law in regard to drunken driving was brought in and it was not very welcome at that time. It was one of the first issues I voted on in this House.  In reality it was the second; the first issue I voted on was in regard to another Limerick man, Steve Coughlan, who was unruly and the second was for the introduction of the breathalyser.  It has taken a while to win public approval and observance and the way the law has been enforced is responsible for its acceptance.</P>
    <P>A number of contributors raised the question of clubs, and I know there is a big problem in this regard.  You could start up a club anywhere with 25 members; you could enrol 25 names and start selling booze.  That is mad.  I would welcome further discussion on that to see if we can do something about it.  It is wrong.  We will take that one from there and deal with it.  If Members of the House had an opportunity to read the Official Report for 1957 on the Intoxicating Liquor Act they would see some of the comments made as to why clubs should not be inspected by members of the Garda Síochána below the rank of inspector. That argument does not hold today and we are taking away that privilege.  I would go further than that, although not within this Bill.  No member of the Garda Síochána should serve on the board of management of any of these clubs.  I know some do and it is wrong and the Garda Commissioner will be asked to look at that matter because it cannot be perceived that in such circumstances the law would be enforced fairly and squarely across the board.  It is not a matter for the Bill, but that should be discouraged. I am sure the commissioner could deal with that in some way as the House want him to do.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable effort, I believe, on my part to reply to most of the points made.  With regard to penalties, a number of Deputies thought the fine of £2, if convicted of being drunk and disorderly, is too low; it is.  It is just the price <Col N="2307" /> of a pint.  I will examine that and we will do something about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Barrett raised a considerable number of interesting points including the question of controls, the renewal of off-licences, the question of making provision in relation to sales of cider and that of imposing some controls on admission to discos.  We will look at these matters and see what we can do there.  Other suggestions were made that we consider greater penalties, as I have said, for those involved in selling alcohol to people under age.  I have no doubt that a number of Deputies will be exercising their minds on this and we will give their proposals every consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested that the Bill should contain provisions to ensure the highest standards of hygiene are maintained in licensed premises.  I point out to the Deputy that provisions of this kind are more appropriate to legislation administered by other Departments, such as food hygiene regulations administered by the Department of Health and perhaps it is wise to leave that area to them.  I am satisfied that it is fairly properly covered.  Deputy Deenihan spoke about the desirability of an educational publicity campaign to instil standards of moderation in relation to drink to help curb under-age drinking in particular.  I agree that such initiatives have a part to play in combating drinking, but any provision of this kind would probably be outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Drink advertising raises difficult questions and any move to include a provision in this Bill to restrict such advertisements would delay probably the progress of the Bill, but we can look at it and I will take up Deputy Colley's offer if we need further legislation in this area, and I thank her for the offer.  I am not prepared to wait a year or two to see how things are going before I do something about it. The only problem I have is to get it up and running as fast as I can.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  We have always been very conscious of the danger of advertising alcohol.  A number of years ago &mdash; do not ask me how many &mdash; I was able to persuade the board of RTE, which was part of my responsibility in Government, that there should be no question whatsoever of advertising hard liquor on TV.  In fairness, they accepted my argument and withdrew that advertising.  I am talking of the early seventies when revenue was badly needed to help them develop services and achieve the very high standards they have today, but they did that gladly, and they did it with regard to cigarette smoking and perhaps we can move along in other areas there.  Deputy Deenihan suggests we might educate the people more as to the right course of action.</P>
      <P>Again I would like to thank the Members who contributed to the debate. Their input was very helpful.  I hope Members will agree with me that the debate will really come into its own on Committee Stage.  Our major job in this Bill will be on Committee Stage.  It is a matter for the Whips but I will recommend to our Whip that if he gives us two clear weeks on this we will try to come up with amendments, get into debate, judge them on their merits and take it from there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2310" /> In page 5, to delete lines 34 to 36, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;`harbour-master' includes a person appointed by a harbour authority to enforce the provisions of section 33 of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I refer to the considerable contribution I made on Second Stage on the involvement of harbour masters.  On Committee Stage I withdrew very similar amendments pending consideration on Report Stage.  I do not propose to go over all the arguments again but I draw the Minister's attention to the points I have already made and I hope he will take them into account when responding.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the role being given to a harbour master within the Bill generally.  Harbour masters are not State employees and we should be very reluctant to extend their role without deep and considered investigation.  They should have very wide powers in relation to operational matters concerning their own harbours. New legislation is urgently required to achieve this but amending this legislation will not achieve what we need.</P>
    <P>I have proposed a further amendment to section 13 which would mean that the detention of a ship for purposes of civil liability would be initiated by the plaintiff's solicitor and the harbour master's role would be merely functional in that case.  The dangers of making the harbour master a prime mover in a civil process would thereby be obviated and the major objection to his involvement could be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Some of the amendments we are taking together come before my amendment to section 13 and others come after it.  This makes it a little difficult to know what line to take pending the outcome of my amendment to section 13.  Regardless of that, we would still be left with the general question of the harbour master's role in relation to inspection of certificates of insurance.  Undoubtedly as many officials as possible, including perhaps harbour masters, should have authority to inspect such certificates.  However, it is far from clear in the Bill who will have had this <Col N="2311" /> duty if it turns out afterward not to have been done.  Who will routinely inspect the insurance certificates of ships carrying a bulk cargo of 2,000 tonnes or more of oil when they arrive in the State?  I feel this ought to be the officer of customs but the Bill does not adequately provide for all customs officers, not just those specifically appointed as fishery inspectors, to have this duty and power.  I have tabled this amendment and the others which we are discussing with it because of this point and the other points which I reiterated on Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If I accepted this amendment it would mean that the harbour master would have powers only under section 33.  In effect he would have powers of inspection only.  I believe it is absolutely necessary that the harbour master should have powers of inspection under sections 13 and 16.  Sections 13 and 16 deal with powers to detain, while section 33 deals with powers of inspection only.  Having discussed the matter with my officials and obtained the advice of the Attorney General, we are absolutely convinced that if this legislation is to be of benefit then the harbour master must have the power to stop and detain vessels in his own port.  It is important that he be empowered under section 16 to demand from the master of a ship that he produce a certificate in relation to the existence of a contract of insurance and that if a ship attempts to leave a harbour in contravention of section 16 it may be stopped and detained by the harbour master and by many other officials who are named in the Bill.</P>
      <P>These powers of detention are not new for harbour masters.  They are given to them under section 6 (1) of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977 and under section 4 (5) of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  Section 6 (1) of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister or a harbour master has reasonable cause to believe <Col N="2312" /> that a vessel is in breach of the Act of 1956, the Act of 1965, or of this Act, and the vessel is within the territorial seas of the State, the Minister, or the harbour master concerned, may halt and detain the vessel.</P>
    <P>Thus it will be seen that the power to detain is not something new.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter very serious consideration since Committee Stage on 2 March, I regret we are unable to accept this amendment and the other amendments grouped with it.  It is vitally important that the harbour master should have power in his own port.  There is one difference between the harbour masters and other officers in so far as any of the other officers appointed by the Minister has this power in any part of the State but the harbour masters have it only within their own harbours.  I am referring to a harbour master as someone appointed by the harbour authority or by the Minister for the Marine as a harbour master for the purpose of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We went through these points in very great detail on Committee Stage and Deputy Doyle agreed to withdraw her amendments, subject to putting them forward again on Report Stage.  Following full consideration and the seeking of advice, I regret I cannot accept amendment No. 1.  That has a knock-on effect in amendments Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, and 12 to 20, inclusive, and I regret I am unable to accept this change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to protract the debate any further on this because we have spent a lot of time on this point at the different Stages of this Bill.  The reasons for my proposals have already been quite clearly put on the record of the Dáil over the time we have been discussing this.  The Minister's concern to give harbour masters the powers he underlines is understandable, especially in fishery harbours.  However, I would ask him to recognise that the role is anomalous. Why should we allow only this certificate to be inspected by harbour masters?  Why not all other important certificates carried by merchant ships? <Col N="2313" /> We are opening up an area here without going into it fully.  It is an <i>ad hoc</i> extension of the powers of harbour masters to suit whatever Bill is before the House instead of looking at the whole role of harbour masters and extending their role comprehensively if that is what the House feels we should do.</P>
      <P>My concern will still remain that the official who will routinely inspect the documents of ships arriving in the State is the officer of customs.  In principle, I think he or she should be mentioned expressly and in practice I do not think it is correct to say that all officers of customs are sea fishery protection officers by virtue of section 220 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 because the sea fishery protection officers have to be authorised in that behalf by the Revenue Commissioners.  I will leave my point, having made it.  I regret very much that the Minister does not feel able to take it on board and I will withdraw the amendment we have been talking about.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 33 and 34, and substitute the following:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided the Bills Office correctly read my longhand it was not inadvertently submitted.  The amendment is as I submitted it and I would just like to make a few points in relation to this section.  Section 7 (1) (c) states:</P>
      <P>An owner of a ship shall not incur any liability for pollution damage otherwise than under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> The exemption comes into play when pollution damage is caused by a ship carrying oil in bulk as cargo.  It is important to note that the word &ldquo;caused&rdquo; means simply &ldquo;done&rdquo; and is not used in its legal sense relating to causation.  Also the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; in the Bill has a wider meaning than in the convention.  Consider a collision between a passing supertanker and, say, a passenger ship in the Irish Sea due to the fault of the passenger ship.  The tanker sinks and there is no trace of any insurance; the passenger ship makes it into Dublin port; there is widespread pollution.  In these circumstances section 7 (1) (c) would seem to prevent a person suffering pollution damage from proceeding directly against the passenger ship.  I wonder does the Minister understand exactly what I mean in that example?  To ensure that the right of direct action is not lost in such a case I wish to press my amendment again as it now reads in the list circulated on Fourth Stage that an owner of a ship that is liable under this section shall not incur any liability for pollution damage otherwise than under this section.  I would ask the Minister to take that on board as it clarifies what his intentions are and protects in the situation I have just mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully appreciate the example which the Deputy has given in relation to a passenger ship. This legislation refers to ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed to the example of a passenger ship and an oil cargo ship colliding, the fault being with the passenger ship.  What is the position in relation to liability then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the oil tanker had sunk without trace and there was no insurance there is no comeback for those who have suffered pollution damage as a result of such a collision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in that unlikely event sufficient evidence would be available to obtain details of the vessel which had sunk.  The necessary details in relation to ships coming into or leaving our harbours are available to the authorities and we have shipping lanes.  I will look at this and if we feel it is absolutely necessary I would be prepared to amend this in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>My example is hypothetical but it highlights a gap in the section we are discussing now.  If the tanker sinks after a collision with a passenger ship, insurance certificates and all have gone down and there is widespread pollution damage, how do those who suffer pollution damage get redress according to the strict terms of the section here?  As it is here, section 7 (1) (c) says that an owner of a ship shall not incur any liability for pollution damage otherwise than under this section.  It defines quite specifically under what circumstances liability can arise.  My amendment extends that and ensures that in no circumstances that we have envisaged at this point anyway could the situation arise.  I accept that the Minister is prepared to look at it in detail and come back to the Seanad if necessary on it and perhaps we could leave the debate on this amendment for the moment.  I call his attention to it because while the example I gave may be hypothetical it is not beyond the bounds of possibility, given the type of trade we have on our seas at the moment.</P>

Contributions may be made by other people and only the mover of the amendment can make a second contribution. This is somewhat different from Committee Stage in so far as the Minister and Deputy Doyle are pursuing a matter of vital importance where we have not reminded them before now of the requirements of Standing Orders. Because they have been reminded I know they will abide by it.</P>

      <P>The fact is that this matter is of vital importance.  There are three different pieces of legislation involved in this.  The Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1977, covered the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which was carrying other materials rather than oil as cargo.  This legislation covers bulk oil and we will be introducing to the House, at the earliest possible date, the Sea Pollution Bill which by and large will refer to discharges of waste oil from vessels at sea.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 35 and 36, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) the servant or agent of the owner of a ship which is liable under this section and is registered in a Convention Country shall not be liable for pollution damage caused by that ship.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment to section 7 (1) (d) also arises out of the wording of the Convention. We discussed on Second Stage and on Committee Stage the necessity to strictly adhere to the wording of the Convention particularly when the rights <Col N="2318" /> or obligations of ships registered in Convention countries is concerned. However, this is not true when the ships of non-Convention or flag of convenience countries are concerned.  Accordingly the privilege of exemption from liability conferred by the Convention on the servant or agents of the owner need not be extended to non-Convention countries. We must remember too that the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; has a very restricted definition under this Bill and the Convention also and it may be necessary in certain circumstances to go after the agent of the registered owner such as an operating company or a chartering company. During the earlier discussions we referred to complications in relation to the ownership of boats such as the <i>Amoca Cadiz</i> and how difficult it would be to define &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in relation to the legislation we are talking about today.  That is why I would like the Minister to accept my amendment 7 (1) (d) to read that the servant or agent of the owner of a ship which is liable under this section and is registered under a Convention country should not be liable for pollution damage caused by the ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Doyle is asking us to accept the insertion of the words &ldquo;which is liable under this section and is registered in a Convention Country&rdquo;. The converse of that is that a vessel registered in a non-Convention country shall not be liable.  In relation to who should be responsible &mdash; the servant or agent or owner of a ship &mdash; we are extremely anxious to ensure that we can pin the responsibility on the owner instead of possibly exempting him and making the servant or agent responsible. One of the objects of the Bill is to enable us to become a party to a Civil Liability Convention and a Fund Convention.  The intention behind these funds is to bring about a measure of unification in international maritime law.  It is a fundamental part of our Constitution that we have an Act in accordance with international law.  We referred to this many times during the course of Committee Stage.  I want to reiterate that this section, <Col N="2319" /> more than all the others, mirrors the appropriate part of the Civil Liability Convention of 1969, and it would not be acceptable to amend this section as we could exempt the owner from non-Convention countries and hold the servant or agent responsible.  If one looks at the converse &mdash; as I said at the outset &mdash; it would leave us in a very difficult position and that vessels in non-Convention countries shall not be liable.</P>
      <P>While I have only the one opportunity to refer to this amendment it is important to say that we cannot, even by legislation, make it compulsory.  We have the voluntary arrangements which will cover cases where it is not compulsory to have it covered by legislation.  I appreciate that there are many countries not covered by the Convention but the voluntary arrangement should cover countries that are not party to the Convention.  I said that at the time, and Deputy Doyle could not accept it.  She did reluctantly at the end and withdrew the amendment but got leave to submit it on this Stage.  As this is vitally important legislation, and bearing in mind the long coastline which we have and the number of ships using the west coast in particular, we want to make absolutely certain that there are no flaws in it.  It would take some time to come back before the House, perhaps when it is too late, to close any loopholes which may be there.  We had an opportunity to study this at length over the last number of weeks.  I am convinced, having discussed it with my officials and with the Attorney General's Office, that while amendment No. 3 on Report Stage, which is by and large the same as amendment No. 5 on Committee Stage, may be well meaning, it does not in any way improve the legislation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1) Without prejudice to any power to detain a ship contained in any enactment, an inspector may stop or detain a ship in any harbour in the State or wherever such ship may be in the State, or a harbour master may detain a ship in his harbour, on the application of any solicitor practising in the State who has been instructed to institute proceedings <i>in rem</i> to arrest the ship in respect of a liability incurred under <i>section 7</i> for pollution damage caused by that ship or any ship in the same ownership.</P>
      <P>(2) A solicitor having made such an application shall, at the first opportunity thereafter, file notice of the detention in the Central Office of the Court in the form of a caveat against the release of property and thereupon a caveat against the release of the ship shall be entered in the &ldquo;Caveat Release Book&rdquo; maintained pursuant to the rules of the Superior Courts for the time being in force.</P>

I have made the point <Col N="2321" /> many times during the debates on Second Stage and Committee Stage that we are confusing criminal and civil law and criminal and civil law procedures right through this Bill.  I find that to be one of the major criticisms of the Bill generally. The Minister has bravely tried to defend and justify his reasons for doing this. Generally the Bill, and particularly section 13, adds a further layer of confusion to the already very confused arena of maritime law.  This Bill will do nothing to streamline or clarify maritime law at all, but will add another layer of confusion to this most vexed arena.  Due to the Minister's amendment on Committee Stage, the District Court procedure on sections 35 and following sections is rightly restricted to detention under sections 13 (3) and 16.  However, it is not clear how a speedy release is to be obtained from detention under section 13 (1) in respect of civil liability.  I should like the Minister to address that point particularly.  Bearing in mind the Minister's argument in favour of detention during the Stages of this Bill and my own previous arguments in favour of admiralty arrest &mdash; we have been through this at length, so I need hardly go over it again &mdash; it may be that everybody will be satisfied with the amendment I have now proposed.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider it.  There is no need to go down through the different aspects. It stands as read.</P>
    <P>The proposal contained in the amendment generally allows an intending plaintiff to short circuit the admiralty procedure to arrest.  The plaintiff would only have to contact the appropriate inspector, or harbour master, as the Minister has won the day on that argument, and file a simple notice in the Central Office.  The full admiralty procedure would then come into play to protect all parties.  The dispute remains firmly in the civil domain of the courts and State officials are kept clear of involvement. Again, I remind the Minister of my contribution on that point during Second Stage debate.  Furthermore, there will be no breach of the liability convention or the convention relating to the arrest of <Col N="2322" /> sea-going ships or of property rights enshrined in Bunreacht na hÉireann and international law.  This is an area where we must tread very carefully.  I know that I do not have to remind the Minister about that.</P>
    <P>Amendment 21 I have proposed as a new section, that is, section 47.  The Minister will recall that on Committee Stage I made the point that the purpose of this section was to remove any doubt as to the right to arrest a ship in a civil action for oil pollution damage and that in most countries the right is similarly reinforced by Statute.  The reason that those countries have reiterated the right in Statute is that <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> cast doubt on the right in maritime law.  The better view, I am advised, expressed in Thomas's <i>On Maritime Lien</i>, is probably that the right to arrest in the admiralty division of the High Court for pollution damage does exist without statutory authority.  It is far better to be safe than sorry and I would like this amendment, which effectively adds a new section, section 47, to be inserted in the Bill so that there is no doubt at all in relation to our intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long debate on the question of whether the powers of detention should be with the harbour master or officers appointed by the Minister or whether we should follow the practice which I understand pertains in the UK in relation to the admiralty division of the High Court.  If a ship causes pollution, we must act as expeditiously as possible.  I repeat, with the greatest respect, that to follow the road suggested by Deputy Doyle would be somewhat more cumbersome.  Let us take an example, of an oil spill on a Friday afternoon when, under the legislation proposed by me, the harbour master or an officer appointed by the Minister could detain the ship immediately. That would be an example of the civil law to which the Deputy has referred.  While we both differ at the outset, we meet further down the road in so far as the case would go to the High <Col N="2323" /> Court.  We put the onus, as far as the civil liability is concerned, on the owner of the ship to go to the High Court in order to have the boat released.  That can be done very speedily.</P>
      <P>By creating these new powers I am firmly convinced that we are not usurping the existing powers of the admiralty marshal. The admiralty division of the High Court which is the successor of the Court of Admiralty will continue to have jurisdiction over any claims for damage done by the ship.  When the boat is detained, the onus, in a civil case, is on the owners to go to the High Court and have the boat released.  Obviously the cost of this will relate to the damage caused.  If there is a question of not having a certificate of insurance it is dealt with at a different level; it can be taken to the District Court.  When a case is with the District Court the onus is on the Minister or his representative to defend the case there. When the case goes to the High Court it is dealt with by them whereas if a case is with the admiralty division of the court it means that if the damage occurred at the weekend, there is a question of the plaintiff having to swear an affidavit which would include certain specified information.</P>
      <P>If the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has a case made out on affidavit and that the action is a proper one in respect of which an arrest can be effected, obviously the arrest cannot be effected until they arrive at that stage which could be many hours or indeed days after the pollution was caused.  Under the legislation proposed by us the arrest can take place immediately.  Indeed, if we had to wait a few days to get to the High Court and to get all the necessary information, the sworn affidavits and the specified information, it could give sufficient time for any ship to leave our jurisdiction.  The legislation being proposed by us ensures that a ship can be detained immediately and the onus is on the owners to go to the High Court to ensure its release at the earliest possible date.  I have no doubt that the High Court will deal with such cases as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2324" /> In relation to amendment No. 21 and the new section 47 which Deputy Doyle proposes, I contend that the Bill provides that any actions arising out of it should be taken to the High Court.  This amendment was discussed with the Attorney General who has advised against the inclusion of amendment No. 4 and amendment No. 21.  If we accepted amendment No. 21 we would limit our actions and we would tie the hands of the High Court.  When the case goes to the High Court they will deal with it as expeditiously as possible.  After serious consideration I regret that I am unwilling to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister is not disposed towards taking on board amendments Nos. 4 and 21 which we are now discussing.  The Minister must know how strongly I opposed the original section 13 and of the various anomalies and defects I pointed out in that on Second Stage and on Committee Stage. To put it bluntly, the only people who will benefit from the confusion and contorted contrivance of section 13 as it now stands will be the legal profession.  We should make some last ditch effort to resolve the difficulties and the confusion between the civil process and the criminal process, and the legal chaos generally that exists in this area.  We are not doing that.  I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 4 but I will press amendment No. 21.  The Minister has heard my arguments on two previous occasions and there is no point in my wasting time in reiterating them. We may as well get an answer one way or another as to whether the House feels it acceptable to add another section, the proposed section 47, along the terms of amendment No. 21 as I have indicated.</P>

      <P>In relation to the civil and criminal legislation, the criminal legislation refers specifically to section 13 (3) of the Bill when a vessel which is detained tries to break out of detention. The fact that a vessel does not carry a certificate of insurance on board should be treated as a criminal offence and dealt <Col N="2325" /> with by the District Court.  If it is available in one's head office, and a true copy can be provided fairly fast, I have no doubt that the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor will take that into consideration.  It is adequately covered and I regret that I cannot accept amendment No. 21 although I appreciate the Deputy withdrawing amendment No. 4.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 45 to 51 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) if the ship is not registered in another Convention Country or the State, there is carried on board a certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) issued by or under the authority of another Convention Country, or</P>
      <P>(ii) which has been certified by the Minister that the ship satisfies such requirements as may be prescribed,</P>
      <P>and showing that there is in force, in respect of the ship, a contract of insurance or other financial security which satisfies the law of that Convention Country concerned or the State, as the case may be, relating to the bulk carriage of oil&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 16 and it arises from a debate on Committee Stage.  This amendment is to ensure that ships which are neither registered in another Convention country or this State carry on board a certificate showing that there is in force in respect of the ship a contract of insurance or other financial surety which satisfies the law of the Convention countries concerned or the State, whichever is appropriate, relating to the bulk carriage of oil.  On Committee Stage Deputy Doyle expressed concern regarding the provisions in the Bill relating to the insurance required to be held by the ship's registered in non-Convention <Col N="2326" /> countries.  The Deputy was particularly concerned that such ships might not hold insurance cover up to the same level as Irish registered ships or ships from other Convention countries.  I agreed to look at this and I feel that this amendment will be acceptable.  Indeed it is designed to overcome the problem and the difficulties expressed by Deputy Doyle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment as it indicates that the Minister was prepared to take on board the thrust of my amendment, No. 11, on Committee Stage.  When I withdrew my amendment at that time, the Minister indicated that he would look into the matter.  The thrust of my amendment was to close a loophole in the Bill as originally introduced whereby a non-Convention or flag of convenience ship would only have to comply with the law of its own country in relation to insurance.</P>
      <P>Compared to my amendment there are two major defects in the amendment proposed by the Minister of State.  I would have preferred if he had taken my amendment on board on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State proposes to give statutory recognition to the certificates of all other Convention countries when carried on non-Convention countries ships whereas my amendment would only recognise the certificates of such countries as the Minister may prescribe by regulation.  Obviously we must recognise the certificates of other Convention countries carried on ships flying the flags of those countries, even if we are unhappy about the insurance arrangements. However, I put it to the Minister of State that we do not need to extend this privilege to ships of non-Convention countries carrying those certificates.  We can, as he rightly proposes in his amendment, restrict ships of non-Convention countries to the certificates of countries we are satisfied with and have given approval to by regulations to be made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point, which is an important point relating to administrative convenience, is that the Minister of State is <Col N="2327" /> proposing in this amendment that certificates not issued by another Convention country would have to be certified by him.  Therefore, certificates issued by the United States of America, which according to the latest information available is not a Convention country, would have to be individually certified by the Minister.  I ask him to consider that fact from an administrative point of view. On the other hand, my amendment which I pursued on Committee Stage envisages that such a non-Convention country could obtain approval from the Minister for its certificates in regulations to be prescribed by the Minister.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to address those two defects, if I may call them that, in his amendment even though I welcome the thrust of the amendment which tries to accommodate the sentiments I expressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">

      <P>From an administrative point of view I see no difficulties whatsoever.  We want to cover all of the members of the fund including the USSR and perhaps there are a few which have ratified the Convention since September last.  We accept that ships of Convention countries will carry the certificate.  Irrespective of what countries have not ratified the Convention, be it the United States or otherwise, we want to be in the position whereby the Minister can inspect a ship.  In fact, this is the practice which has been adopted by all of the Convention countries from Algeria to the USSR and by most of our partners in the Community, including the UK, Norway and Spain.  I do not foresee any difficulties from an administrative point of view.  If it does cost money to carry out these inspections to ensure that the proper certificates and insurance is being carried, it would be money well spent.  I repeat that this is a practice which has been adopted by all of the other Convention countries.</P>

      <P>There is a major logistical difficulty with the Minister of State's amendment and let me draw his attention <Col N="2328" /> to it.  His amendment states that the certificate would have to be certified by the Minister.  It would make a lot more sense to have it certified by the Minister or his agents.  I have visions of a harbour master who would have to perform this function racing around the country trying to dig the Minister or the Minister of State out. Surely, it would be the Minister or his agents who would have to certify the certificate and not the Minister in person?</P>

I would like to make a point which may be acceptable to Deputy Doyle but if not we will <Col N="2329" /> take another look at it in the Seanad. That means we will have to come back to this House again.  We want to have this legislation enacted as quickly as possible. Section 7 (2) covers the right of an owner who is responsible for pollution to proceed against a third party whose negligence gave rise to the pollution in the first place, for example, through colliding with a vessel which leaked oil.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill which I have brought before the House today deals with one of the major public health problems of our time. It is a problem which arises from the consumption of a traditional consumer product, tobacco, which itself is the cause of an epidemic of illnesses and premature death.  This epidemic is wholly preventable and the Bill is a further measure designed to control and reduce the consumption of tobacco products with a view to diminishing the toll of self-induced illness resulting from these addictive products. My concern with the discomfort, illness and disease suffered by passive smokers is also reflected in the manner in which the Bill is constructed.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the detailed provisions of the Bill I feel it is important that the House should be made fully aware of the serious nature of the public health problem caused by smoking.  Thirty years ago when smoking had become widely established it was not regarded as a health problem.  However, the medical evidence which has accumulated since then is both damning and conclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smoking is now known to be associated with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, cancer of the bronchus, the lung, the trachea, the mouth, the throat, the pancreas, the bladder and the kidney.  Those who promote and support the development of legislation of this type are often described as subjective critics, as being zealous, misguided or working on defective evidence.  I would like to put it on the record of this House that the <Col N="2333" /> medical evidence worldwide against tobacco smoking is conclusive.  The statistics on the effects of smoking on public health in this country are horrifying.</P>
    <P>There are over 16,000 deaths each year from smoking related illness in Ireland and it is estimated that as many as 5,000 of these deaths are directly due to smoking. Put another way, 100 Irish people experience premature, and often painful, death every week, directly as a result of tobacco smoking.  Thousands of other Irish people suffer from painful and debilitating diseases, such as emphysema and lung cancer, directly as a result of tobacco smoking.</P>
    <P>There is also a popular misconception put around by subjective critics or those with vested interests that the people who die or who are disabled as a result of smoking are elderly and would have died anyway.  Deaths from smoking related illnesses accounted for 52 per cent of all deaths of those aged 35-64 years in 1982. Smoking is the single most important cause of death in middle age.  The damage to public health from tobacco smoking is of epidemic proportions and no Minister for Health could fail to take appropriate action to do all in his power to reduce the resultant toll of illness and death.</P>
    <P>Tobacco smoking and its resultant illnesses also impose an enormous strain on the health services.  Each year about 480,000 days are spent in hospital as a result of smoking-related illnesses.  It is estimated that the hospital cost alone associated with these smoking-related illnesses is in excess of £50 million.  The costs of our-patient services, general medical services, disability payments and days lost at work are likely to pose equally high costs to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Government have considered all the aspects of the tobacco issue and its implications and decided that public health considerations far outweigh the marginal economic impacts which a gradual reduction in tobacco consumption over a number of years will effect.  Smoking is a social habit which directly affects public health, public policy, families and <Col N="2334" /> individuals.  Many middle-aged adults are cut off in their prime leaving young families.</P>
    <P>In addition to self-induced illnesses the medical evidence now indicates that the health effects of smoking also impacts on non-smokers through breathing in air which contains other people's smoke. This is called passive smoking.  Until the late seventies researchers felt that this was simply a social nuisance, but they have now shown that it poses significant public health risks.  Passive smokers breathe in the smoke that comes from the end of a lit cigarette as well as the smoke exhaled by the smoker.  The unfiltered smoke of the smouldering cigarette is more dangerous than that inhaled by the smoker. Exposure to tobacco smoke leads to a rise in pulse rate and blood pressure. People with bronchitis, emphysema, asthma and chronic lung disease are all adversely affected when forced to remain in smoky atmospheres.  Those suffering from certain forms of heart disease are vulnerable to any reduction in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood as happens when they are forced to breathe in a smoky atmosphere.  Similarly, people with angina are more prone to suffer attacks when exposed to a smoky atmosphere.</P>
    <P>There is emerging evidence of an increased risk of lung cancer for non-smokers who are exposed to passive smoking for many years.  The weight of evidence available indicates that about a third of the cases of lung cancer in non-smokers who live with smokers may be attributed to passive smoking.  It is also estimated that about a quarter of the cases of lung cancer in non-smokers in general, may result from passive smoking.</P>
    <P>Smoking is now a minority habit.  Two thirds of the Irish adult popultion choose not to smoke.  In addition, research has shown that almost half of those that continue to smoke admire those that do not smoke; feel that smoking is a dirty habit and that the rewards of smoking do not justify the costs.  The research has also shown that almost half of smokers cannot break their addiction despite having <Col N="2335" /> negative attitudes to smoking and being aware of its harmful effects.  Three-quarters of smokers indicated that they would like to smoke less and over half of all current smokers expressed a moderate to strong wish to give up smoking.  Smoking is highly addictive and once you have become a smoker it is difficult to give up, even if you want to.</P>
    <P>The actions which I am therefore proposing in the Bill support the wishes of the majority of smokers and non-smokers alike.  The tobacco industry and the pro-smoking interests cannot present themselves as the sole representatives of the smoking population when over half of that population have indicated a desire to overcome their addiction.  Recent research has also shown that 56 per cent of Irish smokers strongly agree that smoking should be confined to special smoking areas.  The controls on public smoking contained in the Bill therefore represent the majority wish of smokers as well as non-smokers and there is not a majority of public opinion to support the argument that smokers should be free to smoke everywhere.</P>
    <P>On 11 February the European Parliament adopted a resolution which welcomed the measure taken by various member states to introduce a smoking ban in public places and called on other countries to follow suit with a view to the complete prohibition of smoking, both in public buildings and in enclosed spaces which are open to the public.</P>
    <P>The European Communities Europe Against Cancer programme has also targeted the reduction of tobacco consumption as the main priority in reducing the high levels of morbidity and mortality from cancer, in the EC.  The programme was debated by an EC Council of Health Ministers in May 1987 which I attended, and there is widespread support amongst the member states for initiative aimed at reducing the incidence of cancer in the Community.  Under the Europe Against Cancer programme, the Euopean Commission, by the end of this year, will be submitting to the council a proposal for the control of tobacco smoking in public <Col N="2336" /> places.  The contents of the Bill are therefore in line with developments in the European Community generally.  They are also in line with international developments.</P>
    <P>By 1982, 31 countries had enacted legislation restricting smoking in public places.  This number has increased continually since then.  More than 80 per cent of the states in the USA make it illegal to smoke in certain places or mandate that smokers be segregated from non-smokers. In Belgium, for example, smoking is restricted in public transport, public buildings, hospitals and other health institutions, schools, theatres and cinemas. In this country the voluntary prohibitions on smoking on the DART services, introduced some years ago, and the more recent introduction of smoke-free bus services by Dublin Bus has indicated the popularity of these controls and the willingness of the public to abide by them.  With little or no enforcement, an environment has been created overnight on the DART and Dublin buses which respects the rights of the non-smoker and, more importantly, it has been accepted by the smoker.  It is heartening to see that once the conditions are provided the result required is actually attained.</P>
    <P>The control of smoking in public places is also in keeping with developments in health policy.  Shortly after taking up office I announced the establishment of a health promotion unit in my Department and the establishment of an advisory council on health promotion.  The development of an emphasis on health promotion is an attempt to create, through public policy, an environment which is protective of, and conducive to, healthy living.  The control on smoking in public places is the type of action which makes the healthy choice the easy one for the smoker and protects the health of non-smokers.  It is the type of action which will be increasingly necessary if we are to reduce the enormous burden of preventable illness here.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, is an enabling <Col N="2337" /> piece of legislation which gives the Minister for Health power to make regulations to prohibit or restrict smoking in a variety of public places.  The places which are designated in the Bill are those in which there is a high level of public support for smoking control.  They are all enclosed public places which smokers and non-smokers are forced to share.  The discretionary power to prohibit or restrict smoking will allow me to consider the nature of the areas concerned and the duration of stay in them, before drafting my specific controls.  In view of the growing evidence of the health risks of passive smoking it is imperative that the Minister for Health should retain the power to prohibit smoking totally in any area where he feels that the public health risks are unacceptable.  An example that readily springs to mind in this respect is the maternity wards of hospitals.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill the owner, manager or person in charge of the public places in question has the primary responsibility for enforcing the controls on smoking.  In the event that individual smokers fail to comply with the restrictions they can be fined a sum not exceeding £100.  However, I would expect, on the basis of existing controls on smoking that there will not be any great difficulty in getting public co-operation with regard to these controls.  In the event that prosecutions are necessary regarding the enforcement of these controls, I have made it an express provision of the Bill that it will be a defence for the owner or manager of the public place to show that they had taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the prohibitions or restrictions were enforced.</P>
    <P>In addition to controls in public places I have included a number of other provisions which are necessary to update the law in relation to tobacco.  Under section 3 of the Bill, I have updated the law on the sale of cigarettes to children.  At present it is an offence to sell cigarettes to persons under 16, under the Children Act, 1908.  However, the provisions of that Act, allowing for a maximum fine of £2 are well out of date.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that smoking <Col N="2338" /> among schoolchildren is a significant problem.  One study of Irish adolescents between 11 and 13 years of age found that 49 per cent experimented with smoking. The earlier a person begins smoking the greater the damage to health.  The evidence indicates that if people had not started smoking in their adolescent and teenage years they are very unlikely to begin in adult life.  The evidence indicated that we need to take a strong stand on teenage smoking and the provisions of section 3 of the Bill are designed to have this effect.  I will be referring to under-age smoking again when dealing with section 6.  Under section 3 any person who sells or makes available tobacco products to children will be liable to a fine not exceeding £500.  Highly addictive products such as tobacco should not be made available to children under any pretext and the Bill has been drafted accordingly.</P>
    <P>Since young people often purchase cigarettes from automatic vending machines section 3 (2) of the Bill is drafted to ensure that these machines are properly supervised.  This is a common international response to this problem. In Canada a legal duty is imposed on the person in charge of a vending machine to make sure it is not used by children. Similarly, in Finland the sale of tobacco products from vending machines is permitted only where the machine is under supervision.  Cyprus has banned vending machines altogether.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill also deals with restricting the access of children to cigarettes. Under the old maximum prices orders for cigarettes, it was illegal to sell cigarettes singly.  However, the previous Government removed this provision when they abolished the relevant maximum prices order.  My Department consistently receive complaints about unscrupulous shopkeepers who break packages of cigarettes and sell them singly.  Single cigarettes are a particular attraction to children with limited money and a desire to experiment with cigarettes. The provisions of section 4 of the Bill will outlaw this undesirable practice and should restrict further the current <Col N="2339" /> access of children to these addictive, carcinogenic products.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill gives the Minister for Health the power to determine what additives are used in tobacco products and to prohibit specific additives which he thinks are particularly injurious to health. At present a voluntary agreement exists between my Department and the Irish tobacco manufacturers which achieves the objectives of section 5 of the Bill. However, this agreement does not extend to importers of tobacco products and the statutory provisions set out in section 5 will ensure that the Minister can treat imported and Irish manufactured products similarly.  With the drive towards low tar cigarettes and the development of tobacco technology, an ever-growing list of additives and tobacco substitutes are being used in tobacco products.  It is imperative that the Minister for Health should have statutory power to control these additives in the interest of public health, just as statutory powers exist in relation to the use of additives in foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill deals with the evergrowing range of products known as oral smokless tobacco products.  These are a range of tobacco products largely developed in the USA and Scandinavia which are designed to be used by being placed in the mouth and sucked or chewed.  These products contain high levels of nicotine and this is absorbed through the mouth.  They are highly addictive and are often marketed at people who wish to give up smoking but who cannot break their addiction.  The section is thus preventative in this context and further strengthens our controls over under-age smoking contained in section 3.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has stated that smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.  The World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer has extensively reviewed these products and has reported that there is sufficient evidence that the oral use of both chewing <Col N="2340" /> and sucking tobaccos is carcinogenic to humans.  A group of experts meeting under the aegis of the World Health Organisation in June 1987 called for a pre-emptive ban on smokeless tobacco, wherever possible, to prevent a new public health epidemic from a new form of tobacco use.  The use of certain forms of smokeless tobacco has been prohibited in Hong Kong, Israel and New Zealand.  The UK Government have now announced their intention to ban certain smokeless tobacco products under the Consumer Protection Act.  The federal government in Australia have also announced a similar intention.</P>
    <P>In 1985, when it was first proposed to import some of the new smokeless tobacco products into this country, the then Minister for Health made an order prohibiting their importation under the Health Act, 1947.  This order was subsequently challenged in the High Court and in a judgment delivered in September 1987, Mr. Justice Hamilton found the order to be <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister under the Health Act, 1947.  The public health basis for the order was not an issue in the judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill currently before the House is intended to restore the effect and intention of the previous order and to ensure that no other smokeless tobacco products can be promoted in this country. To allow forms of nicotine addiction which are not yet established in the country to be promoted, particularly to our young people, would be irresponsible of me as Minister for Health.  To allow new products and products not widely used, which are known cacinogens, to be marketed would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a more technical and routine nature, providing for the enforcement of the Bill.  Section 9 of the Bill is included to amend the procedures whereby summary proceedings may be brought under the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act, 1978.  The revised section will make it easier to take summary proceedings under that Act.  Sections 10, 12 and 13 are standard provisions and section 11 <Col N="2341" /> simply repeals the relevant sections of the Children Act, 1908, which will be replaced by section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would reiterate that I am bringing this smoking control legislation before the House as major public health legislation.  The smoking controls proposed in the Bill are designed to minimise the risks of passive or involuntary smoking and to provide a healthier smoke-free environment.  They will also help to deter young people from smoking by conveying the idea that non-smoking is the normal majority behaviour.  They will provide support to the majority of smokers who wish to stop smoking and who want smoking to be confined to special smoking areas.  Finally, they will enact a type of smoking control that has wide public support among smokers and non-smokers alike.</P>
    <P>The restrictions on the sale of cigarettes to children are the minimum necessary to counter the increasing prevalence of smoking among school children, particularly young girls.  The prohibition on the manufacture or sale of oral smokeless tobacco products is in line with international developments.  It is a vital initiative if we are to ensure that the damage wrought to the present generation by tobacco products is not visited on the coming generations through new tobacco products.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that tobacco smoking is the largest single cause of ill health and premature death and that this Bill is designed as a major advance in tackling the problem, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcome and support the provisions of this Bill which are very much in line with their commitment to preventive health programmes as being a major focus on future health policy.  However, in the context of combating cancer and of smoking in particular, this Bill is perhaps a token effort because the Government are cutting back on all the major areas which need development in the area of health promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the gall to refer to developments in the health education <Col N="2342" /> promotion area which he still pretends to present to the House as an improvement in the situation although, clearly, in the past year there has been a disimprovement in investment and concentration on health education.  We are also concerned that opportunities in relation to taxation were inadequately availed of in the context of discouraging people from smoking.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill is welcome in that it strengthens the laws against smoking.  It gives a political lead and indicates the seriousness with which we view smoking as a contributory to ill health.  The Minister gave a good deal of detail on the impact smoking has on the health of the nation, in all the nations of western Europe and indeed anywhere where smoking is prevalent.  The Department's document published early in 1987 declared that smoking is a major cause of premature mortality and morbidity.  It estimated that 5,000 deaths per year are attributable to it, a shocking figure, yet despite all our efforts public understanding of how much damage they are doing to themselves on a health basis and how much damage we are doing to our economy in the context of the cost of coping with diseases resulting from smoking is still inadequate.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a statement to the public that we politicians view this matter so seriously that we wish to give a lead in this way and to declare that smoke free public areas are what we should see as the norm for the future.  We do so because of the very real health damages and risks a smoking environment provides.  In that context the Bill is relatively unambiguous; it makes non-smoking the norm and ultimately the aim is to eliminate the smoking habit as far as possible.</P>
    <P>This is one of a line of measures against smoking which commenced in 1979 with restriction on advertising, health warnings on packages, controlling advertising in relation to sponsored events and the prohibition on use of gifts to encourage people to take up smoking.  The Bill is a welcome extra addition particularly <Col N="2343" /> because it deals not just with direct smoking but with passive smoking which is seen lately as a major area of concern where smokers are influencing the health, life expectancy and quality of life of people who do not participate in smoking. The Minister outlined, and I emphasise in the context of the Fine Gael view in relation to smoking, that there is still inadequate appreciation of just how serious a health risk it is.  In the medical field many people who have tried to draw attention to it do not underestimate the enormous task facing them.  One of our prominent cardiologists, Dr. Risteard Mulcahy, in an article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> earlier this year referred at length to the links between smoking and heart disease in the strongest possible terms. He said that to him smoking is the single greatest evil affecting the Irish population, that if you ban smoking you save thousands of lives and you will also free the funds being spent on the awful effects of smoking.  He emphasised that there is a powerful lobby that affects the ordinary man in the street who is slow to accept and to change and needs all the leadership we can give to ensure that people break away from habits that are endangering them.  It is not very sexy to talk about giving up smoking, it is seen as a boring, &ldquo;do goodish&rdquo; type of attitude, but it is very important for those who have responsibility in the health area to put forward the facts and issues constantly and seek to counter the enormous economic lobby from maintaining the smoking habit.  Also it is important to try to bring the tobacco industry &mdash; consider its size &mdash; with us as far as we can, encourage them to diversify and give them incentives to find new areas to turn their energies and surplus investment capital to, if we are serious about seeing in the future a society in which smoking becomes less and less the norm and ultimately disappears.</P>
    <P>Dr. Mulcahy suggested that we have absolute proof that smoking is killing 6,000 to 7,000 people a year and he indicated figures even in excess of that to which the Department had put their <Col N="2344" /> name in the document I have referred to. The task we have as legislators or people trying to direct public opinion and habits is underlined by the fact that the number of deaths caused by Sellafield arouses a great deal more public interest and concern than the absolutely proven, now undeniable fact that 5,000 to 6,000 deaths in this country are related to cancer.  Dr. Mulcahy made this point.  This indicates the extent of the task we have in educating people to act in an area directly under their control which would have a major impact on public health and public health spending.</P>
    <P>In European terms the OECD report on finance and delivering of healthcare services backs up these findings in that it indicates that the four major causes of death are diseases of the circulatory system, cancer, external causes and diseases of the respiratory system.  In all the countries covered by the OECD report cancer is one of the major causes of death and smoking, of course, is very closely related to that.  It is often difficult to measure the impact of health services and so on, but in the area of mortality that is one of the measures by which we can judge the importance of any element or factors influencing the health of our nation and it is an absolute, incontrovertible fact that smoking is a major cause of illness in our society.  Incidence of diseases caused directly by smoking &mdash; cancer of the lung and lung diseases of the respiratory system which the Minister referred to &mdash; is now being intensified by passive smoking which people who are themselves non-smokers are being exposed to as a result of other people smoking in their vicinity.</P>
    <P>The direct effects of mainstream smoking on persons who smoke were emphasised by Dr. Luke Clancy in his study in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> of 10 April 1987 when he said, urging strict implementation of EC rules for the elimination of cigarette smoking, that more than 90 per cent of patients with lung cancer are smokers. In relation to passive smoking which this Bill tackles, again there is a great deal of documentation to indicate that the indirect effects are very substantial. <Col N="2345" /> In an article by Mr. Phillip Whidden published by ANSR, Edinburgh, Scotland in November 1987 he points out that sidestream smoking, as he calls it, has an effect quite different from mainstream smoking and that it is very serious indeed; it is the most dangerous type of indoor air pollution for non-smokers.  Direct smokers also breathe smoke from nearby smokers.</P>
    <P>Tobacco smoking can give non-smokers sore eyes, headaches, itching, sneezing, running of the nose, stuffiness, coughs, upset stomachs, dizziness, sore throats, wheezing and hoarseness.  I have reason to know that it also causes special pain to wearers of contact lenses and can cause particular difficulties for them. Some chemicals produce smoke which is poisonous and more than 50 chemicals cause cancers.  The fact that smoke is carcinogenic is the main reason we seek to discourage or control this practice in public areas.  Tobacco smoke is 90 times more powerful in bringing on lung cancer in non-smoking desk workers than asbestos, which is virtually banned from all working environments.</P>
    <P>One of the most worrying elements is the effect of smoking on children.  All women in our maternity hospitals are warned that smoking can have effects on the unborn child.  Children of smokers are born smaller and have a greater number of handicaps and deformities. These are not scare statistics.  They are the results of scientific surveys.  The fact that this information is available but that people have not adequately changed their behaviour indicates the enormity of the task we face.  The Minister needs all our support in implementing the broad spirit of this Bill, but there are many other measures we should also like to see.</P>
    <P>People with allergies can experience severe problems in the company of smokers. Passive smokers are more likely to die from heart disease than non-smokers who do not spend time in a smoke-filled environment.  The effect of passive smoking is not absolutely established scientifically but evidence that it is a very serious problem is growing steadily and will continue to pile up over the years.  It <Col N="2346" /> stands to reason that passive smoking must have a major impact on health.  In one European country compensation has been awarded to a widow whose husband died of lung cancer having worked for years in an office with smokers.  It was accepted by the court that this had an effect on the contraction of lung cancer and its development.  The Minister is addressing the question of passive smoking and we welcome the provision to control smoking in specified public areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly identified under-age smoking as an important area of concern. I welcome the provisions relating to this problem.  However, it is extremely important if this Bill is to have an impact that there should be a major public information programme aimed at young people.  The Irish Cancer Society have a programme aimed at the nine to 11-year-olds in association with the Health Education Bureau.  I hope the Minister will confirm that this remains a priority and will be expanded.  People need access to full informatioin.  Those of us who are reading these documents daily would need to be witless not to succumb to the evidence presented to us but many people do not have access to this information. We must bring home to people the reality of the effects of smoking.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this Bill will be merely a token gesture in the European campaign against cancer.  It is easy to bring in such legislation at a time of cutbacks since there is no cost to the State but if we are to effect a change in the utilisation of tobacco we must embark on a serious campaign which will reach out to people in the public education area.  It is regrettable that educational programmes in life skills seem to have disappeared from the Minister for Education's agenda.  The Minister for Health could have worked very closely with the Minister for Education to ensure that a good deal of time was given to the question of diet and healthy lifestyles. The Minister might confirm that this programme is being maintained and outline whether he intends to back up this legislation with a programme aimed particularly at youngsters.  Without such a <Col N="2347" /> programme this Bill will have a very limited effect.  I hope the Minister will give a positive response, although information recently gleaned at Question Time regarding the level of personnel and resources in the health education area shows that there has been a drastic reduction in activity.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the question of taxation.  All the European programmes recommend that taxation measures should be used to create an anti-smoking environment.  It was extraordinary that petrol was singled out in the last budget for the greatest imposition of tax while cigarettes got off relatively lightly.  This was in the context of a European consensus regarding the taxation of cigarettes and a national recognition that there is a health aspect to cigarette taxation. It is surprising that the Government did not choose to be clearer in the message they were signalling.  Economic factors have an impact on the level of smoking and this was a missed opportunity. Progressive taxation should be a factor in creating an anti-smoking environment. It is certainly an unusual situation for the Minister that people are offering to find ways of raising money.  I did not get a satisfactory response at the time as to why the Minister chose this balance of taxes and as to why the Department of Health do not see this approach as an important element in discouraging smoking, and I would like the Minister to respond to that on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Another important area is in regard to treatment programmes.  People who have become addicted to cigarettes and nicotine are as addicted as persons on other drugs.  Professor Risteard Mulcahy, in the article I referred to earlier, outlined how an intensive treatment programme is necessary to break people from the habit and said that they suffer quite serious withdrawal symptoms.  I wonder if the Minister has anything to say about this.  I know it is not directly related to the Bill, but it is an important element of dealing effectively with the problem.  The Minister himself outlined that many <Col N="2348" /> people are anxious to break the habit, and even when they are convinced they find it difficult and need help to do so.  So legislation of this kind can only be part of a broad package, and I would be concerned to ensure that all elements are making progress at the same time.</P>
    <P>I would also be interested to see what other areas of the general campaign against cancer the Minister plans to deal with.  I accept that that is probably not appropriate to this Bill, but I hope the Minister will let us know in due course of the other initiatives he proposes to take to participate in the European campaign against cancer which is due to be up and under way by 1989, which is quite close.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill itself, section 3 deals with the question of establishing that it shall be a defence to have taken all reasonable steps.  Could the Minister indicate what sort of steps would be likely to be accepted as reasonable, because obviously if this area is woolly it will affect the impact of the Bill.  I am also a little concerned in that I had hoped that the Minister in opening this debate would have been more forthcoming as to where he was thinking of using the powers conferred on him initially, since this is essentially an enabling Bill.  He did indicate that this was the practice in other countries but that his own thinking was at an early stage.  I hope that by the end of Second Stage he might be in a position to let us know in what way he proposes to use these measures, because I am sure he was not seeking them without some intent to use them.</P>
    <P>On the control of vending machines, they are often in foyers and uncontrolled areas.  Is it the Minister's intention that as a result of this, vending machines would have to be in a supervised area and that if a person under 16 or 18 can be proven to have bought cigarettes from a vending machine the owner will be responsible and could be charged with an offence? Perhaps the Minister would indicate how he sees this working, as a number of Deputies have said that these machines would be unsupervisable in reality.</P>
    <P>Section 4 may be too broad in stating that any person who offers to sell or make <Col N="2349" /> available to a person cigarettes otherwise than in packets of ten or more shall be guilty of an offence.  I agree with the spirit of that.  It is right to close off that loophole; it is entirely wrong that youngsters should have access to single cigarettes which makes it easier for them to develop a habit.  However, the use of the phrase &ldquo;or makes available&rdquo; could be interpreted to mean anybody who offers a cigarette to somebody else or could include the practice at receptions and dinners of putting a packet of two cigarettes by every place.  If this were simply confined to selling, that problem would be dealt with.  It is in the area of selling to youngsters that most of the problems are occurring.  Perhaps the Minister will look at that section.</P>
    <P>In relation to regulations &mdash; and this is a debate we have on nearly every piece of legislation &mdash; I believe that confirmation of any regulation should require active confirmation by the House rather than allowing the regulation to pass unless it is annulled.  Regulations under this Bill would have wide public impact and they should get active confirmation here in the House.</P>
    <P>Having raised those relatively minor matters I would like to welcome the Bill as another weapon in the fight to promote healthier habits and greater understanding of the impact of smoking not just on the smokers but on those around and about.  It is a huge task.  Legislation alone will not do it.  It is exceedingly important that the health promotion area of the Department takes this on in an enthusiastic way and that greater resources are allocated for it next year so that we can participate in a very full way in the European campaign against cancer and comply with as many as possible of the proposals in that campaign so that we can see serious progress in relation to the disease which, by the Minister's own admission, is causing 5,000 to 6,000 deaths in this country every year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to welcome the Bill the Minister has brought <Col N="2350" /> before the House and offer our congratulations to the Minister for taking this initiative.  When one thinks of the generations of smokers who have struggled trying to break the habit knowing full well that it was doing damage to their own personal health, it seems strange that it has taken so long for legislation of this type to be brought before Dáil Éireann.  It is very late in the day as the consensus among scientific experts was arrived at many years ago that smoking very positively affected people's health. The staggering statistics that the Minister has repeated here in the House today and the fact that we continue to condone smoking on such a large scale in our society, are a terrible indictment of our society.</P>
      <P>All of us in public life have a duty to do whatever we can to reduce the amount of smoking in our community, to assist, to comfort and to aid those who have been smoking for a long period.  We have a duty to encourage them to give it up and to find ways in which they can be assisted.  The prevention of smoking as proposed in the Bill will assist to a limited extent but the Bill is lacking on other areas. The Minister has not come forward in his speech or in the Bill with positive proposals as to how he can help those who are already hooked on the habit to break it.  It is essential that measures, such as these, be introduced and that every effort be made to discourage the new habit being formed among the youth of our country.</P>
      <P>In the area of primary prevention, it is necessary to persuade people to take more responsibility for their own health. Health, as we know, is costing the tax-payers vast sums of money.  Massive deductions are made from pay packets, weekly and monthly, to sustain the health services which have been built up in this country.  We have had long debates during the past year or so about the cost of health and the cost effectiveness of the expenditure in the health area.  Much greater emphasis must be placed on each individual's duty and responsibility for their own personal lifestyle, resulting in better health for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2351" /> It is essential that the message be got across effectively about the need for increased physical activity, control of diet, control of weight, avoidance of smoking &mdash; which is the subject we are discussing today &mdash; and, of course, the control of alcohol consumption.  If greater responsibility was taken in these areas by each individual in our society, our health bill and our tax burden, arising from health costs, would be very sub-stantially reduced and we would have a much happier and healthier community.</P>
    <P>The research which has been carried out has shown very conclusively that the single most compelling fact is the absolute havoc being created for the health of this nation by cigarette smoking.  It has taken the medical profession some time to arrive at that broad consensus.  Despite the near unanimity among the majority of medical experts, we still find the vested interests &mdash; the tobacco companies &mdash; spending vast sums of money employing the scientists to try to disprove the proof that has been brought forward by medical science about the damage that has been caused.</P>
    <P>I have before me a document which was circulated to Members of this House &mdash; certainly to the health spokespersons &mdash; by the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee.  All the arguments contained therein seek to disprove or discredit the scientific judgment made about the bad effect that cigarette smoking has on people's health.  As one who smoked very heavily for many years I would not need to open the first page in that type of scientific document to prove to myself that it is damaging to people's health. Anybody who has smoked is well aware of the effect it has on their own personal health.  From my own former lifestyle I am aware of the damage it can do to one's health.</P>
    <P>For too long our health policy has been geared towards spending huge sums of money on curing illness and not nearly enough is spent on prevention and advising people on how to remain healthy, stay away from hospitals and stay away from the need for expensive medical <Col N="2352" /> treatment.  It is only in recent times that the Department of Health have begun to put the thrust in that direction.  When one looks at it logically one wonders why this thinking took so long to emerge among the experts.  It is clear that any investment in positive health is a good investment in the long term because it will reduce the need for an expensive and an elaborate health support system which we have here.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that Ireland has one of the highest levels in the world of heart disease, strokes, cancer &mdash; especially lung cancer &mdash; and of bronchitis.  These four illnesses, I understand, impose the greatest financial burden on our State, yet most of those illnesses are relatively easily prevented.  Smokers get three times as many heart attacks as non-smokers. That is a true statement and a very sad fact, that it has that terrible effect on people's lives.  Yet, because of the social attitude to smoking here we have been very lackadaisical in the steps and measures we have taken to discourage smoking in our society.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Desmond, who took a tough stand on the issue.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, on the steps he is taking now because the vested interests are strong and are fairly active.  I know there are many people employed in the tobacco manufacturing industry who are very concerned about their own employment.  The desire to protect people's jobs should not influence in any way Government measures to improve the health of this nation.  There is an obvious responsibility and duty on the Government to promote a healthy community.  In promoting a non-smoking policy, there is an obligation and a duty to support those who, up to now, have traditionally had employment in that industry.  The Government should actively get involved in assisting in redeployment for those people.  That would be good national policy rather than leave them to the vagaries of the open market place.  I have no doubt that with a postive approach by Government and progressive legislation such as we see <Col N="2353" /> here introduced and expanded, that in 20 years there will be very few people smoking in this country.  It is a worldwide problem in the western world.</P>
    <P>Despite the success and the realisation on the part of so many adults on the need to stop smoking, there is evidence of increased smoking by young children. The age at which they start smoking is getting lower and lower and more and more of them are smoking.  A sad fact is that a large number of schoolgirls are now smoking.  I am pleased the Minister has mentioned that in his contribution. With all the scientific evidence which is available, it is tragic that so many young schoolgirls are taking up the smoking habit.  Obviously, there is need for a very strong and positive policy to be applied and aimed at those young people to inform, advise and to encourage them not to persist with this habit and for those who have not started not to take it up.  It would need to be pitched at a very low age grouping.</P>
    <P>Much of this comes from the example which the young people get from their own parents.  The duty does not rest merely with the Department of Health or the Minister for Health; it lies especially with parents.  The teachers have a role to play but the primary obligation rests with parents to ensure that they do not cultivate in their own children this habit or encourage it in any way.  That example will achieve most success.  Recent scientific evidence of the damage to people's health from passive smoking, of a non-smoker being present in an area where somebody else is smoking, is a matter of very grave concern.  It has led primarily to the Bill before us.  I expect that the House will pass this Bill unanimously, although there may be need for some minor amendments to the sections as proposed. But the Bill will not be of any use without the regulations it enables the Minister to make.  I hope that we shall not see too long a delay between the passing of the Bill and the introduction of the regulations and their rigid enforcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures proposed in the discussion document introduced by our Front Bench spokesman should be taken on board because the Minister and his officials put together proposals and failed on three different occasions.  The Minister announced this week that because of the owners of the processing plants not being prepared to come forward with finance for his proposals he was not prepared to go ahead with his latest scheme.  The Minister informed us that there was no crisis in the industry and no need for real progress to be made in securing a scheme such as the scheme we propose.  If there is no crisis in the industry, why did he propose the scheme in the first place?  Why did a member of <Col N="2355" /> his own party, Deputy Leonard, speaking last night at a meeting of 550 farmers, say that there was a crisis in the beef industry?  He said that something positive needed to be done quickly to rectify the situation.  The Minister must be convinced. He does not believe that there is a crisis in the beef industry.  In that case we shall have a very tough job on our hands over the next number of months in convincing him of the reality.</P>
      <P>He mentioned the reduced numbers of cow slaughterings over the past year.  We must accept that this happened for two reasons.  The first was the effect of the milk super-levy proposals introduced by Brussels and the second was the result of the financial institutions looking for repayment of moneys.  That rot started way back in a Government of which present Minister for Agriculture was a member, but he left that Government and ran to Europe.  When that Government came into office, the inflation rate rose to 21 per cent, with interest rates almost as high.  The Minister has mentioned the importance of the inflation rate being now under control and the climate being right for the further production of beef cows, but did not give any credit to the Government that brought the rate of inflation under control. He said on a number of occasions, from the Opposition side of the House, that the inflation rate was not important, that it did not mean anything.  Now we have Government Ministers, one after the other, saying that the most important way to bring improvements in the economy is to bring down the inflation rate. That is from a Government who spent four and a half years telling us that it did not mean anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the calf subsidy which is now available to dairy producers being transferred.  I do not believe, in the present climate, that there is any need for it.  The administration of that scheme is costing almost as much as the subsidy is worth.  That subsidy should be transferred into the suckler cow area.  Without a shadow of doubt, the off-farm income should not be granted to anybody who is <Col N="2356" /> not in dairying, or produces less than 30,000 gallons of milk.  They should be eligible for the maximum grants of 70 per cent or whatever which can be obtained from Brussels when the application is properly made and the western package brought into being.  This is the main area in which a large number of these animals will be produced, but the scheme needs to be extended.</P>
    <P>It grieves me to inform the House that the Ministers did not appear at any of the meetings over the last ten days held by the farming organisations to highlight the seriousness of the position because the western package forms were not available so farmers could not apply for grants.  Deputy Leonard, single-handed attended a meeting last night of the farmers from the north-east, but Ministers seemingly turn up only as fair weather friends when they have good news to announce.  I am not including the Minister of State present in the House in those remarks but certainly senior Ministers in the Cabinet are not prepared to attend any function or meeting of any organised group unless they have some good news, even though the particular benefit they are announcing might not even have been applied for.  That was quite evident in Cootehill last night.  County Cavan has two senior Ministers, neither or whom turned up to listen to the views of the people.  Shame on both of them.</P>
    <P>A large number of us in this House accept that there is a crisis in this area and that action needs to be taken.  What will be the harm if the Minister takes on board a number, if not all, of the proposals from our spokesman's document? It will be nothing new to all of the Ministers to take on proposals produced by this side of the House because that is what they have been doing for the last 12 or 13 months.  To ensure the introduction of speedy action under a new plan is the way forward in this area.  There are quite substantial grants available.</P>
    <P>I stated last night &mdash; and it is no harm to repeat &mdash; that when we talk about a beef mountain, the European people are telling us that it is only a molehill, that because of action taken over the last <Col N="2357" /> number of years this problem has been very quickly solved.</P>
    <P>The benefit in exports of having 300,000 extra suckling cows in this country will in no uncertain terms have two very important results.  The processing plants that the IDA and the Government have welcomed and grant-aided, with which aid I totally agree, will be able to provide jobs and the money spent will result in animals for processing.  That is most important.  With regard to the off-farm area, the maximum amount of grants from Europe for this scheme must be obtained.  If this is done in the very immediate future, even though the Minister may take a number of the points from our proposals, by 1989 we will have a worth-while scheme, taking into consideration the large number of farmers who have gone out of milk production but are willing and able to take on a new scheme to produce more beef cows and beef.  That is the road we must take.  If the junior Minister for Horticulture can emphasise to a senior Minister that there is a crisis in this area and do nothing else, then we will have done an excellent job. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Leonard.</P>
      <P>This debate is coming at a very opportune time.  Everybody with any interest in the future of agriculture in this country must know that it is essential that cow numbers be kept at a high level in order to maintain supplies for the beef processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will agree that we must have an increase in beef cow numbers and the evidence we have to date shows that farmers are reacting to the signals coming to them from the market and that numbers of beef cows are, in fact, on the increase.  For that reason I would not agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that there is a crisis facing the beef industry but I agree that his document and this debate will serve to bring home more strongly to the country generally and especially to those <Col N="2358" /> with an interest in the beef industry that the rate of increase in beef cow numbers must continue.</P>
    <P>People on Deputy O'Keeffe's side of the House and on the Government side are all agreed about the need for the increase in beef cow numbers.  The difference between us is that Deputy O'Keeffe's paper proposes that the increase be brought about by the payment of more and bigger grants.  First of all, these grants are not possible if the Government are to maintain, and they will maintain, their financial policy which has as its objective putting the economy on an even keel.  Secondly, even if the national financial situation was not a major problem we would have difficulties with the European Commission were we to introduce everything that Deputy O'Keeffe is proposing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if both national money and European permission were readily forthcoming, because of the developments I have just referred to in the market place for cattle we would undoubtedly be paying out large sums of money in respect of increased cow numbers which would come about anyhow through the normal market reactions.</P>
      <P>Farmers have a major concern as regards increasing beef cow numbers. Other interests in the country have or should have the same concern but it is very regrettable that some time ago when the Minister for Agriculture and Food tried to persuade these other interests that they should give firm commitments in regard to expansion in beef numbers, he did not get the kind of reaction he had hoped for.  My colleague, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, expressed his concern at this lack of reaction when he spoke here last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reactions which farmers are showing to cattle prices, it is notable that recent cow slaughterings were down very substantially &mdash; a total of 50,000 in six months &mdash; compared with the previous <Col N="2359" /> year.  Cattle prices are at a very high level and this spring the prices for calves have been remarkable.  Lat year the signs from the market place were already making themselves felt because in 1987 the level of the beef cow herd was at its highest since 1980.</P>
    <P>In order to complement this increasing pressure from the market place for more cows, ACOT have their special suckling campaign for 1988 in full operation.  It is very important to stress the points made by the director of ACOT when their campaign was launched on 1 March.  He said that for the first time ever &mdash; this was brought to the attention of the House last night by the Minister for Agriculture and Food but it is well worth stressing again &mdash; that suckling was now competitive with other cattle systems in the non-disadvantaged areas and would become more competitive over the coming years. The director also said that in the disadvantaged areas where subsidies are higher, suckling is now unquestionably the most profitable system and is capable of leaving a profit of at least £50 per acre greater than other cattle systems.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, ACOT are laying particular stress on the advantage of using continental bulls.  This is of special importance in order to improve beef quality.  In the past year the efforts of ACOT resulted in an increase in the use of continental bulls for the suckler herd. The increase went from 44 per cent to 53 per cent.  The objective of ACOT is to secure that increase to 70 per cent which, if achieved, will indeed be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>I would like now to come to some of the particular proposals made by Deputy O'Keeffe in his document.  These include a £100 subsidy on pregnant heifers &mdash; presumably on the lines of the calved heifer scheme &mdash; and also in the disadvantaged areas the removal of the off-farm income limits, raising the payment limits from 35 to 45 livestock units and from 28 to 42 beef cows, and increasing the forage area limit.  I do not wish to comment in detail on any of these proposals other than the first one mentioned, <Col N="2360" /> lest by doing so I prejudice negotiations that will be undertaken with the EC later this year in relation to these schemes.</P>
    <P>I can reply to the first proposal, however, because a measure somewhat akin to it which was proposed to the EC in the context of the extension of the disadvantaged areas has been disallowed already by the EC Commission.  Their objection was that the measure was geared specifically to intensifying production and, as a direct aid to production it could not be accepted.  It is very clear that they would raise the same objection to the Deputy's proposal for a £100 subsidy on pregnant heifers and would shoot it down for the same reason.  Accordingly, we do not propose to pursue an unrealistic policy option that has no hope of success.</P>
    <P>We have asked the EC, in the light of the decision taken at the February Council meeting, to increase our recoupment rate under the disadvantaged areas schemes from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. When we achieve an increased recoupment rate we will be in a position to exploit many options under those schemes that are now closed to us because of lack of Exchequer resources. We shall be making every effort to secure the highest possible recoupment rate as early as possible.  If we succeed, we can then consider other options along with those put forward by the Deputy, for improvements in the disadvantaged areas schemes.  The EC will not automatically grant us the increased recoupment rate we have asked for.  It will have to be fought and negotiated for in competition with other EC member states who are also seeking increased funding.  It will be a struggle but we will pursue it with all the vigour needed to ensure maximum success.</P>
    <P>On the grant schemes which apply throughout the country including the disadvantaged areas, the Deputy has made three proposals &mdash; that the suckler cow premium should be increased to £60 outside the disadvantaged areas, that the calf premium be confined to beef herds at £15 a head and that dairy farmers with a milk quota of less than 30,000 gallons should <Col N="2361" /> be eligible for both beef cow grants in the disadvantaged areas and the suckler cow premium in all areas.</P>
    <P>In addressing these three suggestions, I would like to make one point, namely, that unlike the Deputy who can make any proposal he fancies in Opposition in the knowledge that he will not be called on to implement it, I have to deal with reality.  Like the Deputy, I would dearly like to increase the suckler cow premium to £60.  I have to recognise, however, that it is already fixed at 45 ECU in this country and fully-financed by the EC whereas in the other member states a premium of only 25 ECU is financed by the EC.  Neither can we ignore the real Community position about the calf premium. To continue that premium at all, beyond 1988, would require a Commission proposal that is not so far forth-coming. It is not realistic for us to seek to pay a suckler premium to dairy farmers while other member states cannot do so. We already have advantages in that our suckler cow premium is higher than anyone else's and in that we are paid both calf premium and special beef premium while other member states only have one or the other.  Reality dictates that we do not push too far too fast for too much lest we endanger what we already have.  We shall certainly seek improvements in the scheme but we must have regard to the basic ground rules.  Within the confines of what is possible and practical, the Deputy's comments will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Research now being undertaken in AFT and elsewhere on herd expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for instance by developing effective and low cost calf twinning techniques is very relevant.  Research of this type by its nature is time-consuming and I understand that twinning techniques will not be ready for widespread use for some years to come.  Although the research cannot be hurried, it can be <Col N="2362" /> encouraged.  We have asked to have it put at the top of the priority list.</P>
      <P>Imports of calves from the UK under strict veterinary conditions have recently been authorised but of course preference is to be given to cattle from our own herd. Calf mortality is however an important obstacle to that process and the Deputy was right to refer to it in his document. There is a considerable opportunity to increase the survival rate of calves through improved management practices. The success of the brucellosis eradication campaign is frequently overlooked and tends nowadays to be taken almost for granted.  The elimination of that disease has had an enormous impact in raising the percentage of calves born into the national herd.  Nevertheless, although we have virtually eliminated losses through brucellosis and abortions, calf deaths shortly after birth are still more numerous than they should be.</P>
      <P>The management improvements promoted by the advisory services and encouraged by the higher prices for calves should further reduce calf mortality especially in the post-natal period up to six months.  A reduction of .5 per cent in post-natal mortality now running at 6 per cent could contribute some 10,000 extra calves to the national herd each year. Governments can provide and this Government have provided the favourable economic environment in which expansion can take place but only the private sector, farmers, processors and financial institutions can provide a response.  They will I am sure be able to see their own medium and long-term gains by reacting positively.  In doing so they will also be acting in the national interest.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the various constraints to which the Government are subject but I regard the growth of our beef cattle herd as a highly important objective and we will use all realistic opportunities open to us at national and Community level to encourage such growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this <Col N="2363" /> opportunity of being able to make a contribution on this Private Members' motion.  It is important to realise, as the Minister has said, that the problems in regard to cattle numbers are a direct result of the quota system.  There is no doubt that beef producers were dependent over the years on calves from the national herd.  This may have been a blessing in disguise because many of those calves were not suitable for beef production.  What is significant at present is that beef producers are putting the emphasis on quality and on breeding and in my own constituency this week I watched officers of the Department grading cattle in a meat plant and they could not over-emphasise the importance of breeding.</P>
      <P>It is very satisfying to note that the number of cow slaughterings has been reduced and is continuing to fall.  Along with this people are now trying to ensure that they produce a better quality animal. What is disappointing is that a number of people have failed to take part in the scheme and this is regrettable as it was in their own interest to do so.  Many plant operators have done very nicely over the past couple of years and it is regrettable that they did not make the contributions which they should have made.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his document outlined the measures which are going to be taken to achieve the maximum results in beef production.  In this context I think ACOT are in a favourable position and I wish to compliment them for the emphasis they have put on ensuring that individual members of their staff specialise in certain sectors.  In Monaghan, despite a few having opted for early retirement they still had an adequate number to ensure that people could specialise in sheep production, pig production and in pollution control.  ACOT are playing their part in this area.  The CEO at a County Committee of Agriculture meeting last week outlined the number of meetings which they intend to hold with interested persons on those areas of production and the problem of pollution, which is the most serious problem we face at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> We are discussing this matter at a time when cattle and calf prices are buoyant. They have now hit a level which they have never reached before.  One could now receive between £300 and £400 for a bull calf two or three weeks old and between £50 and £70 less for a heifer calf.  Despite the fact that there is a large amount of beef in intervention we have a terrific trade with British supermarkets and they cannot obtain enough supplies. In this context I cannot over-emphasise the importance of having as many meat plants as possible in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>White elephants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>These white elephants provide jobs.  If that is the only problem which they cause I would like to see more of them.  I notice at present that people can obtain a price of £1.14 per pound for beef and this is a direct result of the scarcity of beef at present.</P>
      <P>There is one point which should be made in regard to farmers who have small milk quotas.  Over the last number of years they have seen a small percentage reduction in their quotas.  As a result of people producing a better quality cow there has been an increase in milk yields. I know of small farmers who have a milk quota of less than 20,000 gallons who have too many cows at present.  It would be of great benefit to these small farmers if they were to be allowed receive cattle headage grants rather than having to dispose of the cattle some of which are of good quality.  They could then use the less heavy milkers in suckling.  This is worth examining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a generous grant is available for suckling.  In the severely handicapped areas this can amount to £148.60 for a cow in calf and £129.60 in the less severely handicapped areas.  This is a good base for which to move.  I have no doubt that in years to come this will prove to be a sufficient incentive for people to develop in this particular field.  There is no doubt that in the immediate future we cannot expect anything but a quota system for milk.  We are limited so far as the sheep market is concerned.  A large <Col N="2365" /> number of our farmers will be dependent more and more on store and beef cattle for a livelihood.  Beef cattle production has many advantages especially in areas where there is fragmentation of land or where farmers take land on lease or on a conacre system.  It is an accepted fact that single or double suckling of calves or the rearing of beef cows was not profitable. The result was that this area declined at a rapid pace.  The tables have now turned and the incentives are there.</P>
    <P>In addition to the incentives in the disadvantaged, severely handicapped and less severely handicapped areas, measures were announced recently, following the February summit, such as the reintroduction of the western package.  It is important that the small farmers and the cattle producers use to the fullest possible extent, housing accommodation for cattle.  In some places over 50 per cent of the stock is out-wintered.  That is a ridiculous situation and one which must erode any profit that could be made from winter feeding.  It should be the ambition of every farmer to house all his animals during the winter months, thereby resting the land and allowing for earlier growth in the spring.  People would get a greater return from feeding their cattle during those months.</P>
    <P>A couple of thousand people have availed of the cessation scheme and that will mean new blood in the production of beef and cattle.  Many of those people have very good quality stock and they will ensure that they make a success of cattle suckling.  Many jobs can be provided in this area.  As is the case in my constituency, it is one of the main sources of labour in a number of respects.  The most recent CBF report indicated the amount of downstream processing.  A substantial number of jobs are being created in the area of value added products.  Beef is being exported on the hoof.  There is a turkey plant about a mile from where I live and a few years ago the birds were packed in plastic bags, boxed and sent off while only a small number of people worked in the plant.  By using turkey meat as a base for processing the employment at that plant has increased to about 300. <Col N="2366" /> It became an attractive proposition for one of the biggest operators in the country who took it over and it is now a very profitable plant.  That is what we should work towards in the downstream processing of meat because there are great opportunities in that area.</P>

      <P>The party in power may discount all the arguments put forward by the Opposition but those arguments provide the incentive for bringing forward one's own policy.  A very positive approach has been taken by the Department of Agriculture in the last 12 months in the sensitive areas and in areas where we saw the danger signals.  One of those areas is beef production.  There is no doubt that the Government have come to grips with this matter.  It was hoped that the banks and the meat plants would have provided the money that is needed in this area but I am confident that the Minister will introduce a scheme which will fill the bill.  As I have said earlier, no credit is due to those people who stand to gain the most and who have gained the most in the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that, with the reintroduction of the western package, the calf to beef system will be considered closely.  It was in existence in the period 1981 to 1987 but it was so restrictive at that time that there was only a £1.68 million take-up out of a total of £58 million.  I hope that when the Minister and the civil servants examine the proposals on the revised scheme which will be put before the Commission, they will lay great emphasis on the calf to beef scheme.  There should be a programme in operation so that producers would be in a position to go to the meat plants, fight for their rights and supply the product on a continual basis. <Col N="2367" /> Until such a system comes into operation the meat plants will be operated on a stop-go basis and the producers will be in a position to buy when the prices are low and move out when they are high.  There is a basis for a sound meat industry which would provide many jobs and give the economy a great boost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of speaking on what I consider to be a most important issue.  This area has been neglected by both the present Government over the past year and by the last Government.  It is unfortunate that we have let our national herd drop to its present number.  One thing this debate has achieved is that it has highlighted the magnitude of the problem the industry is facing.</P>
      <P>I consider that this industry is in crisis not only because of the shortage of the most vital raw material but also at the slaughtering end where we rely heavily for job creation.  If we are serious about this problem, radical steps must be taken. I do not share the optimism expressed by the Ministers last night and tonight when they spoke about the favourable economic climate resulting in a spin-off to the beef industry.  It has to be recognised that cattle numbers are still at a very undesirable level.  It is important that we behave responsibly and do what we can to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are very simple.  Between <Col N="2368" /> 1984 to 1987 our dairy cow numbers have dropped by 115,000, and it is projected that between 1988 and 1992 they will continue to drop by an additional 240,000.  Given the modest increase in the beef cow herd this year, that figure is insignificant.  The beef cow herd is still only half what it was in 1978 and that is very worrying, resulting in fewer calves being available.  In 1978 we were exporting calves and in 1988 we are talking about importing calves.  I am very concerned about that because there is a danger of importing the wrong kind of calf.  We should be concentrating on quality but there is a danger that we would get other countries' leftovers.</P>
    <P>This time last year we had a major announcement about the Goodman group and the Government investment. Now, after one year, I wonder if the Government consider they got good value for their investment.  If that money were available today it should be invested in increasing our national herd.  Our meat factories at present are working at a third of their capacity.  I question the wisdom of putting money into factories we do not really require.  In my opintion, this money should have been invested in our basic raw material.</P>
    <P>Dairy farmers have no choice but to diversify and they are going into beef production.  That is resulting in a shortage of cattle for the traditional beef farmer. He will have to find some other way of keeping his stock numbers up, and I am not sure that problem will be easily overcome.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the incentives and the ACOT campaign are not effective.  We have a long way to go yet. If we are to correct this crisis of supply the Minister has to realise that this problem is on-going and will have to be solved at a cost.  I do not share Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's view that such incentives can be provided at no cost to the Exchequer. It has to be done at a cost.  It has to be realised that if we come up with a formula to encourage farmers to increase our national herd not only will the primary producer benefit but the country as a whole will be far better off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2369" /> I would like to make a few suggestions. The Minister will have to consider higher stock relief.  Even though this has probably been ruled out, I think we will have to reconsider it.  There will have to be new Euro-currency loans for the traditional beef producer.  At EC level the Minister should negotiate increased suckler premiums and higher headage payments having regard to EC funding.  Such EC schemes should accommodate the lowland farmers who have never been facilitated.</P>
    <P>When farmers do not have many options open to them because of the super-levy and the crisis in cereals, there was never a more opportune time than now to encourage farmers to get into breeding quality cattle that would be ideally suited to our beef industry.  If we do not avail of this opportunity, the only thing we can expect is that we will be back here next year discussing the same topic, and in the meantime we will have further closures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  I warn the Minister that unless radical action is taken there will be a crisis in our beef industry.  Where will the beef barons get the cattle to fill the new factories they have been talking about over the past few months?  Unless something radical is done to build up our cattle population, we will soon have the most expensive white elephants in the form of beef factories in Europe and there will be fewer rather than more jobs in the meat factories as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time the IDA have been busy pumping millions of pounds into bricks and mortar, with promises of more to come.  Nobody seems to have taken much notice of the fact that the backbone of our farming industry, the cattle herds, are in serious decline.  There seems to be no shortage of cash when it comes to building meat factories.  We heard our Ministers talking loudly about what those new factories could produce.  It is ironic that nowhere near the same level of funding can be found to increase the raw <Col N="2370" /> material &mdash; that is, our breeding herd &mdash; needed to keep these factories going.</P>
    <P>The latest CSO figures show that we have fewer cattle now than we had before we joined the EC.  This is a sad indictment of the treatment agriculture got from successive Governments since we joined the EC.  There are now 1.53 million cows in our dairy herd, the smallest since 1976. The beef breeding herd is not showing any dramatic signs of an increase and the national beef cow herd of 457,000 cows is not a strong enough base to facilitate the kind of expansion being talked about by our beef barons &mdash; Larry Goodman, Pascal Phelan and Sher Rafique.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, both ACOT and the Department of Agriculture and Food agree that there could be upwards of 300,000 fewer calves coming from the dairy herd for the beef industry by 1990. This is an alarming figure for any Minister for Agriculture and Food to stand over. Because of the present EC constraints on milk production we see this dramatic reduction in calves for beef production. That scenario should be worrying enough to make even the most optimistic beef barons cautious.</P>
    <P>The scheme announced earlier this year by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to try to build up cow numbers, and now abandoned, was a considerably watered down version of the plan originally proposed last July by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy.  The intention was to provide a subsidy of £12 million, to be financed by the meat industry, farmers and the banks, to retain more than 150,000 cows over the next two years. However, the Minister's decision to abandon that scheme will result in a loss of beef exports of approximately £450 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The matter is now so serious that it is time the IDA reviewed their policy of grant-aiding bricks and mortar.  They should see what they can do to bring about a parallel increase in cattle numbers here.  It is ridiculous that the IDA found it possible to give individual meat groups four times more grant-aid than the total national subsidy for expanding our breeding herd at farm level.  Surely <Col N="2371" /> that amounts to disgraceful action by any Minister for Agriculture in western Europe.  In my view it is a classic case of putting the cart before the horse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister of State that there will be no need for him if the Government continue along this road.  They are doing everything possible to kill our beef industry.  I should like to ask the Minister of State, who represents the Minister for Agriculture and Food tonight, what is the point of building new beef plants?  A few months ago when the Minister was holding talks with Larry Goodman we were told he was going to transform the beef industry but with what?  Was it the Minister's view that he would transform that industry with bricks and mortar and nothing more?  In my view we have reached the stage where we will have to import the raw material from England if we are to keep our meat factories going.</P>
      <P>What is the point of building new plants for the processing of beef and capable of catering for a big increase in the national herd if it is declining?  Despite all the huffing and puffing of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and his Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, their scheme to increase beef cow numbers by 130,000 over the next two years is stillborn.  That should not mean that the development of our suckling herd should be written off by our national planners.  We badly need more breeding cows.  The meat factories and the farmers should work together in an effort to extend our breeding herd through once-calved heifers, through tax concessions and the expansion of the suckler cow scheme on part-time farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Joe Walsh that there are many farmers along the western seaboard and in his constituency who would love to be able to avail of the beef cow scheme if they were given an opportunity.  I have no doubt they would play their part in increasing <Col N="2372" /> our beef cow numbers.  However, red tape, bureaucracy and bungling by successive Ministers for Agriculture have hindered any efforts to tackle the problem. Unless the Minister takes immediate action to increase beef cow numbers we will in two years time have the finest and most expensive crop of white elephant meat factories in Europe.</P>

      <P>It is hard to follow Deputy Sheehan's contribution.  I am glad to have an opportunity to support our spokesman on Agriculture and the proposals he has put forward to increase our beef cow numbers.  It is frightening to think that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who for some reason is absent from the Chamber this evening, does not accept that agriculture, and in particular our beef industry, is facing a major crisis. We are all aware of the huge amount of taxpayers' money that has been given in grants towards development of more modern processing plants but although we have great killing and processing capacity here we do not have the necessary raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time involved in agriculture I have never seen prospects looking so bleak.  As Deputy Leonard said, the dairy cow has always been the base for the beef industry but we do not have sufficient numbers any more.  We have calves fetching as much as £400 and beef farmers cannot pay that amount of money for a calf, rear him into beef and hope to make money.  The beef industry is about to collapse but we continue to plough money daily into meat plants.  Do the Government realise what they are doing? Why do they not diversify some of the £30 million they are about to plough into the manufacturing and processing areas into improving the beef cow herd?  The Government should consider paying grants to increase our beef cow numbers. On five occasions last year the Minister for Agriculture and Food went on radio and television to announce what he described as a beef cow scheme. <Col N="2373" /> However that scheme has been aborted. A document circulated to the members of the Committee of Public Accounts last year about this matter amounted to no more than an insult.  We were told in that document that such a scheme would be introduced but what has happened to that in the meantime?</P>
    <P>While I question the amount of money given to the meat barons I must point out that I do not have anything against those people.  It is unfortunate that we do not have such men of enterprise in other areas of industry.  We should not have to plough up to £30 million into the processing of meat while we neglect our breeding herd.  It is regrettable that the Minister does not recognise the major problem that exists in regard to our beef cow numbers.  I have no doubt, as Deputy Gibbons said, that when we raise this matter in 12 months time there will not be any improvement in the position.  The Minister should recognise that he needs to take drastic action immediately to increase those numbers.</P>
    <P>I understand we need between 250,000 and 300,000 additional beef cows.  The only way we can achieve those figures is by encouraging the farming community to increase the number of in-calf heifers and to do that we must increase the amount of the grants available.  The Government have a host of schemes available to them to improve beef cow numbers and many of those schemes are heavily subsidised by Brussels.  The Government could extend the headage grant scheme and may the maximum amount of the headage grant.</P>
    <P>In February 1987 the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Deasy, submitted plans to Brussels to have all of the west of Ireland, which is now classified as disadvantaged, reclassified as severely handicapped but that was not pursued by Fianna Fáil.  I do not know why that was not done because it would be in our interests to reclassify the west and give the farming community an opportunity to avail of increased headage payments.  The Minister should make a decision to pay the maximum headage grant and not the minimum as at present. <Col N="2374" /> If the Government adopted those suggestions they would help to increase our beef cow numbers at very little cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Ministers of State who are in the Chamber to use their influence with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and with the Taoiseach who appears to be running the outfit, to ensure that a scheme is devised to increase beef cow numbers.  We have all heard the advertisements about the efforts to increase the beef cow herd. Those advertisements have been placed by ACOT and AFT, bodies who have had their budgets cut by 44 per cent and are about to be scrapped at a time when the budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food has been cut by only 4 per cent.  This is crazy and I again ask the Minister not to allow the agricultural advisory service to be scrapped, because that is what will happen if this ACOT-AFT Bill comes in.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also ensure that cow numbers are not reduced any further because, not alone will it have a devastating effect on farm incomes, but it will also affect employment in the meat industry.  More jobs need to be created for our young people and agriculture is the motor of the economy.  Unfortunately, the Government have failed ot recognise that.  They seem to be obsessed with cutting back public expenditure, particularly in the capital programme, while, at the same time, ignoring agriculture which has such vital potential for employment where it is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this opportunity to put an immediate package in place which will increase livestock numbers, thereby creating jobs in the meat industry which are so badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Gibbons and my own colleagues for allowing me a few minutes to speak on this most important motion.  There have been many contributions to this debate and I do not intend to go over the same ground.  However, when we talk <Col N="2375" /> about a national issue we really mean it as far as the beef cow scheme is concerned.</P>
      <P>This is not another begging bowl exercise although it might be seen in that light by other sectors of the community.  They will see the farmers, again with the béal bocht, looking for more grants.  We are not talking about grants but about the raw material for an industry which is the most important in the whole agri-sector. The planning process for the future of the beef business is wrong.  I welcome the fact that our processing facilities will be as modern as any of our competitors' throughout the world; anything else would not be good enough.  However, we must be able to produce the raw material to fully utilise the new processing centres and that is where the Government and the Minister have gone wrong.</P>
      <P>I severely castigate the Minister for Agriculture and Food for believing that the meat industry and the banks would help the agricultural community.  Neither group, particularly the meat industry, helped anyone when it was needed.  In the mid-seventies, when there was a surplus, people were down on their knees trying to get cattle into the factories and we then saw the true nature of the beef barons.  It was a very short-sighted policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister started negotiations with the interested groups, he knew in his heart that they would not work.  He had a more devious reason for announcing the scheme four or five times and that has not been mentioned since yesterday evening.  He knew that the Minister for Finance and the Government would not put any money into the scheme so the only way he could keep the agricultural community at bay was to keep announcing a scheme that he knew in his heart would not work, until he got to the Estimates at the end of this year.  If I was a betting man, I would bet that the Minister will try to come up with a programme of some description at the end of this year. However, he has lost two valuable years to try to redress the problem.  As I said, the meat industry will not help.  It is a short-sighted policy but they will not help now when they never did so.  There is a <Col N="2376" /> way, of course, of making them help and I am surprised that the Minister and the Government have not seen fit to take such a course.</P>
    <P>When I talk about taxpayers' money, I am talking about money provided by the Exchequer and Brussels.  From a sum of £140 million, taxpayers either here or in Europe will contribute about £90 million.  It was bad politics and planning by those in agriculture, led by the Minister, not to ensure that a part of that money went towards providing the raw material.</P>
    <P>There is no point in expecting the Irish taxpayer &mdash; I say this as a farmer &mdash; to go on funding this, and that is why great attention should be paid to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's proposals.  For obvious reasons, neither the Minister nor the two Ministers of State will accept his arguments. They should carefully examine those proposals, which are very simple. His scheme is not new but the presentation is new and most timely.  An opportunity should be given to the people who have the greatest capacity to produce calves.  I was a member of a Government that made £11 million available for the beef cow grant in the disadvantaged areas a few years ago.  There was an increase but it was not enough. The central point in the Fine Gael document is that you open up an opportunity to the people with huge farms not just to send milk to the creamery, which they would obviously have to do anyway, but to be eligible for a beef cow grant to ensure that the cows are not lost to the industry.  One does not have to be an economist to see the sense in that.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe will go into this matter in greater detail.  Perhaps it will be done through tax relief but, most important of all, there should be a linkage with Europe.  A deal can be hammered out.  I am not impressed by the facade of the Minister announcing every second day at a public meeting down the country that this new beef cow scheme will come into being.  It was even heralded in the agricultural press.  While that was going on, the fundamental work that should be done between here and Brussels was <Col N="2377" /> neglected.  We have lost the best part of two years and the occasion now presents itself to do a particularly good job on the fundamental aspect of the agricultural community as far as the beef sector is concerned.  Every farmer in Ireland should be involved in the production of beef calves so that we will have plenty of raw materials to give everybody a job over the next couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing we are all agreed on in this debate is that increased cattle numbers are desirable.  We have the basic resources and the capacity to maintain a herd far in excess of present numbers. We could double our beef herd with our grass, climate and natural advantages for producing cattle which are not available to other countries.  We have a marketing and processing sector which has made huge strides in recent years.  Deputy Connaughton referred back to the seventies when we had a surplus of cattle and people returned from the mart with more cattle than they had going to the mart or were left waiting outside factories because the factories did not want to facilitate them.  Certainly there is a tremendous improvement in processing and in marketing our cattle which is very much to be welcomed, and this debate is to be welcomed because it is timely and will focus attention on the importance of increasing the supply of raw material, quality beef cattle.  It has been amply demonstrated that for those producers who operate efficiently and in well structured units cattle production can be and is a very profitable enterprise; it has been more profitable in the past 12 months than for many decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle production offers one of the few opportunities for expansion in the present European environment and, given the consequences of the super-levy system, the longer term prospects for beef are very promising indeed.  I do not agree that we have lost two years.  The beef cow herd has been declining for the past 15 years.  We have to get a market return to the farm which will encourage <Col N="2378" /> expansion, and now we have that market return in place.  Farmers are getting a price for their cattle, whether calves, store or fat cattle, now and for the past 12 months that they did not get for the previous decade.</P>
    <P>A major objective of the Government is to encourage expansion of the national cattle breeding herd and every effort will continue to be made by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and the Government to achieve this goal.  However, to be realistic, the industry itself, the beef and cattle industry, have a responsibility in the matter.  Farmers, processors and bankers all have an interest in increasing beef production and have an important role to play in creating expansion in the production of beef cattle.</P>
    <P>People are very glib when they come in here and say that money, either Exchequer or European, should be thrown at this problem.  The era of throwing money at a problem is gone and the major plank of recent Government action has been to create an economic climate which will facilitate expansion in all branches of economic activity.</P>
    <P>The first results of this programme to improve the economic climate can already be seen in the form of reduced interest rates and minimal inflation, factors so vital to expansion in cattle rearing systems.  Combined with the much improved cattle market prices in recent times, this is giving a major boost to the industry.  Morale is high in the industry and there are indications that farmers have expansion of numbers in mind and are putting in place schemes to expand the beef herd because money and a margin are in it.  Cow slaughterings are down by nearly a quarter this year and farmers are retaining extra cows in significant numbers.  Moaning or whining or preaching doom and gloom at this point will do nothing for the industry.  Genetically we can only go at so fast a pace and we are encouraging research and development.  In the past few months, the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, announced a new twinning system which has tremendous possibilities for the future, though may be not in the short <Col N="2379" /> term.  I think it will make as dramatic a development in cattle breeding systems as AI when it was introduced a number of decades ago.</P>
    <P>People are probably over-reacting to special extra measures that the State can undertake.  We must be realistic.  We have a serious deficit in the public finances and cattle production is already in receipt of considerable support in one form or another.  In an EC context any attempt to provide specific national aid to encourage growth in cattle numbers would certainly be frowned upon, and we should be the last to attempt anything which might be interpreted as a move towards re-nationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  A number of speakers, Deputy Gibbons in particular, put forward a number of schemes which have already been submitted to the EC and are clearly outside the scope of Directives of the Community, would not be allowed and would be seen as national aids.  Again we have to be realistic in all these matters.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised for some time that we need a modern, vibrant processing sector.  There is no point in Deputy Sheehan or anybody else talking about putting money into bricks and mortar.  Any money that has gone into the processing sector has gone into improving the technology and the products that can be manufactured, and those products are returning a price to the farmer which is better now than it has been for years.  That is the Government's policy and I think we are winning on it.</P>
    <P>Again I welcome this debate.  I reiterate that the Government and the Minister in particular are doing everything possible to encourage expansion of supply of this very valuable raw material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined yesterday the full extent of the crisis facing the beef industry and the details of my 20-point plan to resolve that crisis.  I thank those who have contributed to the debate on my motion.  However, I am utterly appalled at the cavalier response of the Minister for Agriculture to my motion <Col N="2380" /> calling for the implementation of a comprehensive programme to cope with the crisis in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>The basic problem is that the Minister says there is no crisis, actual or impending. In this situation it is small wonder that the Minister has not been successful in taking any measures at national level to increase beef cow numbers and thereby, the raw materials supply for our meat factories.  Furthermore, it explains his lack of success at making any progress at EC level by way of recognition of the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister says there is no crisis and quotes selectively from statistics by way of support for this contention.  In particular he mentioned last evening that cow slaughterings are down by 22 per cent or by 17,000 since 1 January this year, as if this proves his point.  In fact, cow slaughterings in the first quarter of 1988 are down by about 15,000 or 20 per cent but the Minister ommitted to mention that steer slaughterings are down by 55,000 in the same period or 28 per cent, and total slaughterings fell by 74,000, or 23 per cent, in the first quarter. Do these figures suggest anything other than a scarcity of supply?  Taking the year as a whole and seasonal factors, if these figures are projected throughout the full year we could have a drop of 400,000 in total slaughterings in 1988.  At current prices this would involve a reduction in output of £270 million.  This is the possible magnitude of the problem, and I challenge the Minister to review his position and at the very minimum &mdash; even if my worst fears are not realised and I hope they are not but they are heading that way &mdash; to accept that we have a crisis of major proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly there is a major and fundamental inconsistency between the importance attached by the present Government to developmental measures for the beef processing sector and the virtually total lack of support for the necessary measures to ensure adequate supply of raw materials.  The result of this approach will be an inbuilt overcapacity in processing and a total inadequacy of raw materials supply.  This is the central <Col N="2381" /> thrust of my argument and the basis on which I formulated my proposals providing for a comprehensive programme to achieve the necessary increase in beef cow numbers.</P>
    <P>My basic contention is that there is need for an innovative, radical comprehensive programme, to achieve a dramatic increase in beef cow numbers of the order of 300,000.  The Minister seems quite satisfied that the measures now being taken are sufficient.  Of course, there will be some expansion in the beef cow herd in the next couple of years in response to the high profitability of suckling systems.  However, all the indications are that under present policies the expansion will not be fast enough to keep pace with the drop in dairy cow numbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite selective in his use of statistics.  He referred to the increase in the beef cow herd in 1987 but did not give any figures.  There was an increase of at most 15,000 but there was no reference to the fact that at the same time there was a drop in the number of dairy cows of the order of 55,000.  Simple subtraction gives a figure for the net drop in the national herd last year of 40,000. Unless these figures are accepted and responded to, the crisis of which I speak will deepen and develop in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be suggesting that for 1988 there will be no problem because there will again be some increase in beef cow numbers.  One interpretation of his remarks yesterday evening is that this increase will be of the order of 40,000 to 50,000 but I believe the Minister is over-optimistic in his assessment.  The figure is more likely to be 25,000 or 30,000.  My policy document contains the figure of 25,000 which I would expect to be confirmed in the next livestock census. The Minister has not addressed the fundamental question of the anticipated drop of a further 200,000 dairy cows over the next four years and its consequent effects on calf supplies to the beef herd. I do not intend to go into the argument about the 100,000 which were lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister, although he has been in office for 13 months, is trying to push <Col N="2382" /> responsibility back to the previous Administration. I am not interested in that exercise.  I am interested in assessing the present situation and producing an adequate response.  Those who are involved in the beef industry and all with an interest in ensuring the continuation of its major contribution to the economy must be in utter despair at the attitude of the Minister.  He does not even recognise that there is a problem.  Obviously there is no hope of a solution from the present Minister and Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the difficulty of obtaining EC approval for some of the proposals in my 20-point plan.  We in Government faced similar difficulties in securing a favourable deal for Ireland under the milk quota regulations. Yet, because we were convinced of the importance of milk production to the economy we were able to launch an initiative at diplomatic and political level which resulted in a favourable conclusion to those negotiations.  If the Minister would take on board the seriousness of the situation and approach the EC on a similar basis there is every reason to expect that he should be able to obtain a similar result but obviously there is no hope of such a result unless the Minister is convinced of the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Very clearly the contribution of beef to agricultural production and to the overall economy is very substantial.  It is of much greater importance to us than to other countries in the Community.  The same kind of argument we made about the milk quota can be applied in this case.  Beef represents 38 per cent of our agricultural production, whereas the EC average is only 13.6 per cent.  No other member state is anywhere near us in this regard. Some comparative figures include Denmark at 9 per cent and France at 15 per cent.  The Minister has a case and plenty of ammunition to convince others if he is convinced himself.  Agricultural output in Ireland represents a far bigger proportion of total output than in other EC member states.  The share of agriculture in Irish GDP is over 10 per cent, while the EC average is only 3.4 per cent.  As against the EC average, agriculture is of three <Col N="2383" /> times greater importance in Ireland.  We are, therefore, in a unique position to present a case to Europe to enable us to implement policies along the lines I have proposed in my comprehensive action plan.  The first major hurdle is to convince the Minister of the extent of the crisis and of the need for urgent and radical action.  The continuing drop in overall numbers in the national herd is the major agricultural priority.  A Minister for Agriculture who does not even recognise this priority does not deserve the confidence of the Irish people and should be giving serious consideration to an application to the Taoiseach for redundancy or redeployment.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats put down an amendment which on the face of it had some merit but because it refers to only three of the proposals in my 20-point plan it lacks a basis for the comprehensive approach which is necessary to cope with the enormity of the crisis and is, therefore, too limited in its approach to be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister detected what he thought was one inaccuracy in my lengthy policy document.  I have to take issue with him for nit-picking.  The Minister knows that I was referring to a certain combination of grants available in the disadvantaged areas, not taking into account grants that might subsequently be available if the calves were kept.  If that is the only inaccuracy the Minister has to focus on in my document I am happy enough.</P>
    <P>There were a number of references to the cost to the taxpayer and I was particularly careful not to follow the old approach when drawing up this policy document of throwing money at the problem at the taxpayers' expense.  I am cognisant of the problem of the public finances and for that reason I introduced proposals which involved actually drawing back certain premiums such as the calf premium for dairy calves and using that money for other purposes.  I was also taking advantage of the opening available to us to get much more substantial recoupment from the Community for the same Exchequer funding.  On that basis I have claimed that there is no additional <Col N="2384" /> cost to the Exchequer in my proposals. A detailed and serious examination of those proposals will show that if we can achieve the kind of numbers I am talking about and additional exports of £200 million a year there would be a benefit to the Exchequer of approximately £50 million per annum.  There are papers available which will show that exports in the agricultural and food sector give a direct return to the Exchequer of 25 per cent approximately.  The figures are based on the situation in 1982 but because of the higher tax rates since 1982 the figure of 25 per cent should probably be higher.</P>
    <P>The main defence of the Minister was the work of ACOT.  He had to scramble around in his attempts to defend the indefensible. It adds insult to the injury being inflicted on that unfortunate body, ACOT, to produce them here by way of defence to this motion.  We already know that people are being hunted out of ACOT and the latest proposal is to redeploy the people whom the Minister claims are to solve these problems by offering them opportunities in the tax office and elsewhere.  The flimsy fig-leaf displayed by the Minister in his defence simply will not work.  While I compliment ACOT on the work they are doing, it is altogether unfair to that very reputable body to wheel them in here to provide a flimsy fig-leaf for the Minister in his difficulties.  It must be accepted by everybody that there is a fundamental and serious problem, in effect, a crisis.  The Minister saying here last night that there is no crisis reminds me of his respected colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan talking about there being no problem.  That is not the way to approach such a serious issue.  The Dáil should recognise fully the crisis facing the beef industry, note the Fine Gael proposals for a resolution of the problem and debate them.  I am glad the Minister took an interest in them and was the first to ask for a copy.  I hope they will be looked at seriously.  I want the Dáil to confirm that this House seeks the introduction and implementation of a comprehensive programme now to achieve the necessary increase in beef cow numbers.  This is the only reasonable <Col N="2385" /> response to the crisis in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it because it follows in the tradition of the thrust of previous Ministers for Health in recognising the serious problem of smoking and the threat that it poses to the health of the people of this country and proposes in a very positive and concrete way to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this very positive act has to be put in the context of the times we live in and I find that I must make reference to the axing of the Health Education Bureau who have done so much in the campaign to educate people to the dangers of smoking.  It is a cause of deep regret that that campaign must be adversely affected by the axing of the bureau who have piloted so many imaginative and successful campaigns to highlight the dangers of smoking in very many clever ways and to alert particularly the <Col N="2386" /> young before they caught the smoking bug.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the clear and indisputable evidence that now exists that cigarette smoking causes a tremendous amount of disease in this country and indeed is the single greatest cause of premature death particularly in the area of heart and lung illnesses.  It is incumbent on us legislatures to lead in this regard and not wait for public clamour.  We in this House have often been accused of responding to the public rather than leading the public.  The body of evidence in relation to smoking is now so overwhelming that I believe we would be criminally negligent if we did not act in the way proposed in this legislation.  One of the Minister's predecessors, my colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, had a very courageous line in relation to the tobacco industry and his initiatives caused the banning of the advertising of cigarettes around every corner store and shop in our country.  These advertisements obviously make a very homely and folksy impact on people who were shopping for groceries, sweets, milk, bread or whatever they were looking for. They were attacked by the notion that smoking is a positive thing, that it is an acceptable occupation and that it should be encouraged.  The Minister's predecessor outlawed that particular activity.</P>
    <P>The next step is to take the measures that are included in this legislation.  Many of those hoardings and advertisements, some of which still exist in magazines, convey an image of smoking as an outdoor, rugged activity, and somehow almost a healthy activity itself.  One sees the outdoor type on horseback smoking. It is very important for us to recognise the irony that in fact so many people have been deprived of the enjoyment of the great outdoors by destroying their lungs through smoking.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this was enabling legislation.  Section 2 lists all the possible prohibitions and restrictions with regard to the consumption of tobacco that will be available to him by statutory order following the passing of this legislation. <Col N="2387" /> The list is quite comprehensive.  I hope the Minister, in replying to this debate, will outline and signal to us clearly what his intentions are in this regard and where specifically he intends to make restrictions and to what extent because obviously we are all subject to the clamour of the convinced smoker who will want some space.  Our process of eliminating smoking must be a gradual one and must not cause undue fear among smokers that their liberties will be immediately trampled upon.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the practices in other countries and the sort of restrictions that exist.  I would certainly welcome the Minister's thinking in this regard as to where he wishes to impose restrictions.  We have reached the stage now where people are entitled to go to a public place, to a cinema or elsewhere or to enjoy a meal in a restaurant and not face the hazard of smoking.  If people make for themselves the choice that they will not smoke, that they will protect their own wellbeing by not smoking, they should not be assaulted in a public place by smoke.  Before this legislation is enacted it is important that the Minister's intentions in this regard are known.</P>
    <P>Some of the sections in a Bill published last year in my own name, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, and which were reflected in the earlier Tobacco (Health Protection) Bill, 1986 &mdash; published in the Seanad in the names of Senators Dooge and Ferris &mdash; are reechoed in the legislation before the House tonight.</P>
    <P>This is very important legislation.  In accordance with all current medical opinion I believe that this legislation will enjoy not only very broad support in this House but, more importantly, very broad support throughout the country.  You can pass any legislation you wish, particularly in an area such as this, but if you do not have the enthusiasm of the people this type of legislation becomes inoperable. In tandem with the legislative framework we must have support and that can only happen if we re-enforce, through whatever channels are open to us, the damage <Col N="2388" /> that smoking causes to people.  It is a cause of regret that the Health Education Bureau is no longer available to do that and that another organisation &mdash; which is less effective &mdash; within the Department of Health will be charged with that task.</P>
    <P>The concept of passive smoking whereby during the past 20 or 30 years people who did not smoke were subject to the assault of smoking is no longer acceptable.  People who tolerated that activity in the past are no longer content to accept a situation where they must, in a public place, in a restaurant or on public transport, endure smoke which they know and are convinced is damaging themselves.  That is no longer acceptable to the vast majority of non-smokers and that is recognised in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the measures to protect children from the effects of smoking.  I mentioned previously the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, published by the Labour Party last year in my name.  I welcome sections 3 and 4 of the current Bill that reflect the same thoughts as were reflected in the previous legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to vending machines it is important that they be supervised.  In many places a machine is put on the wall and no regard is had to the fact that cigarettes are available to anybody who can put in the correct coins; the machine simply doles out the cigarettes to them. It is important that a responsibility is placed on owners to be mindful of the dangers that those machines can place in the way of children.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to restrict access to cigarettes so far as children are concerned and that is welcome.  The notion that you can sell individual cigarettes to children is something I have always rejected.  Unfortunately, it is a practice that has gone on in many corner shops in the vicinity of schools, where children, at break time, are able to run across the road and buy a cigarette for whatever number of pence was charged, so children were introduced at a very early and sensitive age to smoking.  One measure, one step, in eliminating that practice is in requiring that at a minimum only packets <Col N="2389" /> of ten could be sold over the counter. Having read this section I am inclined to share the fears expressed by the Fine Gael spokesperson that the words are allembracing, that a person who sells, offers to sell or makes available cigarettes to a person, otherwise than in packets of ten, is liable to a penalty.  Other people would be fearful that simply offering a cigarette &mdash; as is common practice, perhaps it is something we should outlaw &mdash; would not be an offence.  Perhaps we could tighten up that section with a clearer form of words.</P>
    <P>The tobacco industry is a very important lobby.  My colleague, Deputy Desmond, experienced something of the strength of the tobacco industry in recent years.  We must acknowledge the role of the tobacco industry in seeking to diversify away from the manufacture and distribution of cigarettes into other areas of activity.  It is important that we recognise the very significant employment that is given in the tobacco industry.  Obviously, we must put the health of the people of this country in a paramount position. Nobody in this House would dispute that. In our efforts to arrive at a situation where we have no smoking we must assist the tobacco industry in diversification and in finding alternative forms of livelihood for the many people who are engaged in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products and to allow them to ease themselves into other less socially destructive forms of activity.  That has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister in his response will indicate the approach he intends to adopt because if we are to solve the problem of cigarette addiction, and the damage caused by cigarette smoking, it can only be done in tandem with the tobacco industry and not by setting the Department of Health, or this House, or the health caring agencies on an adversarial course with the tobacco industry or those who work for any of the manufacturers of cigarettes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>On another section which I propose to address, representations have been received by many of us in relation to <Col N="2390" /> section 6 of the Bill.  Section 6 is a comprehensive section which I assume addresses in the main the problem of Skoal Bandits.  Deputy Desmond, as Minister for Health, attempted to use the Health Act, 1947, to outlaw Skoal Bandits and subsequently that was found by the High Court to be <i>ultra vires.</i> The damage caused by this product &mdash; Skoal Bandits &mdash; is something that must be put on the record of the House.  The welcome from the medical profession not only in this country, but abroad as well, to that attempt should be noted.  I know that in the <i>British Dental Journal</i> issue of 7 June 1986 they applauded the efforts of the Irish Government and I quote:</P>
    <P>Happily, the Irish Government has adopted a more enlightened attitude: in December 1985, it banned the Skoal Bandit from sale or distribution.  Said the Health Minister: `It is a particular habit that we are determined should not take on in Irish society.'</P>
    <P>Later in the same leader article it is stated:</P>
    <P>Thus a high health-education profile, as well as constant pressure on opinion makers and parliamentarians, must be maintained by each one of us until the Irish lead is followed and a total `Bandit' ban achieved.</P>
    <P>This was the exhortation to British parliamentarians to follow the example of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, in seeking to outlaw the Skoal Bandits from sale in this country.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Sunday World</i> of 12 January 1986, Professor Risteard Mulcahy, who was in charge of the coronary unit in St. Vincent's Hospital, attacked the measure as not going far enough.  He said:</P>
    <P>While I approve of what Mr. Desmond is doing, I am surprised he is not going the whole hog and banning all cigarette advertising and sponsorship.</P>
    <P>He went on to outline the damage that cigarette smoking and surrogate use of alternatives to cigarette smoking do to the health and well-being of our people. <Col N="2391" /> All that is accepted and I can quote from various medical journals on the damage to health.  For instance, the <i>Lancet</i> outlines in great detail the damage done by oral snuff which they describe as a preventable carcinogenic hazard and all the damage done by the growing number of tobacco substitutes which are coming on sale here.  For that reason, I welcome section 6 but, at the same time, I ask the Minister to alleviate the fears of some who engage in a rare enough habit, that of tobacco chewing. It is not a very prevelent habit and is engaged in, for the most part, by senior members of society.  It would be difficult for us to convince these at this stage that the activity which they have carried on all their adult lives should suddenly be banned.  I hope the Minister will allay their fears.  I understand that most of the tobacco chewed is not actually chewing tobacco but rather pipe tobacco which would not be affected by this section.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the role of education, which is extremely important in this whole issue.  If we are going to prevent damage being done by cigarette smoking, the most important way is to educate people on the dangers.  This is particularly true about educating the young.  We must inform and condition them because there is so much money spent on conditioning them to smoke. With young people image is so important. Smoking has been linked in films, advertisements and magazine articles with adulthood.  To smoke is to be mature, to be an adult.  We have a very sophisticated young people now.  The need for an education campaign is there, but it must be a clever and imaginative one and well funded.  These measures are very welcome but in tandem with them must be a clever, well thought out, well funded educational programme that will reach young people, not patronise them but advise them in a very clear and cogent way of the dangers to their health.  Young people now have the image of the outdoors, of activities and a very effective campaign could be devised if sufficient <Col N="2392" /> resources were made available.  This would be a very cost efficient method.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated to the House the damage done, not only healthwise which obviously is the most important, but the economic damage done to our country by cigarette smoking.  It is a horrific fact that there are 16,000 deaths each year from smoking-related illnesses in this country and that 5,000 of these deaths, according to the Minister, are directly related to smoking.  From an economic perspective, it would be very interesting to do an exact analysis of the cost of cigarette smoking.  It would be a difficult figure to arrive at, but a very interesting and, I suspect, very alarming one.  The Minister indicates that the hospital costs alone due to cigarette smoking exceed £50 million a year.  If one adds the cost of the GMS, of disability benefits and, more particularly &mdash; a very difficult concept to define &mdash; the man hours lost to industry through cigarette smoking a very significant figure would result.  That would underline very clearly that any education programme that costs money would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party unreservedly welcome this measure.  I hope the specific points I raised in relation to ambiguities in the Bill will be clarified.  The Minister will have enthusiastic support from the Labour Party in putting into place this legislation which will have a significant impact on improving the quality of life of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I have been a non-smoker all my life &mdash; the first time I took a cigarette was when I was five years old and that was the end of it.  I have not smoked one ever since.  The major impact of this Bill is towards non-smokers, with regard to passive smoking.  I go along with everything that every Deputy has said here in relation to the Bill.  I appreciate that the figures speak for themselves.  There have been so many deaths and cancer-related illnesses and smoking-related illnesses here and we should know by now that <Col N="2393" /> smoking, quite apart from being anti-social, has a major effect on the health of this nation.  We should all advocate as much as possible that smoking should cease.  Somewhere in the region of twothirds of our population are now not smoking, which is an indication.  Many years ago nearly all the adult population were smoking.  Perhaps this has to do with the fact that cigarettes are so dear now but, by and large, people accept that smoking does damage health.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the previous administrations down the years for bringing in various measures exhorting people not to smoke &mdash; the warning on cigarette packages and the ban on advertising. These have had a major effect on the increase in people not smoking and should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I have a number of reservations in relation to the Bill which I should like to put on the record of this House.  During the abortion referendum campaign we had much talk about the right to chose. Adults should have the right to chose whether to smoke or not in any area, but people who are non-smokers surely also have a right to a smoke-free atmosphere if they do so wish.  Many of us non-smokers who go into cinemas, public houses and other public places are often taken aback and some have to leave such premises because of the smoke-laden air.  This is the case in public houses.  There must be a balance between the two sides, the right of an adult to choose whether to smoke and that of a non-smoker to enjoy a smoke-free atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, I am not so sure that legislation is the area where we should be putting an onus on people not to smoke.  To a certain extent, legislation of this type may intrude far into people's lives and, in effect, make criminals of ordinary people.  This is a query that I have in relation to this Bill.  We often hear that a number of Bills have been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas but that the resources to police the regulations laid down in these Bills have not been made available.  I just wonder will there be an opportunity to properly police this whole aspect?  I am interested <Col N="2394" /> in what the Minister had to say, that with little or no enforcement an environment has been created over-night on the DART and the Dublin buses in relation to non-smoking and he went on to say that, more importantly, this has been accepted by the smoker.  This is why I mention these reservations.  I am not so sure that legislation is the right way to exhort people not to smoke in public places.  However, I bow to the Minister's better knowledge.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is a medical doctor and has the full back-up and all the knowledge and the facts and figures put before him by his Department.  I noticed recently in England that a report came out, called the Fogget Report.  This report was not mentioned here this evening, but it proved beyond all doubt that passive smoking was a danger to people who are non-smokers.  I noticed on a television programme that when Edwina Currie who is the Minister responsible in this area in England was pressed as to whether her government would take action in relation to this report she said &ldquo;no&rdquo; because they felt that legislation was not the correct way to do this and that exhorting people not to smoke was a better way.</P>
    <P>I come from Dundalk where one of our major industries is tobacco-oriented. This industry is one of the few remaining industries in Dundalk, a town which was the pride of the Twenty-six Counties where we had so many people employed over the last decade.  Unfortunately that is no longer the case.  This legislation may be counterproductive in that jobs may be lost as a result.  The firm in Dundalk are well aware of the problems in the tobacco industry and they realise that more and more people will not smoke in the future. They have diversified and they know that ultimately the tobacco industry will not be as lucrative as it was heretofore.  Quite recently 140 people were asked to take redundancy from this firm.  I just wonder will this legislation lead to more people having to leave this industry?  That would have a devastating effect on Dundalk.  I have had discussions with the firm and they understand that the anti-social <Col N="2395" /> aspect of smoking will lead ultimately to the majority of the population not smoking.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that we would make criminals of ordinary people. This is something we should carefully consider.  How will this affect someone aged 60 who has smoked in public houses all his life when he is told he is breaking the law and when he has to come before a district justice to be prosecuted for breaking the law?  The Minister said earlier that there should be a ban on smoking in maternity wards.  I broadly agree with that but some ladies in maternity wards probably need a cigarette.  I do not understand why but that is the point they make.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to section 4 and to the fact that the phraseology here is very loose.  I agree with him.  If I as a smoker offer a cigarette to someone else it might come under that section.  The Minister should have another look at that section to see if he can tighten it up.  I can see what the Minister is getting at in suggesting that the sale of cigarettes in lots under ten should be banned but the section says &ldquo;or make available cigarettes in packets other than ten&rdquo;.  That should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>There are a number of good points in the Bill such as the ban on the sale of cigarettes to those under 16.  In the Intoxicating Liquor Bill earlier on we discussed banning the sale of alcohol to young people.  I accept that there is a problem with under-age smoking.  At one stage young people thought they were great if they smoked but now there is a realisation, even among young people, that it damages their health.  The provision in relation to cigarette machines is something that will be very difficult to police.  I appreciate that other countries have introduced legislation in this regard and that some countries have banned cigarette machines.  In a crowded public house a publican would be hard pressed to police the operation of cigarette machines.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points which I will make on the Bill on Committee Stage but by and large I welcome <Col N="2396" /> the idea of the Bill.  I have a number of reservations, one being that I am not sure that legislation is the best way to exhort people not to smoke.  I am also worried that it will have quite an effect on my own home town in that it may mean some loss of jobs in later years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I come from Dundalk, the home of P.J. Carroll, the pioneers of the cigarette industry in this country, an industry and a company which has given tremendous employment to generations of Dundalk families, the charge can be levelled at me that my views on the cigarette industry are suspect, but they are not.  I recognise the potential dangers to young people who start to smoke and for that reason I accept the principle of this Bill.  My dilemma relates to the right to choose and irrespective of where P.J. Carroll were located I would still hold to the belief that the right to choose is paramount.</P>
      <P>From time to time the media tell us about the various hazards to our health. We are told that over-eating is dangerous and that over-drinking is dangerous.  We are even told that jogging is dangerous, that too much sex is possibly dangerous as well as too little of it and that it can cause heart attacks in middle-aged men. Even crossing the road is a hazard.  In any democratic society the right to choose should be of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>It has been fashionable in recent years to attack the cigarette industry.  There is a lot of hysteria associated with the antismoking lobby.  The cigarette industry has been persecuted in recent years by successive Governments.  It has been charged tax at double the rate of inflation in every budget that has been produced in recent years.  It is a vulnerable industry and the industry is aware of its own vulnerability. The bells are probably now tolling for it and possibly in years to come some Government will ban it and that I would regret as it would be an intrusion on the right to choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister's input into this Bill and I am conscious of the fact that 100 people die per week from <Col N="2397" /> smoking-related illnesses.  That is a statistic which cannot be dismissed lightly but I believe that more people die from the abuse of alcohol which can have many adverse effects on a family.  How many alcoholics leave their wives and families without any money to buy food?  Statistics released last week indicates that there are 175,000 alcoholics in this country and this is very disturbing but because of the level of tolerance towards the drink industry it is pushed aside.  The cigarette industry has been unfairly singled out. Deputy Ahern rightly pointed out the amount of employment which the cigarette industry has provided in Dundalk over the years and while this cannot justify the existence of an industry over which there is a question mark it is also a matter of deep consideration for Deputy Ahern, the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, and myself.</P>
    <P>The cigarette industry has proved itself to be a responsible industry and it is deeply concerned about the hazards which it fully admits exist.  Much research is needed into the cigarette industry and into the problems associated with it and I believe the cigarette companies should work in conjunction with the Department of Health in researching an industry which undoubtedly has a question mark hanging over it.  I think the cigarette companies should diversify into other areas. P.J. Carroll and Company have already diversified into pharmaceuticals and are pioneering the fish industry in the west. They have been wise to do so.  I would encourage them to continue to diversify into other areas because they cannot rely on any Government to maintain the high levels of employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the right of adults to choose should always be upheld in a democracy and I pour scorn on the ban on those under 16 from smoking. That is the equivalent to an Enid Blyton fairytale.  Does anyone really believe that a kid under 16 years of age who wants to smoke will be prevented from doing so? We allow them to have condoms at 16, so why not cigarettes?</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to thank Deputies Howlin, Flaherty, Molloy, Ahern and McGahon for their constructive contributions on the Bill before the House and I would now like to deal with some of the points they raised.  Deputy Flaherty referred to the Government's approach to health education and to taxation on tobacco products.  As regards taxation on tobacco products, it has always been made clear at budget time, particularly during the last budget debate by the Taoiseach, that health considerations form part of the reason why taxation continues to be placed on tobacco products and this no doubt will continue to be the case.</P>

    <P>As regards health education, both Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Howlin referred to the fact that the functions of the Health Education Bureau have been transferred to the Department of Health and they expressed concern that this might prove detrimental for those promoting education on the effects of tobacco products, particularly in schools. I can assure the Deputies that this will not be the case.  I am quite satisfied that the new health promotion unit will be an improvement on the Health Education Bureau.  First of all, the health promotion unit now has a full complement of staff and I am satisfied it contains sufficient staff to carry out its work.  What is also <Col N="2399" /> very important is that the unit is multi-sectoral whereas the remit of the Health Education Bureau was very narrow.</P>
    <P>Apart from the unit itself we also have a committee of Ministers which is chaired by myself and which includes the Ministers for Education, the Environment, Energy, Agriculture and Food and for Labour.  In the context of the Bill we are discussing the importance of having the Minister for Education involved cannot be overstated particularly in terms of educating young people on the dangers of cigarette smoking and I am sure the Deputies who are present in the House would agree with me that ideally health education should be part of the normal curriculum in schools.  Health education should not be the sole responsibility of the Department of Health and it should be part of the functions of the Department of Education to ensure that a health education programme is available to children in schools.  One of the reasons I was anxious to transfer the functions of the Health Education Bureau to my Department, to have a committee of Ministers and to have an advisory council or health promotion, which is chaired by the President of the Royal College of Physicians&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is very important in my view is that health education and promotion and the prevention of illness must be seen in a positive way as part of the Government's function.  For far too long the Department of Health have only provided services for those who are ill. What we have to do now is to change the thrust so that not just the Department of Health but the Government will be seen to be taking a positive approach towards creating a healthy environment for people to live in.  I am satisfied that the health promotion unit will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the new unit is now fully staffed and operational.  We will be launching three major campaigns in the <Col N="2400" /> next few weeks.  Tomorrow I will be launching the European Information Week Against Cancer.  This programme was developed by the new unit in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the EC. In mid-May the unit will be launching a major drug abuse campaign and towards the end of May they will be launching a food hygiene awareness week.  Deputies in this House and the public will see that the unit is performing a very useful function, a more comprehensive role than that carried out by the Health Education Bureau.  The Advisory Council on Health Promotion has been constituted and has met on a number of occasions.  They have agreed a comprehensive work programme aimed at a multi-sectoral approach to health.  As I have said, a Cabinet sub-committee has been set up which I chair.</P>
    <P>One of the priorities of the new unit is education about the adverse effects of tobacco consumption.  I respect the work that was carried out in this area by the Health Education Bureau.  There has been a significant decline, a decline of 11 per cent, in the level of cigarette smoking between 1974 and 1984 and I believe that the Health Education Bureau made a valuable contribution to that decline.  I am concerned about the level of smoking among young females which has been referred to by a number of Deputies. Obviously this is one of the areas that I will be addressing with my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Education, through the new health promotion structure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty was concerned that the provisions of section 3 appear to be too woolly.  We can certainly look at this matter on Committee Stage.  Section 3 appears to me to be quite clear.  It refers to the sale of tobacco products.  Obviously somebody offering a cigarette from a packet would not infringe on the legislation but, as I have said, we can look at the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to vending machines there were three main considerations open to us &mdash; we could do nothing, we could ban the sale of cigarettes from vending machines or we could provide a system <Col N="2401" /> of control.  Having given full consideration to the matter I decided on the system of control which would be backed by a system of enforcement by the environmental health officers of the health boards.  The consequence of the section will be the location of vending machines and the supervision of their use by the owner or the person in charge of the machine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy, Deputy Ahern and Deputy McGahon expressed concern at the effect of this legislation on people working in the tobacco industry and indeed we would all share that concern because none of us likes to see people losing their jobs as a result of any measure we might introduce.  However, it is important to recognise that the tobacco companies have been aware for a long time that there has been and will continue to be a decline in the number of people smoking.  They have gone to great lengths to diversify, as Deputy McGahon pointed out in regard to Carroll Industries in Dundalk, and have diversified the tobacco industry around the world because they know that the sale of tobacco products, particularly in developed countries, is in decline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other hazards I mentioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that it is not only the fact that people are becoming more aware of the hazards of tobacco smoking that is contributing to a decline in the workforce.  The cigarette industry is becoming a very automated industry and obviously that has created a large reduction in the number of people working in the industry.  It is not just public health policy relative to tobacco that is the sole determinant of employment levels in the industry.  I have no doubt that legislation such as this will encourage further diversification of the industry.  It is ten years since the first legislation in this area was introduced by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health.  This legislation is a logical sequence to the 1978 Act.  As I have said, the industry has been fully <Col N="2402" /> aware of the trend for years and has had time to diversify.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Howlin asked about my intention under section 2 of the Bill.  This section gives me the power either to prohibit or restrict smoking in areas to be designated under regulation. In the memorandum to the Bill we pointed out the public places, such as aeroplanes, trains, buses, cinemas and public buildings, where we would be initally considering prohibiting or restricting cigarette smoking.  I compliment CIE and now Dublin Bus on their voluntary introduction of the ban on cigarette smoking on the DART and also on Dublin Bus which is particularly successful.  It was introduced in response to surveys carried out that showed that approximately two-thirds of the people in the State want &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; areas.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the point made by Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Howlin about the making available of tobacco products and their relation to the sale of any other product.  As I have pointed out, it does not apply to situations where, for instance, cigarettes would be offered to a person under 16 years of age in the home.  Deputy Ahern and Deputy McGahon made the point about the right of the individual to choose whether he wishes to smoke.  Again, the evidence is that the majority of people in the State want &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; areas.  One could make the point that they also have the right to choose and to have a smoke-free environment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding about the intent of section 3.  Under the Children Act, 1908, it was an offence merely to have tobacco products in one's possession if aged under 16 years.  Section 3 is designed to limit access of young people to tobacco products and makes it an offence to sell tobacco products to a child under 16 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred to the need for more research.  It is fair to say that <Col N="2403" /> there is no other health issue that has been researched so deeply and on which there has been agreement by the health profession as the relationship between tobacco consumption and disease, such as cancer and heart disease.  Extensive research has been conducted over 30 years on all aspects of smoking on health. This is both conclusive and damning.  The World Health Organisation have declared that in developed countries tobacco smoking is the greatest single cause of ill health.  There is no controversy on this issue.  It is not possible to refute the evidence with any degree of credibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to section 6 which prohibits the importation, manufacture or retailing of oral smokeless tobacco products.  Any person who contravenes the regulation under this section will be guilty of an offence.  The section defines the term &ldquo;oral smokeless tobacco&rdquo; as being a product made wholly or partly of tobacco and which is placed in the mouth unlit and left there for a period of time and sucked or chewed.  The Skoal Bandits, to which Deputy Howlin referred, are included in this section. They are like a teabag with tobacco and are sucked and have been shown to be hazardous to health.  Not alone in this country but recently in the United Kingdom it was decided that they should be banned under their consumer protection legislation.  Section 6 is drafted to take account of all forms of oral smokeless tobacco which are now being promoted internationally as an alternative way of consuming tobacco.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed and made very constructive contributions. I look forward to the Committee Stage when we will examine the legislation in detail and hopefully will produce legislation which will be a credit to the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Durkan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of infrastructure plans for County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I at the outset thank you for allowing me to raise this issue. When I last had the privilege of raising this issue in this fashion we had spectacular success.  While I would not be so presumptuous as to expect a repeat performance, I am hopeful the Minister will give the matter favourable consideration. I thank the Minister for coming into the House tonight to reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>I am not raising this issue for cheap political capital or to castigate the Minister. I am raising it because of an obvious need.  Over the past five or six years I had the privilege to be a member of the Eastern Regional Development Organisation. Within that organisation we have the local authorities of Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Dublin city and county represented among other bodies.  It has become very obvious that, with the reduction in the finances available to local authorities, there was a particular problem which affected counties, areas or communities immediately adjacent to large centres of population.  This evening I will confine myself to my constituency of Kildare, for obvious reasons but what I say will be applicable to Wicklow and Meath, counties with large populations on the doorstep of our capital city which houses a very large population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kildare has been particularly adversely affected by development over the past ten or 12 years.  We have had vast increases in population.  In areas in north and mid Kildare the population has <Col N="2405" /> increased above and beyond any other part of the country.  For that reason greater pressure has been put on services, on roads, on the need for rail transport services, on public buses and so on. Greater pressure has been brought to bear for us to provide much needed amenities to meet the demand of that expanding population.</P>
    <P>There is another problem.  The development within our county took place after the rates had been removed. I am not blaming the Minister for this because this is something to which all political parties contributed in one way or another, but it was a progression which was not beneficial in the long run.  Unfortunately, the development in our county took place after that and we did not have the obvious benefit of the increased revenue from rates coming into our coffers over a period of time as a result of the increased population.  In the capital city and county there was some recompense in that they had some development established and were able to get an income from it.  However, in Kildare we were not so fortunate.</P>
    <P>I will deal quickly with the question of roads.  I raised this issue originally on the basis of the atrocious condition of our roads.  I do not want to make political capital out of this issue.  It is a fact of life. There is no way any Government or local authority could provide the financial requirements of road services in a county like Kildare at the present time, given the population increases and its location, next door to the capital city where every car, truck and motorbike going to or from the capital city traverses some part of County Kildare at one time or another. In tandem, we have the problem that our national primary routes were not up to standard with the result that traffic took shortcuts and ultimately our main and county roads suffered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment gives an annual grant for the maintenance of main and county roads, but it is a far cry from what is required at present for the reasons I have outlined.  There is no possibility that we would even expect a <Col N="2406" /> Government to be able to give the kind of funding needed to any local authority to their problems at this time.  While every politician will want to be parochial &mdash; and will get credit for doing so &mdash; it would be wrong if any county were to be singled out but on the basis of our geographic location and our population overflow from the capital city, we have a unique case, as do the neighbouring counties of Meath and Wicklow.  For instance, our county engineer in recent years has investigated the problem in regard to our main and county roads and submitted plans to the Department of the Environment outlining the need for capital expenditure in the order of £5 million per annum on top of existing maintenance funds.  I do not except that the Government will be able to provide that money.  The previous Government were not in a position to provide it and I am certain that in the present climate the Government will not be able to do so. However, it would be possible to do this work by the preparation for an integrated development programme as is now being mooted at EC level.  I understand that a survey of the Dublin region has been submitted and that the ERDO have recommended that the Dublin sub-region should be included in that survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Deputy permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the infrastructure appertaining to Kildare and I would be grateful to him if he would not extend that to other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I referred to the Dublin region and the Dublin sub-region is because the sub-region includes Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge.  Naturally, as a person who lives in Maynooth I am enthusiastic about the idea of including those three towns in such a study.  I hope the programme will be successful. However, another problem could arise in regard to this.  The local authority, already under severe pressure in regard to finance, may find themselves with the onset of an integrated development programme having to divert funds from work <Col N="2407" /> in the rest of the county to the area included in the new programme.  While people in the region will welcome the programme, such a move could have serious consequences for the remainder of the county.  For that reason it is important that we contemplate the preparation of a rural integrated development programme and co-ordinate the two in such a way as to ensure that there will not be any black spots.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that we should have an overlap but we could co-ordinate the two programmes in such a way as to be of tremendous benefit to the population of the county.  Roads is one service that is seriously deficient at present.  Their condition has obvious side-effects on public and private transport.  In fact, public service vehicles refuse to travel on a number of our roads.  Local milk delivery vehicles and school buses are also affected and other transport services are seriously curtailed as a result of a lack of finance for work on roads.  Another area that comes within the ambit of an integrated development programme is that of jobs.  In our county some of our bogs will be exhausted in the next few years and alternative arrangements for the employment of those now involved in the peat industry will have to be made. I understand that in other EC countries grant-aid is available for areas where coal mining was carried on.  County Kildare is an obvious place to try out that concept. In north and south Kildare many people have been employed in the peat industry and in the related electricity generating stations.  We will have to find alternative employment for them over the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a need to provide amenities in urban and rural areas for the enjoyment of the population.  Our county is unique in that a carefully prepared plan has been submitted by An Foras Talúntais, Kildare County Council, Dublin and Eastern Regional Tourism, Kildare Tourism and other agencies in an effort to attract investment to provide amenities for the area.  I am thinking of the Bog of Allen, Robertstown and adjoining <Col N="2408" /> areas.  The provision of such amenities would give the local people good reason for continuing to live in the county.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of scope to investigate alternative uses for land, whether peatland or not.  We must do what we can to provide jobs in a county where the population has almost doubled in the past 20 years.  We should not be reluctant or in any way bashful to put forward our case to Brussels because I understand that in the areas that will be affected by the Channel Tunnel, the south of England and northern France, local bodies have sought finance for the provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister can do a great deal to assuage the fears of the officials of Kildare County Council who have an overview of what is likely to happen. They also have first-hand information on the restriction on the finances under their control.  Our problems are twofold; the Government cannot provide the finance and it is not possible to extract sufficient money from the population in the county because of the present economic climate. We may not be able to raise £15 million to carry out the necessary roadwork &mdash; I am not taking into account employment alternatives or the development of amenities needed in urban areas &mdash; but it may be possible to get a substantial amount of that money from the EC.  In that event we should be able to obtain a reduced amount from the Government. In that case it might be possible to improve the quality of life for the people of Kildare and, as a result, attract further investment.</P>
    <P>We have a large industrial site at Collinstown near Leixlip and a number of other attractive sites in the county.  They are strategically placed but it is essential that we have the infrastructure to go with them.  It is also essential that we have sufficient amenities for our fast-expanding population.  Where the population has expanded in other areas serious social and economic problems have arisen if essential amenities were not provided in the early stages.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to my suggestions and to assure <Col N="2409" /> him that he will get the full support of the public representatives of County Kildare. From my discussions with public representatives in neighbouring counties I have no doubt that he can count on their support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Durkan for giving me the opportunity to put on record the present position.  I am fully aware of the views of Kildare County Council who have written to me in connection with the procedures to be followed in order to ensure that the maximum possible utilisation of the EC structural funds can be secured for this country and the particular requirements of County Kildare in this context.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy referred to much of what is contained in the submission of Kildare County Council by the county manager &mdash; and I will not run through it &mdash; in relation to industrial promotion, roads, water sewerage, bog peatland development and so on.  Most of those items are covered in relation to activity under the structural funds.  When we refer to the structural funds, we are talking about the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the FEOGA guidance fund.</P>
      <P>The European Council, as it is now known, on 11-12 February 1988 reached agreement on a number of major issues relating to reform of the structural funds, including: (1) resources from the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and FEOGA guidance going to the less developed regions will be doubled by 1992, in comparison with 1987 and within this a special effort will be made for the least prospeorus regions, which include Ireland; and (2) For the less developed regions, including Ireland, the percentage rate of assistance from the funds will be subject to a maximum of 75 per cent of total cost &mdash; it is 50 per cent to 55 per cent at present &mdash; and, as a general rule, a minimum of 50 per cent of public expenditure.  The minimum will not apply to income generating investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is continuing at Community level on the implementing measures, including the share-out of the increased resources <Col N="2410" /> between the funds and between member states.  The actual amount which we will receive will depend on the socio-economic criteria established by the Commission for sharing out part of the funds and the quality of the programmes which we submit for assistance.</P>
    <P>A major implication of the new system is that a national development plan must be drawn up for Ireland in respect of the expenditure areas covered by the structural funds.  This plan will set out the priorities on which Ireland will concentrate in the period to 1992 and the level of expenditure envisaged.  On the basis of this plan, the Community will indicate the amount of support which it is willing to provide to Ireland over the period.  Subsequent to the national plan, a series of operational programmes will have to be developed spelling out in more detail how we will allocate the expenditure. These are likely to be a mix of national programmes which will include roads and geographically based programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government are considering what special administrative arrangements may be needed to meet these new Community requirements.  As the Deputy and the House are aware, the Taoiseach has already indicated that there will be close consultation with the social partners under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Work is already going ahead in relation to preparing programmes.  A steering committee for a programme for the Dublin area has already been established, including representation from the local authorities and the private sector. It is intended that the preparation of operational programmes for the greater Cork area and the west will commence shortly.  It is envisaged &mdash; and I am sure this is what the Deputy is really concerned about &mdash; that the programme approach will be extended as soon as possible throughout the country as a whole, including County Kildare and the adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some people fear we may not be moving fast enough in drawing up our plan and programmes and that we may lose out at Community level.  I <Col N="2411" /> assure the House that there is no danger of this.  The new system is still at the drawing board stage in Brussels.  A series of detailed regulations have to be put in place, which are not expected to be finalised until the end of this year.  We propose to go ahead with our preparations without waiting for all the details to be fully clarified and to be ready to submit our plan as soon as possible after the new system comes into operation.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the additional resources available to Ireland will build <Col N="2412" /> up over the period to 1992.  While we expect a substantial increase by 1992, the immediate impact in the early years, while all the mechanisms are put in place, will be more modest.</P>
    <P>I again wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Durkan for the opportunity of giving the up to date position in relation to this fundamental and important issue which affects the whole country.</P>

However I am particularly concerned at the administrative costs incurred by industry in complying with the many Government requirements that have accumulated in the past years.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided that a programme should be initiated throughout the public service aimed at easing statutory and administrative requirements on industry and on business generally. The programme will involve a review by each Department of their statutory and information requirements, and those of the bodies under their aegis, which impact on business and the preparation of a report on requirements which are no longer necessary or can be simplified, including a timetable for this action.

The new arrangements involve a greater use of employment grants in small industry projects and a heavier emphasis on performance clauses in grant agreements for larger projects linking the payment of grants to pre-agreed performance measures, principally job creation.  Further measures were outlined to accelerate the shift in State support from fixed assets to R&amp;D and management development.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the progress being made to date in the implementation of policy objectives.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate a tabular statement giving details of Irish trade with all the countries of the Pacific Basin.  It is part of CTT's ongoing activity to assist and promote trade with these countries.</P>
      <P>These statistics show that the countries offering the best opportunities for Irish exporters in the Pacific Basin region are those such as the USA, Japan and Australia which already take a high level of Irish exports.  Many of the other countries have just begun to accept our exports.  Irish exports to South Korea, Taiwan, the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong in 1987 increased significantly in percentage terms but remain rather modest as regards total value.</P>
      <P>In support of exporters to those regions I recently led a CTT trade mission to China and Hong Kong.  Later this year, there will be similar trade missions to Japan and Australia.  It is likely that the Taoiseach will also visit both of these countries later this year in an effort, among other things, to encourage further trade.</P>

      <P>The primary aim of the Government's economic policy is to create an environment conducive to growth and investment.  This the Government have done through their rigorous action on the public finances.  The Government's budget strategy necessitated an equitable spread of expenditure reductions across all sectors of the economy. The Industrial Development Authority, like other State agencies, contributed to the achievement of the Government's budget targets through reduced expenditure allocations in both 1987 and 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On returning to office in March 1987 the pipeline of projects in manufacturing industry was almost empty.  This situation has been substantially reversed as a result of renewed confidence in the economy. <Col N="2252" /> This is reflected in a 14 per cent increase in IDA assisted manufacturing investment in 1987 and the creation of 11,000 new first time jobs.</P>
    <P>The IDA target for actual job creation over the next three years is 37,000 new jobs.  This represents a 20 per cent increase on the average activity levels of the past five years.  I am confident that not only will this target be achieved but it will occur against a backdrop of reduced resources reflecting more selective targeting of those resources.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the Government to continue, through the various incentives provided, to attract overseas industry to Ireland.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of weaknesses in its structure and management, mainstream Irish industry has performed poorly in recent years suffering an overall decline in employment, poor profitability and loss of domestic market share.  The Government are determined that the indigenous sector must be strengthened and to this end have adopted a number of new initiatives and policy directions.  These include the development of sectoral strategies for selected areas of manufacturing industry, the establishment of special trading houses which will provide a new and effective export service to smaller indigenous firms, the linking of State support to the achievement of specific <Col N="2253" /> employment targets and the giving of greater priority and resources to meeting the marketing, management and technological weaknesses of Irish industry.</P>

      <P>The fundamental concern which the Government had on returning to office in March 1987 was to restore order to the public finances and, thus, create an environment conducive to investment and economic growth. Achievement of the Government's budget strategy necessitated an equitable spread of savings throughout all sectors of the economy.  As part of this process the Government decided that the IDA could dispose of a portion of its large portfolio of land and buildings without unduly affecting the promotion of industrial development.  Accordingly, at the request of the Government, the IDA has drawn up a detailed schedule for the rationalisation of its property portfolio designed to raise £5 million for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The properties being disposed of have been carefully selected by the IDA to ensure an even regional spread while maintaining sufficient sites in each region for the promotion of new industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> No guidelines were issued by me to the IDA in relation to the implementation of the Government's decision.

      <P>Policy in this area is reflected in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which is at present before the Seanad.  This Bill contains detailed provisions about the disclosure of interests in shares of companies and about transactions entered into by company directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the disclosure of interests in shares.  The existing requirements relating to holdings of directors and secretaries are being considerably extended to ensure that full information as to the true ownership of <Col N="2256" /> the shares is made available.  In addition, new requirements are being introduced in relation to disclosure of significant shareholders by all beneficial owners of shares in a company.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Bill also contains new provisions concerning disclosure of particulars of certain transactions with directors.  These provisions go to great lengths to make sure that as full as possible a disclosure of individual transactions by directors is made in the company's accounts.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the combined effect of these provisions will be that shareholders are adequately informed about the real ownership of their company and about the range of transactions being entered into by the directors of the company, so that they are in a position to make an informed decision about their investment and participation in the company.</P>
    <P>In addition to legislative developments on the domestic front, our membership of the EC has meant that the Government's policy in relation to company law matters has, to a certain extent, been influenced by developments at EC level.  For example, adoption of the Fourth Company Law Directive on Accounts, which was implemented in Ireland via the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, means that the annual accounts of all limited companies, whether public or private must be published.  Thus, shareholders now have access not only to the accounts of their own company but also to the accounts of the company's competitors. The Seventh Company Law Directive, which is due for entry into force by January 1990, and which to a large extent complements the Fourth Directive, requires the publication of consolidated accounts by groups of companies.  Finally, the Third and Sixth Company Law Directives, which were implemented in Ireland in 1987, provide for the disclosure to shareholders of considerable information in the context of certain mergers and divisions of public limited companies.</P>

      <P>Investment in manufacturing industry is now at its highest level of activity since 1984.  In 1987 the volume of output and exports increased by 10 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, while investment in manufacturing industry assisted by the IDA grew by 14 per cent.  While it is difficult to speculate about the precise levels of future investment because of the many variables involved, I would expect grant-assisted manufacturing investment to increase over the period 1988 to 1990 in line with the increased job creation targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>I have no plans to dispose of part or all of the commercial State bodies under my control.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware of the joint venture which commenced last October between Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and ICI.  This involved the transfer of certain NET assets and properties, as well as assets of the ICI subsidiary, Richardsons Fertilisers Ltd., Belfast, to a new company, Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd., in which NET holds a majority share.  The ownership of NET which is a 100 per cent State owned company remains unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Irish Steel Ltd., I share the company's conviction that it could gain a <Col N="2258" /> substantial advantage from an association with an external partner possessing complementary attributes.  The company has been searching for such a partner for a number of years.</P>

The Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited have statutory responsibility for the implementation of industrial development policy.  The information sought by <Col N="2259" /> the Deputy relates therefore to the day-to-day responsibility of the State agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, however, that the IDA and Shannon Development take full account of the potential environmental impact of industrial projects.

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that a tax-free allowance certificate for 1988-89 was issued to the taxpayer last March as part of the general issue of certificates.  Marginal relief is not carried forward automatically and, therefore, relief previously granted under this heading was not included in that certificate. On the basis of information now available the inspector of taxes has determined that the taxpayer is entitled to a measure of marginal relief.</P>
      <P>A revised certificate, incorporating this relief was issued to the taxpayer on 26 April 1988.  Any tax over-deducted from the taxpayer's retirement pension since 6 April 1988 will be refunded to him by the payer of that pension when the revised certificate is put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community's 1987 scheme for the supply of food to deprived persons in the Community was implemented as a response to the particularly severe weather conditions prevailing in the early months of the year.  It operated for a limited period, therefore, but there was no limit on the quantities which could be distributed during the period.</P>
      <P>The present scheme, which is confined to the distribution of intervention stocks, can operate, at each member states discretion, on a permanent basis or for certain periods during the year.  A global allocation of 100 million ECU (about £80 million) has been provided for the scheme in 1988, of which 2.35m ECU (£1.8million) has been allocated to Ireland.  I would have preferred a bigger EC scheme but, unfortunately, this could not be agreed because of the current EC budget constraints.  Some member states pressed for a distribution of the allocation based on population but I insisted on a distribution which took account of the relative position of member states.  I am pleased that the Commission took the latter approach and with only about 1 per cent of the Community's population Ireland will receive about 2.5 per cent of the allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish scheme for 1988, drawn up <Col N="2274" /> following consultations with the Department of Social Welfare and other bodies concerned, covers the following categories:</P>
    <P>(a)  homeless persons accommodated inhostels and shelters run by voluntary organisations, and</P>
    <P>(b)  certain social welfare recipients, i.e.</P>
    <P>Recipients of long-term unemployment assistance who qualify for the fuel allowance,</P>
    <P>recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance,</P>
    <P>FÁS trainees who qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>The eligible hostels and shelters have now been allocated supplies of beef and butter based on their needs to the end of December next.</P>
    <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who have agreed to operate the scheme in so far as the eligible social welfare recipients are concerned, are at present finalising arrangements for the distribution of beef.  I am informed that the Society expect to be in a position to commence distribution of approximately 6 kgs of beef to eligible recipients in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the grave financial difficulties of a number of farmers, approximately 50, in the Cavan-Monaghan area who were refused grants for works carried out under the farm modernisation scheme with the verbal approval of the farm development officers prior to 9 February 1983; if he will pay these grants to the farmers as many of them borrowed heavily to modernise their farms on the strength of these grants and now find themselves in grave financial difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with a decision taken in the context of the 1983 budget, the issue of approvals under the farm modernisation scheme (FMS) for grants for farm structures was suspended with effect from 10 February 1983.  The suspension ended with the introduction of a revised FMS from 3 January 1984 but works undertaken between the dates cited without the prior written approval of the Farm Development Service (FDS) were not eligible for grant aid under the terms of the revised scheme.  It was subsequently decided to pay grants to farmers who had made formal written application to the FDS prior to 10 February 1983 and who went ahead with work during the period of the scheme suspension.  Those who remain ineligible for grants are farmers who proceeded with work during the scheme suspension without written approval from the FDS and without having made application for such approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants cannot be paid to farmers who do not meet some of the most basic requirements of grant schemes, viz. making an application and obtaining written <Col N="2276" /> approval before commencing work.  I have no knowledge of the number of farmers, if any, in the Cavan-Monaghan area who are in financial difficulties as a result of carrying out works for which they had neither made application to the FDS nor received written approval from that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food whether badgers which are infected with tuberculosis constitute a potential reservoir of infection for cattle; and his policy for dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two separate committees that have considered this question in Britain in recent years, namely the Zuckermann (1980) and Dunnet (1986) Committees, believed that infectious badgers are potential sources of infection to cattle and that badgers must be taken into account in a bovine TB eradication programme.</P>
      <P>Under our disease eradication programme investigation of a possible link between badgers and TB outbreaks on particular holdings is initiated normally in cases where reinfection is a recurring problem and then only after thorough examination of all other possible causes of the breakdown.  In some such cases badgers may be captured.  This is done under licence granted to my Department by the Wildlife Service.  Application for licence is made only after the most strict screening process.  The capture of badgers under licence is then carried out under the supervision of veterinary inspectors of my Department, with careful attention to the humane aspects.  Where the proportion of badgers identified as being infected is significant, the remaining badgers are removed and the cattle herd is closely monitored for several years afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the findings to date justify continuation of the present approach on a selective basis.  All the data and results are carefully recorded <Col N="2277" /> and assessed and apart from the research dimension attached to that work, my Department are also associated with a number of projects relating to badger ecology and population dynamics, the search for a TB vaccine for badgers, and the development of a diagnostic TB test on live badgers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably referring to the conditions which must be met if an aquaculture licence is granted in respect of a public fishery area.  Under section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, I am empowered to issue aquaculture licences within areas designated for aquaculture under the Act.  The holder of an aquaculture licence may be given the exclusive right to deposit, harvest and propagate one or more species of shellfish, including scallops, within a specified area.  If the area in question is regarded as a public fishery, and this will almost certainly be the case, then an aquaculture licence in respect of the area will only be granted to a co-operative whose rules of membership <Col N="2280" /> allow any resident of the State to become a member of it where the resident fulfils all the conditions laid down by the co-operative and the rules do not lay down different conditions for different classes of people.</P>
      <P>Once such a licence has been issued, the rules of the co-operative may not be amended without my consent and I have the power to direct the co-operative to amend its rules if it is in the interests of the good management of the fishery.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 70, 71 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have agreed to grant-aid an improvement scheme for Holy Trinity national school and Scoil Bride national school, Donaghmede.  Detailed proposals and tender recommendations for the works submitted by the school authorities are being examined in my Department.  A decision will be conveyed to the school authorities at an early date. The arrangements for alternative accommodation during the course of the works <Col N="2289" /> are a matter for the school authorities with whom the Department are in close contact.  I understand that the necessary alternative accommodation will be available as required.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the school/community hall is in very poor condition.  In November 1987 the school authorities requested that it be demolished and replaced by a new hall to serve both schools.  The Department would be prepared to consider grant-aiding the demolition of the premises and the re-instatement of the ground subject to receipt of proposals and costings from the school authorities for these works.  It would not be open to the Department at this time to grant-aid the provision of a new hall for the schools.</P>
    <P>My Department's professional advisers will inspect the furniture supplied to Holy Trinity school at an early date and if it is satisfactory the usual grant will be paid.</P>
