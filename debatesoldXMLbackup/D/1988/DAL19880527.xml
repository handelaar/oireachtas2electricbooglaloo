      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £126,311,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st December 1988 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In working to regenerate our economy, this Government are committed to working together with the national organisations of employers and trade unions and other representative bodies to improve the social equity of our society. Since its establishment a central objective of the Department of Labour has been to keep open the lines of communication between employers, trade unions and Government at national level in the interests of improving the conduct of industrial relations and the performance <Col N="455" /> of the economy.  My Department have an important role to play in ensuring that the strategies pursued by Government, employers and trade unions in restoring competitiveness are attentive to the need to maintain a proper balance between equity and efficiency in the labour market.</P>
    <P>In response to the competitiveness challenge, the Department of Labour are engaged in a critical examination of the entire range of their programmes.  This examination and the current spending requirements on which this Estimate is based maintain a balance between the objective of securing savings in public expenditure and the need to maintain services to assist the disadvantaged and to promote the full development of our human resources.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has outlined an extensive programme of labour law reform. Legislation is, of course, only one means alongside other public policies and the collective bargaining process in maintaining employment standards.  In a global economy, employment standards have to be shaped so as to help Ireland become a more effective competitor. This calls for the development of more co-operative relationships between employers and trade unions, based more on compatible goals than on conflict.</P>
    <P>Member states of the European Community are finding that high rates of economic growth are not, for various reasons, being converted into increases in employment. In our case, however, real economic growth, investment confidence and the stable economic environment which is underpinned by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are accompanied by practical development measures which are creating extra jobs.  The agreement to double by 1992 the Structural Funds will enhance those development efforts especially in the productive and infrastructural area and for employment schemes.  Deputies will be familiar with the measures which have been announced to meet the specific job objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The objectives are as follows: <Col N="456" /> a total of 4,000 new first time jobs were created in the first quarter of 1988; in the same period some 240 project start-ups have been recorded by the industrial development agencies across the overseas, indigenous and small industry sectors; twenty-four projects have been approved for the international financial services centre at the Custom House Docks involving a job content of approximately 1,000; over 2,000 new first time jobs have been created in the food industry in the past year.</P>
    <P>While manpower programmes cannot and should not be equated with real jobs &mdash; they are very often the means to lead unemployed people back to the labour market &mdash; their importance should not be understated.  I will be returning to these programmes later.</P>
    <P>My Department's annual report for 1987 provides details of recent unemployment trends.  The principal features are first that the total at work continued to fall last year except in the private services sector and, secondly, that unemployment has fallen slightly over the last 12 months.  While part of this latter development is due to emigration and the effectiveness of Jobsearch, we should not ignore the underlying favourable development in the real economy.</P>
    <P>The change in the live register seems to have heralded not only a halt to the long, steady upward spiral in unemployment which had persisted for years but also a substantial year-on-year decrease in the numbers out of work for the early months of this year.  At the end of April there were 241,700 registered as unemployed compared with 250,000 in April 1987, representing a fall of 9,000 over the year.  Seasonally adjusted, unemployment is now at its lowest level in 18 months.</P>
    <P>The combating of long-term unemployment features as one of the objectives of the European Community's Structural Funds.  This underlines the commitment at Community level to preventing and to reducing this most serious of social problems.  In our own case long-term unemployment, that is unemployment in excess of 12 months, hovers <Col N="457" /> around 45 per cent of total unemployment. The most recent figures available reveal a small decline in long term unemployment &mdash; the first reduction in several years.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> aims to strengthen our indigenous manufacturing sector so that it can achieve the size and the vitality which other small economies have achieved.  It also aims to continue, but on a more selective basis, to attract overseas manufacturing companies. Economic growth and performance need to be accompanied by measures to improve the functioning of the labour market, raise educational and training levels and adapt their content to present and future requirements.  While these strategies can prevent a recurrence of long term unemployment in future on the scale of today's historical high levels, they need to be supplemented by actions which reintegrate the long term unemployed into the labour market, and stop those who become unemployed from drifting into long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I turn now to my priorities for 1988 as they relate to this important area of the work of my Department.  That importance is underlined by the sheer scale of the financial commitment involved.  This year, FÁS will receive grant-aid from the Labour Vote of £113 million, towards the costs of overall expenditure of over £180 million.  CERT will receive £2.5 million towards its overall budget of £6 million.</P>
    <P>I should point out to Deputies that the establishment of FÁS has given rise to a variation in the presentation of the 1988 Estimate compared with the way in which the gross Estimate had been calculated in the past.  The full details of this format are outlined in the Revised Book of Estimates. Briefly, in 1987 European Social Fund grants due in respect of certain employment and training schemes run by the National Manpower Service were treated as appropriations-in-aid on the Labour Vote and the full cost of the programmes shown under the respective subheads.</P>
    <P>In 1988 these grants, totalling over £10 million, will be received by FÁS directly. <Col N="458" /> Secondly, in 1987 the Votes for postprimary education and higher education received over £33 million from the youth employment levy through the Department of Labour Vote.  The allocation to the Department of Education of £30 million from the employment and training levy is no longer channelled through the Department of Labour Vote but is allocated direct to the respective post-primary and higher education Votes.</P>
    <P>The establishment of FÁS as the training and employment authority is the single most important development in the manpower area in recent years.  FÁS have taken over the functions of three former agencies.  They have a vital role to play in the development and use of all manpower resources and I am confident that FÁS will be able now to offer a greatly improved service to their main clients, the unemployed.</P>
    <P>One of my major objectives in setting up FÁS was to create an integrated set of programmes for the public.  Previously many people did not know whom to approach for information or access to an employment and training programme. The local FÁS office will now be able to offer a comprehensive service of information, advice and referral.  FÁS have already started refurbishing their offices to provide a more efficient service, together with a more attractive atmosphere. Deputies will be aware that a central information service has been set up for public representatives which should help to provide speedier information in response to specific requests on individual cases.</P>
    <P>The establishment of FÁS is, of itself, a major step towards the integration of programmes.  FÁS have begun a farreaching review, at my request, of the scope for rationalising the existing range of employment schemes and training programmes in order to provide a more responsive service to individual clients. In the enterprise area for example, each of the three former agencies had their own programmes and these are being examined with a view to developing a comprehensive programme with a variety of modules which can be put together <Col N="459" /> as needed to suit the individual client's needs.  Other programmes are similarly being reviewed.  I hope that this rationalisation will lead to a better and more cost-effective service.</P>
    <P>In the general area of cost-effectiveness FÁS are working to ensure that savings can be achieved in each area with the least disruption in service.  A number of steps have been taken to reduce overheads in FÁS.  Total staff numbers are being reduced through the voluntary early retirement package.  Other staff are being moved from administrative and overhead activities to work on direct training or employment activities, in particular Jobsearch and employment schemes.  All overheads are being critically examined and any measures necessary to eliminate overlap or waste will be taken.</P>
    <P>As a further step to becoming both more client-centred and more cost effective, FÁS will operate as a genuine regionally structured organisation.  This will ensure that the needs and concerns of individuals and local communities will be catered for effectively and in a flexible manner at local level.  The regions will participate in the overall planning process and FÁS programmes can be targeted more closely to local needs.  This will help to encourage local initiative and experimentation and will also facilitate better co-operation with other local organisations.</P>
    <P>Despite continuing efforts to reduce costs and streamline the provision of services, the resources available for manpower services will remain limited.  I am most concerned to ensure that these resources are used to improve the position of the most disadvantaged people in the labour market.  I have therefore given FÁS two priorities in programmes for the unemployed &mdash; the long term unemployed and early school leavers with no formal qualifications.</P>
    <P>FÁS have a major role to play in the Jobsearch programme, in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare. Some 65 per cent of FÁS recruitment must come from the live register, thus <Col N="460" /> ensuring that those longest out of work have the chance to learn new skills and improve their chances of finding employment. Other FÁS recruitment comes principally from the early school leaver category.</P>
    <P>The apprenticeship system is one of the key programme areas which I have identified in guidelines issued to FÁS as a subject for urgent assessment and change.  While apprenticeship has served us well in the past, it must be updated to meet the needs of a modern economy.</P>
    <P>I have asked FÁS to make recommendations by the end of this year on the development of a flexible system which can provide high standards and yet reduce the currently high cost to the State.  Industry must be prepared to take up its responsibilities in developing specialised skill training and to pay a more equitable share of the cost.</P>
    <P>The combination of resources within FÁS will also give added impetus to planning for equal opportunities.  Building on the initiatives pursued by its forerunners, the new streamlined Authority is to bring forward an integrated action programme identifying opportunities for positive action.  FÁS are not short of ideas and have already built up considerable experience in this regard.  They will be devoting special attention to working with employers to encourage them to take more young women into employment, particularly in the non-traditional types of work for which they are now being trained.</P>
    <P>FÁS will also play an important role in the development of co-operatives.  Parallel to the Community enterprise programme, FÁS plan to establish a specialised service to promote the cooperative concept and provide expert advice and counselling services.</P>
    <P>These new initiatives meet the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and reflects the outcome of consultations with the key interests involved.  Worker co-operatives were seen in the terms of the programme as having a significant contribution to make in employment maintenance and job creation.  I intend as Minister for <Col N="461" /> Labour to ensure that arrangements for the support of co-operatives are better co-ordinated and that co-operatives are given the kind of specialised assistance they require to enable them to pursue employment initiatives with realistic commercial prospects.</P>
    <P>The issue of the free movement of workers has become increasingly important in the context of the completion of internal market.  FÁS provide detailed counselling services to people considering working abroad.  It is also the most appropriate source of advice for young people about the difficulties involved in leaving this country without adequate preparation.  This applies particularly to those who have no qualifications and, therefore, little prospect of success abroad.  What FÁS can do is to try to redirect them to manpower opportunities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Despite cuts in most other areas of State expenditure, the Government have maintained the 1988 allocation for emigrant advisory services at its 1987 level of £250,000.</P>
    <P>The bulk of these funds, which are released by me on the recommendation of DÍON, are currently directed towards improving and developing the reception services mounted by voluntary agencies in Britain for newly arrived emigrants. DÍON has been trying to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is adopted in the development of emigrant welfare services on the part of these agencies, the &ldquo;settled Irish&rdquo; represented by the Federation of Irish Societies and the various statutory agencies in London and other urban centres in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have been urging employers to recognise that our provision for training and development at company level in Ireland is too narrow, too little and for too few. We certainly need to look more systematically at training needs at enterprise level.  It is clear, however, that neither at management level, at the level of technical skills, nor at the level of basic induction training for young people is our overall performance sufficient to ensure that we are fully competitive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> An analysis of the information available from the 1986 labour force survey on training provided in the four weeks prior to the survey revealed that only 5.5 per cent of all employees had received some training or education in that period. We lag behind Britain in this respect where the comparable figure was over 10 per cent.  We must acknowledge the existence of a significant training gap compared with our competitors in Europe.  Training will have to come to be regarded as a matter of central importance in the corporate strategy of Irish industry.  We need to change employers' attitudes to training and retraining so as to ensure that employees' skills are updated to meet changing needs.</P>
    <P>On management development the success or failure of many business enterprises today depends largely on the quality and style of management.  Unfortunately, too few firms have demonstrated any long term commitment to management training and development.</P>
    <P>There are many routes to management and there is a variety of institutions and organisations engaged in the provision of management education and training, involving substantial Exchequer subventions. I believe there is considerable scope for rationalisation in this area to enable better use to be made of existing facilities and to co-ordinate the work of third level educational institutions, State training agencies and the Irish Management Institute.  That was one of the reasons I appointed an Advisory Committee on Management Training in July 1987.  I have asked the committee to make recommendations to me on how management training can contribute more effectively to economic development.</P>
    <P>Because of the urgent need to raise the general standard of management throughout all sectors of the economy, I have asked the committee to report by June this year so that decisions can be made quickly to ensure the best possible provision of management education, training and development from within existing resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> Since we joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the European Social Fund has provided sustained and invaluable help for vocational training and job creation schemes in Ireland. Ireland has always been a region of absolute priority in the fund and, as a result, has qualified for special consideration and a higher rate of assistance than certain other regions.</P>
    <P>The total amount of ESF assistance received by Ireland since 1973 exceeds £890 millions.  This money has enabled us to develop a vocational training structure, throughout the country, which we would have otherwise been unable to establish.  Our ability to provide a trained workforce has greatly enhanced our attractiveness for foreign investors and the efficiency of our industry has improved.  In the current year we expect to be approved for ESF assistance of over £166 millions, which is £4 million more than for 1987.</P>
    <P>The budget of the ESF in recent years has not kept pace with the increased demands from member states, particularly since the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain.  As a result the European Commission has been applying stricter criteria for the approval of applications for ESF assistance, and programmes for persons unemployed for more than 12 months.  This emphasis by the Commission on programmes which produce economic results, as opposed to programmes of a more social nature may have the effect, in the future, of reducing the level of assistance for some of our programmes.</P>
    <P>The agreements reached at the last summit in Brussels on the reform of the structural funds are of major significance in meeting the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and combating the scourge of unemployment.  My Department, together with the agencies under my responsibility, are working with other Government bodies to ensure that the increased resources that we will get under these funds are used to the best possible advantage to increase the productive capacity of the economy, and we <Col N="464" /> will do this in close consultation with the social partners under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>A very important new development is that Community support can in future amount to up to 75 per cent of the cost of projects or programmes, as compared with the present maximum rate of assistance of 55 per cent.  This opens up a whole new range of possibilities.  It also means that we will have to improve the quality of our programmes in order to qualify for support.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the European Community's Standing Committee on Employment on Wednesday at which I emphasised the commitment made in the context of the Single European Act and the February Council in Brussels to help the less developed regions on the periphery to improve their infrastructure and to reach the same standard as the more favourably located regions.</P>
    <P>On work safety and health schemes, developments under way both at home and within the European Community will have profound implications for our future approach to safety and health.  In accordance with the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> my priority in 1988 is the introduction of a Bill in the Oireachtas based on the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work.  The drafting of the legislation has now reached its final stage. The legislation will set down general safety and health principles applying to all employers, employees and the self-employed. Safety and health issues will have to be taken care of at the workplace under a safety based on an assessment of the hazards that exist.</P>
    <P>Consultation and dialogue between employers and workers on safety and health matters will also be an important feature of the new provisions.  The legislation will provide for updated enforcement provisions including improvement plans, improvement notices and prohibition notices.  The new legislation will provide for the establishment of a national authority for occupational safety and health representative of the social <Col N="465" /> partners and Government Departments. The authority will have overall responsibility for safety and health at work at national level, which will include initiatives in policy, providing an enforcement and advisory service and co-ordinating and guiding education, information and training activities in the area of safety and health at work.</P>
    <P>The development of measures relating to occupational safety and health has gained increased momentum in the European Community in preparation for the completion of the internal market by the end of 1992.  There is a strong consensus within the Community that the internal market should mean more than just removing tariff barriers.  Improvements in worker protection are a major feature of the social dimension of the internal market.</P>
    <P>The Labour and Social Affairs Council is currently examining a number of new proposals for directives including: the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at the workplace; and minimum safety and health requirements for workplaces. The European Commission is bringing forward many other draft directives in the area of safety and health at work.  These are of particular relevance to us now as many of the proposals are very similar to those arising from the Barrington commission.</P>
    <P>These new instruments have obvious implications for our approach to legislative reform in this area.  I have been advocating that any proposals for directives should be flexible and carefully produced. There is a clear need for adequate prior consultation with member states and with the representatives of employers and workers before proposals are finalised.  We have also emphasised that the special position of small and medium sized enterprises needs to be properly recognised.</P>
    <P>On employment law, my Department administer and enforce a very substantial body of labour legislation, including employment regulation orders made under the Industrial Relations Acts. These orders set down minimum pay and <Col N="466" /> conditions in traditionally low-paid or unorganised areas of employment such as clothing, catering, law clerks, hairdressing and agriculture.  As a result of inspections carried out by the general inspectorate of my Department, almost £44,000 in arrears of wages were recovered last year.  Such monitoring and inspection procedures are justified and do not at all imply a favourable disposition to the maintenance of unnecessary rigidities on the labour market.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious, however, of the need to eliminate any superfluous legislative or administrative burdens on employers which can impede their competitiveness and their capacity to provide employment.  The removal last year of the 50 year old statutory ban on the employment of women doing industrial night work is a case in point.  Employers now have more flexibility in how they make use of their manpower and machinery. I propose to eliminate other regulations which are generally regarded as having outlived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>As a further step towards improving equality of opportunity and eliminating unnecessary provisions in worker protection legislation, the Government yesterday lodged in Geneva an instrument to denounce Convention No. 45 of the International Labour Organisation.  This action will enable us to remove the current restrictions on the employment of women underground in mines.</P>
    <P>One of the areas on which action is called for is occupational safety and health.  I am particularly attracted to the Barrington commission's proposal to use legislation to put beyond question important points of principle and to use structural codes and guidelines to advise and to educate people on how those principles are to be observed or implemented.  I am particularly conscious of the very large volume of regulations and orders in the occupational safety and health field and the very genuine concerns of employers in this regard.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the employment laws are better explained and understood a guide to labour law has been published. This provides in a straightforward and <Col N="467" /> non-technical manner, an immediate outline of the various protective employment measures and it should be of real assistance to workers and employers alike &mdash; particularly those in small and medium sized undertakings.</P>
    <P>I have also initiated a review of a number of pieces of legislation and a discussion document on possible changes to the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Employment Equality Acts and the Payment of Wages Act has been published. Interested parties have had an opportunity to submit views on the proposals outlined in that document and the range of responses received will allow for full consideration of all aspects before legislative proposals are finally advanced.</P>
    <P>A number of Acts covering the conditions of employment of workers are on the Statute Book for over 50 years.  Many of the provisions of these Acts were introduced to deal with conditions in a very different employment era.  A substantial number of them, or major parts of them, have by now been superseded by subsequent legislation.  The question therefore arises as to the relevance of these enactments in present day circumstances. A preliminary review of this body of legislation, which includes the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944, the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938 and 1942, and the Night Work (Bakeries) Acts, 1936 and 1981, is at present being undertaken in my Department.</P>

      <P>The negotiation and ratification of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the agreements in pay associated with it represented a major achievement on the part of the social partners and the Government.  The agreements on pay are designed to achieve long term wage stability &mdash; with obvious benefits in terms of reducing the <Col N="468" /> potential for industrial conflict and increasing confidence in the performance of both the public and private sectors. We need to foster this kind of confidence if we are to achieve our aims of increasing industrial output and generating additional employment.  A sizeable number of pay settlements covering approximately 37,000 workers have been monitored by my Department since the ratification of the national programme and the great majority of the settlements have been based on the pay terms of the national programme.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> committed me to holding discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers on industrial relations reform with the intention of bringing about changes which would provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement.</P>
      <P>In my efforts to make progress in this complex area I have formulated a comprehensive set of proposals which I have put to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers. My proposals include: reform of the Labour Court and the establishment of a new, pro-active dispute resolving agency; provision for codes of good industrial relations practice; reform of the joint labour committees which propose statutory minimum rates of pay for certain sectors of low paid or poorly organised employment; further measures to promote and facilitate trade union amalgamations; the requirement that union rule books provide for secret ballots before industrial action; restriction on the granting of injunctions, particularly <i>ex parte</i> injunctions, in trade disputes; the removal of immunity in workmen <i>v</i> workmen disputes and in disputes in breach of procedure involving one individual worker; the removal of immunity for picketing a person's home and clarification of the position in regard to secondary picketing.</P>

    <P>I did not have an opportunity, as happened last year, to cover everything.  I would have liked to refer to CERT and <Col N="469" /> the Great Southern Hotels.  I should also like to have referred to the difficulties of the Labour Court and industrial relations.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister whose speed reading has certainly improved over the last 12 months. It is a year since we last discussed Estimates for the Department of Labour and on that occasion, facing a Minister who had been less than three months in office, I complained that there was very little evidence of any fresh thinking.  That criticism may have seemed harsh but, a year later, the remarks were entirely prophetic.</P>
      <P>We are reviewing a year of missed opportunities, playing safe and fudging the issues.  I know the Minister is a keen sportsman and it is worthwhile considering what some of the sports journalists might say if they were invited to assess his performance.  The GAA scribes might suggest that it was a question of some nice touches early in the game but that he failed to stamp his authority on it.  The rugby scribes might suggest that, while some nice tackles were brought off in defence, he failed to link with his three quarters.  However, having seen his performance as he went for the line in trying to finish his script some references to a front row forward might have been more appropriate.

      <P>I am trying to be fair to the Minister and none of my suggested reviews are all that bad but our prospects and situation called for something much more than a policy of safety first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government took office <Col N="470" /> unemployment stood at 245,000.  Now, a year later, we are debating a Book of Estimates based on an average level of unemployment of 256,000, which is built into the Estimates.  There is also an expectation, built into the Estimates, of continuing emigration at anything up to 30,000 a year.  This is all done against a major exercise of &ldquo;sweating&rdquo; the register through the operation of the Jobsearch scheme.  The Government's only response to unemployment of that scale has been to argue in favour of cutting expenditure in the belief that it will reduce interest rates and that all we have to do then is to wait.  At one level, that is fine but, despite the growth rates which we have achieved, we are experiencing a continuing decline in unemployment across all sectors of the economy.  The only possible exception is that of private services.  Against that background, a response is overdue from the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>What is required of the Government? They are required to demolish the road blocks to growth, road blocks which are now encased in concrete.  Our costs are way out of line with our competitors in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. The tax regime must be of particular concern to the Minister for Labour with its very high marginal rates on very ordinary incomes which reduces the work incentive.  We are talking about an effective marginal rate of 65.5 per cent for a single person on a salary of £11.500 or £12,000 per year.  More generally, those rates produce an ever-widening gap between what the employer pays out and what the employee takes home.</P>
    <P>The Government's dismissal of the Fine Gael proposals for an all-party approach and their disavowal of any interest in fundamental tax reform is bad news for the unemployed and for the parents of those considering emigration. The direct result is that employment will continue to shrink and that there will be increased burdens on the Department of Labour, advisory services and services engaged in the creation of temporary employment opportunities.  Inevitably, <Col N="471" /> the haemorrhage of emigration will continue, which will have further implications for the Department of Labour as further strains are imposed on them in their role of serving the interests and needs of the welfare organisations supporting Irish emigrants abroad.</P>
    <P>The divergence between the tax regime applying here and the much more benign one in Britain has implications on the supply side for the Department of Labour because, across a range of occupations, as diverse as the traditional professions, the construction industry and the financial services sector, there is now an opportunity for very highly paid employment at moderate tax levels.  The inducement to travel is very strong and it holds out the prospect of a serious shortage of skills in the coming years as the best and the brightest go.  They leave against a very high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards a two-tier society, an élite in the main in the traditional areas of employment, the public service providing people in the older suburbs with secure employment but surrounded by outer suburbs with vast levels of unemployment and a whole new urban proletariat for whom the prospect of secure employment is all but unknown. Alongside traditional responses and the obligation on the Government to go for growth, something more is necessary, if there is not to be a whole new sub-class of people in our society for whom any upturn in the economy would be irrelevant, too little or too late.  This sub-class would comprise the holed boats for whom the rising tide would simply mean that they would sink instead of being lifted.</P>
    <P>Part of the response to that lies in the area of redefining the nature of work and in supporting the efforts of the third sector to identify, carve out and build on a niche for itself.  In this context, the Government's response has been deeply disappointing.  In the area of self-employment, the enterprise allowance scheme has been effectively relegated to the sidelines. In the case of local employment initiatives, the situation is even bleaker. <Col N="472" /> I fully supported in the House the restructuring of the manpower and training agencies and their merger in FÁS. However, I was very anxious indeed that those areas which had been developed and had shown signs of movement would not suffer.  One area where the Youth Employment Agency were finding a role for themselves was in the area of cooperative support for community employment initiatives.  I am very unhappy as I already detect signs that there is a much less sharp focus on that area of activity by FÁS.  I am in no sense reassured by the somewhat bland reference in the Minister's speech to FÁS looking after co-operatives.</P>
    <P>In the area of conditions and allowances paid to those who participate on various programmes, the record of the Government has been particularly disappointing. On taking office they moved quickly to disimprove the conditions, to reduce the allowances of participants on the Teamwork and social employment schemes.  I have already drawn attention to the disparity in treatment between those who participate in the programmes and those who administer and direct the programmes.  I do not wish to go over that ground again except to say that in one instance there is the prospect of guaranteed salary increases in accordance with the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> while for others there is the actuality of very large cuts, percentage-wise.  There can be no justification for treating those who have agreed to take up temporary employment which is of benefit to the community as well as to themselves less favourably than those in permanent employment and less favourably than those on social welfare. To single them out uniquely for unfavourable treatment cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to make that point with all the force at my command but it remains the case that those schemes are attractive to sizeable numbers of people among the unemployed, particularly to many people among the long-term unemployed. That is so in those parts of the country where it operates but it remains <Col N="473" /> a national scandal that the social employment scheme, which is acknowledged as being among the most attractive to many of the long-term unemployed, is unavailable to the long-term unemployed of this city not because of any actions of this or previous Governments but because of the edicts of some trade unions.  I raised this issue in the House on a number of occasions and I was brushed off with rather vacuous assurances that in time all will be sorted out.  It is time to cry halt and to say that the continued obduracy and selfishness of some trade unions in dealing with the local authorities in Dublin cannot be allowed to continue and that this issue has to be faced up to fairly and squarely.</P>
    <P>It is particularly galling that that should be the position in Dublin's Millennium year when the scheme might otherwise have been used to good effect.  There has been some talk of movement in that area but it seems that at best what will happen is that there will be so many preconditions imposed that in practice the position will remain the same and the long-term unemployed in Dublin will be disadvantaged as against those from everywhere else in the country who have the opportunity to participate in such a programme.</P>
    <P>That same timidity of approach is to be found elsewhere.  For example, it is to be found in relation to the debate on greater flexibility in the labour market. Within Community countries and the wider OECD there has been a vigorous debate on the need to deregulate, on the need to introduce a greater measure of flexibility.  In a number of instances that debate has led to legislative action and to the repeal of many controls which were found to be no longer apt.  The Minister's contribution to this debate has been to publish a discussion document that focused on three areas of legislation, the payment of wages, equality and unfair dismissal.  It would be a fair paraphrasing of that discussion document to say that what it says is that some people think that the unfair dismissals legislation is a disincentive to employment creation while other disagree.  I do not think the <Col N="474" /> document goes much beyond that.  On that basis it does not add greatly to the sum of human knowledge.  It seems to me that the time is now right for an audit of all the interventions, assessing in each case the protection afforded and the cost to industry.  Simultaneously with that audit there is a need to identify a code of rights covering areas of basic fundamental importance, safety at work, equality and so on, which would be sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>As in the Minister's case, the clock has defeated me.  I would have wanted to go on to talk about the lack of progress made since our last Estimates on health and safety legislation and the fact that only yesterday the Taoiseach told the Dáil &mdash; he appeared to know nothing about the legislation &mdash; that the legislation would not be published before the next Dáil session.  I wanted to say something about the lack of progress on reform of industrial relations which has seen again deadlines missed and, apparently, no willingness to grapple with fundamental issues such as those that arise in the area of State monopolies in providing essential services.  I wanted to talk about the apparent lack of urgency in preparing this country for the changes in the Social Fund and in the labour market that will be consequent on 1992 but I will have to deal with them later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I will mention the areas I would like to deal with because up to now the other Members have been defeated by the clock.  There is reason to go through the matters mentioned in the Minister's brief.  There is a thread going through them that should be adverted to.  It is important to deal with a number of matters, including the development of FÁS, industrial relations and reform and the problems associated with trying to solve long-term unemployment and emigration.  I should like to deal with matters that will be dealt with in the coming years in relation to a European single market by 1992.  The Minister touched on that in his speech <Col N="475" /> when he mentioned management training but there are a number of other aspects involved.</P>
      <P>The reason I mentioned those matters at the outset was because on looking at the Minister's speech in moving his Estimate last year I noted that he touched on a number of those areas, particularly the development of FÁS, industrial relations reform and the plight of the long-term unemployed.  Specific measures were suggested last year.  We were promised legislation within a few months on industrial relations reform.  I fully expected we would have passed legislation to reform industrial relations laws, something that is long overdue and has been referred to by many Ministers over the years, and that it would be in place.  However, at this stage the Minister is still promising he is going to deal with the problem.  He has said he proposed dealing with certain areas of industrial relations but we have heard similar statements from many Ministers of Labour before.  There is no obvious sign of any progress being made. Discussions are taking place but what will be their result?  When will those discussions come to an end?  When does the Minister intend to grasp the nettle and introduce legislation with a view to dealing with industrial relations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has asked the FUE and ICTU to discuss in relation to the framework of such legislation a number of areas including the reform of the Labour Court and a proposal that we should have a labour relations commission. I welcome a move to take out of the adversarial arena the practice of industrial relations.  For far too long we have allowed it to become too legalistic and there has been a marked trend away from the idea that responsibility for industrial relations rests on the shop floor, in the office or in the place of employment.  Despite the best efforts of the Labour Court, given the structures there, it has not been possible to overcome that trend.  I would recommend relying more on a conciliation service, with emphasis on prevention rather than <Col N="476" /> cure in managing labour relations in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Provision for secret ballots before industrial action is decided upon and restriction on the granting of injunctions are essential elements in industrial relations reform.  There should also be provision for the outlawing of secondary picketing.  While the Minister proposes the removal of some immunity, we should be very clear that secondary picketing simply will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>While I commend the Minister on the proposals he has made, we are awaiting legislation.  What has happened in this area is symptomatic of what has happened in FÁS and in dealing with the long-term unemployed.  My party voted against the establishment of FÁS because there were no provisions in the Bill to reduce the numbers of those working in the bodies.  The whole purpose was supposed to be more efficiency, reduction in staff numbers and reduction in duplication of services and functions, but there was no evidence in the Bill that this would actually happen.  To date I do not see a real thrust in that direction.  I am not saying it will not happen but it should be obvious that there will be a move in that direction.  The Minister refers to a number of people leaving because of the early retirement package which is on offer to the public service generally, but he also refers to many administrative people moving into direct training areas. The first thing should be a fundamental review of the work of this body and then a consideration of whether one needs the people employed there.  It is an unfortunate fact that three bodies grew up and achieved a certain staff complement, without any regard for the fact that there was duplication of services.  This is a thorny problem but it must be tackled. Preparation for the establishment of FÁS was, perhaps, rushed and was not at the correct point before the body was established. The first priority should have been to sort out the industrial relations area and what the functions of the various grades would be; in other words the management structure should have been got going before the body was set up.  I cannot <Col N="477" /> think of any other company which would become established without some idea of what its management structure would be. As I understand it, FÁS became established first and then looked at its management structure.  It is still doing so. There is a great amount of upheavel among those working there.  They do not know what jobs they will be doing tomorrow, next week or next month or even if they will be working there.  They are not certain in what direction they are going. Although it may not remain in this state of flux, valuable time has been lost in which the development of the proper training courses and schemes for the long-term unemployed could have been worked upon.  It seems that much of this work has been put on the backboiler until the administrative structures have been sorted out.</P>
    <P>I have yet to see a fundamental review of the various schemes.  The Minister refers to a fundamental review of apprenticeship schemes but I do not know where it is going.  He acknowledges that there has been a very antiquated view of apprenticeship over the years and that we must move away from that idea.  What are FÁS and the Department proposing? We are not being told.  Next year, if this Government is in place, we will find ourselves once more debating the Labour Estimate and we will not have any concrete change in an area which is crying out for it.</P>
    <P>Labour market flexibility is something that is upon us.  We must develop that flexibility not just for our own sake but because of the implications of the single market in 1992.  One of the major elements must be the training of our young people in the usual skills, trades and crafts, as well as new ones.  If we continue to stick to antiquated ways of training we will be left behind.  The Minister has a great amount of goodwill in this regard but as in the case of industrial relations, the development of FÁS and the problem of the long-term unemployed, nothing concrete is happening. Many speeches are being circulated with very interesting ideas but that is all.  The mark of effectively spending £126 million <Col N="478" /> in the Department of Labour should be that we are getting value for money, not just talking about it.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly concerned about the problem of the long-term unemployed and the continued growth of the numbers in this category.  I acknowledge that there has been a greater awareness during the past year or six months of the plight of these people and that the social employment scheme, if it were properly operated, could do a lot of good, not just for the long-term unemployed themselves but for the community as a whole.  I would have to agree with Deputy Birmingham when he says it is disgraceful that because one or two unions decide to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the operation of the social employment scheme in certain areas thousands of people are deprived of even part-time occupations, something that would bring them back into contact with the labour market with the possibility of retraining or maintaining existing skills, bringing them further towards getting a job.  This is all the more disgraceful when one considers the success of the scheme in many other areas and the degree of dignity it has given to people who have been unemployed for so long and now see they can play a proper role.</P>
    <P>This problem of the long-term unemployed and the social employment scheme has some bearing on flexibility in the labour market.  The resistance of the unions to allowing the social employment scheme to take effect in some areas is tied up with their view that work consists of the 35, 37 or 40 hour week that is fully socially insured, that is permanent and that has the various protections and rights that go with it.  There is no doubt that we are behindhand in moving to develop new work practices and a new flexibility. There is also no doubt that in the future there will be much more part-time work. It will probably be quite normal for people to have two separate part-time jobs in different areas.  For many people that will be the reality not just because they cannot find a full-time job but because it will suit them.</P>
    <P>This issue of flexibility is one that will be paramount in the next two or three <Col N="479" /> years in particular, in developing labour markets and training and in allowing for the fact that European nationals of other States will be coming to Ireland from 1992 onwards.  They are used to more flexible work practices.  We will have to rethink our attitude to what constitutes work.  It is not good enough to allow 120,000 or 130,000 people to remain outside the stockade of employment.  It is not reasonable to build a stockade around employment that does not allow the long term unemployed inside its borders and that does not allow them to take up any opportunities that might possibly be put their way, that might benefit the community and that might benefit themselves and give them some dignity.  That is indefensible and it simply must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has taken up the part time work and voluntary work ideas that I and others have been speaking about for the last year, and I am delighted that he is doing so. I would also say, following yesterday's Question Time when I questioned him on this matter, he is beginning to acknowledge that availability for work is not the only criterion for receiving social welfare assistance.  That indicates that there is a move towards saying that we simply must redefine our ideas about work.  I ask the Minister to push forward on the various fronts that he has rightly identified need action.  I would expect that, should we be here next year, we will have passed a great deal of legislation and that we will have developed our ideas on flexibility and work practices to a much greater degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Estimate it is worth remembering that, regardless of what decisions are taken and what is said here today, it is unlikely that it will create any jobs.  I am not amused by some of the things I have heard from Deputies Birmingham and Colley and indeed from the Minister.  The role of the Department of Labour has changed considerably since its establishment in as much as a large section of the budget of the Department is taken <Col N="480" /> up with what could be termed as social activities.  They are trying to clear up the mess that the system has created, trying to mobilise people who are victims of the system.  Deputy Birmingham made a sporting analogy as to what he would compare it with and it is certainly not cricket we are taking about but blood sports.  That is the only analogy I can make from what I have heard here today.</P>
      <P>Before I move on to what I originally intended to say, there are some points which were made by Deputies Birmingham and Colley that I feel I have to respond to.  Deputy Birmingham referred to a two-tiered society.  We must ask ourselves why do we have a two-tiered society.  The answer is very simple &mdash; because over 90 per cent of the people in this House have, by their policies, opted for that system.  He also said that the prospect of securing permanent employment in the future is remote.  It certainly is because the main aim of the people who make the decisions is not to create permanent employment but part time employment because they find it cheaper to employ people on a part time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Colley has said, that they cannot afford it.  That is not the truth.  Money is flowing out of the country simply because those who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of creating employment, namely, the private sector, find it more profitable to invest abroad. Yet the three major parties in this House endorse these actions.  The time comes when profit becomes a dirty word.  That is something that is often said to people like myself who are members of parties who are not of the right.  They say that profit is a dirty word in the Labour Party. Profit need not necessarily be a dirty word but it becomes so and it becomes immoral when people are put on the scrap heap so that the people with the money can export their finance to gain 1 per cent or 2 per cent extra in foreign investment.  I welcome the recent call for the repatriation of profits but it has been only a <Col N="481" /> whisper to date.  Until something positive is done about it the Minister for Labour and other Ministers will be charged with the responsibility of trying to introduce remedial action.  This situation arises as a consequence of their own actions.  We need a more fundamental change in society but I do not see any willingness to do that.</P>
      <P>At present there is a major row going on about a rod licence.  People are flowing out of the country by the busload, the boatload and on aeroplanes.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair have record profits and I wonder why.  It is not due to an upsurge in tourist activity but simply because people are going abroad to seek employment. What are we doing about it?  These people are the victims of the system.</P>
      <P>Deputies Birmingham and Colley referred to the unions' attitude towards the social employment scheme.  The social employment scheme is praiseworthy and is doing a job to the best of its ability.  Can you blame the unions if they question some of the scheme that are being put forward and the fact that they are not intended to replace permanent employment?  The trade unions have as much right as the moneyed sector to protect their own interest and that of their members.  The trade unions are far more conscious of the plight of their fellow workers who are being made unemployed than the employers are. Deputy Birmingham also referred to greater flexibility in the labour market. At the rate we are going there will be no labour market.  All that will be left is a flea market because the policies of the Government, supported by the Deputy's party and the Progressive Democrats, are bringing about that situation.  Deputy Colley also referred to the resistance by the trade unions and greater flexibility. Trade unions realise that they have to be flexible in their approach and there is evidence of this right across the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right if the Deputy can identify an area which should be criticised but on the other hand can <Col N="482" /> she say with justification, when there are 250,000 people unemployed, that those in the trade unions have not a right to protect their own interests?  History has proven to them that they have to do so. It is amazing that, according to the Estimate, there has been a 97 per cent plus increase in advertising and publicity. That is a rather frightening figure.  Consultancy services are also on the increase and yet in the social area there have been huge reductions.  Are we carrying out a publicity exercise or are we really concerned about the plight of those in the labour market?</P>
      <P>The present Estimates presented by the Minister for Labour reflect a considerable retreat from the high ground that had been achieved by the previous Administration.  When the Minister took office, he found intact a Bill which provided for the amalgamation of four agencies in the Manpower and training services area.  Because of considerable political pressure that Bill was amended to provide for three agencies which were amalgamated into a body known as FÁS. Despite the fact that it is now nearly 12 months since that legislation was passed, the actual operation of FÁS throughout the country is unequal and uneven.  As regards CERT, we objected to the setting up of that body.  I would like to know if CERT have paid the paltry sum they were supposed to pay, namely, £500,000 for the whole industry of training.  I would like confirmation of this.</P>
      <P>The second area of activity which engaged the Minister was the reform of industrial relations legislation.  Once again he found himself inheriting a legacy of prepared data and, indeed, prepared draft legislation.  However, 15 months after coming into office, he has made little or no progress in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third area of primary concern for the Department of Labour is the safety and health conditions within which workers have to operate and fulfil their contracts of employment.  The Minister inherited the recommendations of the Barrington commission established by his Fianna Fáil predecessor, former Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, which provided for a <Col N="483" /> framework proposal within which a semi-State body would be established to administer in a comprehensive way work and safety legislation under the direction of a semi-State organisation.  When the Minister took office, work on this legislation was considerably advanced.  An interim board had been established by his predecessor and preliminary discussions had taken place between the social partners and officials of his Department on sections of the draft legislation. However, 15 months later it would appear that this work has ground to a halt and slow, or no progress is now the order of the day.</P>
    <P>These are the three main areas that concern any Minister for Labour.  There are, however, other areas of concern which are of considerable importance in political terms.  The first is his relationship with the European Community and the way in which he relates to the Council of Social Affairs Ministers.  This is particularly important having regard to the fact that the structural funds, including the Social Fund, for which the Department of Labour have a direct responsibility are now likely to be dramatically changed following the completion of the legislation in relation to the Single European Act and preparation for 1992.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement by the Taoiseach that the preparation for integrated programmes in the Dublin area and elsewhere is now being organised under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance with a secretariat provided by that Department, is a clear indication that the Department of Labour have lost the battle to France.  This is a retrograde step.  It appears the Department of Finance lord it over every other Department. Unless they have their hands in the pot, nothing happens.</P>
    <P>Secondly, returning to the operation of FÁS and in particular the manipulation and management of the various interventionist measures to boost and maintain employment in a falling labour market, the Minister has failed to maintain the momentum created by the previous Administration in creating a <Col N="484" /> number of initiatives for generating employment.  The State, through creative treatment of the social welfare code, could generate jobs and wealth through a variety of measures.</P>
    <P>The enterprise allowance scheme has not been extended or indexed to provide a current level of incentive for participants coming off the unemployment register who wish to establish their own business.  The rhetoric of the Fianna Fáil Government falls on deaf ears when the placement officers of FÁS, previously the National Manpower Service are required to inform incoming applicants that, if married, they can only obtain £50 per week under the enterprise allowance scheme, a sum similar to what they were entitled to four and a half years ago.  The money set aside for this scheme this year represents a 32 per cent reduction.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme has been abolished and thousands of young people no longer have the necessary start into the industry which was available to them through this programme.  Teamwork has been pegged at its existing level and inflation has curtailed its attractiveness to many young people looking for employment.  There has been a 15 per cent reduction in this area.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme, which was a major breakthrough in terms of harnessing the energies of large numbers of semi-skilled people who had been unemployed for one year or more, remains under-resourced and undermanaged on the direct instructions of this Minister.  A clear and conscious policy dictated by the Department of Finance is clearly now running the Department of Labour.  The take-up of participants in the social employment scheme will be reduced on a successive basis over the next couple of years because of the failure to increase pay rates.  Despite the fulsome praise the Minister for Labour gave to the scheme when it was announced four years ago by the previous Minister for Labour, his actual performance in office in ensuring a constancy of resources and indexation of remuneration is in marked contrast to the attitude he displayed when this scheme was being inaugurated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> Finally, the Minister, despite his frequent protestations of commitment to principles of international solidarity particularly in the area of racial harmony and apartheid, has reneged on a major commitment to funding and support entered into by the last Government.  The previous Government entered into an agreement with an agency of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the International Labour Office to provide a fund to assist in ensuring that a particular programme of education and development would be made available to the South African Congress of Trade Unions for training in office equipment, maintenance and printing techniques.  It was envisaged that this commitment would have a multi-annual dimension.</P>
    <P>The participants who entered into the programme and their sponsors, the South African Congress of Trade Unions, believe that the commitment financed by Ireland and coming through the International Labour Office would run for more than one year.  Accordingly, they were devastated to learn at the end of the first year that the programme had been terminated arbitrarily and that no follow on commitment in terms of funding was available, despite the fact that they were anxious to proceed with an extensive programme of personal development and further education.  The Government should, without hesitation, make all the necessary arrangements to provide for the renewal and continuation of this programme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have covered three departmental areas for which this Minister is responsible and I regret to say he has recorded little progress in all of them, and in some there has been a positive reversal of the momentum he inherited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I want to comment on the adoption of this Estimate for the Department of Labour for the coming year.  One should always welcome expenditure on labour &mdash; in this instance the Department of Labour.  It is especially important that money should be made available in times of high unemployment <Col N="486" /> but what concerns The Workers' Party is that so little is being delivered in return for the money being spent.</P>
      <P>The role of the Department of Labour is becoming more and more crucial in times of massive unemployment when very little impact is being made on the unemployment figures and the training and employment schemes are becoming the real substitute for work and work creation.  I borrow, to some extent, the words the Minister used when he told us Manpower programmes cannot and should not be equated with real jobs, to say that what the labour force want is real employment, not training schemes, not Manpower schemes, and not schemes of limited range and duration.  Jobs are what are needed, what are being demanded, and what have so often been so cynically promised but rarely delivered.</P>
      <P>In the context of that demand for real jobs and the preservation of existing jobs, the trade union movement have little difficulty in justifying &mdash; and as a member of The Workers' Party I have no difficulty in justifying &mdash; their attitude and approach to social employment schemes. As with Deputy O'Sullivan, I stand four square behind them in the position and approach they take.  I am sure the Minister will take the opportunity, when responding to any ill-informed and narrow criticism of him, to agree that the trade union movement contribute very positively and constructively to the development of these programmes in very difficult circumstances.  Deputies do not have any regard for the pressures on trade union leaders and representatives who are trying to advance, even in a limited way, these schemes in co-operation with the Government.</P>

      <P>I appreciate their response and their co-operation in this area.  The Minister said we should never equate Manpower programmes with real jobs.  He went on to refer to one of the perceived major job creation projects at the Custom House Docks site.  We must put that into perspective.  It helps to illustrate more than anything else the limited gains being achieved by the Government in the area of job creation due to overreliance on the Manpower training schemes.</P>
      <P>Recently two constituents of mine who live only a matter of miles from that project were advised by FÁS that they could put their names on the register and indicate their preference to work on the Custom House Docks project but they were also told very directly and honestly by the new Government information unit that their prospects were virtually nil. There was a reference in the letter to preference for local area employment with regard to such recruitment.  The Custom House Docks site scheme was introduced and presented as a major development for the city of Dublin and a source of great employment in the city. However, we are now facing the reality. Workers living a short bus ride away from this great development, who pass it on a daily, or weekly basis if they can afford only to go once a week to Gardiner Street labour exchange, are now being told it does not offer any prospect of employment or training for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two gentlemen whom I have mentioned went directly to the developer on site to ask if they could be considered for employment.  He said that the matter was out of his hands which is, I understand, the way the scheme works.  He complains that the referrals by FÁS are not suitable for his needs.  I would not be so unkind <Col N="488" /> as to suggest that because the development is within the Minister's own constituency the decision is limited geographically, but I would ask him to look again at the definition of preference for local labour, because the net is being kept a little too narrow.  One must have regard to the massive extent of unemployment existing right across the north city area where there were real expectations of some prospect of employment on that scheme.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government in regard to emigration, in particular of our young unemployed people, is a matter of major concern.  This aspect has been touched on by each of the previous speakers so far today.  The views and comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs will haunt the Government all the days of their term in office.  It is a strong reminder that this Government consider the unemployed to be a burden, a problem which must be shifted on, by whatever means or device.  Welfare schemes are to be welcomed and no-one would criticise the relevant allowance in the Estimates.  The least that we can do, having forced these people to move abroad seeking work, is to ensure that they have basic minimum rights in the countries to which they are obliged to go.  There is a much stronger attitude running through Government which has been detected, perhaps more abroad, in statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This has recently manifested itself in the Government's own agency.  The Minister for Social Welfare told the House on 26 April last &mdash; and I quote from the Official Report, column 1931:</P>
    <P>FÁS do not, in fact, display advertisements for persons to apply for jobs in Britain. </P>
    <P>In fact, that is not so.  I want to paraphrase a letter dated 12 May on FÁS headed notepaper, to the effect that they had been notified by a company in Clonmel &mdash; which I shall not name for obvious reasons &mdash; of a number of overseas vacancies for electricians commencing on Monday, 16 May 1988.  They stated that the work would commence in the United <Col N="489" /> Kingdom and the persons employed then would be transferred to construction sites in Belgium and Holland.  A 70-hour work week was stipulated and the rate of remuneration for qualified electricians would be £4.30 sterling per hour, with an accommodation allowance of £86.80 sterling also payable.  Third or fourth year apprentices would be paid at a reduced rate.  People were given a contact name and number for further information.  That was displayed at a local FÁS unemployment centre on their headed notepaper, advising the unemployed youth of Clonmel that if they want work they can find it in the UK to start with and then they can go to Belgium and Holland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This illustrates yet again an attitude which is rife throughout the Government, although this is often denied and the Government have sought to dissociate themselves from it.  It is an appalling attitude which cannot be condoned. It amounts to a betrayal of our young people.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the whole area of industrial relations.  An acknowledgment must be written into the record today of a welcome decrease in the number of days lost due to strikes, the lowest level for many a year.  The Minister must be congratulated on his role in the solution of many industrial disputes that have arisen, in the ESB, CIE, the Dublin Fire Brigade.  These are a few that immediately come to mind.  It shows a willingness by all parties, when avenues of negotiation are available and used fully, to help to resolve any dispute in the labour market by discussion and constructive involvement on the part of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I remind the House of a very unfortunate dispute which has been taking place since 21 March, that at the Irish Printed Circuits Limited plant here in Dublin &mdash; a dispute which, unbelievably, has run so long simply because <Col N="490" /> of the refusal of management to recognise a trade union and give it the right to negotiate on behalf of a wrongly dismissed worker.  It is incredible that the proprietor is a former executive of the Industrial Development Authority.  That is an Authority who have done much to develop good trade union relationships and expand trade union involvement and it is a great pity to see one of their departed lieutenants adopting this outdated, 19th century attitude to labour relations.  It is also worth reminding the House that this is a company that have received in excess of £500,000 in grants from the Government and have an application pending for a similar amount.  I ask the Government, through the Minister, to put a stop on that investment by our taxpayers until such time as attitudes become somewhat more reasonable regarding this dispute.  I ask all those concerned to support the mass picket being held tomorrow at the premises, in the hope of bringing management quickly to their senses.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to raise in the short time left to me is in the area of discrimination against women in the workplace and, in particular, in the training schemes operated by the Minister. The Minister knows this issue by heart and, as he told us on the last occasion, has answered this question so often.  However, the matter will be raised until this anomaly is addressed.  It is of the 10,500 women, merely the tip of the iceberg, who sign on on a weekly basis but not being in receipt of income are automatically excluded from employment in the social employment schemes. How many more women simply do not go to the bother of signing on who could and should sign on?  We are taking about many thousands of women who would be and are willing to take part in these schemes but, because of what I consider to be a glaring anomaly, they are automatically not considered.  As I have already said, the Minister has told us that he has answered this question so often that he knows the answer by heart, but that is not good enough.  We will raise <Col N="491" /> this issue again and again until this rather invidious discrimination against women is addressed and the arguments about cost have been put aside in favour of a more enlightened approach in the interests of fairness and equality in the work place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's very strong remarks on equality in the workplace I am arguing on their behalf.  This is one small invidious discrimination which particularly militates against women.  I would like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to make what I consider to be pertinent remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McCartan at the conclusion of his contribution referred to some of the discriminations against women in the workplace.  I take the point which the Minister made that it is not only women who are affected in this case, but I would like to think that the same arguments which are being used by all of the Members of this House in this case would be used in regard to the other discriminations against women in the workplace, not just in respect of the social employment scheme.  That may be one glaring anomaly but the most glaring anomaly of all is the acceptance in these days of recession that women should not have equal job opportunities and that it is considered almost anti-social to provide them with any support or resources to enable them to carry out their duties, if they have a job in the first place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly and I will refer to that in a few moments.  First of all, I would like to refer to what the Minister said in his speech.  He said, and I particularly welcome this, that the combination of resources within FÁS should also give <Col N="492" /> added impetus to planning for equal opportunities and that, building on the initiatives pursued by their forerunners, the new streamlined authority are to bring forward an integrated action programme identifying opportunities for positive action.  I would like to turn that language around a bit to read that FÁS must give an impetus to planning for equal opportunities.  I would also like to think that FÁS will bring forward an integrated action programme identifying opportunities for positive action because I think, and the Minister may agree with me, that there have not been up to now a great number of integrated action programmes identifying opportunities for positive action.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us if notices have gone out to all the officials who work within FÁS, particularly in the employment offices, that specific questions being asked of women which would not be asked of men are no longer acceptable and that there should be no stereotyping of roles?  Again and again I hear that such an approach is not part of the working programmes of a great number of offices. The Minister also said that he has been urging employers to recognise that our provision for training and development at company level is too narrow, too little and for too few.  At present we are planning for the competition which we will face in an integrated Europe and this is all the more reason why we should make sure that not only are we keeping up with the rest of the countries of Europe, but that we are surpassing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing to note that only 5.5 per cent of all employees have received some training.  This figure is taken from an 1986 labour force survey for Ireland. Can the Minister tell us whether there is any breakdown of that figure of 5.5 per cent available in terms of how many men and how many women received training? In a recent television programme it was pointed out that many British companies, in particular those which traditionally would have been described as male companies &mdash; Britain has been mentioned as having a higher level of training and development &mdash; have discovered that <Col N="493" /> management and industrial relations which are inextricably linked have improved beyond expectation through the introduction of women supervisors and women in management.  Development managers within these companies are now arguing that the potential of women which has been wasted on the factory floor for so long should be developed and that some of their characteristics should be integrated into the male development programme.  I am not chauvinistic enough to argue one sex over the other, but it is appropriate that we should look at this area.  I am convinced that, if we brought more of those characteristics into the area of industrial relations and had a more equitable distribution of management skills, we would put an end once and for all to many of the difficulties which we are experiencing at present.</P>
    <P>One thing which I am always reminded of is that no matter how justifiable a strike is, it is the employees who lose out at the end of the day, not just financially but also psychologically.  I ask the Minister to take this dimension on board in drawing up national development programmes. I note that the Minister appointed an advisory committee on management training in July 1987 which he has asked to report by June of this year.  We are all looking forward to the publication of that report.  If we find that women have been excluded yet again I have no doubt that several of us will be making our views known.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to give us a breakdown of the ESF assistance which we have received?  We are all aware that there is going to be a doubling of these funds between now and 1992 and that the total amount of ESF assistance which we have received since 1973 exceeds £890 million.  Is any breakdown of that figure available and can the Minister tell us how much of that assistance has gone into the training of men and women?  What concerns me, and what I know concerns the Minister, is that there is not the same level of participation by women in apprenticeship of training courses as men and, in this context, I <Col N="494" /> welcome the fact that FÁS have set up one positive action programme which is attempting to introduce women to higher technological training courses.</P>
    <P>We have had equal employment opportunity legislation here since 1977. Since then most of the new technological industries have been established here. While there had been a tremendous difference between the earnings of men and women and the number of supervisory management staff in traditional industries it was all the more shocking to learn that the ICTU and Employment Equality Agency reported that there had been no change in that discrimination against women, that the gap that existed in traditional industries remains in the new technological ones.  We must not neglect to redress that discrimination.  I contend that a large amount of the extra moneys from the European Social Fund should be utilised on positive programmes to ensure that such discrimination against women is not perpetrated in new industries being established here.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge and recognise the new FÁS training course entitled New Technology for Women and also a recent management training course run by RTE specifically for women on their staff.  Through rigorous interviewing they discovered many potential skills among women at lower levels which could be deployed at management level. Accordingly, they ran this specific management course for them.  The Minister and his Department might monitor that course in order to ascertain whether it yielded the desired results.  If it proved to be successful it might well constitute a model or blueprint which the Minister could direct be adopted by other companies. I note that there were 40 places available for women on the FÁS training course and that there were over 800 applicants. This would seem to prove the need for an extension of such training course.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the legislation proposed with regard to safety and health in the workplace.  We are inclined to forget that work is about much more than mere money; it also has to do very much with the security, safety and health of <Col N="495" /> workers.  It is also shocking to realise that, even with the huge strides and changes that have taken place in regard to labour and labour relations, it is more than 50 years since some of our labour legislation has been reformed.  Probably that is the reason there are such difficulties still being encourtered in the workplace.</P>
    <P>One cannot speak about employment without referring also to the whole problem of unemployment.  I should like to think that all parties in this House would concentrate on the recent Fine Gael policy for a basic income for all workers over 18 years of age.  Such a policy and its proper implementation would remove the stigma attached to unemployment, eliminate much wasteful bureaucracy and prevent the marginalisation of people who do no to appear to be contributing in a meaningful way, whereas it should be recognised that voluntary or part time contributions are of tremendous importance.</P>
    <P>We must examine the whole structure of employment to ensure that it is more flexible, allows for job sharing, in turn ensuring that, within households, work will be shared equally, so that people can work inside and outside the home in a way that will reap the same income but in a more shared and equal manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying that equality of opportunity does not mean merely the absence of discrimination.  It is that vacuum that must be filled and in respect of which there must be positive action taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the spokespersons and other Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I will endeavour to utilise the short time available to me to answer some of the queries raised.  I do not propose to go into a debate on what I may have said last year or the conditions obtaining when I took office in the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last year I have spoken about three or four areas needing to be tackled. It must be acknowledged that, in the <Col N="496" /> conditions prevailing in this House at present, one cannot do things without the co-operation of the Opposition spokespersons. I sought that co-operation last year on the establishment of FAS and the processing of the relevant legislation &mdash; which had been introduced at very short notice at the end of a session &mdash; so that we might be given an opportunity to begin the work in the remaining six months of last year.  We received that co-operation. FÁS has been established, not without many difficulties; there would be no point in saying otherwise.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge many of Deputy Colley's remarks.  She demonstrated that she is well briefed on many internal controversies and arguments.  She is correct in that there was much controversy of one kind or another which arose in the period when the interim board was established on 30 September.  I agree with Deputies who said it was a pity that all of the necessary preparatory work was not undertaken in advance.  I would have to admit that it was not done.  However, that would not have justified delaying the establishment of the board because, had that not been done, we could not have commenced our work.  However, one would acknowledge that, in more normal circumstances, one would go about it in a different manner.  The organisation had to be established, its board and management structures set up, so as to get on with the various activities called for. Considerable progress has been made in the meantime.  For example, the regional structure is now fully in place, a much different type of structure reduced from approximately ten tiers to three.  This means that the appropriate personnel now meet members of the public more readily than was the case under the old, larger-tiered structure.  Again is has to be acknowledged that many of the agreements, practices and so on obtaining were not satisfactory to modern management. There had to be negotiation with the various unions involved with a view to ensuring that progress was made.</P>
    <P>Deputies Colley and Birmingham asked if there would be a review of the operations of FÁS carried out at an early <Col N="497" /> date.  I should say that working groups involving the people concerned were established back in January and February last.  These groups have reported on what they see as being necessary to eliminate duplication and integrate programmes. For example, there is a working group concerned with apprenticeship who will report fully by the end of the year.  It would appear they will recommend fairly fundamental changes, which will be implemented.  We have initiated a pilot scheme for the rationalisation of the business enterprise programmes.  There are now different attitudes to and work practices being engaged in with regard to a number of other schemes.</P>
    <P>I might mention also the worker participation and offshore safety legislation processed in the course of the year.  I think we shall have enacted three Acts. There are also a number of orders, for example, those in respect of women's night work and insolvency.  There is also the management review committee, probably better known as the Galvin Committee.  It has been confirmed that they will report on target, incorporating a major review of management practices. I should like to acknowledge the commitment of the members of the Galvin Committee, particularly that of Mr. Paddy Galvin, the Chairman, who, in conjunction with his fellow members, has done a tremendous job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham will be glad to hear that his suggestion about good ideas will be taken up by FÁS and within FÁS a new section has been set up to deal with co-operatives.  This will be announced tomorrow.  The section has a separate budget, separate people and it is a separate organisation.  It takes time to do that but it will be there.   FÁS set up their own agency to sell their services.  This has been in operation for two months and is achieving considerable success.  CERT, in selling their own services and trying to bring in income, are having considerable success.  This was dealt with in the part of my script that I did not get to.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of the Barrington legislation.  The Department were far from having a Bill <Col N="498" /> ready when I took office, but I am now on the final draft of the Bill.  I said before that it is unfair to suggest that anyone dealing with that legislation was dragging his feet.  I believe everyone has worked extremely hard, but it is extremely complex legislation.  Deputy Birmingham and others who have first-hand knowledge of it would know that.  This morning the Attorney General and officials are still working on some sections where there are still major difficulties.  Deputy Birmingham mentioned before that when the Bill comes before the House it will have to go to Committee because it is also technical.  They are trying very hard at a technical level to clear as many amendments as possible.</P>
    <P>A review of the Payment of Wages Act is completed.  We now have proposals for the social partners and we are making progress on it within the Department. Last year I said we would start the process of putting together our views on industrial relations and that we would have it done by Christmas.  We would then enter into talks with the social partners which would be completed by the 30 May. There was some delay which was not the fault of the Department of Labour or the social partners.  The final meeting has taken place and I hope we will be going to the Government within a matter of two to three weeks.</P>
    <P>The review of the conditions of employment is finished and a very bulky presentation on all of the Acts has been produced.  The Department officials and the unions dealing with this have highlighted clearly the areas where changes should take place.  We are going to proceed with that.</P>
    <P>During the year we had an awareness campaign on emigration.  We issued booklets which were acknowledged by all Deputies in the House to be of value.  We work in conjunction with DÍON and with FÁS trainees.  Deputy Birmingham will be glad to hear that a scheme which he initiated was suitably acknowledged by Fr. Scully in London on Wednesday when I was there for the opening of a centre for the elderly.  The Deputy's contribution is <Col N="499" /> not forgotten.  Work is proceeding and quite a lot is happening in that area.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Clubs greatly acknowledge the support of all parties in this House.  They are continuing to make great strides.  People are inclined to talk about all the negative things about emigration but the federation are stronger than ever.  The are more active than ever and are making a great impact.  I am sure that it was noticed that the European Commissioner for Social Affairs Mr. Marin was here yesterday.  We had talks at great length with the Department of Labour and the Department of Education. We have members of the Department in Europe who deal with the European Social Fund almost on a permanent basis.  Our interests are being well served.</P>
    <P>There is a joint group of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour dealing with the issue of the long term unemployed.  They are trying to do what Deputy Colley has been continually suggesting, and I acknowledge her contribution over the past 12 months.  I am glad people acknowledge that small things have been done during the past year for the long term unemployed, particularly the increase in the budget.  Whatever about the negative effects of Jobsearch, it genuinely helps the long term unemployed, all the surveys to date said that.</P>
    <P>The structure and programmes of FÁS have all been reviewed.  The apprenticeship scheme and the enterprise scheme have all been examined and reviewed and a great deal of progress has been made in this area.</P>

      <P>The final meetings between the Hotel Federation and the chairman and members of the staff of CERT are either completed or to be completed in the next few days.  There is agreement on the level of contribution for the most part.  However, I believe the actual amount of money has not been <Col N="500" /> agreed yet.  CERT are quite satisfied they will get a contribution.  If they do not, a decision was taken last July that the Government will cut the services that CERT provide.  Deputy O'Sullivan is right.  The industry only contributed £15,000 out of a total budget of £5 million. A Government order of July 1987 demanded that they must pay their contribution. It may be hard for some of the organisations to accept that but the matter is being pursued and will be implemented.  The Government's decision will have to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to development aid, but he was misinformed. There is no commitment to funding for a continuing period.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that I met with Mr. Norushe of the South African Trade Union Congress last week.  He appreciates the work that was done by the FÁS trainees and asked us to look at further programmes.  I agreed to pursue the matter with the new subsidiary, FÁS and I will raise the matter of bilateral aid with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I will raise it also at the ILO conference in Geneva in some weeks time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan raised a number of points but I will refer only to two.  I will deal with the question of youth employment. The youth groups around the country made some criticism of FÁS and said that they do not use the service.  Whether we like it or not, our young people are European-minded.  People ten or 15 years younger have a different view.  When I attend conferences up and down the country the youth tell me that when we joined the EC, the free movement of labour was one of the prime attractions, and FÁS are not involved in promoting European schemes.  They say there is a system to advertise various opportunities in Europe and why are we not using it? That is coming from the young people themselves.  Rather than taking the negative view, we should look at the opportunities that are out there in Europe.  Our young people are going abroad and they want us to give them the information. This is a point we have to consider.  I hate the idea of helping people to go abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> You are immediately accused of advertising wholesale emigration.  That is not what I am doing.  Articulate, educated young people are telling me they want to go to Europe.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barnes questioned the opportunities for women.  I have a great deal of information which I can give the Deputy but I do not have the time now. However we will consult with the Deputy.  I did not have an opportunity in my speech to mention the Great Southern Hotel group.  The hotels and CERT are referred to in the text.</P>
      <P>Disagreement between myself and the Labour Court was referred to.  The matter concerned discussion documents which they wished to raise with me but which were issued to the press almost before I had seen them.  I acknowledge the great work the Labour Court do, and have done since 1946.  Naturally any suggestions they make will be taken on board before we finalise matters with other interest groups.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that I have not got more time as I have many more issues to raise.  Finally I thank the spokespersons and the Deputies who have contributed to the debate for their comments and criticism.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy and Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,156,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister for Communications and certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The net Communications Estimate amounts to £2,156,000.  The gross expenditure amounts to £52,333,000 of which £50,177,000 is met from Appropriations-in-aid. Virtually all receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid are derived from broadcasting and cable television licence fees which, net of my Department's administration costs are paid to RTE by way of grants-in-aid and to An Post to cover that company's costs of collecting television licence fees.  The size of the net estimate does not reflect the relative importance of the role of my Department in the activities for which it exercises responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efficient, cost effective and reliable communications facilities are a necessity for the economic life of this country. Everywhere, worldwide significant <Col N="503" /> employment growth is foreseen in service industries.  These industries depend for their life blood on the availability of the communications facilities of the highest quality.  In many instances the quality and cost of communications facilities is the key factor in the decision-making process affecting the location of industrial activity.  In this dynamic and cut-throat environment top class Irish communications facilities are essential if the Government are to achieve their job creation targets.</P>
    <P>The objectives set for the postal and telecommunications companies established under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, are demanding in a country of our size, population base and spread.  An Post are charged with providing a national postal service within the State and between the State and elsewhere, and with meeting the industrial, commercial, social and household needs of the State for comprehensive and efficient postal services. Telecom Éireann likewise are charged with a similar objective in relation to the telecommunications service.  Both companies, in the four years since their establishment have come a long way towards meeting the objectives set for them.  But much remains to be done particularly in containing and reducing communications costs to industry.  I will refer to this later.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week we debated the Second Stage of a Private Members' Bill whose aim is to improve the public accountability of the two companies in respect of their achievement of the obligations set for them in the existing legislation. I said in the course of that debate that while I agreed with the aims of the Bill, I did not believe that the detailed proposals in the Bill would achieve the result desired by Deputy Bruton.  I do not propose to go over the same ground again but I think it is worthwhile to highlight the performance of the two companies.</P>
    <P>Since they took responsibility for the telecommunications service in January 1984 Telecom Éireann have gone from strength to strength and will report a profit for the financial year just ended.  I <Col N="504" /> am particularly pleased that in addition to returning a profit this year, the company also repaid, ahead of schedule, part of their indebtedness to the Exchequer. This shows the dedication of the company to their goal of eliminating accumulated losses and becoming a profitable self-financing company and reflects the contribution of the staff at all levels to the well-being of the company.</P>
    <P>The automation of Ireland's telephone network has now been completed.  With the closure of the last manual exchange in Mountshannon last year, the country now has a fully automatic telephone system.  A total of 750,000 subscribers are connected to the network.  All of them can dial direct to any part of Ireland and to over 84 countries worldwide.  With operator assistance telephone access is available to over 120 more.  The technical quality of the network has been transformed. With nearly 50 per cent of customers connected to digital exchanges, Ireland is currently among the most advanced technologically in the world.</P>
    <P>At the practical level the waiting list for installation of telephones has now been reduced to such an extent that almost 60 per cent of applicants can be provided with telephone service within three months of application.  The quality of service subsequently provided has improved to the extent that a subscriber can expect to have a fault on the line not more than once in about two years. Almost 80 per cent of faults are now cleared within two working days.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann are fully conscious of the need not only to provide their customers with a service using the most advanced technology but of the need to provide that service in the most costeffective manner.  To this end, they will be introducing major price reductions later this year.  The call charge to EC countries and Switzerland will be reduced by 20 per cent.  Calls to North America will cost 25 per cent less and a 30 per cent reduction will be effected on calls to Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. It is perhaps timely to remind the House <Col N="505" /> that there has been no increase in telephone charges since April 1986.  I am confident that this development will provide a welcome boost to our economic recovery.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the company's relations with their customers. The Ombudsman has referred to over 2,000 complaints received by him against Telecom Éireann.  This is a large number of complaints in anybody's books and I am sure the company will accept that this number must be reduced significantly. However, to put the number into perspective, on a subscriber base of 750,000 it means that well under 0.3 per cent of subscribers feel they have a grievance. Most complaints refer to the accounts issued by the company.  Telecom are acutely aware of the need to improve the public's confidence in their billing system and have planned to introduce detailed billing for STD calls at a cost of £20 million during this year.</P>
    <P>Telecom's capital allocation for the current year is £135 million compared with £127 million in 1987.  The allocation will be used mainly to improve the quality of service, to provide for business growth and to exploit new business opportunities. This allocation will be funded by the company from non-Exchequer sources. The money will be found partly from BTE's own resources and partly by borrowing through the company's financial subsidiary, Irish Telecommunications Investments plc.</P>
    <P>In addition, funds will be available to the company from the European Regional Fund and under the EC STAR programme.</P>
    <P>The aim of the STAR programme is to foster the economic development of the least favoured regions of the Community by improving advanced telecommunications services.  Ireland was allocated 50 million ECUs, approximately £38.8 million, over the five-year period 1987-1991.  Of this amount Telecom Éireann will receive £33 million.  The money will be spent on projects which include the extension of EIRCELL, the company's cellular radio mobile telephone network to less densely populated <Col N="506" /> areas, an optical fibre link between Portmarnock and Holyhead and the provision of a new national radio paging system. To date £5.2 million has been received under the STAR programme.</P>
    <P>To turn to postal matters, I am pleased to say that 1987 was a particularly successful year for the company making a profit of £2.776 million.  The volume of mail handled by An Post continued to increase last year.  Total mail volume is now 16 per cent higher than when An Post commenced operations in 1984.  The company are achieving particular success in their express mail service.</P>
    <P>Irish postal charges are high by international standards.  However, there has been no increase in charges since March 1986 and as a result, those charges now compare more favourably with the postal charges of other EC countries.  Our charges now occupy fourth place in the EC league table, as compared with first and second places in 1985.  In real terms our postal charges have been reduced by 8 per cent over the past four years.  In addition, I am glad to be in a position to state that the Irish postal charges will be maintained at existing levels at least to the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>The level of our postage charges reflects the costs which An Post have to bear.  The company's medium-term strategy is to become more competitive and to reorganise their structures to meet the challenges of the future.  An Post have introduced a self-financing staff productivity scheme in which the company and staff share in the benefits.  A major management restructuring was begun last year by An Post aimed at decentralising responsibilities with a view to achieving greater efficiency in meeting customer needs.</P>
    <P>The parcel mail service has been a problem for some time, with falling traffic and significant financial losses.  Last year the loss on the service was £5.6 million. An Post have drawn up a plan to resolve the problem.  It is the company's objective to build a profitable parcels service that recognises the needs of customers for speed, convenience and cost efficiency.  If the company should fail in their efforts, <Col N="507" /> the company will be faced with no alternative but to seriously consider discontinuing the service.  However, given the outstanding success of An Post in other areas to date, I am hopeful that the company will succeed in reversing the unfavourable trend and in returning the service to an economic basis.</P>
    <P>Last year An Post carried out capital development in relation to the improvement of accommodation, the replacement of their motor fleet, the provision of security measures and the acquisition of machinery and equipment, costing £8.67 million.  The funds were provided from the company's internal resources and borrowings and there was no Exchequer assistance involved.  The company still has a healthy debt ratio 1:5, with their borrowings now amounting to £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>The share capital of the company includes £4 million provided by the Exchequer by way of 5 per cent cumulative preference shares.  The accumulated dividends due to the Exchequer on these shares will amount to almost £500,000 at the end of 1988.  I intend to seek payment of dividends from An Post in the financial year 1989 subject to continued satisfactory financial performance in their current financial year.</P>
    <P>At the end of April RTE hosted the Eurovision Song Contest for the third time.  I have already conveyed to RTE my own and the Government's appreciation and admiration for a task carried out with the ultimate in professionalism and using technology that is at the leading edge. It is only right that our appreciation is recorded in the report of this House.  I am sure my colleagues on all sides of the House will wish to be associated with my expressions of gratitude and appreciation. The production team involved radically altered the traditional format of the programme and attracted record audience levels here at home, clearly appealing to all sections of our population.  They have presented an unenviable challenge to next year's host.  As they say in show business, follow that.  Not alone did RTE once again show the world the facility <Col N="508" /> and imagination with which Irish people can handle the latest technology but they showed to the world the real face of Ireland, a face that is all too often distorted in the media through the violence that has plagued our island for far too long.  I am confident that RTE's presentation of the Eurovision Song Contest will contribute enormously to the achievement of our targets for tourist business this year.</P>
    <P>While I have highlighted RTE's achievements in televising the Eurovision Song Contest, this is in no way meant to belittle the performance of RTE radio. Through their three national services they have provided a comprehensive service over the years of high quality news, current affairs and entertainment.</P>
    <P>RTE's total output is comparable in quality with the best in the world and is achieved at a fraction of the cost of that of our nearest neighbour.  I have no doubt that RTE will be able to meet with total confidence the challenges presented by forthcoming broadcasting developments.</P>
    <P>A provision of £43,858,000 has been included in my Department's Estimate for the payment of a grant-in-aid to RTE in respect of net receipts from television licence fees.  This again represents an increased grant-in-aid over 1987 and reflects an anticipated improvement in television licence sales by An Post.  Subhead G of the Estimate provides for a payment of £5,062,000 to An Post in respect of the cost of collecting the licence fees.  The task of issuing television licences, collecting television licence fees and detecting and prosecuting licence fee evaders was delegated to An Post following the establishment of the company in January 1984.  An Post and RTE liaise closely with one another in an attempt to secure the maximum possible number of licence sales.  Ambitious targets for licence sales have been set for An Post over the past three years and I am glad to say that they have managed to achieve the required number of sales each year. Sales have increased by 100,000 per annum since An Post took over the work in January 1984.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless evasion continues at an <Col N="509" /> unacceptably high rate.  Estimates suggest that the evasion rate in recent years may have been of the order of 20 per cent.  However, An Post's performance in 1987 should have made inroads on that figure.  The completion of the computerisation of householders' records by An Post and the enactment of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, which substantially increases the penalties for TV licence evasion, will help to combat evasion in the future.</P>
    <P>RTE's financial results over the past couple of years have been very encouraging. In particular, the posting of a surplus of £9.5 million in the 15-month period to end of December 1987 is a tremendous achievement and all at RTE must be congratulated.  RTE must continue to show good profits, however, if they are to provide for their capital requirements and meet the programming needs of their audience.  The broadcasting environment in which they have to operate is becoming more and more competitive.  Additional services on cable and satellite are all contributing to a more competitive situation for RTE and they have responded well.</P>
    <P>The station very quickly identified the way forward as being the introduction of more and more home-produced programmes in their schedules.  This goal was tackled with an intensity and enthusiasm which augurs well for the station.  The popularity of RTE's home productions proves that the national broadcasting organisation can meet the challenge presented by the proliferation of new services.</P>
    <P>Subhead F2 provides for a grant of £1,740,000 to RTE in respect of net receipts from licence fees on cable television systems.  The estimate was prepared on the basis of a licence fee of 15 per cent.  I have recently made regulations reducing the fee to 5 per cent. The reasoning behind this decision is to provide a modest financial boost to the cable industry to encourage the investment necessary to upgrade systems to be able to carry a greater range of programme services.  In accordance with the general thrust of the recommendation of <Col N="510" /> the Cable Systems Committee, the receipts from cable licence fees will be retained by the Exchequer from 1990 onwards.</P>
    <P>Deputies will all be aware that the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, has been introduced to this House and that the Second Stage debate on the Bill has concluded. I have circulated amendments to the Bill, the main thrust of which is to provide for the establishment of an Authority to select radio station operators and to oversee and regulate the programme services provided by the operator.  The Authority will be known as the Independent Radio and Television Commission and their ambit will embrace the selection of the programme contractor for the new independent television service and the regulation of its output. Extensive amendments are required to give effect to these changes.  These amendments have been circulated together with an informal document setting out the text of the Bill as it would look if these amendments were accepted by the House.  I would stress that this document in no way prejudices any decisions the Dail may take in relation to the Bill as passed on Second Stage.  As the House will have an opportunity to debate the issues involved fully next week I do not propose to take up the time of the House on this matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>At EC level discussions have been taking place with a view to drawing up a directive laying down minimum standards in relation to programme content and advertising to facilitate the free flow of television broadcasts between the member states.  The need for such a directive stems from the development in recent years of broadcasting services which are clearly targeted at international audiences and are delivered via satellite.  The number of such services will grow in the future and it is clearly desirable that all such services should be required to meet minimum standards.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe is working on a draft Convention with a similar intent which would apply to the wider membership of that body.  My Department, in consultation with RTE, are actively <Col N="511" /> involved in the deliberations of both bodies on these issues.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by expressing my appreciation to the boards and staff of the three bodies under my aegis and to the Secretary and staff of my Department for their commitment and dedication to achieving the tasks set and I look forward to their continuing success in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address briefly the issue of the Broadcasting Bill which is currently before the House.  The Minister's change of heart in respect of many of the important issues in the Bill is very welcome but I am worried that it betrays a certain lack of clarity of thinking about policy in the area that he should have come into the House with such a strange proposal in the first place.  Even with the present changes, further changes are needed in light of the fact that he is changing the scale of the proposal by tacking on television to his Bill at this stage.</P>
      <P>A very worrying feature of his proposal is that the new television station will not be similarly constrained, as are RTE, to refrain from expressing editorial views. Anyone could see that a large commercial organisation who control the sole commercial television station in the country should not have the freedom to express their views on controversial issues of the day.  We could end up getting a clearly partisan &mdash; and not necessarily politically partisan &mdash; statement on controversial issues emanating from a station who had been given a monopoly by the State to operate in the commercial field. That would be highly dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly there is need for improvement in other areas of the Bill which we will have adequate time to discuss next Wednesday.  Just to flag them in advance we would, in the case of monopoly television going out, need to see details of the applications publicly provided so that the public in general can see the sort of programming that is on offer.  That is an important element of pressure on the <Col N="512" /> station not only to perform subsequently in conformity with the sort of statement they made at the time of application.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the issue of the Minister's proposal on the microwave multichannel distribution system.  There is, as the Minister knows, growing concern about this proposal.  I am sure he knows the arguments that are being rehearsed.  I will just summarise the main ones that are being made to me and other Members of the House.  They are that 30 per cent of the country will remain uncovered by this system, that it does not have the capacity because of its line of sight technology to cover the whole country and we will need UHF deflectors in the isolated pockets anyhow if we are to get full cover.  It is also pointed out that in the UK the MMDS is only used in very special situations and generally it is confined to an interim provision for cable networks where they plan to cable the area anyhow; it is, if one likes, a system of getting in a bit of revenue to the cable company to help finance that high cost. The UK seems to take the view that satellites will anyway supersede this technology.</P>
    <P>It has also been argued that the RTE transmission system has considerable spare capacity that would allow it to carry Ireland's needs for further channels without this system.  The Minister seems to be proceeding with his decision at breakneck speed and has invited applications, although he has not circulated any of the regulations that will be applied, but it is only fair that before regulations are put in place and the House is asked to acquiesce in those that the Minister should publish from his Department an appraisal of these various options and an assessment of the issues being raised by people who are concerned about this.  As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there has even been a health concern raised about this.  It is important that these issues be addressed in a cold and objective manner so that everyone can see that a fair deal is being done in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to another issue that the Minister mentioned in the course of his comments, that is, his decision to <Col N="513" /> cut the levy on cable and his decision not to allow the proceeds of that to go back to the consumer but back to the cable companies themselves.  I cannot see the rationale in this at all.  The Minister will know that the Cablelink's profits have grown very rapidly, considerably faster than inflation, in recent years.  They have a high rate of profit on turnover.  The consumer, when this merger was agreed, expected great rationalisation gains that would bring down the cost of cable to the subscriber.  In fact, we have seen no such reduction; cable subscriptions have grown in line with inflation.  I cannot see the rationale of the Minister giving this levy to the cable companies.  He is right to abolish the levy and I think he should do away with it altogether, not go threequarters or two-thirds of the way there, but I certainly see no grounds for giving it to the cable companies.  It should go to the consumer who has to pay, and if the companies want to make application for price increases on grounds of some new investment plans, they have to run the normal course of getting approval from the Minister.  I do not like this backdoor approach to such price applications.</P>
    <P>In the post and telecommunications area I must say that I am frankly very disappointed with the Minister's attitude in this area.  He has shown a continuous opposition to the interests of customers. Not only did he abolish the users councils at minute savings to the Exchequer &mdash; they were costing £80,000 on a turnover for the bodies they were overseeing of £700 million and even that was not a net saving &mdash; but he has also gone back on a commitment given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House that he would make those two companies amenable to section 39 of the Sale of Goods land Supply of Services Act.  The Minister produced a rationale for that last week in the House which does not hold water in any way.  No court could reasonably take the ground that a company like An Post would have to go through the sort of procedure that he recited here in the House last Wednesday.  The Minister appears to be determined to play down the rights of the <Col N="514" /> consumer and he is pretending that the level of complaint going to the Ombudsman is of something less than great significance by saying it is only .3 per cent of all bills.  The truth is that the level of complaints going to the Ombudsman from Telecom Éireann exceeds that of all Government Departments put together and those Government Departments have a combined clientele of probably in the order of two or three million, and if one took a ratio as to what proportion of their clientele are complaining to the Ombudsman it would be dwarfed by the .3 per cent that the Minister says is happening in Telecom Éireann.  The truth of the matter is that the highest level of complaint to the Ombudsman is coming from Telecom Éireann subscribers and, as the Minister knows, people take a great deal of irritation before they take the step of going to the Ombudsman with their case.  There is no burying that under the carpet by dividing it by some big number produced out of the Minister's head to make it look small.  That is not the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the Minister is rejecting the notion of setting clear price targeting for these companies so that we would get to a situation of comparability with Europe.  There is nothing unusual about asking him to do that and to report on their performance.  There is nothing unusual about asking them to report publicly on the speed of delivery of post and all these other indicators.  The Minister tells us he is getting reports on the speed of delivery of post and the condition of telephone boxes in the country. If he is getting the reports why does it continue to be so bad and deteriorating, and what is he doing about it?  I am very disappointed that in this area the Minister appears to be taking such an anti-customer view and I hope he will reconsider it.</P>
    <P>I would like to go back to the area of broadcasting.  I would like to see the Minister look at broadcasting in a much broader context than the very narrow debate about the system of licensing independents. There is enormous economic potential for people here to provide <Col N="515" /> income and jobs through the broadcasting medium and I think it will take more than simply the changing of licence terms for this country to exploit the opportunity that there is for Irish producers of programming to get a market niche in other countries.  We are entering into a system of free and open competition in 1992.  Broadcasting technology is evolving very rapidly.  There will be huge opportunities and it takes more than just the Minister acquiescing in the arrival of commercial broadcasting to exploit those, and I would like to see a much more active look taken at this issue by both the Minister and his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has most of the tools for promoting industrial development and service development.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I understand I am under a very severe time constraint, I would like to mention briefly the issue of education in relation to broadcasting.  There is an educational potential of broadcasting that is not being properly exploited.  It is a great disappointment to me that foreign language programming has not yet got into the cable system in Dublin although it has arrived in Cork.  I certainly appreciate Cablelink's difficulties in Dublin in that they have a smaller capacity to carry stations, but I cannot understand why it would not be possible to have opt-out hours out of channels such as Super and Sky and others who are providing broadcasting that could be viewed at any time; there are surely hours when Cablelink could opt out to provide some foreign language broadcasting.</P>
    <P>With the advent of 1992 and the need for Ireland, as a small peripheral country, to be on a level pegging with everybody else we need to develop the language skills of our people.  The broadcasting media is uniquely placed to bring language within the reach of many people who might not have the time, the energy, or the opportunity to go through formal classes.  The Minister should ask the cable companies to provide, even on a flexible basis &mdash; nobody would ask them if they have very <Col N="516" /> limited capacity to carry a wide range of channels in foreign languages &mdash; some such programmes.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one last issue relating to the speed of delivery of post.  The Minister told us that he will get reports furnished to him.  I hope and I am sure he will make available to the House the results of those reports.  It is very important that the Minister look not just for the average delivery speed but for a regional breakdown.  It is my experience from talking to colleagues around the House that if one is to post &mdash; as Deputy Kavanagh mentioned to me &mdash; a letter in Wicklow addressed to another part of Wicklow it can often take a week to make the journey.  That experience is repeated throughout the country.  It would be unfair of the Minister to look solely at the overall average.  We must be assured that the different regions of the country are getting a speedy delivery as well.  We must also be assured that no letters are delayed to the extent &mdash; even if they are only a small proportion &mdash; of weeks rather than working days.  At the very least I ask the Minister to scrutinise very carefully the overall composition of the survey results and not the simple global average figure at the bottom line.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the Estimate for the Department of Communications, I would like to spend some time talking about the proposed MMDS system, which Deputy Bruton has referred to but which I do not think the Minister referred to in his speech.  The multipoint microwave distribution system is to have a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; notice for transmission of the new commercial television channel.  It would carry up to ten other terrestrial and satellite delivered services but it is specifically required to have a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; notice for the new national channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Department of Communications on which we could spend some time talking this morning. The Minister pointed out there are two Bill before the House at present, namely, the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) <Col N="517" /> Bill, 1988 &mdash; which we debated last week and will be debated again next week &mdash; and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, which no doubt will get a lot of airing in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for that I would like to confine my remarks to the proposed new television transmission system.  As Deputy Bruton said, advertisements for licences to operate the MMDS transmitters have recently been placed in the public press.  I am sure the Minister is aware that a campaign is developing, particularly in rural areas, to bring pressure to have the MMDS system stopped.  I am not saying to the Minister that I am in agreement with this protest group or that I necessarily support their views but arising out of the campaign certain questions have been posed in relation to this matter and I would ask the Minister to take this opportunity to clarify several aspects of the proposed system.  I believe there is need for clarification and until such time as we get it the Minister is putting us in a position where we must keep an open mind on the subject of MMDS.</P>
      <P>I want to ask about the technical suitability of this system for the areas it is intended to serve.  The system operates on a clear line of sight basis and its capability in many areas where there are mountains or hills, or where trees or buildings intervene could effect the signal and may cause it not to operate effectively. I understand that the system was developed in Canada where there are lots of wide open plains and where the terrain and the geographical conditions are entirely different from that of rural Ireland.  I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that there is a likelihood, at the very least, that this system could operate on a very patchy basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to use the system here in a way that has never been tried elsewhere, that is, on a blanket coverage of <Col N="518" /> the country.  Up to now it has been used in an isolated way, mainly in Canada and the US where it has been developed. There is a requirement on the operators of this system to provide a service to anybody who wants it within their own catchment area.  There is no guarantee that they will actually provide the service, either willingly or otherwise, and we could end up with only partial coverage of areas which are intended to be serviced by this system.</P>
    <P>At present there are several multi-channel television operators supplying service illegally to many areas that the MMDS system is proposed to serve. These operators are using a deflection system and re-beaming signals in the UHF spectrum.  They are at present illegal by virtue of the fact that they cannot get a licence from the Department of Communications.  They are somewhat like the illegal radio stations which are operating at present, many of whom, I presume, will be in a position where they will be granted licences when the new Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill is enacted.  The Department said the main reason they cannot license these operators is because it would not be in the interests of proper frequency management and they wish to keep the UHF spectrum free for the development of State broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>I understand that the UHF spectrum is at present under-utilised and has a lot of spare capacity available.  Is it absolutely sacrosanct that this spectrum be kept exclusively available for State broadcasting services?  It does not appear to be the case in other countries and why should it be so here?  The deflector system is much more cost effective and any change in the present illegal transmission system will mean that people who are at present receiving a satisfactory service will have to scrap their receivers, pay a new connection fee, buy a new television aerial and pay a new annual charge which will have to be sufficiently high to enable the MMDS operator to recover his installation costs on the system.  We have all this just for the privilege of receiving the same service that one is already receiving <Col N="519" /> and I want the Minister to explain why this is necessary.</P>
    <P>The multi-channel UHF operators want nothing other than to be treated in the same way as cable operators.  That is why they want to pay their licence fees and copyright fees.  They want to be licensed on a provisional basis, say, for a period of five years.  Their systems are using well-established technology which is economical and in volume production both here and abroad, unlike MMDS. Because they are localised systems, they are flexible to any future expansion into the UHF spectrum envisaged by RTE. Frequencies can be changed easily and economically at any stage and the UHF operators would be agreeable to yield up their frequencies to accommodate any expansion which RTE might want to make in the future.  They could also be obliged to encode their signals which would give protection to existing cable operators.  Given that scenario is it not possible that these re-beaming operators could be legalised and enabled to continue providing their services as it is certainly much cheaper and is already doing the job which the MMDS system proposes doing.</P>
    <P>In any event, with the way technology is developing, is it not likely that terrestrial transmission systems with the exception of cable &mdash; because it will have other functions &mdash; are likely to become obsolete within a few years when DBS, direct broadcasting services from sattelite, come on stream?  If so, is this not another reason why there is not much point in putting in an expensive new terrestrial system like MMDS which may well turn out to be defective anyway?</P>
    <P>The point of concern Deputy Bruton referred to about the MMDS system which I am sure has been brought to the Minister's attention is the growing body of opinion that is concerned about MMDS from a health point of view. Many eminent and professionally qualified people are expressing concern about the health hazards associated with microwave radiation and several articles have appeared in the media recently on the <Col N="520" /> matter.  It is very important that the public be given the facts on this for no other reason than to allay their fears.  If the Minister does not do this I have no doubt there will be a rash of objections when it comes to planning permission which will be required for all these transmitters which will be dotted around the country.  I anticipate there will be problems at that time if the fears out there in the community are not addressed and assurances not given that no health hazards will arise from this system.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is not my intention to be obstructive, but the questions I posed on technical, cost and health safety aspects are very important and should be addressed before the MMDS proposals are taken further.</P>
    <P>Let me mention the relationship between RTE and Cablelink.  RTE own 80 per cent of Cablelink, so effectively they control them.  This is a unique situation both in Ireland and abroad, where the State broadcasting service controls a potential competitor; indeed, all cable operators have to pay a levy to RTE.</P>
    <P>In the first place Cablelink carry other stations which are in competition with RTE, and I wonder if the Minister considers there could be a conflict of interests there, given the ownership position.  Secondly and more importantly, because Cablelink are controlled by RTE, the cable company are effectively prevented from competing with RTE.  Cablelink need not function just as a relay company; they could compete for purchasing of programmes and for advertising revenue, particularly by offering local Dublin advertising.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not agree that the public interest and the consumers' interest would best be served where competitive conditions existed between the broadcaster and the cable company and that market forces should determine which programmes are provided?  Does he consider that the present situation does not allow that to happen and has he any plans to change it?  I look forward to the Minister's replies to the many points I have raised.</P>

      <P>It would save us having this day here in Dublin.  The substantial decrease in the Estimate for Communications represents the board changes within that Department over the last two or three years.  The establishment of An Post and Board Telecom Éireann has delegated much of the responsibility within these two areas.  We have had a substantial debate this week on both these agencies and I intend to contribute to Deputy Bruton's Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill next week so I will not infringe on that area.  Reference has already been made in some detail to some of the contents of that Bill.  Suffice it to say I am not terribly happy with the Bill or the criticisms made without consultation with the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of which I am a member, and they are the main union concerned. I tell Deputy Bruton I will be addressing that matter next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to the £2.156 million set aside in 1988 for developments within communications, I welcome the increased investment in areas of capital expenditure within the Department.  I would like to refer to a number of items and maybe the Minister will respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead A.2 a substantial increase is indicated in Departmental expenditure for consultancy services. Last year £2,000 was the amount spent but for 1988 the amount expected to be spent is £25,000.  This is a significant increase which warrants explanation from the Minister.  All the Estimates presented to day indicate a huge jump in consultancy fees.  I ask the Minister for Communications why such a large increase in this area is necessary.  I would also like the Minister to tell us something <Col N="522" /> about consultancy services.  Are they contracted staff or fee staff?  Could the services so provided not have been provided by long-term departmental research staff?  I raise this point because I believe that while jobs are embargoed within the Civil Service there is a growing incidence of staff being taken on on contract on a once-off or consultancy basis and I am concerned that this may be a roundabout way of bypassing the embargo.</P>
    <P>With regard to any development in communications, it is important that the new skills and technological information be retained within the Department.  This is relevant as we set ourselves the task of preparing for 1992.  We must prepare the public sector staff for the major changes and ensure that the skills are developed within governmental agencies rather than developing reliance on consultancy and advisory services.  The greater the need the greater will be the increase in price and these agencies are expensive to engage and have a commitment to the profit motive rather than to the Department. Research work conducted abroad indicates that long-term and ongoing training of permanent staff is far more appropriate for Government agencies.  In this way banks of skills are built up throughout Departments and can be used without reliance on outside agencies.  An added bonus is that staff pay and conditions are negotiated collectively and Governments can be sure of consistency, which is an important feature of public sector employment.</P>
    <P>With 1992 in mind there will be increased dependence on advanced and complex technological skills.  The Irish Government will be actualy dependent on a highly skilled and reliable workforce if we are not to be left behind.  In this regard the Department of Communications will have a central role to play in ensuring that the communication channels are open and accessible to the business and productive agencies.  The only resourceful way to ensure that this will happen is to plan for skills within the service and retain them there.</P>
    <P>Apart from 1992 considerable changes <Col N="523" /> are about to take place in the communications area as far as broadcasting is concerned.  Fortunately, RTE are now returning to profitability, though not without considerable rationalisation and sacrifices on behalf of the staff.  The latest announcement by the Minister regarding the third TV channel will undoubtedly create additional financial pressures in RTE.  It is essential that RTE be provided with appropriate governmental support and that the new channel is obliged to operate under the same standards and regulations with regard to staffing and programming.  Then RTE will be adequately placed to compete.  The Labour Party will be asking the Minister to provide guarantees to the national service to ensure RTE are not asked to make any unreasonable sacrifices.</P>
    <P>An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann have a crucial part to play in the communications service.  Deputy Bruton mentioned criticism regarding delays and undue delays.  Delays cannot be attributed solely to An Post.  The service was in an advanced state of decay when it was transferred from the Post Office to the semi-State organisation.  It is only now that the service has been streamlined. Having worked for practically 30 years in the service I can say with some degree of certainty that the post office staff are probably the most dedicated in the public service.  Many of these people give their whole lives to the Department but decisions are taken over which they have no control and there should be greater communication between the workforce and the management.  They were involved in the longest strike in the history of the State and the longest strike ever in any communications organisation in the world.  This was largely due to a breakdown of communication within the organisation.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised by Deputy Bruton's reference to the spare capacity by RTE because they were contrary to his party's position in relation to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>It certainly does and it has been completely ignored and the same can be said in relation to the skills of RTE.  It should be recognised that we have a very valuable asset which should be utilised.</P>
      <P>Under the 1926 Act, the Minister had the power to come to grips with the problem of pirate radio stations but he did not use it.  However, I was a member of a Government which was equally guilty in that regard and who should have taken on the pirates before the problem got out of hand.  I will not be opposing the Estimate and I look forward to discussing more points in detail in the weeks ahead.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Minister's proposals in support of his amended Estimate for the coming year.  Having just listened to his previous colleague in Cabinet propose an Estimate of £126 million the first thing that strikes me is that his request to the House is so modest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth recognising why the budget is of such modest proportions. As the Minister has borrowed the word I will be reluctant to use it again during the course of the debate.  The House and the public should appreciate the very good record which has been achieved by the State and semi-State companies in the area of postal and telecommunications and communications generally.  The net requirement of the Minister's Department for a year is something over £2 million.  The majority of the running cost of RTE as a communications company is achieved <Col N="525" /> from their income from cable television, licence and broadcasting fees generally.</P>
      <P>The postal services in 1987 made a profit of £2.7 million.  Many of us who have to listen so often to the criticisms of the State and semi-State bodies take great pride in their achievements and the Minister rightly recognised this in his contribution. I should like to make special mention of the workers in these companies who, through their efforts and contribution, have helped to lift both areas &mdash; communications and the postal services &mdash; out of the doldrums.  They have achieved this through the development of very healthy, good competitive practices.  I am glad Deputy Kelly has come back in and I repeat that no semi-State or State companies are worried about competition on fair grounds.</P>
      <P>I made this remark in the context of insurance costs a week or two ago and I regret I did not stay to hear Deputy Kelly advise me that perhaps I was in the wrong party.  The Worker's Party are not afraid of the policies or philosophies of competition and we look forward to an increased competitiveness on the part of State and semi-State companies.  We commend any move in that direction on the part of this or any Government which allows the State to develop competitively. It is a major problem as people on the one hand say it is unfair competition to let them get on with the job and, on the other, criticise them for not doing the job when they are hampered by unfair market constraints.</P>
      <P>We should show our disapproval at the failure of the Government to deal with illegal broadcasting.  It is not inaccurate to describe the failure of the Government and the authorities to tackle this problem as a scandal.  We have been told, on a daily basis over the past number of weeks in the context of the rod licence angling dispute, that the law is in place and must be enforced.  It is a great pity this and previous Governments were not of the same mind and did not have the same enthusiasm for the law and its enforcement in the area of illegal radio broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, this is a <Col N="526" /> remarkable time for communications.  A revolution is taking place.  The whole area of development and debate is occupying a great deal of our time in the House and outside it.  It is important, in making fundamental decisions, to get them right. I hope people will never again be able to engage, nationwide, in illegal broadcasting. One of the aspects of the development of the revolution in communications is the suggestion by the Government of a third television channel. This will have major implications for the State broadcasting company, RTE.  I heard the Minister saying that people in RTE are willing to take up the challenge of a third channel on a private basis but, against that, one has to measure the desirability and the capacity of RTE to continue viably with the withdrawal of advertising revenue and what that will add to the cost of the licence fee.</P>
    <P>All speakers mentioned the decision of the Government in the past year to disband the Postal Users' Council and the Telecommunications Users' Council. This decision was met with some apprehension by Opposition spokespersons in the House at the time but, to some degree, our worries were assuaged by the suggestion that the remit of these councils would be taken up by the Office of the Ombudsman.  That seemed a reasonably fair substitute but the history of the Office of the Ombudsman then and since has been one of appalling cutbacks with the result that the Ombudsman made an unprecedented plea to all interests and parties in the House to come to his aid and that of his staff.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of us not to comment on the fact that more than 2,000 complaints from the communications and postal areas have been submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman since this remit was extended to cover those areas.  It is clear the Ombudsman is unable to cope and that the users' councils in postal and communications areas have been abolished and not replaced.  In view of the fact that the cost of retaining such a council would be very small I should like to suggest to the Minister that he give serious consideration to reviving it in the near <Col N="527" /> future or, alternatively, that he commit a very strong view through his office to the Cabinet for an increase in the remit and resources of the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>An Bord Telecom and An Post are major operations employing many people.  They provide a wide range of services and it is the general view here, and abroad, that they have become more efficient in the delivery of those services in recent years, particularly since they were taken out of the direct control of Civil service administrators.  The quality of the services provided by those companies has improved greatly.  The introduction of worker directors to the boards of the companies is recognised as an important advance but I should like to suggest to the Minister that he consider appointing to those boards a person to represent consumer interests.  If he does that he will be giving those who use the services of the companies an opportunity to voice their views.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to the workers of both companies for the contribution they have made to the development of the companies.  I should like to make special reference to the skill and experience of those in RTE, particularly in the radio division.  I do not think that RTE are given the credit they deserve.  I should like to make special mention of Radio 1 and the regional stations.  The radio division has been seeking an increase in the number of hours for service delivery for many years.  People do not understand the degree of State control in the area of broadcasting in RTE radio and television. The fact that Radio 1 ceases broadcasting at the hour it does each evening by Ministerial edict is an indication of that control.  The station has asked on many occasions for an extension of those hours and I urge the Minister to accede to that request.</P>
    <P>An area of broadcasting that concerned us in the House recently was the proposal to televise Dáil proceedings.  In considering that we must have regard to the service that is being provided by <Col N="528" /> RTE.  In my view the timing of the evening broadcast is far from ideal.  I urge RTE to consider plotting that transmission at a more appropriate time when, as statistics show, the station enjoys a bigger audience.  The timing, and the time afforded, to a great degree belittles the quality of the work of the staff who transmit our deliberations from the House on a daily basis.  I understand that &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; propose to extend the time of its programme from 7.30 a.m. to 9 a.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>The additional time will afford the station an opportunity to transmit a slot on the previous day's proceedings in the Dáil.  I do not think we have been given adequate coverage on the airwaves when one considers the amount of work we get through daily, particularly in recent weeks when we have taken on an increased workload.  I would like to see that programme carrying a more detailed report of Dáil proceedings before we get involved in the argument of whether we should televise our proceedings.  The radio service, which is excellent, should be allowed develop to its full potential.  We do not have any difficulty in welcoming the Minister's Estimate and we hope that matters will continue to progress as rapidly and as constructively as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying a word or two about what Deputy McCartan was referring to.  It had not been in my mind to say anything about televising Dáil proceedings but it fills me <Col N="529" /> with shame to find that this proposal surfaces only when the British had done it. It is only when the British make a step of this or any other kind that anyone in this country gets round to deciding that it is high time we did it too.  Were the reasons for broadcasting by television or otherwise the proceedings of this House not just as strong before the British made their decision as after it?  Have there not been reasons for it for the past 65 years? Why then must we wait until it is done across the water by the people we spent 700 years trying to be free from according to the folklore without doing it ourselves? I will have time to refer to that on another occasion no doubt.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes I have I should like to concentrate on the situation we have been in in the past five years in regard to pirate radio stations.  In 1983 a couple of the very popular ones were attacked, quite rightly, by the Coalition Government and temporarily put out of business, quite rightly.  Every Deputy will recall the sackfulls of mail, the countless tens of thousands of signatures of young people flowing in telling us that we were going to enjoy nothing but their disfavour as long as we remained in politics unless we supported the remaining open of those stations.  The Government, needless to say, backed down on this issue and every other Government has done the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to give the House an idea of the scale of this problem I should like to refer to what the Minister for Communications said no more than six months ago.  On 19 November in the House he estimated that there were about 70 illegal stations operating at various locations in the country.  He said the number could vary from month to month.  On the Minister's evidence we have 70 pirate stations operating here and harvesting between them, again on the Minister's evidence in reply to the same question on 19 November, between £3.5 million and £4 million in advertising per annum.  Are they not in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926?  Is that not just as much part of the law of the land as the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987 which one <Col N="530" /> moment we hear is not being enforced and the next moment we are told is being enforced?  It seems to operate north of a particular parallel of latitude but not south of it.</P>
    <P>This is of greater importance than merely broadcasting importance.  I want to point to those radio stations and what has happened about them as being one of the reasons for the softening of attitudes here towards the law, for the invasion of the Irish Constitution by a sort of dry rot. The institutions are all in place, the Dáil is sitting, the courts are open, the President is signing Bills, the Executive are at work in their various Departments but, just the same, there is a certain invasion of the structure by the following proposition: &ldquo;we will only obey as much law as it suits us to obey at any particular time&rdquo;.  That is the attitude on the citizens part and on the Government's part it is: &ldquo;we will only enforce as much law as we are let&rdquo;.  That is a shameful position for a free republic to be in.</P>
    <P>What I know about fishing is so slight that I will not take sides on the merits of whether there should be a charge for trout fishing.  If the Government are in difficulties and find themselves divided on whether to give in or not, it is because they have tolerated this slack application of the law, rightly or wrongly, down the years.  I do not specially put Fianna Fáil on the spot because, as Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan fairly admitted, the Government we were voting for over the past few years were every bit as bad.  That is the reason.  Until Governments get their act together in regard to what they will face up to and stop being cowardly and running away from sacksful of petitions, we will never have a settled attitude towards law and government.  It has been weakened enough by the history behind us in which law was foreign law and government was oppressive foreign government.  It got off to a bad start for that reason alone, but let us not make it worse by despising and scorning the laws we ourselves have enacted, either in 1926 or 1987.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year Deputy Richard Bruton asked the Minister the number of <Col N="531" /> pirate stations which he had closed during the previous six months, the grounds on which they had been closed and whether he planned similar action against other stations.  The Minister replied that in the previous six months action had been taken by his Department against one illegal broadcasting station on foot of a court order.  I do not understand the last phrase too clearly.  Summonses had, he said, been issued as a result and the matter was therefore <i>sub judice.</i> The matter is no longer <i>sub judice</i> because it was decided by the District Court last week to fine Mr. T.C.G. O'Mahony £50, not for operating a pop radio station polluting the atmosphere with pop music but for broadcasting his version of the Christian message, running a thing called Christian Community Radio Broadcasting at 90.23 megahertz.  He was prosecuted because there are no votes to be lost in prosecuting Mr. O'Mahony.</P>
    <P>Not a single other prosecution was brought, although there are 70 other illegal stations broadcasting, free as the air through which they transmit.  That is the crown of infamy on this contemptible situation.  The State has not the guts to close down a pirate radio unless it is run by somebody such as a religious enthusiast behind whom there are not enough votes to make any difference.  My religious faith is very far from being of the same strength as Mr. O'Mahony's and I am by no means attracted by the level of devotionalism which it is his right as a Christian or as a citizen to entertain, but it is a scandal and a shame that he should be singled out for persecution by the Minister and his Department when the 70 other broadcasting stations, not interested in transmitting the Christian message but interested in making money, are allowed to remain open and in business.</P>
    <P>Where is the philosophy which would explain the difference between this and what is happening on the waters of the west?  This invasion of the Constitution by a psychological dry rot has reached very high levels.  A bishop said last week that, if so many people are against that <Col N="532" /> law, there must be something wrong with it.  I have not the exact quotation in front of me but I believe I am paraphasing him not unfairly.  I wonder would he apply that argument to the law of his own Church.  Would he accept that as a valid criterion for changing the law which he preaches and is bound to preach from his pulpit and bound to make sure that the priests subject to him preach in their pulpits? If it has reached that length it is very serious indeed.  If bishops, who used to be the main bulwark of respect for the law, are beginning to talk like that, it is very serious and it is a lot for a democratic Government to answer for if they allow that situation to develop.  I hope I have not been unfair to the Minister or his Department, but it looks to me, and will look to others, as though this particular defendant was singled out because it was felt to be safe to single him out.  That is base for a republic.</P>
    <P>I want to change not only subject but gear and pitch in my closing remarks which will be a lot more pacific.  I hope they will not be entirely irrelevant to what ordinary people feel.  There was a time when I was first in this House when the debates on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs went on for a week.  There was hardly a Deputy in the House who did not want to contribute. Everybody had an opinion about RTE or the various programmes they produced.  The way the House was run then allowed Deputies to give their views at great length about this or that programme. I do not wish to do that but there is one respect in which I would stop short of supporting the praises which in other respects I would certainly endorse in regard to RTE's standards and expertise. I refer to the amount of control they exercise over their advertisers.  I do not object to advertising but there is a level of boredom and infuriation which one ought not to wish on the listener.  I do not think anyone in RTE applies a standard to the sort of stuff served up by the advertisers. No one applies the following standard: if people hear this jingle, not for one, two, or three months but for a year on end, are they going to go out of their <Col N="533" /> minds?  If they hear that idiotic pipping following by &ldquo;ACOT &mdash; Focus on Farming&rdquo; for a couple of years in a row, are they going to become nursing home cases?  This is not to speak of a canon or genre in advertising which has now virtually taken over.</P>
    <P>I refer to a conversation between a man and wife &mdash; the marital status is not made clear but they are certainly in what would nowadays be described as a &ldquo;stable relationship&rdquo;&mdash; in some kind of surreal Castleknock.  They speak in accents which are not English accents and are certainly not Irish ones.  The scenario always involves the man in disclosing himself to be a well-spoken knucklehead at his wits end because of the insurance premium demand he has received.  His wife, who would take my prize for smugness, whoever she is &mdash; there is, I suppose, a whole raft of them &mdash; calls him with every half sentence &ldquo;darling&rdquo; and has the answer up her sleeve.  Mrs. Darling O'Smug has all the answers &mdash; he should try this company or that company. The building society advertisements are every bit as bad, sometimes worse.</P>
    <P>RTE should not be on their knees to their advertisers and should insist on a certain minimum level of amusement and elegance.  I do not care how earthy an advertisment is but it should not be irritating or something that will tend to infuriate if heard over too long a period. Advertisers should be told that no matter what jingle they select they will be able to run it for no longer than three months and then will have to come up with a different jingle.  Perhaps I have a lower exasperation threshold than other people.  I do not hear other people complaining about this matter but when I complain about it among my circle of friends I get virtually 100 per cent agreement, which is not something I am accustomed to getting anywhere about anything, as a general rule.  RTE, if they have not heard this point made before, should reflect on it and consider whether their advertisements are phoney and if there is something false or exasperating about them if repeated <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>
    <P>The advertisements I like best are the <Col N="534" /> ones I understand least, like the agricultural ones early in the morning from which one will learn a great deal about liver fluke while having one's breakfast. There is a certain reality about them. Even though I do not have the problem of liver fluke or hoose, I appreciate that it is serious for the farming community. At least it is dealt with in what I might call a manly, straightforward way that one could listen to, even as a city bred person, without resentment for many months on end.  There have been occasionally, in the agricultural sphere and in others, excellent advertisments which got their message across through wit but that seems to be in desperately short supply these days as far as the agencies which turn out the material for clients are concerned.  Even if the agencies are low on inventiveness, ingenuity and taste, surely RTE which we all praise for their content of skills might apply some of those same skills to sparing the public the kind of low grade and nauseating advertising which we have to listen to.  I accept that they have to run advertising but the people should not be expected to listen for sometimes 12 months or years on end to the same idiotic, stomach-turning jingle.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the bonus.  I very often find it a problem in rhetoric or in public speaking if one has a few serious points to make and one also has a point which is perhaps just as serious but which allows itself to be addressed more lightheartedly.  One always runs the risk that what one has said fairly lightheartedly, although seriously intended, will detract from whatever weight the other part of one's remarks may have had.  Even though I have spent some time talking about advertising I hope the Minister will realise that the point I really want to get across is the one in regard to the nonapplication of the laws of this House or rather their selective application in a way that I think is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>In listening to Deputy Kelly's words I wonder if there are those in the general public who would say &mdash; people in RTE often say it about politicians: &ldquo;There they go, irritating and infuriating; we have to listen over a long period to idiotic, stomach-turning speeches by politicians&rdquo;.  I want to refer to the question of pirate radio and the statement made by Deputy Kelly and many others on the need to get these pirate radios off the air as soon as possible. Deputy Kelly rightly quoted me as saying that there are 70 such stations and their very existence is bringing the law into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister called it a disgraceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgraceful situation. It is for that reason that I introduced the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill which has already passed Second Stage and which, I hope, will be debated the week after next in the House in association with the Report and Final Stages of the Radio and Television Bill because they go hand in hand.  It is essential that we come to grips with the pirate stations.  They are in existence and they have picked a niche for themselves in the marketplace for independent radio.  We want to get these pirates off the air and have a legal regime of alternative radio in force as soon as possible.  The fines proposed in that Bill will ensure that it is legislation that can be enforced and that can be effective.  At present fines of £50 and £20 are imposed on those who have been brought to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You can also seize their apparatus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When the new legislation is passed these people will face jail sentences and fines of up to £20,000. That applies not only to the operators but also to those who advertise on those stations.  There are powers in the new Bill to stop the ESB from giving them power and also in relation to the phone service to these operators.  I share the concern of <Col N="536" /> the Members of the House.  The sooner this legislation is passed the better.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific case mentioned by Deputy Kelly, lest there be any misunderstanding on this, the action taken in that case was not the only one that was taken.  Action has been taken in other cases as well.  The practice being followed by me, and which was followed by my predecessors, in the absence of legislation to allow radio is that any of these illegal stations who cause intereference with other stations or with the emergency services are taken to court. That is what happened in the case referred to by Deputy Kelly.  It had nothing to do with the content of the programmes but with the fact that the person was interfering with other stations and when he was asked to change from the channel he was on he would not do so.  It was for that reason that he was taken to court.  This has happened in a number of cases where the equipment has been seized.  Unfortunately the fines are always about £20 or £50 and the equipment is eventually given back to the operators.  Under the new legislation which will be passed within the next couple of weeks we can come to grips with this national scandal that has brought the law into disrepute for the last ten years.  The sooner it is passed the better.  This matter was mentioned by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the Radio and Television Bill.  We will have an opportunity next week and the week after to discuss the various Stages of that Bill. I will not go into detail on the points he made.  He referred, as did Deputy O'Malley, to the sacks full of mail, to use Deputy Kelly's phrase, from the present illegal deflector operators around the country trying to retain their illegal operations in relation to the deflection of television services.  I can assure the Deputies that I have noted their points and I will put together a properly documented case answering the various points.  I will publicise it as widely as possible and make it available to them.  I will just mention a few of them briefly today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> First, in relation to the MMDS and the accusation that it will not achieve nationwide coverage and that it is merely line of sight, UHF is also line of sight. The position with regard to the MMDS is that the frequency pattern which has been designed by my Department will give national coverage in any areas where there is a black spot and alternators and repeaters can be put in.  There is no difficulty with that.  For example, it took RTE nearly 25 years to achieve the whole national coverage that they now have. You will recall that the Black Valley in Kerry, for example, did not have service for a long time and the Cooley Peninsula was another example.  The MMDS frequency as designed by the officials of my Department will give national coverage, not all on day one but progressively as the system is constructed.</P>
    <P>The position that was referred to by Deputy Bruton in the UK still has not been resolved.  We are pioneers in this area in relation to MMDS.  As regards UHF capacity and RTE's capacity I can assure the Deputy, as I have done already in replies to questions, that that capacity is, for all intents and purposes, taken up. Deputy O'Malley was concerned about the health aspect.  I will deal with this matter in greater detail in the statements that I will prepare because I want to allay the legitimate concerns and worries of the Deputies on this matter.</P>
    <P>The technical specifications being laid down by my Department will require MMDS operators to comply with the guidelines laid down by the International Non-Ionising Radiation Committee of the International Radiation Protection Association on the limits of exposure to radio frequency electro-magnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 kilohertz to 300 gigaherts.  This body, in co-operation with the environmental health dicision of the World Health Organisation have undertaken responsibility for the development of health criteria documents on non-ionising radiation.  These form part of the World Health Organisation's environmental health criteria programme which is funded by the <Col N="538" /> United Nations Environmental Programme. The body has the support of the International Labour Office and the Commission of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>A document called &ldquo;Environmental Health Criteria 16 &mdash; Radiofrequency and Microwaves&rdquo; was published in 1981 under the joint sponsorship of UNEP, WHO/IRPA, and served as a scientific rationale for the development of the &ldquo;Interim Guidelines on limits of exposure to RF electro-magnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz&rdquo;, published in 1984.  Following publication of the interim guidelines, important advances were made in biological RF radiation research which led to a revision of the interim guidelines. The revised text was approved in June 1987 and it is this set of guidelines that MMDS operates will be obliged to comply with.  I can assure the Deputies these guidelines will be fully enforced.</P>
    <P>The microwave is already being used for the telephone network.  I am told the health risk from a microwave oven in the home is far in excess of anything that comes across on the microwaves used for telephones and for the proposed system of MMDS.  World Health Organisation rules will be fully enforced.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked about the future of Cablelink.  I have taken note of the points mentioned, as well as the levy question mentioned by Deputy Bruton. I want to put on record and categorically deny the statements made by Deputy Bruton in relation to my attitude and the attitude of the Government as far as consumer protection is concerned.  We are fully committed to consumer protection but that does not mean we have to accept the legislative proposal put forward by Deputy Bruton.  In our view, rather than being a protection for the consumer Deputy Bruton's Bill would cost the consumer and would lead to greater inefficiencies in the postal and telecommunications area.</P>
    <P>I accept what Deputies Bruton said about the foreign language programming on cable television.  I believe there is a case to be made for TV 5 or some of the <Col N="539" /> other stations to be put on air for a couple of hours a day in spare capacity time.  With the new systems I have no doubt we will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised questions on the MMDS and legalising the illegal stations. That is not the way to go forward. The suggestion that DBS broadcasting will replace terrestrial broadcasting in the foreseeable future is a little optimistic. The United Kingdom satellite project started in 1983 and may come to pass in 1989.  However, subscriber penetration is expected to grow slowly, and individual reception of DBS would require the purchase of expensive new satellite reception equipment at each individual home.  The British system will offer three channels some of which will be encoded.  None of this will be provided by the existing terrestrial services.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned consultancy services.  The increase in consultancy services expenditure was due to the engagement of consultants to prepare for the introduction of information technology in the Department.  It is planned to computerise the areas of financial control information in semi-State bodies under my aegis and licensing systems.  It is part of the Government's determination to exploit the latest advances in information technology to provide the most efficient and cost effective service to the State.</P>
    <P>Another point raised dealt with the transmission resources available to RTE. There are a number of misconceptions about this.  The transmission resources are very limited and are fully utilised and any expansion would require significant capital investment by RTE.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy McCartan's endorsement of my views that the three State companies under my aegis are good examples of good management as evidenced by their financial results.  I have also recognised the dedicated efforts of the staff, the board and management of those companies who are doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to pirate radio stations.  That area will be handled in the <Col N="540" /> Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill.  Deputy McCartan alleged there was undue ministerial power over hours of broadcasting.  It is for the RTE Authority to decide what the hours of broadcasting should be and having so decided, they require my approval.  I recently received some proposals from RTE for an extension of their hours, and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on that very shortly.  I will bring to the attention of the Authority the points raised by the Deputies in relation to transmission of &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; during the extended &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>We will have a lot of time over the next two weeks, particularly next Wednesday, to discuss many matters which would have come up in the Estimate.  I thank Deputies for contributing to this debate. I can assure them we have taken note of the points they have mentioned but to which I have not responded in detail.  I will bear them in mind when determining future policy in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £252,144,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1988 is for a net sum of £252,144,000 of which £200,246,000 or <Col N="541" /> 79 per cent provides for pay and allowances. The outturn for 1987 was £252,053,000, which means, in effect, that the 1987 level of expenditure will be maintained in 1988.  The gross provision in the 1988 Estimate is £260,334,000.  This includes £60,088,000 for non-pay items. The provision of £8,190,000 for Appropriations-in-Aid shows a decrease of £295,000 on the 1987 outturn.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for 1988 is based on averages of the toal strength of 13,230 in the Permanent Defence Force comprising 1,590 officers, 40 cadets and 11,600 other ranks.  The averages for 1987 were 1,583 officers, 56 cadets and 11,655 other ranks.</P>
    <P>Even in times of financial stringency, basic security must be given priority. Events for some years past have clearly shown the need to have a strong well equipped Army available to assist the gardaí in internal security arrangements. It is a matter for satisfaction that in the Defence Forces there is available a well trained, disciplined body of men who have the capability of flexibility to permit of their being employed in a variety of demanding security tasks.</P>
    <P>The contribution to security made by the Defence Forces is appreciable and it is essential that they should be in a position to continue to meet the demands which are made of them in the security area.  While providing the necessary resources I want to ensure, particularly in present financial circumstances, that the best possible use is made of manpower and equipment at all times.  The indications are that there will be no significant reduction in the demands made on the Defence Forces in the security field for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that the Defence Forces should have the capacity to respond to requests for assistance from the Garda Síochána as the occasion demands.  Deputies will recall the very extensive search for arms and ammunition which was undertaken throughout the State by the Garda Síochána, with the support of the Defence Forces, in November and December last.  It was necessary that the Defence Forces were <Col N="542" /> in a position to have adequate numbers of trained personnel on the ground at short notice to assist in this major operation.</P>
    <P>In the economic difficulties in which the country finds itself, it may be suggested that we should cut down significantly on expenditure in the defence area.  The Government, however, because of their unswerving commitment to the maintenance of law and order and their determination to ensure that the democratic institutions of the State will prevail, have allocated the necessary resources to maintain the services which underpin those institutions.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces also assist the community in a variety of other ways. During 1987 59 search and rescue missions were undertaken by Air Corps aircraft and a total of 84 air ambulance missions were flown conveying seriously ill patients to specialist hospitals.  Assistance has also been given by the Defence Forces on occasions in the past to maintain essential supplies and services during industrial disputes involving such areas as public transport, refuse collection, fire fighting, petrol and oil deliveries and water and sewerage.</P>
    <P>During the recent Dublin Fire Brigade strike, which lasted from 22 January to 3 March 1988, the Defence Forces provided an emergency fire and ambulance service.  This service was of a standard which exceeded all expectations.  It drew tributes and expressions of thanks from many quarters for the magnificent job done by the Defence Forces personnel in protecting the lives and property of the people of Dublin during that strike.</P>
    <P>Arising from an industrial dispute in the prison service, personnel of the Defence Forces were recently committed to duties in prisons throughout the country. The tasks undertaken by military personnel mainly involved catering and duties of a housekeeping nature generally, while custodial duties were the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.  The sincere thanks of all citizens are due to both the members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána for the efficient and capable manner in which the difficult <Col N="543" /> and demanding task of running the country's prisons over a four week period was carried out.</P>
    <P>Participation by personnel of the Defence Forces in United Nations peace-keeping operations is a practical expression of Ireland's support for the United Nations aims and ideals of maintaining international peace.  This participation commenced some 30 years ago, when Ireland first sent officers to act as observers in Lebanon.  Since that time, thousands of Irish personnel have seen service on a voluntary basis in the cause of peace in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>We now have an Irish contingent of about 750 all ranks serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  We have also eight personnel serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Force in Cyprus and 25 Irish officers serving as observers with UNTSO &mdash; the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.  Five of the UNTSO officers are part of the observer group which is monitoring the agreements concerning the situation in Afghanistan.  The request of the United Nations Secretary General for Irish personnel for this latest mission is a measure of the high regard in which our contribution to UN peace-keeping is held by the United Nations.  We have been involved in a fourth UN peace-keeping operation &mdash; the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan &mdash; since September last, when Brigadier-General James Parker was appointed its chief military observer.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to support in every possible way the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to find the basis for a settlement in the Middle East which would lead to a lasting peace. We must continue to hope that these efforts will meet with success.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to some particular issues which are worthy of comment.  I can assure the House that the strength of the permanent Defence Force is kept under constant review to ensure that, within the limit of the financial resources available, the strength is <Col N="544" /> kept at an adequate level.  The current strength is 13,200 officers and men.  I propose to enlist, in the near future, up to 500 recruits, to make sure that the number provided for in the Estimate is maintained for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces, the Government are concerned to ensure that the remuneration of the Defence Forces keeps step with that of other sectors of the public service.  To this end, the pay of all ranks has been increased with effect from 1 January 1988 by 3 per cent on the first £120 of basic weekly pay and 2 per cent on any amount of basic weekly pay over £120, subject to a minimum increase of £4 per week in accordance with the terms of the agreement on pay in the public service.  Further increases under the agreement will be paid as they arise.</P>
    <P>The pay of a recruit is now over £133 per week rising, after about 14 weeks' basic training, to £154.  On advancement to private three star, which usually takes place within the first year of service, gross pay rises to over £160 per week, while after three years' service the gross pay of a private is over £175.  In addition, allowances are also payable to officers and men who perform duties of a security nature.  The rates of these allowances are kept under review to ensure that personnel are adequately compensated for the duties which they are required to undertake.  I am pleased to say that as a result of the most recent review of these allowances, an increase of over 4 per cent was granted with effect from 1 January 1988.  This increase brought the rates of allowances for service in the Border areas to £22.82 a week for officers and £19.81 a week for men, while the allowances for other duties in aid of the civil power, such as guard duties on vital installations, cash escorts and prisoner escorts, were increased to £9.71 for each week-day and double that amount for each Sunday or Army holiday.</P>
    <P>As regards the Reserve Defence Force, I regret that, because of financial considerations it has not been found possible to order annual training for members <Col N="545" /> of the First Line Reserve in 1988. However, annual training for the FCA and the Slua Muirí at the same level as in recent years will be held.  Notwithstanding the fact that annual training for the First Line Reserve has not been ordered for 1988, members who would have qualified for the gratuity in the normal course, will be eligible for the full rate of gratuity.  The gratuity payable to qualified members of the FCA and Slua Muirí who complete the maximum permissible period in 1988 will also be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance for training for the shorter period.  This is the same arrangement which applied last year.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army and the Air Corps were held in 1987 and 25 cadetships were awarded.  Proposals for an intake of cadets in 1988 are under consideration and a decision in the matter will be made in due course.  Last year 50 apprenticeships in the Army Apprentice School, Naas, and the Air Corps Apprentice School, Baldonnel, were awarded.  Competitions for the award of up to 100 apprenticeships in 1988 were advertised in February last.  The apprentices will commence training in August this year. As I have already indicated, the non-pay provisions for this year come to just over £60 million.  This is necessary to maintain the capabilities of the Defence Forces and to meet commitments already entered into.</P>
    <P>Late last year I was pleased to announce the placing of a contract for the supply of new rifles for the Defence Forces.  These weapons will gradually replace the F.N. rifles which were first introduced into service with the Defence Forces in 1961.  The initial delivery of the new rifle is expected to be made towards the middle of this year.  The contract provided for countertrade arrangements whereby substantial orders for Irish goods would be arranged through a company called Steyr-Barter.  Implementation of the countrywide arrangements is being handled by Córas Trachtála.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the matter of <Col N="546" /> fishery surveillance.  The Naval Service has five off-shore patrol vessels, including <i>L.E. Eithne,</i> which is a helicopter-carrying ship.  Two maritime Dauphin helicopters are available for use in conjunction with <i>L.E. Eithne</i> and two Beech King aircraft are devoted exclusively to fisheries surveillance duties.  The full integration of the maritime Dauphin helicopter with <i>L.E. Eithne</i> will greatly enhance our fisheries surveillance capacity.</P>
    <P>The question of further increasing the fisheries surveillance capacity of the Naval Service and the Air Corps is under active consideration at present and an application to the European Commission for financial support has been presented to the Commission and is being vigorously pursued.  Meanwhile, my Department have been examining, for evaluation purposes, many offers of vessels and aircraft which have been received from suppliers in order to be in a position to make early decisions in the event of a favourable response from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Our capabilities in the marine search and rescue area have given rise to much debate recently.  The Minister for the Marine holds primary responsibility for marine search and rescue arrangements and there are quite a number of State and other agencies at his disposal in order to carry out this function, two vitally important ones being the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    <P>I know there are many people who have taken a keen interest in pursuing the possibility of locating Air Corps helicopters on the western seaboard.  This is a section of our coastline which can present a hostile environment in certain conditions to those who must spend a good deal of their lives at sea.  We can all recall the many tragedies which have taken place off this part of our island and we feel a great deal of sympathy for those who have lost loved ones in these incidents.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of the Dauphin helicopters has improved considerably the resources available to us to carry out the search and rescue function and they have <Col N="547" /> played a vital role in the saving of many lives so far.  The deployment of these very sophisticated aircraft, which represent a quantum leap in technological terms from the older Alouette helicopters, presents particular problems.  With my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, I am currently addressing these problems so that maximum use may be gained from our resources, in the context of marine search and rescue, through the properly planned deployment of our helicopters.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on the building of a new military barracks at Cavan and it is hoped that it will be available for occupation during 1990.  The old barracks there has been in existence since the early 18th century.  It was built around 1710 and is the oldest occupied barracks in Europe.  It is, however, no longer suitable or adequate for its purpose.  The need for a modern replacement has been recognised for some considerable time but financial constraints and other priorities have intervened up to the present.  I am glad to say that these problems have now been overcome and the project is proceeding. The old barracks in Cavan and the temporary accommodation at Cootehill will be vacated as soon as this new barracks is ready for occupation &mdash; sometime in the summer-autumn of 1990.</P>
    <P>The provision of £8.8 million &mdash; which includes the financing for the new Cavan barracks &mdash; is made in subhead S of the Estimate for building and engineering works.  This figure includes a total capital sum of £6 million for new buildings and major renewal works.  The provision will permit the continuance of the programme of development and improvement of the accommodation and other facilities required by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The improvements encompass the construction of modern billets, the renewal and modernisation of catering arrangements, the provision of recreational facilities and the continuing betterment of administrative and operational accommodation.</P>
    <P>In concert with the provision of much needed up-to-date accommodation, the question of disposing of properties which <Col N="548" /> are antiquated and surplus to requirements is being tackled.  Griffith Barracks will be vacated later this year and will be handed back to the Office of Public Works for disposal.  Arrangements are in hand to sell properties in Dublin, Cork and in a number of locations around the country.</P>
    <P>A scheme for the sale to their occupants of married quarters which are located outside of military barracks is being introduced.  Details of the scheme have not yet been finalised but it is expected that it will be broadly similar to the purchase scheme available to local authority tenants.  A total of about 220 houses will be available for sale under the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>Turning to equestrian events, I am pleased to report that in 1987 Army riders and horses competed in 19 international shows.  The Army riders won 16 first places, 13 second places, 11 third places and 10 fourth places and total prize money of £43,700.  In addition, 70 provincial horse shows and gymkhanas were attended.  A total of 214 places resulted in winnings of £11,360.  Fourteen Class I horses were purchased in 1987.  The school is now in possession of eleven international class showjumpers.</P>
    <P>An invitation from the Australian Government to send <i>Asgard II</i> to Australia to take part in the Tall Ship's events held there in January 1988 as part of the Australian Bicentenary Celebrations was accepted.  The vessel left Ireland on 15 October and was shipped from Rotterdam to Sydney where it arrived on 13 December 1987.  The cruise programme in Australia extended from 23 December 1987 to 7 April 1988 and included participation in the Tall Ships' Race from Hobart to Sydney, in which <i>Asgard II</i> came first in her division and second in the Tall Ships Class.  <i>Asgard II</i> participated also in the magnificent Parade of Sail which took place in Sydney Harbour on Australia Day &mdash; the 26th January, 1988.</P>
    <P>The visit of <i>Asgard II</i> to Australia was a tremendous success.  It was particularly appreciated by the Australian Irish Society based in Sydney that the Irish <Col N="549" /> were among the many nations represented by tall ships at the events in January, 1988.  The full programme for <i>Asgard II</i> took her to many towns and cities in Australia where there are large Australian Irish communities, including Melbourne, Hobart, Sydney, and Brisbane.</P>
    <P>The Estimate contains a provision of £1,765,000 for Civil Defence in 1988. This provision emphasises the Government's commitment to the maintenance and improvement of this essential component of national defence.  I do not propose to dwell on this service as my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, who is responsible for Civil Defence will cover this item in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, in the course of responding to a Dáil question, I undertook to make a statement in relation to the grant-in-aid of the Irish Red Cross Society when presenting my Department's Estimates for 1988 to the House</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society was statutorily established on 1 July, 1939 in order to give effect to, and take advantage of certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions, to which Ireland had become a party.  It is an autonomous body with full power to control the administration of its affairs.  The accounts are audited by a fully qualified auditor appointed by the central council of the society.  Agreement was reached with the society in 1974 that its books and accounts would be available for inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  An annual grant-in-aid from the Vote for Defence is paid to the society.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid covers the following: (1) the normal activities of the society, including organisation of the society, payment of salaries of headquarters staff, general administration expenses, etc.; (2) refund of the actual expenses incurred by the society in maintaining the Naomh Aindrias Home for Refugees in Merrion Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.  This work was undertaken by the society in 1957 at the request of the Government who had acceded to a request from the United <Col N="550" /> Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; (3) grant towards the Society's Emergency Relief Fund; and (4) payment of the State's annual contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid provision for 1988 is £300,000.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Army Pensions Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1988 is for a net sum of £40,385,000, representing an increase of £678,000 for 2 per cent on the 1987 outturn.  The bulk of expenditure from the Estimate falls under Subhead E1 and covers retired pay, pensions and gratuities granted under the Defence Forces pensions schemes to former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.</P>
      <P>I might say also that, as part of the Government's decentralisation programme, approximately 200 of the staff of my Department &mdash; comprising roughly 40 per cent of the total &mdash; are to be transferred to Galway where they will occupy new offices at present being built on a State-owned site beside the military barracks at Renmore.  The review of the defence area was initiated some time ago. I announced its initiation at a press conference last August and gave a detailed outline of the position on 2 December last in the course of Question Time in the House.  There is a substantial amount of work to be undertaken by the members of that review group.  Their work is proceeding as speedily as possible and I am satisfied with the progress achieved to date.  I have no doubt but that the review process will do much to ensure that we have the most realistic and cost effective defence arrangements feasible and that all financial and other resources allocated to defence are put to the best possible use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 15 minutes at my disposal I propose to show that all is not well within our Defence Forces. The past year has seen a remarkable slide in morale.  That is a development which must be addressed in a positive and balanced way.  Ironically the reason this issue came to a head recently was because our Army gave the nation sterling service in aid of the civil power with their professional display of competence and ability in manning the fire-fighting and prison services during those recent strikes.  The Army put up a commendable performance in the course of those strikes. Even their most ardent critic must have been impressed by what they saw. However, many soldiers saw, at first hand, the kind of conditions that apply to civilians and could not but be envious of their pay and working conditions. Whether or not we like it, pay relativity becomes part of the equation.  Army pay is streets behind that of prison officers and firemen.  It is now recognised that soldiers' pay is so much behind there are suggestions that, were it not for the otherwise poor job prospects in the country, many soldiers would leave the Army overnight.  One has heard of countless cases of soldiers applying for the family income supplement to the Department of Social Welfare to augment their poor take-home pay, an issue which has been raised in the House on a number of occasions recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Army personnel are not entitled to overtime, as such but rather to an allowance.  I believe there are rumours in Government <Col N="552" /> circles at present that there are to be approximately 500 new recruits into the Army to replace in part &mdash; I stress, in part &mdash; the numbers leaving or retiring. I understand it is also hoped to identify areas in which overtime and-or allowances would be appropriate and to pay the personnel involved on that basis.  If this were to happen it would establish a most dangerous precedent for the Army. One might well ask: where would the demarcation line being and end?  I had always understood the basic concept of the Army was one of a team effort.  Certainly that will not constitute a resolution of the problem of low pay in the Army.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the much publicised study group at present investigating the future role of the Defence Forces were not requested by the Minister to examine Army pay and conditions when, at least, experts would be afforded an opportunity of saying what they believed to be the true position.  In my opinion this review body is about to produce a mouse, the only proposals being that a few barracks here and there will be closed, a little peripheral work, nothing more.</P>
    <P>The promotional structure in the Army is another disquieting feature.  Within the Irish Army command and control are exercised by way of a clearly defined command structure.  Each level of command and its subordinate units must have a commander of the appropriate rank to exercise operational and administrative command and control.  On account of the present embargo on recruitment to the Civil Service that command structure is in danger of disintegrating because the State is refusing to appoint replacement commanders of the required rank, as laid down under Defence Force regulations. Normally these commanders would be replaced by way of the process of promotion which has also been suspended. What is happening is that an officer of a more junior rank is being put into the post and expected by the Government to assume the extra duties and responsibilities without holding the required rank or receiving the extra pay.  For example, lieutenants are now holding captains' <Col N="553" /> posts, captains are holding commandants' posts, lieutenants-colonels holding colonels' posts and, in some cases, colonels filling two such posts. Clearly that is not good for Army morale.</P>
    <P>The present lack of promotion in the Army causes considerable problems, such as the possibility of commanding officers' authority being undermined by the fact that they are now required to command officers of the same rank and, in some cases, a subordinate could be senior to a commanding officer in years experience.  This is reflected throughout the various ranks, in that corporals will now be required to undertake sergeants' work, carry that level of responsibility and so on.  In my view this will lead simultaneously to a serious deterioration in morale, a problem already existing, and to an exodus of senior technical personnel to civilian jobs.  If the civilian jobs were more freely available this would become more apparent.  There will be an exodus of young, enthusiastic officers because they will have no career prospects and they will certainly want to get out and the undermining of the military command structure will be very serious.  The Minister, despite his best efforts, is not coming across as a person who can fight the case for the Army and the Defence Forces where it counts most, around the Cabinet table and, in particular, with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The purchase of new rifles for the Army was badly botched.  As we all know in this House, value for money must be our motto.  As legislators, we must make and be seen to make decisions to protect the taxpayer.  To provide rifles for our 11,000 strong Army is a big undertaking at any time but to provide them at this stage, given our perilous financial predicament, requires the best negotiating skills available.  I understand we are about to take possession of the initial cargo of Steyr rifles from Austria. Despite my best efforts I did not get the information in the House but I am told the cost is about £2 million which is part of an overall cost of between £6 million and £8 million for the entire consignment. I want to put it on record that I have <Col N="554" /> nothing whatsoever against the Steyr rifle.  Experts inform me that it is a very good rifle.  However, I am deeply concerned that the authorities did not deal with or seem to negotiate with the Colt Corporation of America for an equally good rifle at a fraction of the cost.</P>
    <P>I have here today a copy of the tender document submitted by the Colt Corporation together with the sales information which leads me to believe some terrible messing must have been done with the contract.  I will now quote from the details which were sent to the Department by the Colt Corporation:</P>
    <P>Reference is made to the Colt Firearms offer to the Irish Defence Forces for M16 A2 rifles submitted through your Department against your outstanding RFQ.</P>
    <P>We wish to confirm herewith that said proposal also can be entirely or partially financed through the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) funding system.</P>
    <P>The funding could be made available in the form of grants (MAP) which would, in effect, render a purchase of M16 A2 rifles free of charge to the Republic of Ireland.  Colt can assist in obtaining such grants.</P>
    <P>The purchase could be made directly from Colt but financed <i>gratis</i> with the above funds.</P>
    <P>The document then goes on to refer when arrangements could be made.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister directly in the House today to tell me &mdash; in fact I asked the question at Question Time &mdash; whether the lowest tender was accepted.  I was told on that occasion that the lowest tender was accepted.  I would like to see the details of the contract of the Steyr rifles which could be anything less than that.  I understand the basic reason the Americans would want to give those type of rifles away is a particular funding system they have to protect that industry in the US.  Can it be proven that we spent between £5 million and £8 million more on rifles than we should have?  It is extremely difficult to expect people who have seen hospital services closed down <Col N="555" /> because of additional expenditure less than £.5 million to accept that this is good government.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be asked many questions following the publication of that document.  I would like to know who negotiated with the Steyr company in Austria?  What factors influenced the Government to purchase the Steyr rifles, given the background?  Was there an agent involved, and if so, had he any connection with our own forces?  What efforts were made to investigate the Colt tender?  Were the Government aware of the potential savings to the Exchequer by purchasing in the United States?  I hope the Minister will reply to these questions later on today.  The Minister's attitude at Question Time so far of hiding behind the so-called confidential military file will not wash on this occasion.  It is important that the House and the electorate are made fully aware of the details of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the Air Corps Rescue Helicopter Service.  Since the Air Corps have taken possession of the Dauphin range of rescue helicopters and now that the pilots have completed their night time flying training, I strongly urge the decentralisation of the service to cover the western part of the country.  The case for the placement of the rescue helicopters in the areas of greatest risk of accidents at sea speaks for itself.  The Minister is displaying little regard for the lives of fishermen who battle against angry seas off the west coast.  His only contribution at Question Time a few weeks ago was that financially such a move was impossible, that it would cost £3 million to provide landing and take off facilities for such a service, not to mention the plethora of staff necessary to man such a project.</P>
    <P>This is quite ridiculous and, as every interest group from here to Donegal knows, there is very little point in having all the helicopters based at the aerodrome in Baldonnel at a time when most of the tragedies are happening 150 miles away. We already have a very fine airport network in the West, at Knock, Galway, <Col N="556" /> Castlebar, Sligo to name but a few.  Is the Minister telling the House that these facilities cannot accommodate a rescue helicopter?  The Minister could put 50 of them in Knock, 20 in Galway, &mdash; we have no shortage of space whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not in favour of putting a helicopter where he should put it.  I think the Minister is beginning to find that out.  The ability to react quickly to an emergency call at sea is the hallmark of any rescue operation. Does it not make great sense to have helicopters stationed 100 to 150 miles nearer the potential tragedy?  At this stage it is not a question of if, when, or how; it is a question of immediate action. In my view, this initial move should be made and announced not later than 1 October 1988.</P>
      <P>It is with regret that I learn that the Department of Defence have suspended the purchase of horses for the Army equitation school for this year.  I notice the Minister in his opening remarks referred to the numbers he purchased last year and, if I remember correctly, I complimented him on that last year.  This is a serious blow and is another example of the mixed-up priorities which seem to exist in the Department at present.  It is a serious blow to our bloodstock industry. Many people are very worried that the best of our blood horses will be sold outside the country and that we will not be able to retain them for future training. When you take the Army buyers out of the system this creates a problem for our horsebreeders.  The decision to cut in half the participation by our Army jumping team at the International Show this year is a great blow.  We paid too many millions of pounds for rifles and we reduced the funding for our appearances at the international shows which would positively support the Irish horse industry and greatly help tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to talk on this Estimate.  It affords us an opportunity to ask some fundamental questions.  In relation to the part of the Estimate relating to marine pollution counter-measures, I am disappointed that that Estimate remained static despite the increasing threat of marine pollution and the threat to the ecological environment around us, particularly in the wake of the recent revelations that the Government are probably not getting accurate information in relation to toxicity and the radioactive material being dumped in the Irish Sea.  Even within the Estimate there should be a re-examination of whether or not resources should be reassigned to that element of the Estimate because of the obvious threat and the failure of the Government to counteract in any significant way the degeneration of the environment, particularly the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never understood the unnatural obsession with secrecy when it comes to trying to elicit information in this area. Deputy Connaughton referred to this difficulty. It has been a standard cant of successive administrations and Ministers to offer, on a minimal pretext, the excuse that the cause of national security disallows the answering of serious fundamental questions in this House.  That excuse has been offered as a smokescreen to frustrate any serious examination of the fundamental questions which should be asked about the Defence Forces.  They are not questions about showjumping representation abroad or about how a specific contract has been handled, although in their own way those questions are significant.  They are more fundamental questions.  The US Government, where military matters are significant for all of us, recently concluded a fundamental blue ribbon examination of their Defence Forces by an independent commission, the report of which has been sent to every nationally elected public representative in the United States.  In the light of that I cannot understand how the most banal, simple <Col N="558" /> request in this House has to be frustrated by the reference to national security.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister recall that he represents us in this matter and he should not be befuddled or confused by suggestions from the military or Defence Forces that aspects of information will somehow subvert the system if they are given to people who have a mandate to ask for them? That is what is happening.  I stand for the peoples' right to know, unless there is an absolutely clear indication that there is some serious and fundamental danger to national security.  Many of the questions, including the questions referred to by Deputy Connaughton, relating, for example, to the systems in place for handling contracts, are not about national security but about how this Government and other Governments spend taxpayers' money.  In that context the public and Members of this House have a right to know.  At the moment it suits the Defence Forces and the military to have things as they are and to have compliant Ministers unthinkingly offering that easy excuse any time serious questions are being asked by serious representatives whose last concern is to put at risk the national security.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental question relates to the role of the Defence Forces in 1988. Year after year Estimates are discussed in a superfical way and are approved, in some cases having been committed or spent already.  In this case, practically 80 per cent of the Estimate goes for salaries and pensions and 20 per cent for procurement, without any fundamental examination being carried out on the role and purpose of today's Army.  What purposes do the Defence Forces serve?  Have those purposes been determined by the Dáil or are they rooted in some form of historic evolution the genesis of which goes back to the events of 1919 and 1923? Could some of the duties be achieved by an alternative force, under, for example the Department of Justice, for considerably less than the sum of money we are voting on today?  There is a need to ask a fundmental question.  The role of today's Army predominantly is to defend the neutrality of the State in the event of <Col N="559" /> another war, to pursue and combat IRA terrorism, to provide fishery protection and to be a guarantor of last resort in the event of civil disobedience or breakdown in public utility services.  In every one of those areas there is ample evidence that the Defence Forces as we know them are ill-equipped or over-equipped depending on which facet one looks at.</P>
    <P>In terms of an international military role &mdash; I know we are not supposed to say it, but it is true, &mdash; we do not have any chance of defending ourselves against military invasion from a superior power. Dozens of countries around the world manage to order their affairs in the realisation that they are similarly deficient.  We do not have the resources to prevent any superior power from occuping this country and we never will have them.  If that is a facet of the basis for maintaining the Army, it is time we were a little more honest about accepting certain inevitabilities if they were to arise.  That is not to say that we should not do all we can at international fora to try to ensure that that does not come about.  We should bear in mind that there is also a moral question for us in asking some 13,500 soldiers to make the ultimate sacrifice if necessary in the pursuit of hopeless ideals.  We have an obligation to face some of these questions.  For the men and women in the front line that is the ultimate question and many have given that ultimate sacrifice.</P>
    <P>We should not easily assume that because there has been an Army at a certain strength, equipped in a certain way, aspiring to achieve certain objectives which none of us have questioned in recent years, that that is the way it will always be.  Our needs for defence against terrorism and for fishery protection could in some respects be achieved more efficiently and cost-effectively by a major change in the present structure of the Department of Defence and the reallocation of some of those duties many of which are quasi-police duties, to those areas of the Department of Justice or other Departments better equipped to deal with them.  Those quasi-military <Col N="560" /> duties could come within the ambit of the Department of Justice.  That precise exercise was carried out in 1948 in Costa Rica.  I am told that at the time that country had similar problems to us and apparently it improved effectiveness and public expenditure in these areas.  I simply raise the question not as someone who pretends to know all the answers but as someone who believes that if we ask the right questions perhaps we will get some of the answers eventually.</P>
    <P>All military establishments, including ours, and perhaps all Government Departments, have a voracious appetite for new equipment.  They constantly order new equipment despite the fact that much of it is clearly irrelevant to our needs.  It is very hard to understand what relevance the purchase of surface-to-air missiles or heavy tanks has to the objectives which are reasonably achievable by an Irish Army, apart from simply whetting the appetites of young men and women who see the Army as a career and perhaps in some cases placating the egos of some of the people at the top in military establishment who believe it is important for us to ape large military powers.  That is not in any way to denigrate the importance of the job they do but simply to suggest that it is the job of this House and the Government to make these decisions because the shape, role and function of the Defence Forces are ultimately political questions and the job of the Defence Forces is to execute those decisions in daily practice.  I believe that defence policy is being shaped in the reverse and that the Minister is responding to requests and accepting blindly in many cases the demands of the military for certain types of equipment without questioning their legitimacy in the context of clearly defined roles.</P>
    <P>I am far more interested in the kind of debate which asks what is the function and purpose of the Army today, and which even asks the basic question do we need an Army today.  I believe that there is an argument for an Army but I do not believe that the Army as they at present exist are properly organised or equipped <Col N="561" /> or have a clear set of objectives from the Government.  I do not think we can blame the Army in that context.  Some of the things we are doing are at odds with our total rejection of the use of military force as a legitimate means of achieving national goals and of our espousal of neutrality as a way of achieving ends both nationally and internationally.  A far clearer and more succinct and refined definition for the Army, in harmony with the principle of neutrality, scaled down from the point of view of equipment to relate to the precise needs which are achievable by us would lend efficiency to the Army and lend weight to our role internationally as a neutral nation which has a full understanding both of the opportunities that are presented to us and of the limitations with which we have to deal.  These are important questions because they are ultimately life and death issues.</P>
    <P>I think the Defence Forces today have evolved from the needs of the War of Independence and the Civil War.  We are basically trying to maintain, on a military scale, a traditionally organised military force which parallels those of much larger and richer states such as the UK, France and Germany.  The purpose of that force and their thinking and orientation is not very clear.  It is not clear to me, and I do not believe it is clear to anyone in this House, especially in the light of our policy on military neutrality.  There is a lack of interest in asking these basic questions.  I have not heard a debate in this House which answers those questions.  This may be because two commonly held assumptions are, of course, always bathed in the inevitable reference to &ldquo;the sterling work being done&rdquo;.  That is the kind of security vest we all wear lest we be militarily attacked from the right or left for being less than enthusiastic about the job anyone is doing.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they are doing sterling work.  I assume they are and I commend the individual officers and the people whom I know are doing such <Col N="562" /> work.  However, that does not mean that we do not have an obligation to ask searching questions.  Because the Army consume, broadly speaking, something of the order of 1.2 per cent of GNP some people may have the idea that they are not that important.  That figure is very substantial because it represents something like 36 per cent of the interest we pay on foreign debt.</P>
    <P>I want to give examples of the role the Army have played in quasi-police duties. In one year alone the Army provided 11,000 parties for Border duties, 9,500 for check points and 15,000 for patrols. They provided 900 escorts for transporting explosives and blasting operations, 4,500 escorts for transporting cash and had 150 bomb disposal team requests.  Some of these tasks, and in particular the latter one, are for the military only but others are clearly not.  I want to know if someone is thinking the whole thing through.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making some comments on the Estimate for the Department of Defence and on the Estimate for Army Pensions.  I believe the Minister has missed the opportunity of clarifying many of the issues raised by Deputy Keating and his statement to the House did not reflect the serious situation which now exists in relation to the Defence Forces.  We are talking about an Estimate of considerable value, £252 million.  This is a very large figure when we consider the situation of the public finances.  It represents about one-fifth of the Health Estimate.  I regret that far more in-depth information was not forthcoming in relation to some of the subheads and it looks like we will not have the opportunity of eliciting that information from the Minister.  I should like the Minister to give us a breakdown of the cuts in these very important subheads.  I should also like to ask the reason for the 400 per cent increase in consultancy fees during the last year.  Is this in line with Government policy generally? The increase in consultancy fees seem to be the only increase taking place in the Department at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very worried about the allocation <Col N="564" /> to the Civil Defence.  The 32 per cent cut in this allocation, on top of the 9 per cent cut last year, is very serious for the Civil Defence.  They play an important role and I believe they will play an even more important role in the future.  This reduction could lead to the Civil Defence becoming an nonentity and this is a dangerous downturn.  I ask the Minister whether he has had any liaison with the Minister for Energy in relation to this subhead because I understand that the new emergency plan for dealing with nuclear accidents which will be published shortly will contain a major role for the Civil Defence, a role which the Civil Defence exercised and displayed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl incident.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify to us whether there will be a supplementary Estimate which will cater for the major role the Civil Defence will have under the new emergency plan.  If he has not we will have the typical situation where two Departments will be working together without any co-ordination between them.  At the end of the day, while the Minister for Energy may hold out that the Civil Defence will be in a position and equipped financially and otherwise to deal with a second Cher-nobyl-type accident should it occur, the Minister for Defence will not be in a position to give the Civil Defence the resources that are necessary because he has not included them in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The whole substance of the Estimate is very worrying indeed.  There are cuts upon cuts which were imposed last year. Every second subhead, ranging from the instore provisions, transport supplies, educational courses and monitoring of pollution, has been cut.  What we are left with is a substandard military force which will have second-rate equipment.  This is obviously not good for the morale of the Defence Forces, and morale is at its lowest ebb since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Promotional opportunities are limited if not excluded altogether.  Numerous <Col N="565" /> personnel are attempting to leave the force and many are serving practically under duress because their applications for permission to leave have been refused by the Minister.  This is a reflection of the inadequate provisions that have been made by the Minister for payment and promotional opportunities for the Defence Forces.  It is unfortunate that many well qualified and skilled personnel want to leave.  It also reflects the disparity between the public and private sectors, and this is something which will have to be attended to because there is little point in having people in the Defence Forces, particularly in the senior ranks, if they are requesting permission to leave on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>Army personnel are used in many roles not strictly related to defence, such as civic duties, industrial disputes etc., and we should all be very grateful to have them on these occasions.  Circumstances vary from time to time but one notable aspect is that basic pay and working conditions are falling far behind the average industrial wage as time goes by, leading to many members of the Army applying for the family income supplement.  This is a sad reflection on the consideration being given by the Government to the Army personnel.  Has the Minister any particular plans to try to give the Army an increase, particularly the lower ranks of the Army where basic pay is very meagre indeed?  This obviously puts people under a lot of pressure and, as has been said already, when people in the Army become aware of the salaries being paid to both the Garda and the prison officers they certainly feel that they are the poor relation.  In addition to the lack of promotional opportunity, the cutback in educational courses is a step in the wrong direction because it limits the possibilities for Army personnel to better themselves and increase their skills.  This is also a contributory factor to the present low morale.</P>
    <P>What I find very disappointing is what the Minister said about air and sea rescue. <Col N="566" /> Earlier this week I sought information from the Minister's Department in relation to the ongoing debate about the location of the helicopter rescue service to the west coast.  On that occasion I was informed that the Minister would be making a statement today in the course of the Estimates.  I would call that the wrong lead of the year because the statement is a total non-statement which will be seen with dismay by people involved in trying to convince the Government of the necessity to locate at least one helicopter on the west coast.  I would have thought that the Minister, in courtesy, could have outlined to the House the technical problems as he sees them, the financial problems and the personnel difficulties with locating a helicopter on the west coast.  The lack of urgency the Minister is displaying in relation to this matter is an indictment of the system.  He outlined the problem of the hostile environment on the west coast and the risks taken by fishermen and others in using boats.  If the Minister's statement here today is the only amount of urgency he can give to addressing this problem it is a sad reflection on himself and his Department.  I would have expected the Minister to tell us what he intends doing with the helicopters when they are fully in service and outline whether or not the Government will be locating a helicopter on the west coast.  I would consider that to be the most urgent requirement at present.  This matter is a serious deficiency in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Over all it is a serious matter for a country to run down its defence forces even though, as Deputy Keating said, its effectiveness in a general military sense is obviously quite limited.  There is perhaps a need for an open debate in the House on whether or not we should consider redeployment or integration of the Defence Forces generally with the Garda.  We should strengthen the naval side of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The cuts that have been made and that are to be made in the course of this year <Col N="567" /> have gone dangerously far.  They will not improve morale which will continue to deteriorate.  In fact morale has sunk so low that it will be very difficult to rebuild it.  There will be no encouragement for people to join the Defence Forces when they see the finest people in the forces leaving as soon as they get the opportunity. The situation where people are trying to leave and being refused permission to do so by the Minister reflects insufficient advance planning in providing the back-up personnel required for the flying of the aircraft.  It is because of this that the Minister has no option but to refuse this permission to the pilots who are trying to get out of the Air Corps. They then have no choice, because of the terms of their contract with the Army, but to stay and serve.  One must ask questions about the quality of service these men will be giving when they would prefer to be out of the Defence Forces. One cannot blame these people for wanting to leave because they see far better opportunities outside.  Many are men with young families who are under financial pressure and want to avail of career opportunities which exist outside the Defence Forces.  The Minister should take urgent steps, by way of extra training to make more pilots available to fly the aircraft for the Air Corps to ensure that the people who are serving in the Defence Forces are doing so willingly and not because they are bound, by contract, to do so because this cannot augur well for the future of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>One aspect which frequently raises its head is the question of the expense of carrying money.  I would like to ask the Minister if, in the past 12 months, he has had any discussions with the banking groups in regard to them funding some of the charges which arise.  The expenditure is considerable and, at the end of the day, it is a service being provided to the financial institutions and they should be asked to make a contribution to it.</P>
    <P>The cuts are excessive.  The Defence <Col N="568" /> Forces are being run down constantly. The back-up services are practically non-existent; training, if any, for the next 12 months will be minimal in both the reserve force and the Civil Defence.  The Minister has a serious task ahead of him if he is to give the necessary support to people who are carrying out a difficult job at the best of times.</P>

In particular will he outline for many people living in the western coastal areas from Donegal to Kerry and west Cork his plans and his programme for the location of the Dauphin helicopters, one of which we hope to have on the west coast.  Perhaps, this is the most serious matter facing him as Minister for Defence and I would like him to give some indication of the location because in his contribution today there was no indication whatever about it and it is a matter of great urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I would like to contribute briefly to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  I wish to address the question of conditions, pay and other areas within the Defence Forces today.  I note the Minister's remarks appreciating the very fine corps of men and women we have in the armed forces.  In the course of his speech he referred to them as well trained and disciplined people whose normal duties involve many demanding security tasks. He indicated that their commitment to duty and loyalty to him, as head of the armed forces, was very much appreciated. I wonder whether that appreciation can ever be translated into decent wage <Col N="569" /> and working conditions for members of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>In that regard I speak primarily of the majority of ordinary non-commissioned members whose lot is certainly not a happy one, and is far less happy than that of their commanding officers.  A very sharp distinction exists in the forces between the conditions pertaining for those at ground level as against those at command level.  There is a sharp contrast of lifestyle, remuneration, facilities and of privilege that makes the position of the ordinary member of the armed forces extremely difficult to accept.  While many speakers have referred at length to the morale, the discipline, the spirit, the <i>esprit de corps,</i> this within the forces is not something that particularly impresses me.  I am a parliamentarian.  I am not used to the terminologies and notions of military life and I make an assessment of all of that as a member of The Workers' Party and as a socialist.</P>
      <P>The point has been made here that we are expecting all of these men and women to undertake the demanding security tasks that are so necessary on a daily basis within the State and, indeed, abroad for what amounts to a pittance.  The Minister, in outlining the levels of remuneration, to some degree simply accentuated that point.  On 11 May of this year, at Question Time, he conceded that the average industrial wage, including over-time and other duties, amounted to £199.41.  The start of wage for a recruit is £113 which can rise in time, after training, to £150.  After three years the maximum basic wage which a recruit can earn is £175 or thereabouts, that is, on the assumption that there will be some basic promotion, at least to a three star, which he believes occurs within the first year of service as a full recruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems that exists is that promotions within the armed forces, as I understand it, have been frozen and the prospects for new recruits because of the level of cutbacks and the embargo on <Col N="570" /> recruitment, are nil.  There is general dissatisfaction amongst all Opposition parties in the House regarding the philosophy of cutbacks, simply for the sake of cutting back.  Where they reflect and impinge directly on the working conditions of so many people, who are in very harsh conditions, they cannot be tolerated and will not be supported.  The basic increase in overall wages allowed under the Estimate is 2 per cent over last year's Estimate.  In that context it is interesting to note that the increase affordable for chaplains and clergy is 5 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister would explain how he hopes to keep an even development within the small concessions of Government to pay increases in the coming months.  How does he hope to achieve the targets set by him and the Government in negotiation with the national parties, given a simple across the board increase of 2 per cent on the pay allocation of the Permanent Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister attempted to enhance the advantages available, the way forward and the progress being made by him and his Department in the area of wages.  He spent a lot of time explaining the higher percentage rates of 4 per cent and upwards in respect of special allowances, for example, the Border duty allowance etc.  I suggest that that is not the way to approach pay within any area of work but most particularly within the area of defence and the armed forces.  I cannot believe that the Minister will continue a policy that seeks to draw commitment to duty on the &ldquo;perk&rdquo; of the extra money.  The way to do it is to increase and maintain at a reasonable level the basic wage and that would encourage and sustain commitment to duty including the more unsociable types of duty, for example, prison and Border duties.</P>
    <P>In that regard I want to ask the Minister if the reports in the national media are accurate and will he respond to the report, carried in at least one of the <Col N="571" /> national newspapers on 3 May of this year, that the rate of pay for an ordinary soldier for special duties, Border or prison on a daily basis for a 24 hour shift, is £6.50 during the week and at the weekend rises to the magical figure &mdash; for a 24 hour unbroken shift &mdash; of £13.65.  I would like to know if those figures are accurate and, if so, how can anyone justify that level of pay.  I did not even bother to work out what it amounts to as a rate per hour but you are talking about pence rather than pounds.  I wonder whether the reports are accurate and I ask the Minister to clarify this.</P>
    <P>Another point which must be made concerns the disturbing increase of reliance on the family income supplement scheme.  When it was introduced we were told by the Minister responsible that it was a scheme to try to help people to stay in lowly paid work as opposed to opting out and going onto social welfare benefit.  It is a scheme that must have absolutely nothing to do with persons working in the armed forces because we cannot afford in a committed and disciplined Army to have people so close to the breadline as to come within the terms of a scheme designed to help them not to opt out and go on welfare.  Is that the kind of armed forces we want to develop? Is that the kind of commitment we expect now of our Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>The FIS was never designed in its inception and conception as having anything to do with persons working in the Permanent Defence Forces.  It has become so much relied upon now because of the poor level of basic pay that the Minister must address himself to it to the extent, if he has to be, of finding a more equitable base of pay between the higher levels of staff within the Defence Forces and those on the ground or by redeploying resources from administration to other areas.  I do not know how it is to be done but this position cannot be allowed to continue unabated much longer.  I am sure the Minister cannot be <Col N="572" /> happy with that and I invite him to assure the House that the problem is being addressed within his Department and at Cabinet level where necessary.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of concern which must be addressed in the Estimate in regard to employment and employment conditions is women within the armed forces.  We spoke earlier on the Estimate for Labour, about the discrimination that exists in certain aspects of the employment and Manpower schemes for people signing on for unemployment assistance but not in receipt of payment.  Here it is far more fundamental and basic discrimination. There has been virtually no if any recruitment of women into the Permanent Defence Forces in the last number of years.  The basic grounds advanced by the Minister are put forward on three levels. First, women are considered, for some reason, to be non-combatant and there is at present a need for recruitment of combatants within the permanent Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister to tell the House, beyond the isolated incidents abroad in Lebanon and elsewhere where in the pursuit of peace keeping there have been regrettable incidents of aggression shown to our Permanent Defence Force members there, where any other male member of the Defence Forces has been involved in a combatant position or posture. It just does not exist and this argument that men are needed above women just does not stand up in the argument on the need for combatants.  It is also suggested that there is not an interest generally abroad among women in applying for recruitment to the armed forces. This is a myth that has to be addressed and dispelled.  I do not believe the Minister has the slightest basis, statistically or otherwise, for suggesting that is the case.</P>
    <P>The final argument being advanced incessantly by the Minister at Question Time here is that apprentices must live in and we do not have suitable accommodation for live-in recruits and apprentices. I suggest there is a scheme whereby you can allow apprentices to join up and <Col N="573" /> be available on the basis that they are boarded out.  That has been done in respect of a number of male recruits; I do not see why it cannot apply to women. Again, I believe the Minister and his Department cannot be happy with that aspect.  Why is it persistent and why can something not be done to address the whole spirit of equality in employment and the whole notion of fair play to all sectors?  I hope the Minister will address that in the coming year and that we will have a change of attitude with regard to it.</P>
    <P>I am glad I have had the opportunity to contribute before the Minister of State because I understand he will be having regard to the area of local defence.  A problem that has come to my attention and that of members of The Workers' Party is that in some quarters recruits, aspirant recruits and members of the local Defence Forces are being quizzed and subjected to interrogation by their superior officers with regard to trade union and political party affiliation or membership.  This is a very undesirable practice.  Certainly, there is need for security, but the issue of a person's political beliefs or trade union activity should not be of concern to the officers in charge.</P>
    <P>Finally, can the Minister advise me in respect of two items?  Subhead W. 10 is in respect of hire of baths.  I ask him to explain that.  The figure is significant.  I do not want to say any more in case we are talking about different kinds of baths; swimming or washing, I am not too sure. Could the necessity of that be explained to the House?  Subhead Z. 11 relates to the repayment of sums advanced to officers for the purchase of motor cars. Is this some perk available to officers only?  Could the Minister elucidate a little more on it and advise us what it is about? Is that type of scheme available for the ordinary defence member?</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the whole approach to working conditions within the armed forces at the moment. I believe they are central to a proper and <Col N="574" /> advancing, well meaning force.  It is a matter for all of us to see that proper, humane conditions exist and that the spit and polish attitude of another era does not persist as a reason for expecting our men and women to live and work in unsatisfactory conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I comment on the 1988 allocation for Civil Defence, I would like to inform the House that I was very glad to have the opportunity earlier this year of visiting the Irish contingent serving with the United Nations Interim Force in the Middle East.  The visit enabled to me to see at first hand the situation and conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate.  I was very impressed with their operations, expertise and the high degree of morale among the troops. I sometimes think that we here at home are not fully aware of the excellent job our troops do abroad.  I have found them to be extremely conscientious and professional and I know they enjoy a very good reputation with the local people in that part of the world.  They are indeed a great credit to our country.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for Civil Defence, it is my duty and pleasure to comment on the provision for the organisation.  The provision of £1.765 million for Civil Defence in 1988 emphasises the Government's commitment to the maintenance and improvement of this essential component of national defence.  The provision in this year's Estimate is very similar indeed to the provision last year.  The amount of money spent last year was greater.  The difference can be explained by an additional payment by way of grant-in-aid made to local authorities late last year for expenditure incurred in previous years.  The Estimate this year is very similar to the Estimate of the previous year. There is no change; there is no cut whatever as has been suggested in the House this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The primary role of Civil Defence is to mitigate the effects of war on the civilian population.  There is also the very important secondary role of assiting in the relief of distress in the event of any peacetime disaster such as flooding, fire, bizzard or train crash.  The peacetime role now also includes certain responsibilities in the event of nuclear accident abroad, for which plans are being developed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Civil Defence organisation are a volunteer force organised under the local authorities for the purposes of both the wartime and peacetime roles.  Therefore, the bulk of the provision will be allocated to these local authorities by way of grant aid usually at the rate of 70 per cent of their actual expenditure for Civil Defence purposes. This grant goes towards local authority expenditure on administration, including staffing, publicity, training, exercises, competitions and week-end camps, maintenance of equipment and the construction and maintenance of Civil Defence county and city control centres.</P>
    <P>My Department are very conscious and appreciative of the effective role which the local authorities play in the provision of Civil Defence services &mdash; the warden service which is vital to the warning and monitoring role, the rescue, casualty, welfare services and the auxiliary fire service, which are self explanatory.</P>
    <P>An element of the Civil Defence provision is allocated to the purchase of equipment for the use of the various services. Deputies will be aware that substantial stocks of dose rate radiation meters and other instruments have been acquired for local authorities with a capability of reading doses of radiation likely in wartime.  In addition to these instruments, a number of low level radiation meters have also been supplied to each local authority to enable the reading of low levels of radiation such as can arise from peacetime incidents involving <Col N="576" /> nuclear power stations.  A further quantity of these latter instruments is being acquired this year.</P>
    <P>Various other purchase programmes are also being continued this year to cater for the needs of Civil Defence services and some new equipment is being bought.  A supply of sirens for the warden service warning and monitoring operations is envisaged for the first time.  A third instalment of 1,250 first aid kit bags will be acquired for the casualty service, and personnel and equipment vehicles to provide replacements for existing wornout vehicles.</P>
    <P>The purchase of higher level communications equipment for training and operations is being continued this year with the acquisition of a further 50 handportable radios, 30 mobile radios and a base repeater.  Provision of modern PABX telephone systems for control centres will also continue this year and next year and, when completed, will provide a fully effective modern control network from national through regional to county level.  This will be a key improvement in the method of reporting the results of any fallout monitoring by the warden service and the conveyance of appropriate warning to the public.</P>
    <P>Significant purchases have been made in recent years to help each of the five services and each active volunteer.  Newly designed uniforms have been purchased in large quantities as well as Civil Defence denims for volunteers in the field.  This year money has been allocated for the purchase of showerproof suits for volunteers and for other articles of uniform. I can honestly say that Civil Defence has never been better equipped and this Government's commitment to further equipment purchases is continuing this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that other recent developments in Civil Defence include production of an updated version of the booklet <i>Bás Nó Beatha.</i> It is entitled <i>Survival</i> and provides advice relevant to householders <Col N="577" /> in urban and rural areas to protect themselves from the effects of nuclear weapons. The new booklet has been circulated on a limited basis.  I hope also to have a TV video prepared this year on this subject.</P>
    <P>A Civil Defence information package is currently being distributed to schools around the country and will provide material for pupils on the role of Civil Defence and its function in society.</P>
    <P>These developments show this Government's enthusiasm for Civil Defence and the continuation of this level of spending is necessary to ensure that the optimum state of preparedness is reached and maintained and that it can perform effectively in the face of a threat of the magnitude of global nuclear warfare.</P>
    <P>Some people might say that in view of the treaties to do away with certain classes of nuclear weapons signed in Geneva recently and the prospect of further reduction in the size of the super powers' nuclear arsenals, there is no need for Civil Defence.  This is far from true. While every sane person welcomes the prospect of disarmament, even a 50 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear weapons would leave 25,000 nuclear warheads on this planet.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that there is no conflict of interest between the objective of Civil Defence and the objective of global nuclear disarmament but while even the remotest prospect of nuclear war exists, this country needs an effective Civil Defence organisation which is capable of monitoring radiation and advising the public of measures for its protection.</P>
    <P>The radiation threat to this country is not just confined to the prospect of nuclear war.  I mentioned earlier the possibility of peacetime nuclear accidents. Within a few hundred miles of this country there are a number of nuclear reactors, the reliability of which cannot be regarded as guaranteed.  The lessons of Chernobyl have not been lost on this country and Civil Defence must be prepared to provide an important supportive <Col N="578" /> role in dealing with any such future emergency.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the responsibilities of Civil Defence in wartime and its activities in the event of a peacetime nuclear accident.  Other peacetime roles implemented recently include search-and-rescue, marshalling, first-aid at community events, rescue at gas explosions, medical aid at accidents, ambulance services, welfare service to help refugees, evacuation and sand-bagging at floods; the list is extensive.  This peacetime service is not only of obvious value to the community but it is also cost effective given that all Civil Defence members are volunteers.  These peacetime activities are not only worthy of our support but should be encouraged to develop further.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight a feature of this organisation that goes beyond the merely material or financial and I want to focus on personal commitment.  I am talking about the personal commitment of the 20,000 active volunteers in the organisation who give of their free time to perform a task for their community. We often tend to look at the negative aspects of the world today, the evils of materialism, the breakdown of the old community spirit and the growth of the &ldquo;what is in it for me&rdquo; type of society. We have an example in Civil Defence of people who put the good of the community before personal comforts and who give of their time and effort without asking anything in return.</P>
    <P>This is something in which we can all express pride and I know that Deputies will join with me in thanking and congratulating the members.  This membership includes, of course, many members of the voluntary aid societies, the Red Cross, Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade to whom the thanks of all of us is also due.  I congratulate the many thousands of volunteers who, weekend after weekend, take part in exercises and attend functions. The purpose of all this is to aid members of the community and the <Col N="579" /> Government give Civil Defence their fullest support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This form of Estimate debate is unsatisfactory as far as the allocation of time is concerned.  It is totally inadequate and does not enable me to give answers to the questions which Deputy Keating posed.  However, I am eating into my own time.</P>
      <P>I am not given to making wild or exaggerated statements and when I say that the morale of the Army is at its lowest point since the demoralisation following the widespread demobilisation at the end of the Civil War I am reflecting the present state of morale in the Defence Forces.  Let me immediately say, however, that the loyalty of the Defence Forces is still, as high as ever, and though clearly interlinked we should not confuse loyalty and morale.</P>
      <P>The reason for the current poor morale in the Defence Forces is quite simple. The Government have treated the Defence Forces quite disgracefully.  It is ironic that the Minister in the course of his speech today said that the Government have allocated the necessary resources to maintain the services which underpin those institutions.  They have not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three areas in which the Government are guilty, areas which are fundamental to building a good morale. First, the numerical strength of the Defence Forces must be adequate to the tasks they are asked to do.  Secondly, they must be provided with equipment of a quality and in a quantity adequate to their needs.  Thirdly, the career structure they are offered when they join must be maintained during their service.  The question of pay would, of course, be another factor but the Defence Forces come under the national pay agreement like the rest of the public service and to that extent they are not special.  However, other Deputies <Col N="580" /> have made statements that I would sympathise with in regard to the level of pay for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The numbers of other ranks in the Defence Forces, privates and non-commissioned officers stand, according to the current Book of Estimates, at 11,600. That is a reduction of 850 since 1986.  It also includes approximately 800 men who are serving in Lebanon.  A reduction of 850 is proportionately a severe reduction in numbers but there has been no corresponding reduction in the duties to be carried out.  The same number of cash escorts, explosive escorts, Border patrols, garrison duties, security duties in the prisons and whatever may arise by way of emergency, still have to be carried out by a smaller number of men.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that he intends to recruit 500 personnel in, to quote his words, &ldquo;the near future&rdquo;.  I should like to ask the Minister to say when the recruitment campaign will start because, as I understand it, the pay subhead of his Estimate provides for the numbers referred to in the Estimate and not for the extra 500.  Will the personnel be recruited this year and, if so, how does the Minister propose paying for them? Those recruits will be very welcome to the Army.</P>
    <P>The inevitable result of not having enough men &mdash; even the extra 500 will not bring the number back to the 1986 level &mdash; is that the incidence of duty on the individual soldier is becoming intolerably heavy.  In some garrisons that are small in number &mdash; there are two such garrisons in my constituency; I am excluding Athlone which is a Command headquarters &mdash; the incidence of duty is as high as one in three.  I understand that means that a soldier goes on patrol or escort duties for a 24-hour shift, has then 24-hours resting off, goes back to the barracks on the third day for ordinary duties which may be a 12-hour day and on the fourth day he is back on the 24-hour duty cycle again.  That level of duty is not uncommon &mdash; in fact, it is common <Col N="581" />&mdash; and a moment's reflection will show that it leaves very little room for a normal social or domestic life.  It is driving men out of the Army in spite of the dire unemployment situation in civvy street.</P>
    <P>Matters have become so bad that I understand that the group of Army chaplains, uniquely, &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; have made representations, I do not know whether to the Minister or the military authorities about the level of duties.  Army chaplains in the discharge of their welfare role, a very important part of their function, see the damage being done to the family life of soldiers and the personal and domestic difficulties it is causing.  It is imperative that the Minister increase even further the numbers in the Defence Forces.  He should increase the numbers further than the 500 he intends recruiting.  We should recruit those people immediately because there are extensive lists of excellent applicants waiting to be called up.  When we reach the stage that the chaplains have to make representations because of the damage the Army incidence of duty is doing to the social lives of soldiers we are at a sorry state indeed.</P>
    <P>The morale of an army also depends on having an adequate amount of modern equipment and having available specimens of all military technology for instruction or training purposes.  These items are normally purchased under subhead H, Defensive Equipment, and I note there is a reduction of 33 per cent in the provision for 1988 as compared with 1987.  From my experience, and I have had a number of years experience, this would enable only essential maintenance and carry-over contracts to be paid for.  It would not, in my opinion &mdash; I would like the Minister to comment specifically on this &mdash; make any provision at all for new equipment in 1988.  This is soul-destroying for a professional army. Its members must when they meet their peers from other countries on Middle East or other service be in a position to <Col N="582" /> have at least a passing acquaintance with modern military technology.</P>
    <P>I also note that for the second year in succession the estimate for mechanical transport has been reduced and that a mere £990,000 has been made available for new vehicles.  Having regard to the immense demands made on the Land Rover fleet in carrying out all the escort duties, and having regard to the overall age profile of that fleet, it is essential that it is updated and modernised.  The fact that it is running at all is now, and was in my time, a great tribute to the personnel of the Supply and Transport Corps.  I am afraid that the Minister, because of the low level of money for new vehicles, is in grave danger of putting the Defence Forces in the position that it found itself in in 1969 when it had to hire private transport to move into new positions along the Border.  That was shameful and a disgrace and it should never be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>When a private or a cadet enters the Defence Forces he has an expectation of a career structure available to him on merit and in accordance with the normal passage of time.  Due to the heavy-handed application of the public service embargo in the Defence Forces on filling vacancies the normal promotion opportunities are not now available.  So far as I can ascertain there are approximately five vacancies in the rank of colonel, something like 15 or 16 in the rank of lieutenant-colonel and nearly 40 in the rank of commandant and proportionate vacancies in the rank of captain.  This is leading to ludicrous results and I understand that in one Command if things are not changed that within a month or a couple of months we will have the General Officer Commanding and the next highest officer in rank will be a commandant.</P>
    <P>Officers are filling appointments normally filled by higher ranks.  The saving is marginal because the pay of an officer at the highest grade of his rank very nearly equates to the pay of the lowest level of the next succeeding rank.  In <Col N="583" /> addition in the NCO ranks, there are hundreds of vacancies in the rank of corporal and sergeant and the frustration from lack of promotion opportunities, added to the unreasonably heavy incidence of duty, is a great worry.</P>
    <P>I had a number of questions to the Minister recently to try to establish what precisely was the position in regard to the impact of the embargo and the denial of promotions to officers and men.  I regret to have to say that I suspect his answers were framed to try to conceal the true position, contrary to the spirit which normally surrounds parliamentary questions and the answers to them.  For example, on 24 November 1987 I was told that the strength of the commandant rank at 31 October 1987 was 372.  Deputy Enda Kenny was told on 20 April that the strength of that rank on 31 March 1988 was 435, an increase of 63.  I am quite certain that there were not 63 promotions to the rank of commandant in that period. I call on the Minister to clear up the discrepancies in the replies he has given to various statistical questions regarding Army strength and vacancies in various ranks.</P>
    <P>The Minister was aware that I was trying to ascertain the effect of the embargo and it is a measure of his embarrassment on how it is affecting the Defence Forces that he tried to conceal the position from the Dáil.  I regret having to say that.  I cannot blame the Minister for being embarrassed because the position in the Army in regard to the lack of promotion opportunities is scandalous and is verging in the ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces do not have any associations, representative bodies or trade unions and when the Chief of Staff gives an order it is obeyed and there is no question of any group of members going to the High Court looking for an injunction.  We have taken the loyalty and efficiency of the Defence Forces for granted and have been able to do so with total confidence in a whole myriad of <Col N="584" /> disparate tasks over the past number of years.  They have provided sanitary services for the citizens of Dublin and Cork, they have provided fire brigade cover, have dealt with the consequences of an outbreak of fowl disease in Monaghan, have manned our prisons and have even enabled mental hospitals in the west to be maintained.  At the same time they have carried out their military and security duties with distinction and efficiency both at home and abroad.  They are deserving of the best attention of the Government because in the absence of associations &mdash; I hope there will never be associations in the Defence Forces and it is up to the Minister to ensure that a climate conducive to their growth does not emerge &mdash; members of the Defence Forces have to depend on the Government, and in particular on the Minister, and to a lesser extent on Members of the House, to speak for them.  That is why I am publicising these facts today.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the Minister, and the Government, have not treated the Defence Forces as they should have been treated.  I repeat that their loyalty is beyond question but if their morale continues to be eroded at the rate it is happening at the moment then even the question of loyalty has to come into focus and the present murmurings about representative bodies are, regrettably, understandable.  I urge the Minister not to confuse loyalty and morale.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience that when he is visiting the troops loyalty and discipline will cause them to give favourable responses to his questions about their well being, but he should not confuse that loyal response with the underlying morale.  I live in a garrison constituency and officers and men are punctilious about not approaching me; yet I cannot live in the middle of that society and remain ignorant and unaware of the drastic position pertaining in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces serve <Col N="585" /> alongside other units connected with State security who are paid far more than they are.  Nevertheless the Army personnel who served in Portlaoise in the recent emergency in the prison there have not yet been paid their special allowance for that difficult and unpleasant service, whereas the members of the Garda, who earn as an extra, four or five times per day what the Army personnel get by way of extra allowance, have long since been paid.  That is not good enough.  The Army know that they have been treated in an inferior fashion in comparison with the other forces.  This does not help their sense of morale or self-esteem.</P>
    <P>We should never forget that the Defence Forces are the ultimate defenders of our democracy and we must accord them the respect and the tangible and material recognition their role deserves.  There is an urgent problem facing the Minister and the Government in restoring conditions in the Army so as to ensure that the morale of that important unit of our society is kept at the level it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure in the budget of £250 million illustrates the price we as a nation pay for the presence in our midst of the IRA.  That is the real justification for having the Army.  It illustrates once again how deeply this nation has been hurt and injured by the presence in our midst of that despicable band, <Col N="586" /> irrespective of which grouping they come from.  As a Border Deputy, I want to pay my tribute to the Army and to their committment to the defence of this country. Living as I do in a garrison town, I have seen their dedication and commitment at first hand at all hours of the day and night in constant surveillance along the Border.  I have to be grateful on behalf of my constituents for their presence there, very often in the face of threats from paramilitaries of differing hues on the other side of the Border who have on occasion threatened to bomb the town of Dundalk and other Border towns.</P>
      <P>The role of the Army needs to be redefined. I should like to see the creation of special units trained to react in a national emergency and to take over as wardens in the jails so that this country would not be held to ransom by the intemperate demands of various groupings or irrational trade unionism.</P>
      <P>There is one matter about which I have complained over the past few years and I want to make my annual complaint once again.  I object to the use of Army escorts for the transportation of cash for banking institutions.  These institutions are awash with money taken from the backs of the Irish people and they should not be given this facility.  They should have to pay for it.  When we go into a bank we are charged for blinking an eye.  Perhaps much-needed money for the Defence Forces could be garnered in this way. There is no bank here which has not a healthy balance sheet and it is ridiculous to expect this facility at a time when we are closing hospitals and people cannot get a bed in which to die with dignity. This is an imposition which should be stopped immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not often agree with anything The Workers' Party have to say but I have to agree with Deputy McCartan that the scale of pay for ordinary privates and corporals is very low and should be upgraded.  I have seen these people on Border duty right through the night <Col N="587" /> standing shoulder to shoulder with gardaí who are paid handsomely.  While I do not begudge their rates of pay, the soldiers are very poorly paid.  They get a ridiculous gratuity and some equality must be introduced.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Cooney's suggestion that these people should be treated humanely by the Department and the Minister.  I echo his hope that we will never be faced with trade unionism within the ranks of the Army.  The way to prevent that is to ensure that they are well looked after.</P>
    <P>I want to identify a problem which has occured in the Border area in recent times and which has caused me to table several questions to various Ministers.  I refer to the appearance of 24 observation posts on the Border, particularly in County Armagh.  I am concerned at the risk to health caused by the fact that these posts are emitting radiation which I understand to be extremely dangerous, possibly more dangerous to the people of County Louth and other Border countries than the threat posed by Sellafield.</P>
    <P>These are death beams and unfortunately they are beamed directly into the South.  They are monitoring devices used to pick up conversations, even in cars, deep into County Louth and the South and they pose a definite risk to health.  They are known as X-band radiation. They were the subject of an international incident in 1970 when it was discovered that a number of personnel in the US Embassy in Moscow successfully sued the US State Department for damage to health caused by Soviet microwaves. One marine took action for genetic damage caused to his child which was born later in the US.  Statistics have proved that virtually every one of the personnel serving in the US Embassy in Moscow were affected to some degree. These are serious problems and I would like the Irish Government to address them.</P>
    <P>I have put down questions on this <Col N="588" /> matter to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs I asked what action was being taken to ascertain the degree of danger posed by the presence of British Army observation installations in South Armagh, adjacent to County Louth, and the reported use of radiation-based systems for monitoring purposes and if the Minister was consulted in advance by the British authorities about the use of these systems.  While that might not necessarily come within the ambit of the Defence budget, nevertheless it is a subject for concern.  I ask the Minister for Defence to make some investigation into my claim.  I am very thankful for the few minutes I have got and I would like to share my remaining time with Deputy Mervyn Taylor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to Deputy McGahon for allowing me a few minutes to comment on the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  I want to make a few brief comments on the role of our Army in the Middle East and Lebanon.  Our soldiers are performing a first-rate international task, a task that is extremely difficult to perform under any circumstances.  It is the role of the peace-maker, the person who tries to keep the peace between conflicting and warring factions, and that is always a difficult role.  Great care should be taken by the Irish Government to do nothing that would in any way affect or prejudice the ability of our soldiers to play out and enact that role.  They are working in Lebanon, an area where there are innumerable conflicting armies and militias of all descriptions, the Israelis, the South Lebanon Army, the Hezbollah, the Amal, the Maronites, to name but some.  That is not a comprehensive list.  I am leaving aside the Syrian army and I will say a word about that in a moment. <Col N="589" /> Our soldiers are placed in a very delicate position.  We have to be careful that we are not seen, as a Government, to be partisan in any respect as far as any of the conflicting interests of that part of the world are concerned.  I am afraid that some Ministers in this Government have not lived up to their responsibilities in that regard.</P>
      <P>I refer, first to the response of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in this House last night. In replying to an Adjournment Debate he gave what could only be described as a totally biased and prejudiced account of events on the West Bank and in Gaza. Other similar statements have also been made.  It does not understate the position to say that loose or careless talk of that nature possibly puts the lives and limbs of our soldiers in Lebanon at risk.  This is not just a matter of neutrality; it is a matter of peace-keeping and impartiality. The issues in Lebanon and in the West Bank and Gaza are not as simple as the Minister, Deputy Calleary, or other Ministers would have us believe.  They are extremely complicated.  There is no question that one side is all right and the other side all wrong.  This is not the time to go into the merits or demerits of that situation.  That will arise on the Department of Foreign Affairs Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is in sympathy with the Deputy's contribution in so far as he is basing it on his concern for the members of the Defence Forces.  I am quite sure that, while he points the finger of criticism at the Minister of State in respect of what he has said, the Deputy will also be cautious that he will not say anything which would similarly prejudice, as he would think, the position of our Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly never do that and never have done.  That matter is far too important.  I would never do anything that would put at risk the lives and limbs of our soldiers who are fulfilling <Col N="590" /> such an important, delicate and difficult role.  How much more so do the Ministers of this Government have a responsibility to exercise extreme caution in the comments they make on anything affecting that area?  The Syrian army are now invading Lebanon.  The news media describe that as a measure to possibly release the hostages but I do not think that is the intent of the Syrian invasion of Beirut.  I think they have other purposes in mind.  I highlight that point to illustrate how complex the situation is in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>I was extremely concerned to read the reports of the Minister, Deputy Calleary, yesterday.  If those kinds of one-sided comments were to be seen, as no doubt they will be, by the Israeli authorities they could be forgiven for calling into question the impartiality of the Irish Government in that part of the world.  It is very serious that that should arise when our soldiers are out there in the firing line. I make a special appeal to the Ministers in any future pronouncements they would make, in the interests of the position that we have in maintaining troops in an international role in the Lebanon, to exercise extreme care in what they say and to remember that it is a complicated situation. To attempt to put the entire blame for conditions there on one side, or to say that it is the Israelis, and they alone, who carry the responsibility for events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is totally untrue and bears no relationship to the facts.  It was a totally unsympathetic statement &mdash; at least the parts that were reported in the paper but I have not seen the transcript.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe they should but should not Syria and the Iranian's Hezbollah withdraw to the international borders too?  That comment by Deputy Cooney is typical of the sort of comment that is made.  People say that the Israelis <Col N="591" /> should withdraw.  What about all the others who are there and who have no equal right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite right for the Irish troops to be there.  That is very important.  When the Deputy says that the Israelis should withdraw, should he not couple with that a statement that the Syrians should withdraw?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and so are the Syrians. I have just read reports that they are invading Beirut and that is not very far from the southern border.  I am not saying that the Israelis are angels, or that there have not been some excesses in their army.  I do not know of any army that, on occasion, has not been guilty of some excesses.  Many of them have been taken to task by courts martial and by other means.  They are facing extremely difficulty situations in which stones and petrol bombs are thrown and three or four soldiers are responding to large crowds of insurrectionists.  I do not say they have done that but I am not going into the merits or demerits of this because that would take a long time.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the kernel of the contribution I want to make is that there are rights and wrongs on all sides.  We are in a particularly delicate position when we send our forces there.  We must maintain a strictly neutral, impartial and balanced position and not let ourselves fall into the trap of being guided by the propaganda battle that has been heavily won by one side in this dispute.  We should not allow ourselves to be drawn by that but we should stick to the neutral and impartial position.  That is absolutely essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I want to express my thanks to those Deputies who contributed to this debate and to re-echo their tributes to the personnel of the Defence Forces.  As I said before, there is no doubt that these people deserve this praise.  They are a body of men and women whose commitment to their country manifests itself in the day-to-day discharge of their duties.  That is patriotism in its truest sense.  We have an excellent Army and it is only right and proper that this should be recognised and expressed in the central forum of our democracy. Long may we have the opportunity to do that.</P>
      <P>I would like to address a number of points raised in this debate.  The question of the members of the Permanent Defence Forces being paid family income supplement was raised by a number of Deputies.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force are eligible for family income supplement on the same basis as other members of the community. However, out of a total of 11,700 non-commissioned officers and privates, only a very small number with large families, who have short service and are serving in the lower ranks, are eligible and qualifying for this benefit.  The number in receipt of this benefit is very small &mdash; 29 out of a total of 11,700 non-commissioned officers and privates.  These figures compare very favourably with other sectors of the community.  That is not to say the situation should be ignored, but I just want to put this matter into proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high incidence of duty was also referred to.  I am aware that the level of duties in the Defence Forces is high due to a number of factors &mdash; Border patrols, cash escorts, bomb disposal, prison and barrack security, fisheries patrol, air and sea surveillance and so on, and the security of a number of installations as well as the security of this building.  To offset this, I am making arrangements for an intake of 500 recruits in the very near <Col N="593" /> future.  This should help to alleviate the incidence of duty and I want to tell Deputy Cooney I hope these 500 recruits will be in training by 1 July.</P>
    <P>The question of promotion in the Permanent Defence Force was also raised. The restriction on the filling of vacancies in the public service has been applied to the Permanent Defence Force since April 1987.  Not more than one in ten of all vacancies are filled.  Having regard to the nature of the Permanent Defence Force, it is necessary to maintain the rank structure and to fill all key appointments.  That was pointed out by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Cooney.  I have prevailed on the Government to modify the restrictions in the case of the Permanent Defence Forces and I am glad this modification will take place.  At the moment I am discussing this matter with military personnel and I hope to have the modification brought in very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the number of new rifles.  When Deputy Connaughton gets information I wish it were accurate.  I am particularly pleased it was possible to arrange the contract to buy new rifles, notwithstanding the restrictions on spending imposed by the Government.  The new weapon was ordered after a very lengthy and extensive process of technical testing in all commands.  Each command examined each type of rifle over a long period &mdash; upwards of two years &mdash; and carried out exhaustive field trials of a large range of modern assault rifles.  Tenders from a number of manufacturers had to be evaluated.  The weapon order was the choice of the technical experts and was regarded as the best available from the point of view of safety, which is important, effectiveness and, above all, value for money.  Deputy Connaughton said we could purchase the colt rifles without paying any money.  That is not so.  The information Deputy Connaughton has is completely incorrect.</P>
    <Col N="594" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I do not know what paper the Deputy has but I am giving him accurate information.  As I said, these rifles were tested for up to two years and only then was the contract put out to tender.  I am not at liberty to disclose the contract price because of the secrecy surrounding the tendering system.  As I said, value for money was taken into consideration and, for the first time ever, there was counter trade to a value in excess of £1 million to this country. That was significant.  I can reassure Deputy Connaughton there was no waste of finances.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Spring when he spoke of the importance of careers in the Army.  For that reason I have introduced modifications with regard to promotions. Applications for permission to retire from the Permanent Defence Force were received from pilot officers of the Air Corps in recent months.  In the case of a number of applications I have had to refuse permission because the retirement of the officers concerned would have had serious consequences for the operation of the Air Corps at present.  Some of those officers hold important appointments in the helicopter service, particularly the training programme to bring the Dauphin helicopters to full operational capacity, and to provide the maritime control service.  I am doing something to ensure that we will not have a repeat of the position in which we find ourselves; in other words, I hope to increase the number of cadets in the Air Corps.  I have sympathy for the personnel concerned.  Deputy Spring must appreciate my problem and that of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards locating some of the Dauphin helicopters along the western seaboard, this point was made by a number of Deputies.  We have only a limited number of aircraft to cover all the national territory and our seas and to <Col N="595" /> respond to search and rescue calls.  A redeployment to Shannon would undoubtedly shorten travel time to large areas of the west coast, but not to the bulk of the Donegal coastline.  It would also dilute cover to the east coast where there is a high incidence of passenger traffic.  I am discussing this matter with the Minister for the Marine and some solution will be found but it will not be easy.  This problem did not arise today or yesterday.</P>
    <P>The welfare of members of the Defence Force has at all times been the special care of successive Governments, and we are looking at that area as well. This is being kept under constant review and will be considered more fully in the future.</P>
