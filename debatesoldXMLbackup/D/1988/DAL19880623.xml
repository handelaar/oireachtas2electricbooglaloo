      <P>I have two questions to put to the Taoiseach in respect of prospective business.  The first relates to a matter which I raised with the Taoiseach on Tuesday.  There is a problem in regard to the ratification of the Community Patents Convention where a referendum might be necessary on a particular interpretation of the Constitution.  Will the Taoiseach consider raising this matter at the European Council with a view to having a regulation made by the Council which would resolve this difficulty?  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity of investigating this possibility?  The second question relates to the summer recess. Will the Government be prepared to consider bringing forward legislation to Second Stage before the summer recess with a view to allowing the possibility, in respect of non-contentious legislation, for such legislation to be processed through Committee Stage in special committee during the recess so that an amount of legislative work could be dealt with during that time?</P>

      <P>I do not think that either of the questions is strictly in order but, out of courtesy, I will answer them. The suggestion regarding the Patents Convention is under consideration.  I do not know if the Deputy's other suggestion about legislation enabling committees to meet would be a practical proposition although it can be considered.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill, 1988: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Quinn. We also have amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Keating.  Amendments Nos. 6 and 10 are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 20, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the definition of a competent person and it is a response to representations I have had from the <Col N="1510" /> Association of Consulting Engineers, the body representing the people who in respect of the structural stability of buildings would be the persons who would be described as competent persons.  They are asking that a competent person would be a person who has had experience in structural design and appraisal of multi-storey buildings.  Structural design, as the House will accept, is a multi-disciplinary type of activity in that there are many different kinds of structural designs ranging from roads, to bridges and so forth. The experience in the structural design of multi-storey buildings should be combined with some experience of the appraisal of multi-storey buildings.  This would limit to a degree the number of people who would be described as being competent but the amendment has been suggested to me by the body representing those people who will have the responsibility to make this unnecessary legislation work.  I would ask the Minister to be generous in his response as this amendment does not effectively alter the definition. To some extent it ameliorates the very different concerns of the people who will have to make this legislation work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Quinn's amendment.  The Minister is aware from representations made publicly and privately by the Engineers' Associations of the concern that this Bill will not work.  It is accepted that there is a great deal of goodwill on the part of the Government in bringing forward this Bill, but the Engineers' Associations made a very strong case as recently as last Sunday on the radio that they are most concerned that the Bill will make a bad situation worse and that it has tackled the problem in the wrong way.  In terms of the wishes for some amendments by the engineering associations, the Minister should be very forthcoming on this because, as Deputy Quinn pointed out, they are the people who are being asked to undertake what they see as an impossible job.  They need every possible assistance if this Bill is to have any chance of working.  I suspect that we might end up before very long <Col N="1511" /> back in this House changing this Bill drastically because it is unworkable.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Quinn in his amendment. It is a minor amendment in some ways but it would strengthen that clause by ensuring that the people doing that inspection would have a very broad ranging expertise not only in structural design but also in the appraisal of multi-storey buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was raised on Second Stage and I considered it.  I do not see this legislation as being in any way contentious and I want to be as helpful as possible.  This legislation is trying to satisfy a requirement which at the time of these disasters seemed necessary.  The Bill is limited in scope.  It is only seeking to do one thing in so far as the structural safety of certain kinds of buildings are concerned.  I went into all that before in relation to the difference between progressive collapse and disproportionate collapse.  We have come up with the right formula here.  A competent person in relation to the structural appraisal of a building is defined in this legislation as a chartered engineer who has experience in the structural design or appraisal of multi-storey buildings.  To require experience of design and appraisal would have been unnecessarily limiting and Deputy Quinn accepts that.  As far as I was concerned that might have led to an unnecessary shortage of persons who could have issued the certificates.  I was trying to be as accommodating as I could so far as the associations and the professional groups are concerned, to keep it as wide as possible and not to limit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn made the point that the limiting factor of doing what is suggested here now might not be in the long term best interests of those people who are seeking it.  It must be remembered that a chartered engineer will have a third level degree course, but in addition to that he will normally have about four years of practical experience as well.  On the basis of the definition in the Bill he must also have experience of the structural design <Col N="1512" /> of multi-storey buildings.  All these things are limiting in their own way.  We are getting down to a small number of people and I am trying to leave it as broad as possible within that framework to enable them to make these certificates available. I am satisfied that such engineers &mdash; the type that have been suggested here in the interpretation of a chartered engineer with the kind of experience I have mentioned &mdash; are competent to discharge the function required under the Bill.  I fail to understand the implications in the amendment that this might not be so because it says that certain people might not be competent to do the job, but I do not accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>An engineer may have experience of design and of building generally but not of multi-storey buildings. He could also have experience of appraisal of buildings, including multi-storey buildings.  If that amendment were passed, as suggested, then such an engineer would not qualify under the Bill and that would limit it still further.  That would not be in the best interests of having the legislation implemented.  For that reason I fail to see a good argument to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill was to be confined exclusively to chartered engineers in the Republic of Ireland and in the United Kingdom &mdash; there is a certain degree of interconnection between both associations &mdash; then the standards of competence, training and experience to which the Minister has referred would be accurate but, as he would be the first to recognise, within a period of less than three years the boundaries, the definitions and the territorial exclusivity of practising professionals will be removed following the completion of the internal market and we will have a much wider range of diversity in relation to chartered engineers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the implications of 1992, from <Col N="1513" /> the point of view of professional recognition, is that a chartered engineer anywhere in the Community from the Peloponnesus back up to the north of Denmark and from the north of Scotland down to Portugal will qualify.  We will have a situation where any engineer in any part of the Community representing 320 million people can come in and sign a certificate stating that this building is competent.  This is the first instance, in my immediate experience in this House, where the practical realities of 1992 are beginning to dawn.  I want to ensure that we will avoid the potential abuses that that lowering of standards will imply.</P>
    <P>With regard to professional architectural and engineering standards, there is no doubt that the current standards of professional practice and qualifications pertaining in the Republic and in the United Kingdom are higher than in a number of the other European countries. That is a matter about which I do not want to be contentious, because I welcome 1992.  What I am trying to say is that in this regard we are asking for a competent person to have not only the necessary formal qualifications but experience in relation to structural design and the appraisal.  As I said on the Second Stage debate &mdash; I am not going to refer at length in relation to this matter &mdash; you are asking people to diagnose after the event if a building has been satisfactorily constructed.  It is like asking a chef to diagnose from the end product whether a particular meal, cake or product has been cooked, baked or made strictly in accordance with the written recipe.  Without actually putting a laser cut through a section of the building, it is very hard for that to be done.  A person must have the direct experience of building multi-storey buildings and appraising them &mdash; the two go hand in hand.  This is not a political amendment put in for the sake of trying to improve the legislation, which has been drafted by technical people in the first instance and by the people in the Department of the Environment.  I have already indicated to the House where the amendment has come from.  It has been suggested by the very people who will <Col N="1514" /> have to give effect to this legislation. While in theory it would limit the number of people who would be available in this State to serve as competent persons, in terms of distorting the market so that there would be a monetary gain for those people who would be able to combine both combinations of experience, that of appraisal and of structural design, I do not think it would have that effect.  If the Minister is so motivated, as I suspect he might be, I will support his concern that this limiting amendment would have a distortion effect on price and would drive up the cost of professional fees. However, I do not think it will have that effect.</P>
    <P>In response to what the Minister has said, standards throughout the Community will be uneven after 1992.  The standards of a chartered engineer, as we have traditionally come to know them in this country, will no longer apply after 1992 and there is nothing we will be able to do in respect of this legislation.  Therefore, I suggest that we should have this combination of experience and appraisal in relation to design.  If the fear of the Minister is that this may have an impact on the cost of professional fees, and consequently on the cost of the end user, by getting a competent person &mdash; so now defined if the amendment is accepted &mdash; then I do not think that that would be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Quinn.  I suppose after 1992 there will be so many changes in the technical engineering and financial world that we are only beginning to see through the window as to what will happen.  So far as I am concerned, I sincerely hope that all these certificates will have been furnished long before 1992.  If they have not, the whole thing will have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Between now and 1992 I think that the certificates of appraisal that would be required will, as far as I am concerned, have already been discharged and have been submitted to the local <Col N="1515" /> authorities and the registers will be there by that time.  Any limitation on the number of people capable or, indeed, competent to do their job would involve not just the cost element, which I did consider.  It is a fact that has to be taken into account and could cause further delays than those which would be inevitable in some of these matters, and it would also be an inhibiting factor.  I am satisfied that the chartered engineers, as I have outlined, can do the job before 1992.</P>
      <P>I will not make any comment as to whether Irish chartered engineers are more competent than anybody else.  I take it that in the fullness of time, as in many of the other professions which are being considered now, in the framing of new directives under the EC there will be comparative standards applied throughout the Community.  I can see that that will not happen in 1992.  There will be much discussion about that before it is applied.  We have seen the same argument put forward as far as nursing and medical qualifications are concerned. I think we are a bit down the road from that.  I do not see that as a good argument for seeking this amendment, particularly when one considers the provision that is made for providing these certificates. Under section 4 of the legislation they will be superseded before very long by the Building Control Bill when it is passed by the Dáil.  That, as I told the Deputy some time ago, is on Committee Stage. We have had enough of delays waiting for further control measures to be introduced. This can go on and we can keep adding on to such measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be much happier if we were discussing that Bill instead of the measure that is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should get on with that matter in the autumn and get it off the agenda.  Then, it takes over all questions as far as such certificates are concerned. We are talking about a limited provision to deal with a problem that arose.  In my <Col N="1516" /> view this is a good way to do that.  I do not want to limit the type of engineers but the amendment would do that.  The type of chartered engineer we are talking about, a person with experience following years of practice in structural design of the type of buildings we are talking about, will do the right job as far as I am concerned.  I should like to ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister envisage the competence of these chartered engineers being checked?  Does he envisage local authorities setting up a register of people who will be acceptable or does he envisage them examining the competence of the person who will hand in the certificate?  I notice that the Minister does not make it an offence to submit a certificate without having the said competence. How does the Minister see this provision being put into effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any difficulty in so far as the legislation states the type of person we are talking about.  I have every confidence in the associations of the various professional groups to indicate that those people are competent, just as I have in the medical profession. They are either qualified, with certain experience, or they are not.  In my view the profession would be in a difficult position if they allowed themselves to have members sign certificates that were inaccurate or illegal.  I do not see this as a problem and that is probably the reason the profession have taken such a keen interest in this.  It will be their members who will be signing the certificate and their professional credibility will be on the line.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the professional organisations will, effectively, be establishing some type of register to put this provision into effect? Presumably, as experience is a very elastic concept, somebody will have to decide when a person is experienced.  How do we, in effect, say how that will be decided?  Is it up to the engineer to look <Col N="1517" /> into his heart and decide he is so qualified? Does the Minister envisage that the liability the engineer would incur if he certified it without adequate experience is the effect of policing?</P>

      <P>No, that is covered in the legislation.  The certifier will be required to state that he is qualified, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, to do the job.  If he makes a false statement then the penalties in the legislation apply.  The certificate, as I pointed out last week, is open for public inspection.  I was very anxious to have the provision in the legislation so that they would be available for everybody to see.  In the certificate the certifier will be stating he is a qualified person.  In my view simple professional etiquette would require that he is such a person.  If it is established on inspection of the local authority register that he is not, then the penalties apply.</P>

      <P>The point being made by Deputy Bruton is a valid one.  The section refers to a person who &ldquo;has experience in the structural design&rdquo;.  The Minister should not think for one moment that any Member on this side of the House is questioning the expertise and ability of the engineers of the country because that is far from the position.  In fact, it is a measure of their very high standards that they are so intensely critical of the Bill and doubtful about whether its provisions are workable.  They know the pitfalls and that is why they are raising objections, despite the fact that they would stand to benefit greatly financially because of all the extra work that will arise at a time when there are so many problems in the construction industry.  Suddenly, they will be handed a lot of extra work, plus fees, but they are saying they do not want it, that it is not possible to do this.  I should like to know who will evaluate the experience?  Which body will say that an individual has enough experience to be a certifier?  Will it be left to the engineering body or a local authority?</P>

      <P>The level of experience necessary is not specified because it is considered impracticable to include such a definition in the legislation.  For example, does five years experience mean five years continuous experience or to have had some experience from at least five years ago?  In any event, the type of training and education received by engineers together with the practical experience necessary for them to become chartered, is adequate and equips them to do the job.  I do not see any argument in that.  If engineers have that type of experience, training and skills and become chartered I cannot see how they cannot be regarded as competent to deal with the matter.  The question of whether they want to do the work is a different matter.  In this section we are referring to certain types of people having the competence to sign certificates.  This section outlines the experience and qualifications they have to have.  I do not want to put a limiting amendment into this section that may mean less people, more cost, bigger delays and the job not being done any better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) in relation to the provision of electricity into a multi-storey building, a chartered engineer or electrical contractor entered on a register of electrical contractors who has experience of the design or distribution of electrical services by reference to the appropriate codes of practice and standards as set down by the Electro-technical Council of Ireland or equivalent codes of practice and standards recognised in another Member State of the European Community, as specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the House is taking the amendments together and I should like to appeal to the House for support for what is a very fundamental issue.  The Bill before us is the legislative response of the Government to a specific incident but it affords us an ideal opportunity to deal in a comprehensive way with serious problems in relation to the potential which exists for explosions and fire in such buildings.  The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to facilitate an arrangement whereby we could have the same standard of inspection for electrical supply as we have in the Bill for gas supply.  The reason for my concern is simple.  There is a number, probably running into double figures, of people in this country who die every year on account of fires caused by electrical failure.  It is very difficult to pin down the figures.  The certified figures amount to about half a dozen but they do not include all the available figures. This is the first Bill under which we have had the opportunity of doing something about that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to explain briefly to the House the present arrangement in relation to the installation of electrical wiring.  I am not saying that this is the norm.  Most people engaged in this industry are legitimate and genuine.  I was interested to hear Fine Gael's justified concern with <Col N="1520" /> regard to certifying standards of competence for adjudication in relation to the first amendment we dealt with.  There is no certification of any kind in the area of electrical safety.  We should bear in mind that there cannot be a gas explosion without some form of ignition or some form of spark.  It seems that the two are inextricably bound up together</P>
    <P>Any individual who perhaps does not even know an electrical plug from an electric kettle can walk into an ESB store and ask for, and on occasion has received, what is known as a completion certificate, a small pink slip which, when it is signed, the ESB accept for the purposes of giving electrical supply to a house or a building. The problem is that there is no policing of this arrangement.  The ESB have expressly written into their rules for accepting those certificates the clear statement that they do not accept any responsibility for the quality or safety of the wiring which they say is the consumer's own responsibility.  The ESB are not required to ensure that an installation is safe before connecting up to the national grid.  Unfortunately, as in every area where there is an opportunity for the rogue, a number of people have got involved in this area and because they are completely unpoliced and in some cases unqualified or under-qualified they are likely to get business because their costs are lower.  On occasions they have done significant wiring installations in private homes and in some cases in blocks of dwellings.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that all electrical contractors are engaged in this abuse.  The vast majority of them are genuine people and have a pride in their standards.  The public believe that the ESB give supply on the basis that the wiring is safe.  I want this Bill, in the case of multi-storey buildings at least, to ensure that we can deal with that.  The ESB give no such guarantee.  They have written into their rules that that is the consumer's responsibility. We know from experience that there have been many occasions on which such wiring has been grossly defective and dangerous and has caused fires despite the fact that it was carried out <Col N="1521" /> on the basis of a completion certificate signed by the person who did the work, and who need not be qualified in order to get the certificate, and accepted by the ESB who say that it is not their responsibility. I have taken the liberty this morning of bringing into the House a number of pieces of wiring which has been installed into private homes in this context. I am not going to make a big play of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point clearly, and I do not intend to be dissuaded from it, that these are examples of wiring in respect of which completion certificates were signed alleging that they were installed properly and in respect of which the ESB gave supply.  In those examples there is fundamentally incorrect wiring which would facilitate in some cases overheating and overloading, <Col N="1522" /> embody very bad practice and, in short, would lead to fires which would cause deaths.  That is the present arrangement in relation to electrical supply in this country.  This is not the ideal Bill for dealing with this issue but it is very relevant to it.  It deals with the adequacy of supply in terms of gas availability for these buildings.  Unless there is a spark there cannot be an explosion.  A simple electrical switch creates the opportunity for a spark and if the wiring is wrong there could be an explosion.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to accept the spirit of these amendments.  I do not mind about the wording of them; I am not the draftsman.  I want to ensure that the cowboy operators in the electrical supply area are prevented from operating and I want it done now.  I assume that, on the basis of our concern about professional standards, I would have a broad base of support in the House, including from the Minister's party.  The issue is very important. It is a question of life and death, the same as the basis for this Bill.  The present arrangement is highly unsatisfactory.  I am not going to dwell on this matter too long but I just want to make the point that even in internal documents in the ESB's operation procedures there are clear and very explicit references to their non-acceptance of any responsibility for the safety of the wiring of an electrical supply.  There are circumstances in which they accept that it may not even be necessary to have a completion certificate in cases of urgency, which we cannot fault them for.  The certificate is in some cases worthless because it allows the person to certify in all cases.  I do not know if that is satisfactory, particularly when there is no policing of the arrangement whereby those certificates are available.  I am very adamant that this matter must be dealt with.  If we had building regulations I presume it would be dealt with there but because there are no such regulations it is even more imperative that we deal with it at every opportunity we get.  At present there is an abuse of the system and unfortunately people have died from fires as a result of faulty wiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is based on the fact <Col N="1523" /> that most consumers believe that when they get supply the wiring is presumably safe.  There is no such guarantee, either implicit or otherwise.  The ESB say quite specifically that that is the individual's concern and that they are not interested. Perhaps that is being a little harsh on them.  They want to do the job and I am not blaming them for not doing it.  They are not statutorily obliged to do it and the Government have not asked them to do it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a logical extension of a set of provisons which the Minister has asked us to accept, which seek, in relation to the structure of a building, the inspection of a chartered engineer who is experienced in that area, in relation to the installation of gas in a multi-storey building, a chartered engineer who is experienced in that area and in relation to the distribution of gas in the vicinity of a building, a similar form of inspection.  I am asking that in relation to the provision of electricity to that building there be similarly a provision which requires some form of registered electrical contractors who are qualified and able to do the task.  It is not a peripheral matter but fundamentally a matter of life and death.  It is a major omission in the present arrangements governing buildings, the structure of buildings and the supply of services at present available in this country and I cannot over-emphasise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the amendment. I want to press this point as hard as I can. I am very strongly committed to what I am trying to achieve here.  Amendment <Col N="1524" /> No. 6 to section 3 raises the same topic and is an equally fundamental point.  The concern expressed by a variety of interests and bodies, and most forcibly by Deputy Quinn on Second Stage and by the Association of Consultant Engineers, is that if the purpose of this Bill is to try to ensure that the incidents which gave rise to this Bill cannot recur, there is no point creating an arrangement where there is an inspection of buildings, if possible deficiencies in the gas supply system, which could give rise to an explosion, are not dealt with at the same time.  If there is an explosion it does not matter how structurally sound is a building.  It is important to refer to the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings.  They say explicitly in their recommendations it is important that deficiencies in the gas supply system be dealt with.</P>
      <P>There is no harm saying, in passing, that the basis of this Bill could be open to query on the basis of unsatisfactory data collection on multi-storey buildings. There was no response from many people to whom questionnaires were sent.  I want to ask the Minister a question: when the task force were doing this work, they asked the local authorities for their observations on the Bill.  I was very startled to hear some authorities did not even bother to reply.  A total of 425 questionnaires were returned.  Does the Minister have power to compel local authorities, who are supposed to be answerable to him, to answer a questionnaire sent out in his name?  Many of the replies were unsatisfactory and, as far as I am concerned, many local authorities are out of control. If we cannot even get a simple response to a questionnaire affecting public safety, how can we be sure about the integrity of the measures now being proposed on the basis of that research?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 to section 3 seeks to insert in the Bill, &ldquo;the supplies of gas and electricity to the building are provided in accordance with the appropriate codes of practice&rdquo;.  If that does not happen, what we are doing is creating a legislative device which allows appraisal of the building structurally but which may not deal with the fundamental problem of standards of supply.  It is the latter that will give rise to explosions. Some way has to be found of dealing with the admitted deficiencies in that supply system where it is clear that we are, to some extent, out of line with standards in Europe.</P>
      <P>There is a set of recommendations on pages 4 and 5 of the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings which point to fundamental problems in that supply.  According to these experts some 20 per cent of the gas service pipes in Dublin alone should be replaced over the next four or five years, and be subject to further reviews.  They say that having regard to the absence of significant mains renewal work over the past ten years or more in Dublin, it is recommended that 15 per cent of the Dublin network should be replaced in accordance with specified criteria and so on.  They talk about leak surveys, data collection inadequacies and raise a series of very serious questions about gas supply.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is designed to deal with the risk of potential explosions in these buildings, how can we pretend that the gas supply network, the basis for potential explosions, can be forgotten, that we can turn away and say that is another day's work.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  I am open to any wording the Minister might suggest.  I am not pretending my amendments are the last word nor do I see it as my job on Committee Stage to suggest perfect wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 arises from the other amendments.  If one accepts the provisions I am arguing for, one would <Col N="1526" /> logically have to provide a set of provisions in accordance with which those installations should take place.  I am suggesting that that would be the national rules for electrical installations published by the Electro-technical Council of Ireland in 1984 and its amendments and revisions.  I am open to suggestions if there are better European or other standards about which I am not aware.</P>
    <P>The essence of my contribution is this: electrical supply is equally important to gas supply in terms of potential for loss of life.  The evidence shows there is an inherent weakness in the system &mdash; I am not blaming the ESB for that &mdash; and that it has cost lives.  It is important that those matters be rectified, that deficiencies in the gas supply system and the appalling potential for abuse in the electrical supply system be dealt with.  This Bill is the first opportunity we have had to deal with these matters.  If my suggestions are incorporated in this Bill, these matters will be dealt with in the context of buildings which fall under the ambit of this Bill.  I am making a very strong case that that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister says, as I suspect he may, that this is not the appropriate vehicle for looking at electricity safety, it appears that this issue falls between all stools.  Recently on the ESB Bill I tabled an amendment asking him to consider requiring the ESB to use their powers to deal with this problem but he rejected the amendment for no good reason.  The Minister for the Environment has responsibility for the general safety of the housing network &mdash; I fear he will again say this is not the appropriate vehicle to raise this matter &mdash; and although the ESB have powers under the legislation they do not seem to see this as their primary concern and do not wish to go beyond the meter and into the safety aspect of the buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister may argue that this is not the appropriate vehicle to raise this subject, this is a real issue which needs to be dealt with.  This legislation was introduced because of an accident and pointed up the fact that safety was no <Col N="1527" /> one's first concern and in that case it was a litany of failures in safety regulations. This electricity issue looks like another area which State agencies do not see as their primary business, and as a result it has fallen from public attention.  There is a problem to be addressed here, if not today then on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 seeks to broaden the appraisal to the supply of gas rather than simply the structure of the building. Even in the narrow context of the building, the task force drew attention to items such as the assumption by Irish codes of practice that there would be one air change per hour.  They drew attention to the fact that there can be inadequate flues provided in buildings, and particularly in apartment buildings.  This can be a problem.  As I see it, the issue of ventilation will only be addressed under this Bill if there is a danger of the progressive collapse of the structure.  It will not be addressed in any other circumstance.  I wonder whether we should exclude examination of the items listed in Schedule III when examining five-storey buildings.</P>

This matter was mentioned to me before and discussed at some length on Second Stage.  It is appropriate to warn people about the need for proper electrical installations, not just in five-storey buildings but in all buildings.  I have no complaint with that.  It is right that public representatives should draw attention to this matter.  I am concerned about it too, and about the code of practice and the standards in all buildings, not just multi-storey buildings.  While I can sympathise with some of the remarks, this legislation does not cater for such matters.  Both the <Col N="1528" /> Long Title and the Short Title of the Bill make it clear that it is a response to the recommendations of the task force in relation to the safety of the structure of multi-storey buildings.  The Bill is not a suitable vehicle for dealing with building services.  There is a distinction between structural matters and services.</P>

I do not concede the argument about flawed electrical installations on which the proposed amendments are based, but in any event a Bill dealing only with multi-storey buildings would not be the appropriate vehicle to deal with such concerns, even if they were valid.</P>
      <P>All the task force recommendations concerning existing structures, multi-storey building design and gas matters are being dealt with positively, as instanced by this Bill.  Progress is being made in implementing the gas-related regulations.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that accidents happen because of fire.  Many such fires are the result of faulty electrical appliances being put on the market.  The fault does not attach to the electrical supply but rather to the appliance.  Undoubtedly fires cause damage and loss of life but very often they do not affect the structure of building. When an electrical appliance goes wrong and causes a fire in which somebody dies, the structure of the building does not collapse.</P>

Nearly all the gas mains in close proximity to buildings have been surveyed, as well as the bridge crossings, a particularly difficult job, and the main valve connections and locations. There was a second survey on public <Col N="1530" /> buildings, which I understand has started but has not been completed.  The frequency of these surveys is in accordance with the recommendations of the reports that came to us and were acted on with all expedition.  As far as I am concerned, Dublin Gas has established for itself a solid data base on the conditions of the network and that will be improved upon in time.  Good progress has been made as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about structures, about certain types of buildings, not services. The long and short Titles do not include that and, consequently, I cannot accept these amendments and the Deputy who put them down knew that. All I can say is, and I think he will be satisfied with this, that I recognise what he says is a matter of concern to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a matter of concern to the House and, if he can take it in good faith, I see it as a matter of concern to myself.  If he would like I will take the points made by him, some of the examples quoted by him &mdash; for example, certificates of competence and completion certificates &mdash; and speak to my colleague in Energy, who has direct responsibility for these matters.  Of course, I would expect the Deputy himself to take a suitable opportunity in the House here, whether it is on the Estimate for the Department of Energy, at Question Time or on Private Members' Business, which would be an excellent time to raise this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not offering the Deputy anything.  I am just putting it to the Deputy &mdash; and the Ceann Comhairle should be doing this &mdash; that there are vehicles which would enable the Deputy to have quite a wide discussion on this aspect in isolation from all other matters instead of raising it in an inappropriate way at this time, because it is not relevant <Col N="1531" /> under this legislation.  I will be supportive of the Deputy's point of view in putting the matter to my colleague and I suggest that the Deputy would take other time that might be available to him in the House in order to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us dispose of this question of the inappropriateness of it. What I said was that it was not necessarily an ideal vehicle in the sense that it is not exclusively designed to cope with questions of electrical and gas safety.  It is perfectly appropriate to deal with questions of safety of electrical and gas supply in buildings which are being treated of in this Bill, that is, multi-storey buildings, particularly when there is a specific reference in section 1(1)(c) to the question of gas supply.  Therefore, there is nothing inappropriate about it.  It is not just appropriate; it is urgent and necessary. The Minister asked me to have good faith.  I learned at school years ago that basically faith without good works did not boil down to a great deal.  If I am not to press the Minister on this I want an express commitment from him.  I have a great deal of regard for the Minister but I am not going to go down on my knees with thanks because he said he would speak to his colleague.  I expect he will do that because he is a concerned public representative.  What I want to know is when this House will have a comprehensive response, and a legislative response if it is appropriate, to the serious issue involved here.  I want the time for that.  Otherwise, I will just have to press my case.</P>

      <P>Precisely the reason I am pressing this matter here this morning is because it will not come up in the building regulations.  When will it come up?  If I had the feeling that there was a Bill down the line in a few months' time that would deal with this, I might not be putting this case.  But there is no Bill, not just on the horizon but in any part of the circumferences of the legislative globe, and I do not believe there is any intent to bring in such a Bill.  I just want to clear up the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has brought in a Bill here this morning which seeks to deal with gas supply.  Section 1(1)(c) says that &ldquo;in relation to the distribution of gas in the vicinity of, or the provision of gas services into, a multi-storey building, a chartered engineer who has experience in the design or appraisal of gas distribution systems ...&rdquo; etc.  If I were, for example, to seek to delete the word &ldquo;gas&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; it would be perfectly in order.  It is the Minister's Bill, so I submit that it is a Bill which deals with services.  Electricity is a service and it is not a service which is fundamentally different.  I have made the point, although I have no technical qualification in this respect, that if there was all the gas in the world in a cavity under a building, nothing would happen unless there was an igniting mechanism of some kind and that can only be an electrical spark, so it is germane and as far as I am concerned it is very important and we should treat of it in this Bill.  The only dissatisfaction <Col N="1533" /> I have is that if the Minister accepted this amendment it would not deal with all buildings throughout the State but at least would deal with these.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is that the Minister gave a blanket assurance about the surveys that were carried out and the recommendations being implemented.  There has been some progress, and so there should have been.  If some of us had had our way, the people who oversaw that regulatory vacuum would have been dealt with very severely. The fact that that series of omissions, which it has now been attempted to rectify, has existed for years is a disgrace. The facts are that the recommendations in the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings will not be implemented in three years, regardless of what the Minister has been told, and I assume he has been told by the Gas Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to two or three paragraphs.  Under gas safety, on page 2 of the report, it is stated, just in case we have any bland assurances accepted in the House, that there is a lack of the necessary technical information on which to make a comprehensive assessment of the state of the gas distribution system generally and that statistical comparisons with other networks show an unacceptably high level of leakages in the recent past in Dublin due in part to the absence of systematic repair and replacement programmes.  If one flicks over to page 4 there are a number of recommendations, and I am not going to read them all because it would take too long. They include a specific recommendation that 15 per cent of the Dublin network should be replaced.  They include the recommendation that some 20 per cent of gas service pipes in Dublin should be replaced over the next four or five years. They include the recommendation that leak surveys of all mains services should be undertaken; and some of that, but not all, has been done.  It is recommended that they should be carried out annually on all multi-storey buildings.  That is not in the Bill and will not be in the Bill and will not be done.  Data collection, the targets to be achieved, the use of new <Col N="1534" /> materials and technology, a change from the old system of piping that was there &mdash; all these things are not going to be done in the next three years, or ever, unless we make some attempt to change the Bill along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending I have all the answers either.  We are just making an honest attempt here to deal with central issues.  The facts are that, as the Association of Engineers said, in the Minister's report, which is just over one year old, 30 recommendations were made relating to the gas supply system and only one relating to structure.  That is the Bill that should be here this morning &mdash; one on gas supply, not one on structure.  There is no evidence whatever that structure is a widespread problem; and it would not be a problem at all if the Government had acted in relation to the building regulations, making sure that building was done in accordance with certain standards. So, the urgency is in the area of supply of gas and electricity, both of which together, in the present environment, facilitate the kind of tragedy we saw and will continue to see unless we get some form of commitment; and those recommendations, which are being nibbled at by the services, will not be implemented unless the Government take action.</P>
    <P>Just to give the Minister one final example before I sit down of how inadequate those services are, the Gas Company in Dublin and the local authority in Dublin have only begun to talk to each other.  They are so ill-integrated that at present there is hardly a street in Dublin that does not have an opening of some kind made by the Gas Company, and the reason they do not want to have absolute completion on those and to clean the street and allow it to revert to the jurisdiction of the local authority is than then they get a bill from the local authority.  I understand that at present the Gas Company owe £2 million to the local authority. It is incredible that in a city of our size &mdash; and this would not be tolerated in any other city in the world &mdash; all of the different utilities do their own thing.  One roadway at the back of this building was <Col N="1535" /> dug up over 70 times in a two-year period and yet I am supposed to accept assurances about the capacity of these utilities to provide a safe supply.  I will not and the Minister should not either.  I am pressing this amendment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is based on information received in replies to a questionnaire set out by the Minister.  Why did the Minister not insist that the local authorities answer this questionnaire and answer it satisfactorily? Has the Minister the power to do this and, if not, is he going to take it? If the local authorities do not comply with a request from the Minister how can we expect the ordinary person who has no statutory obligations to do so?  Why did the local authorities not answer the Minister's questionnaire?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to make statements about certain things that is a matter for him.  All I am saying is that I am concerned with the safety of structures and buildings.  I hope it will not happen, but if there should be a gas explosion I hope a building will be able to withstand that explosion.  This matter has been discussed in this House on many other occasions, during debates on other legislation and on motions, and I suggest that this is not the time to do so.  It was never intended that all the network would <Col N="1536" /> be replaced immediately and the Deputy is aware of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if the pipes have been replaced and what I am saying is that a replacement programme was drawn up which was to be carried out over a number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with a specific percentage of the network to be replaced over recommended periods.  That is being complied with fully.  By way of information, over 30 kilometres of mains have been replaced, including the Bray line and the Grand Canal project.  As I understand it, Dublin Gas are well on target to replace over 80 kilometres of the network this year.  About 2,500 services have been replaced so far this year and accordingly progress on replacement, both mains and services, is ahead of the targets set down by the task force.  The Deputy may think that this is not adequate but at least they are ahead of the targets set out in the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that there is fire safety legislation in place, the Fire Services Act, 1981, and fire officers are inspecting public buildings for fire risks.  I recognise the Deputy's concern and I appreciate how he feels that something should be done about the problem which he has highlighted but it is not for the Minister for the Environment to initiate such moves.  Can the Deputy not leave it at that?  I may very well share the Deputy's concern and hope that an initiative may be taken in respect of some of these matters but I am not conceding the point to him as it is not for the Minister for the Environment to deal with the matter.  What we are talking <Col N="1537" /> about is ensuring that structures will be able to withstand disproportionate collapse following a gas explosion.  That is why the reference to gas is in the legislation. What I am concerned about is whether a structure is strong enough to withstand a gas explosion and what we are talking about now is the safety of structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the local authorities will not deal with this matter as they are not competent enough to deal with matters in regard to electrical installations and gas.

If I could get a commitment from the Minister that action will be taken, with a timescale, I would be relatively satisfied.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The two questions I want to ask the Minister are, first, whether I can be given an unequivocal guarantee that the completion certificate loophole will be closed and that some policing will take place.  In fairness I should say that the public at present do not understand the system and do not appreciate that the certificate which is issued by the Electro Technical Council of Ireland is worthless because it is a self-made declaration and that no policing takes place either by the ESB, the council, the local authority or the Department in regard to standards of installation.  I have given many examples this morning of this and I could outline dozens of others.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister took me up wrongly on what I said about the local authorities.  I did not ask for a responsibility to be placed on the local authorities.  All I asked was why did the local authorities not comply with the Minister's request? Why did they not write back?  Is the Minister not going to do anything about it? Obviously, those who wrote back are those who are most efficient and most competent and likely to have something to say.  The local authorities did not answer and I want to know why.  Those are my two questions.  Can I be given a guarantee that action will be taken and a timescale for this?  Can the Minister also deal with the question on his power to ensure that they do respond satisfactorily when he writes to them to seek important information which will be of assistance in the formulation of a Bill of this nature?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitated to come in on this Committee Stage debate because I am concerned at the progress we are making but I am concerned also at what the Minister finally said in relation to this matter.  As the Minister for the Environment, he is responsible for housing. Every house in this country gets an electrical supply into it and, in fact, the number of ESB connections is the measure we use for housing statistics.  Today The Minister is asking this House to give him and his Department professional, legislative and statutory responsibility in relation to the competence of engineers whose unique qualification is in the area of the conveyancing of gas supplies, for which the Department of the Environment have absolutely no responsibility. It is illogical and disingenuous of the Minister to argue that since the Department of the Environment have no responsibility for electricity he cannot in any way have responsibility for the monitoring of the competence of electrical contractors on the one hand and to ask us to agree on Committee Stage to the definition of a &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; as being a chartered engineer who would have responsibility in relation to gas.</P>
      <P>I am not going to press this point but I want the record not to so stand unchallenged. There is perhaps another time and occasion on which to debate this and perhaps the Department of the Environment should speak with another Department with a better degree of co-operation than that which currently prevails between Dublin Corporation and the gas company, as evidenced by Deputy Keating.  There is genuine concern in relation to the supply of electricity by some contractors and the fact that there is no apparent system for monitoring the competence of those contractors.  We are taking upon ourselves a system for the monitoring of the competence of chartered engineers and so on but in response to a question posed by Deputy Bruton the Minister was somewhat vague as to how this would be policed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as it could, at some future date, form part of an internal brief and argument within the Department of the <Col N="1542" /> Environment, in response to a parliamentary question or in response to some legislation, that the Department of the Environment had no responsibility for the safety of houses which have an electricity supply because of the inadequacies of a particular contractor, I do not think the Minister should allow that to stand on the record of this House on Committee Stage.  I know the Minister is not directly responsible for electricity or gas installations and the supply of services but in so far as they interconnect into a building, the Minister and his Department are choosing to take upon themselves in this legislation some form of responsibility, although not total responsibility, in relation to the monitoring of professional competence.  If the Minister accepts that that is what he is doing in this instance, by implication he is opening the door at some future date &mdash; and I accept he is not going to do it today &mdash; to extend some similar form of monitoring in relation to the competence, professional or otherwise, of contractors who instal equipment which we know to be far more lethal, in terms of the deaths caused, than an explosion in a multi-storey building.</P>

      <P>I have no conflict with what Deputy Quinn said.

There is no such thing as having another opportunity.  I do not know when that will be or if the Minister will be there. There is a growing view on this side of the House that he will be in the Department of Finance by then.  All I can say is that I cannot rely on the Minister's very pleasurable soft talk.

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to have a brief discussion on the reason for the definition of &ldquo;multi-storey&rdquo; being five-storey as opposed to four-storey.  The word &ldquo;multi&rdquo; implies a number of buildings but, in practice, there is no emphasis on multi-storey buildings here, although obviously there are some.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is to be effective its ambit should extend to most buildings, or at least to as many buildings as the Minister or the Government would wish.  By defining &ldquo;multi-storey&rdquo; as restricting it to five storeys and upwards, in effect the vast majority of buildings will not be covered by the proposal.  That would include buildings which would in many cases house offices or dwellings.  It may also be a factor in terms of planning applications in future when people design such buildings because there are costs and controls involved in the measure for any building with five or more storeys.</P>
      <P>I tried to trace the origin of the definition as being a five-storey building and I got back to the reports about which we spoke earlier on.  For some reason a five-storey building is accepted as being the appropriate definition.  Perhaps that arose from thinking in Great Britain or the Continent and, if that is the case, we could be making a mistake because obviously, in those countries there is a much greater emphasis on high-rise buildings.  It is not, however, a feature of the Irish landscape.  If we eventually have the Bill on the Statue Book, we all want it to work as well as possible and there is no point therefore in unnecessarily disbarring the vast majority of buildings, many of which both now and in the future will house offices and residential areas or both.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the <Col N="1549" /> Minister of my clarification on Second Stage in relation to definition.  I suggested that &ldquo;multi-storey&rdquo; would consist of four floors and a penthouse, that a penthouse would be considered a floor for the purposes of specified buildings.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by Cremer and Warner on the explosion at Raglan House recommended that the task force investigating multi-storey buildings should initially concentrate on buildings of five or more storeys and, depending on the findings, consider buildings of four or more storeys.  The task force recommendations for appraisal referred only to buildings of five storeys or more.</P>
      <P>In framing the recommendations they considered the proposed building regulations (1) and (2) and the British and Irish codes of practice and standards, including the Irish Standard 325, Part I, which clearly distinguishes between buildings of up to four storeys and of five or more storeys.  I refer to paragraph 5/5/3 of the task force report.  Cremer and Warner also considered the amendment, in the aftermath of the Ronan Point explosion in the UK, of the building regulations relating to the design of buildings of five or more storeys referred to in paragraph 5/3 of the task force report.  In the report which they commissioned from the Joint Engineering Committee the task force found no evidence to suggest that buildings of less than five storeys should be included in the findings and recommendations.  That was supported by the different treatment relating to the structure of buildings or less than five storeys and of five or more storeys in Part E of the proposed building regulations which were published last Monday.  Part E is the part dealing with structural strength and stability.  Consequently, it would be highly inconsistent from a technical point of view to include four storey buildings under the Bill.  For that reason we see no need for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of the Bill a storey includes any area on or over the top floor and used for any purpose including a dwelling, offices or storage other than for <Col N="1550" /> enclosing services such as the lift mechanisms, heating and ventilation plant, and the full building does not have to be five stories.  That is the point with which Deputy Quinn was most concerned.  The definition provides for a building comprising or including five or more storeys and that is the way we want it written. A penthouse would be covered by the wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that he has adequate scope with a cut off of five storeys?  I noticed the Minister's reference to the Ronan Point incident and to the standards in Britain.  I wondered to what extent they might have influenced the five-storey ruling in the Bill?  In Britain there is a significant emphasis in high rise buildings and here we do not have that.  I wondered if the proportionate storey line here should be somewhat lower, but if the Minister is satisfied I will not push it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That did influence some of the thinking as did other aspects such as the task force and the Cremer and Warner report and the building control regulations.  Everything came together to suggest five storeys and technically the advice is that that is the right way to do it.  But the Deputy is right that we were influenced by the Ronan Point incident as well.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to see if the Minister would be interested in having in the Bill a power to deal with all buildings.  The cut-off point of 1950 is a fair proposal, but I wonder if we might regret that cut-off <Col N="1552" /> point?  Was it necessary to incorporate that limit in the Bill at all?  Perhaps the surveys should be carried out progressively on all multi-storey buildings of five storeys.  I am sure there cannot be too many of them.  If someone came into this House and suggested that a house built in 1948 was a death trap, it might be better if the Minister could under the Act have the local authority ensure that the building is checked out and so on.  If the Minister wishes to take that power he will have our support and I propose that we delete the words which limit the Minister's authority in that respect.</P>

      <P>I like a good amendment stage; and, no matter how hare-brained an amendment might seem, it is up to the Minister to justify not accepting it.  I see this in a total sense of co-operation with the legislation, particularly in non-political legislation.</P>
      <P>The fear expressed by Deputy Keating was something that occurred to me, too, and I wanted to be absolutely satisfied that we were doing the right thing by putting a date into the legislation.  In pursuing that matter I discovered that the joint engineering committee which advise the task force on design and construction practice in relation to multi-storey buildings consider that there is no evidence that post-1960 buildings generally are less robust than pre-1960 buildings. The task force shared that view but were concerned with a limited range of buildings of particular construction forms.  That is why the Bill deals with those types of building.  The pre-1950 buildings would not be constructed using any of the three construction forms which are of concern.  That is why 1950 was taken as the cut-off date.  These are the only forms of construction which the task force considered it prudent to appraise in the first place &mdash; the three types referred to in my Second Stage contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force considered that there is no evidence or cause for general concern for earlier multi-storey buildings; but the risk of accidental overloading should, as with all buildings, be kept as low as possible. The construction form referred to <Col N="1553" /> in the definition of a specific building in the Bill did not come into general use until after 1960.  However, there is evidence in a report of proceedings covered in the 1965 symposium on concrete practice in Ireland, that it was applied in a very isolated case or two pre-1960 and may be as early as 1955.  There is also an engineering consensus on the improbability of such construction material and methods having been applied earlier than that.  However, to cover the possibility that there might have been anything pre-1960, I decided to go back to 1950.  The advice given to me did not necessarily ask me to go back that far but to cover everything that might have occurred with that type of construction I decided on the extra ten years.  Basically, that is the reason for the cut-off point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some concern was expressed by the engineers about the wording of the definition of robustness and the wording of the specified buildings. They are concerned that the building would still have to be certified no matter how small a part of the building might be in this pre-cast mode of construction and even though it might not render it vulnerable to progressive collapse. That is as I understand it.  There was some concern about the definition, that when &ldquo;wholly or in part&rdquo; was inserted it meant that even if a tiny part of the building was in the certain specified form it would have to be certified even though it might be unnecessary.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say <Col N="1554" /> on that point.  They were also concerned about the definition of &ldquo;robustness&rdquo; in which it is stated that robustness concerned ensuring that there would be no multiple collapse.  They felt that &ldquo;ensuring&rdquo; was putting too strong a word on it and that it should be &ldquo;characteristics that tend to prevent or militate against&rdquo;.  Has the Minister considered those two points? If so, I would like to hear his views on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We must try to get away from referring to the progressive collapse concept.  I gave progressive collapse much consideration as distinct from disproportionate collapse.  We do not have to go into the difference between them now but they are very substantial. Deputy Quinn referred to that matter and it is critical to the whole Bill.  I think the wording is right.  So far as disproportionate collapse is concerned, &ldquo;robustness&rdquo; as a definition is readily understandable.  We took a lot of advice of a technical nature on this.  Regarding its use in the Bill, it is an indicator of a building's ability to resist disproportionate collapse.  A robust building is one constructed in such a way that its walls and floors are well connected with proper ties.  One would expect internal load bearing walls rather than stud partitioning to be in a good robust building. That was the element I wanted to get into the definition and I think that the technical, engineering and architectural people understand that.</P>

      <P>It would be a very rare case where there would be a dual construction. Buildings are usually constructed to a plan and if the plan is of a certain concrete structure and if it includes any of the three which we have, I would not like to go on record as saying that I guarantee that it would be all the same type of structure but I am not aware of any building where there are multiple types of construction within the one building.  For that reason, I think the Deputy's fears are not well grounded.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash; The Minister shall designate Eolas as responsible for conducting an audit from time to time of the safety of the gas supply network and working practice of gas companies and of the certification system of multi-storey buildings; and Eolas shall have all necessary powers to execute this function.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister will warm to this amendment, having seen his performance on the electricity amendment. This is perhaps widening the debate again but it is a very important matter and dealing with the whole question of gas safety in general.  The Minister for Energy has decided that the way in which to handle gas safety is to tell Bord Gáis they should be concerned about gas safety.  It is commendable to tell them so.  There is absolutely no provision for independent oversight of Bord Gáis.  The only difference from what happened heretofore is that Bord Gáis is now in <Col N="1556" /> State ownership whereas the other company was not.  This does not in any way affect the very limited number of gas companies that are no longer in State ownership.  The Minister will be aware that the task force adverted to an earlier report in which concern was expressed that should the number of accidents in the Dublin system diminish the dedication of staff to safety would equally diminish. The evidence of what led up to Raglan was that when a business was under pressure the day-to-day management task of keeping a company on the road, in a tough competitive environment, caused safety to become a second priority. Consequently one of the recommendations of the task force was that the frequency, the number and the classification of leaks should be independently monitored on an annual basis by a formal reporting system.</P>
    <P>The task force recognised the need for someone independent of either the gas supply company or, in this case, the building owners to have a role in overseeing safety procedures.  Accordingly, I have tabled this amendment in which I am suggesting that the Minister might designate Eolas as a possible body with the required skills who would have the possibility of conducting an audit from time to time both of the certification system, envisaged in this Bill, and of the general safety of the gas supply network and the working practice of gas companies.  The purpose essentially is to keep the two systems of guaranteeing public safety up to scratch.  The Minister will point to the various recommendations having been acted upon by Bord Gáis.  He is perfectly right in that, as they have acted upon the recommendations.  What we are talking about is the longer run situation where concern about safety may diminish in time to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the results of the leak surveys are not made public.  The results of their accident reports are not made public.  Their performance relative to targets on gas losses in the system are not made public.  These are all areas over which the public will have no input in years to come.  No one <Col N="1557" /> has been appointed to ensure that these things will be honoured in years to come when the same pressure and public interest in safety will not be there, because we hope there will not be another accident.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the whole certification procedure is operating to good effect it requires someone who has the power to go in and spot check the procedures being used.  That is probably true in the case of section 6, where the local authorities, apparently, will oversee their own certification of multi-storey buildings so that they will be handing a certificate to themselves. That, to my mind, is a very strange system of certification, where you both write and oversee the same certificate. That is the reason I see merit in having someone who has the power not to do a continuous bureaucratic oversight on a day-to-day basis but to do occasional, unannounced audits and spot checks on what is going on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what the Deputy is getting at.  He was correct in saying that the responsibility for gas is a matter for the Minister for Energy and in recognising that this legislation concerns structures. The Minister for Energy has appointed a technical officer solely for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the recommendations on gas in the various reports I referred to.  In the monitoring the officer will be guided by the 34 standards on gas published by Eolas last October at the request of the Minister for Energy.  I gave details about them earlier.  What the Deputy is seeking is being attended to in a different way. Local authorities are the appropriate bodies for seeing that the certificates are lodged and for prosecutions.  If an owner defaults on his responsibilities it will be a matter for the local authority to pursue the matter.  They have their responsibility and the prosecuting powers under the legislation.  I do not think we should take that from them.  It would minimise the whole structure of control.  In view of the fact that we have the new monitoring arrangements I do not think it is necessary to pursue this point, but I accept the <Col N="1558" /> essence of what the Deputy would like to see happen as far as safety is concerned.</P>

      <P>On the amendment, the Minister has missed my point.  The existence of an officer interested in this matter is commendable, but there is a need to have somebody who does not have any other responsibility but to report publicly on the safety of the system.  The officer the Minister has referred to will not have any public function. There is a natural symbiotic relationship between officers and companies if there is not public reporting. Eventually, they see their role as similar to the company they are supposed to be overseeing.  There is a need to have somebody whose job it is to report on an intermittent basis on the successful operation of the systems that are supposed to be there.  That is the distinction I am anxious to make.  Bord Gáis are not answerable to anybody; they are not answerable to the House for what is going on in this area.  We cannot get information on that, but I do not think Deputies have the competence to appraise the results of leak surveys and so on. However, there is a need to have somebody who would not be involved with the company, which is trying to make a commercial profit out of the system, to oversee the success of the safety measures. Similarly, under section 6 the local authority will be providing certificates, looking at those certificates and taking prosecutions.  That seems extraordinary.</P>

      <Col N="1561" /> In page 5, line 14, to delete &ldquo;,as far as practicable,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to promote the idea that these certificates should be completed.  The words midway in line ten of the section are a slight rollback from that.  The section states:</P>

    <P>I am a little unhappy about the qualification, but I can understand the need for it.  However, when there is a further qualification within the qualification I wonder if we are leaving a way out.  The words &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;, seem to be a bit milk and water.  I am not going to go to war over this, but I must make a point that I cannot understand why those words are in the section.  It would be perfectly reasonable to say &ldquo;in whose functional area the building is situate a further certificate, signed by a competent person, certifying that all reasonable actions as set out in that certificate have been taken to minimise the risk of accidental damage&rdquo; and so on.

It is not possible to eliminate risk completely in normal circumstances and this practicality has to be recognised.

If there was a void under a building and if it was in a honeycomb format in the construction it would be impracticable to ventilate the inner walls of the honeycomb.  In such a case the answer might be to do something else, as laid down in the Schedule. If the amendment was accepted the engineer might consider that he had to ventilate all the voids as listed in the Third Schedule and that would make it impossible.

Does he see any danger there that buildings that are otherwise quite sound might not be granted a certificate simply because of the time at which they were built relative to the institution of practices?  Practices change from time to time.  A new set of practices might be announced in a year's time.  Will a whole new round of certification have to be undertaken when those new practices come in, or will it be the case that buildings now complying under a set of certificates might on another day no longer meet some new requirement that is brought in?  The Minister has probably covered this matter in section 3 (2) (c). There is always the option that other actions can be taken.  What is the Minister's view on a person asking that a building be retrospectively certified to meet standards that were not there when it was built?  Is there a danger of this?</P>

      <P>No.  I can reassure the Deputy on that.  We are only talking about certain types of construction. There are three different separate types of certificate that cover that.  They give total cover of all aspects such as the ones to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 36, to delete &ldquo;any&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;all reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former English teacher, words seem to cause me a certain degree of undue excitement and importance on occasions. Section 7(2) states: &ldquo;The owner or his agent shall make good any disturbance of the building caused by any works or actions pursuant to this section&rdquo;.  I would like that to be amended to read that the owner, or his agent, shall make good all reasonable disturbance of the building. In the discussion which we had a few moments ago we agreed that there is a practicability or a reasonable dimension to this kind of statement.  I could see a situation arising where by accident there could be a disturbance caused to a building by works or actions pursuant to the section.  It could be a very serious accident. A wall could be cracked or major renovations could be needed by virtue of bad workmanship and so on.  It is unnecessary and unfair to impose such a cost on the owner or his agent.  He or she should carry out and pay for any works that are necessary to put right what is wrong.  The use of the words &ldquo;any&rdquo; makes it an open cheque.  If the words &ldquo;all reasonable&rdquo; were inserted it would seem to be quite fair &mdash;&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; being <Col N="1565" /> defined with reference to what is reasonable to achieve in order to comply with the Bill.  Otherwise a person could end up having to foot an enormous bill through negligence, accident, omission, oversight or whatever and that would not be in the spirit of justice.  The use of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; makes the provision virtually open-ended and it could cause unnecessary problems for a person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposite point is what we are trying to get at.  We want to ensure that it will be to the tenant or owner's benefit, for the following reason.  Section 7 gives the powers of entry to carry out inspections and any works or actions necessary to enable a certificate to be obtained and submitted to the local authority. There can be physical disturbance of the building.  For example, in relation to the opening of a wall, a floor or a ceiling, certain details of the construction would have to be checked.  Occupiers of the building, such as long-term tenants who are not owners, should not suffer.  It is reasonable that any disturbance should be made good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>By whoever carries out the work.  We found it difficult to understand the amendment for that reason.  If it was passed it would require that only reasonable disturbance be made good and, by implication, unreasonable disturbances of the building would be left without repair.  If that happened, the opposite to what the Deputy wishes to achieve would be the result.  For that reason we have drafted the words in this way, so that the disturbance will be repaired properly and to everyone's satisfaction as against giving people an option to do something that is unreasonably expensive and thereby not having the job done properly for the tenant.  It is purely to ensure that the job will be done properly.</P>

I am concerned that unreasonable disturbance would not be remedied to the level that would leave it proper.  It might seem like semantics but at the same time the point is that we want the job done either for inspection or for remedial work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4), line 31, after &ldquo;one&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;daily or provincial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reason to think that this amendment is worthy of sympathetic consideration. As we know, the Planning Acts require notification in a newspaper and in this Bill the same broad formula is being applied.  &ldquo;Where a notice is served on, or given to, a person ... a copy of the notice shall, within two weeks thereafter, be published in at least one newspaper circulating in an area in which the person is known to have resided.&rdquo; That is fair.  When the Planning Acts were drafted I suspect that the newspaper had mass circulation and was probably a well known, easily identified, popular organ of dissemination.  In recent years there has been a growth in the number of other printed matter, which are newspapers in <Col N="1567" /> the literal sense of the word but which, on occasion, are called free sheets, giveaway papers, or are of indeterminate print run or distribution.</P>
    <P>I have had experience in recent times of people who, in the planning context, were conned by the insertion of the requisite planning notice in what, in my view, could not be called newspapers, because basically they are entertainment sheets and their main purpose is attracting advertisements.  Fair play to the publishers, I am not denying them the right to do that but I am concerned about the definition of &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the notice is to alert those who are interested, or if it is to afford them the opportunity of being aware, then some qualification of &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; is appropriate.  We could define it as a national paper, a provincial paper or a major countywide paper.  I do not know the correct word which will best meet that need and I am open to any suggestion the Minister may make.  This is a problem, and I know from professionals in the planning field that it is a major problem. That requirement &mdash; which is the only way a community has of being alerted &mdash; can be met by putting a notice in an obscure newspaper, in an obscure language, or in the Irish language or in any other form.  That is not the spirit of the proposal.  Having learned the lesson in the planning area, I am trying to apply it to this area as well.  I am not pushed about the wording and I know it is a problem but perhaps the Minister would suggest a suitable wording.</P>

      <P>Could I help the Minister? I am pleased the Minister has accepted this point.  The problem is that we have Report Stage immediately following the Committee Stage today and the Dáil will not have time to consider this Bill further.  It would probably be a little restrictive if we were to say daily national papers because it might mean that five pages of every daily paper was taken up with little notices.  If the Minister is willing to tackle the problem and tell me he will deal with it between now and when the Bill is discussed in the Seanad, I would be happy enough.</P>

      <P>My comments might be related to the Second Schedule.  Would either of these Schedules prohibit the use of what is known as a Super Ser heater in a multi-storey building?  Items 9 and 10 on page 11 mention 500 millilitres. The normal liquid gas container is approximately five litres &mdash; perhaps even five to ten litres.  Are we excluding the possibility that somebody could have two or three of these cylinders in their house? If elderly people were using this form of heating, it would be practical if they were to have a replacement cylinder so that if one ran out of gas they would be able to replace it.  I am sure somebody has thought about this and it may be unnecessary but perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is much comfort to the Deputy, but it is recommended that people do not keep replacement cylinders in their apartments or in their homes because they are dangerous. It is highly desirable that if people are using these heaters they do not keep the spare cylinder at home.  It is possible for the owner to prohibit the storage of such cylinders in particular blocks.</P>

      <P>The type of heating which Deputy Quinn mentioned is very popular in local authority flats because it is relatively cheap and people know where they stand regarding their financial outlay on heating.  If gas cylinders are banned in a particular flat complex the tenants will be paying for this by having to use more expensive heating.  That would not be acceptable unless some compensation was paid to them to adapt to a different type of heating which might be more expensive.  Could the Minister explain the exact circumstances in which gas cylinder heating could be banned?</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this matter before taking the Bill to the Seanad.  St. Michael's estate has precast elements and these would qualify as specified buildings.  The estate is in Deputy Mac Giolla's constituency. Paragraph 10 of the Third Schedule refers to the cessation of, and the restriction on, the use or storage in the building of gas in containers exceeding 500 millilitres in capacity.  My reading of this provision is that a local authority tenant would not be allowed to have a Super Ser on the fourth or fifth floor of a dwelling in St. Michael's estate.  It would not affect the more traditional type of local authority flats.  I am putting down a question mark and I would ask the Minister to clarify the matter in the Seanad.  We will not have time to deal with it here, but clarification is necessary.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine have completed their first year of operation and I believe that substantial progress has been made during this short period.

      <P>Immediately we were voted into office, the Department of the Marine was set up.  The main functions are reflected in the structures of the new Department, with divisions dealing with sea-fishing, inland fisheries and recreation, aquaculture, maritime safety, marine shipping and legislation.  This year has seen a number of major developments in the marine area.  (1) The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set out ambitious targets for output and employment for the sea fisheries sector.  A plan for the accelerated development of this sector is well advanced.  (2) A framework has been provided for the development of the aquaculture industry and 1988 will see the establishment of a sound licensing system for projects in the industry which will facilitate greater output and more jobs.  (3) I am working towards the rationalisation of the inland fisheries and putting the funding and the development of the industry on a more sound footing.  (4) Legislation has been introduced for the protection of the marine environment.  I have set up a programme for the systematic investigation of the marine environment with a view to ensuring that the high quality of the environment is maintained. (5) I have directed that a programme to enhance marine safety be put in place.  The priorities of that programme are improved communications at sea and increased emphasis on ferry safety and supervision.  (6) Finally, I have Government approval for the establishment of a marine institute.  This will bring together under one body activities carried out by a wide range of State funded organisations.  The heads of a Bill for the marine institute have been prepared and the Bill will be drafted as soon as possible to give a statutory basis to these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the Government put particular emphasis on the potential of the fishing <Col N="1577" /> industry to generate growth in the economy. The Government's programme recognised that a properly planned approach to the exploitation of our sea fisheries was essential and offered a very significant opportunity for economic expansion and job creation.  For this reason, Bord Iascaigh Mhara have prepared a development plan in conjunction with my Department covering the expansion of our sea fisheries resource up to the end of 1991.  It is the Government's intention that the plan will revitalise all sectors involved in fishing and, above all, instil a new confidence and competitiveness into the industry.</P>
    <P>The plan addresses specifically those issues which have inhibited expansion, sets objectives and strategies aimed at redressing these problems and will point the way to new opportunities and job creation in fishing.  One of the key strategies in the plan will be a planned approach to fleet modernisation which is essential in order to reduce the high age profile of our fleet.  In view of the enormous potential for expansion in aquaculture with particular stress on added value, I have asked the board to give this sector particular attention.  I have also asked that exploratory fishing be given increased attention, and particularly that such fishing in our more distant west coast waters should be encouraged with a view to rapidly developing new fisheries in those waters.</P>
    <P>The fish processing industry is a vital element in any strategy for the fish sector. Supplies have been a major constraint to the development of the sector.  I intend to pursue every possibility &mdash; quota fish, non-quota fish, fishing in third country waters, imports and aquaculture to maximise the supplies to the country's fish processing industry.  Marketing, processing and related product quality issues will feature prominently in the plan as it is apparent that, with increased landings and expansion in fish farming, it will be imperative that we adopt a much more co-ordinated and dynamic approach in the market place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> My Department, together with the various State development agencies concerned, have been considering in recent months how best to optimise the further development of the fish processing sector.  There are already indications indeed that the sector is about to enter a significant new phase, one characterised by greater integration, operational scale, cohesiveness and professionalism.  In my view, the task of the State agencies will be to encourage and accelerate such trends. All future State support to the sector will, therefore, be directed towards achieving the objective of building a strong internationally competitive fish processing sector.</P>
    <P>More detailed criteria governing future State assistance to the sector will be made available shortly.  I am confident that as a result of the policies and objectives now proposed and shortly to be published, up to 800 new jobs can be created over the next three-year period in fish processing. Already indeed, within the past six months, approximately 70 new jobs have been created in the sector.  Naturally, this type of planned development will entail a very significant level of investment by the industry.  The Government for their part will help stimulate this investment through the provision of Exchequer assistance.  It will be the Government's aim to ensure the maximum take-up and the effective use of all available EC structural funding.</P>
    <P>On the quotas issue, while we are constrained by the common fisheries policy every effort is being made to improve our position.  I am pressing for increases in the fish allocation and have received indications that the situation for herring and mackerel will be reviewed during the year.  In 1987 we obtained an extra 10,000 tonnes of mackerel for Irish fishermen by swapping quantities of unused quotas of other species.  I would like here to pay tribute to the industry for its co-operation in our stock management programme without which co-operation it would be more difficult to operate.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the difficulties facing Ireland arising from activities of the so-called &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo;<Col N="1579" /> vessels.  The matter has been pursued through the European Courts and while not wishing to prejudice any further legal actions, I feel that a recent judgment by the Court of Justice in Ireland's favour offers real hope for the future solution of the problem.  The matter was also raised by me on a number of occasions at the Council of Fisheries Ministers and during the EC Commissioner for Fisheries visit to Ireland on a fact finding visit in 1987. In response to my intervention the Commission have accepted the serious nature of the problem and have circulated for consideration a proposal to address the matter.  While the proposal does not in our initial view deal adequately with the problem of &ldquo;quota hopping&rdquo;, the matter is being pursued at working group level.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress was made on the ground in 1987 and is continuing to be made this year in the enforcement of existing controls on quality standards within the fishing industry.  While the preparation and enactment of legislation is important, I decided that the first priority was to improve the situation on the ground.  This will, through surveys and other evaluatory exercises, help us produce a new up-to-date marketing Bill.</P>
    <P>My Department's quality control programme contains the following elements: The shellfish monitoring programme, which commenced in September 1985, continued and was expanded in 1987, so that at this stage samples of water and shellfish are taken from over 50 sampling points and analysed for microbiological parameters every two weeks.  The objectives of the programme are to classify shellfish producing waters and to establish a comprehensive procedure whereby the quality of shellfish and shellfish producing waters is monitored and controlled. This programme, as with similar programmes in other European countries, is modelled on the American National Shellfish Sanitation Programme, and allows for the greatest flexibility without any diminution in safety and quality standards.</P>
    <P>In 1987, I had completed a comprehensive survey of hygiene standards <Col N="1580" /> in approximately 80 per cent of fish processing premises, in order to improve the levels of operational and structural hygiene.  In many cases a large proportion of required improvements and alterations have been completed.  My Department's sea fishery and fish quality officers continue to monitor the progress being made and report to the Department.</P>
    <P>A programme to inspect fishing vessels started in 1987, during which 40-50 per cent of vessels were examined.  Remedial works and changes in hygiene practices were specified in the course of these inspections.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Department's strengthening of fish inspection systems to make them more effective, the Department last year initiated comprehensive and ongoing training programmes for the sea fishery officers and the fish quality officers.  This year, as part of the programme, the officers received further intensive training on a wide range of areas relating to fish quality including microbiology, biochemistry, fish pathology, refrigeration and facilities design. Additional follow-up training is planned for later this year.  Other elements of the quality control programme include the improvement of standards in ice-plants and purification plants.</P>
    <P>I believe that what will ultimately determine the profitability of the fishing and fish-processing industries are the quality of the product and the ability to meet the requirements of the consumer.  My Department will be stepping up their efforts with all sides of the fishing industry to improve these factors.</P>
    <P>My Department have responsibility under the Fisheries Act, 1980, for the regulation of aquaculture in the State.  To date 14 areas have been designated while five further areas are being considered for possible designation.  I am taking steps to improve the availability of information for the public in respect of aquaculture. In particular, I have asked BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta to prepare video material which might serve as a basis for informing the general public about aquaculture development in areas where designation is being considered.  I intend <Col N="1581" /> to arrange a new series of hearings later in the year and this I hope will lead to further designations being made.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed in recent times in relation to my Department's policy on fish farming in lakes, particularly those in the west.  I am glad to have this opportunity to restate my policy on this issue in order to allay fears and correct misapprehensions.  Aquaculture projects are not permitted in lakes where there are major wild fisheries, that is, trout and salmon.  I regard these as a valuable natural resource to be fully developed in their own right.  No permits have been issued for full scale fish farming projects by my Department.</P>
    <P>I have recently undertaken a critical examination of the concept of smolt rearing in lakes generally.  The requirements for smolts for the aquaculture industry should to the greatest extent possible be met in the future from land-based facilities using pumpted or gravity fed water. As I recently indicated to the House, there are eight applications with my Department at present for smolt rearing projects in lakes.  Each application on hands will be examined personally by me in line with the policy I have outlined above.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we produced 250 tonnes of farmed salmon.  By 1987 this figure rose to 2,500 tonnes, the bulk of which were exported.  That is just one example of the room there is for development and expansion in that area and the necessity for pressing ahead with developments along the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture of fish and shellfish under intensive farming conditions is growing very rapidly in Irish coastal waters. Because of these intensive conditions farmed fish and shellfish are exposed to greater risks from outbreaks of disease than they would be under intensive natural conditions.  We can expect the variety of diseases to increase, just as they did in the case of intensive farm animal husbandry, thus exposing the industry to the possibility of outbreaks of disease caused by mortality.  It is therefore essential that <Col N="1582" /> a national disease diagnostic and therapeutic service is available to the aquaculture industry and my Department consider this to have a priority rating in their work to promote and improve this rapidly growing sector of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis will be given to disease avoidance by the use of controlled feeding diets and improved husbandry. At the same time vaccination techniques and therapeutic treatments will be utilised to prevent or cure diseases which in the recent past have proved to be fatal.</P>
    <P>The people going into the aquaculture business today are better trained than ever before.  The regional technical colleges, universities and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have developed training courses specially designed to cater for the needs of this industry.  I have established a high level aquaculture management committee chaired by my Department comprising senior executives of BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The task of that committee is to galvanise and co-ordinate the efforts of Government Departments and agencies to improve the interface with FEOGA and to ensure that aid applications are properly prepared and presented to the European Community. The arrangements are designed to assure that aid applications are properly prepared and presented to the European Community.  The arrangements are designed to ensure that the returns to the economy in terms of employment, output and exports can be maximised.</P>
    <P>The contribution which aquaculture can make to economic development does not begin and end with rearing fish.  As it develops I hope that the industry will become integrated with more and more inputs being generated within our own economy.  At present our main import requirements are seed stock, cages, equipment and fish feed.  Ireland is now almost completely self-sufficient in terms of supplying salmon smolts for ongrowing in sea cages and the importation of smolts has practically been suspended for disease prevention reasons.  There are a number of new hatcheries for shellfish and finfish which are now coming on <Col N="1583" /> stream and these should be able to meet the increasing demand for stocks.</P>
    <P>A number of companies in Ireland now manufacture various types of fish cages and all types of floats and mooring equipment for the industry.  Some of these have also developed highly profitable export markets for their equipment.</P>
    <P>At present there are 330 full-time and 1,040 part-time workers employed in aquaculture.  The Government's target is that by 1991 output will almost treble, full-time employment will be 1,100 and part-time employment will be 2,300.  This additional employment is crucial to areas where fish processing will be developed as physical factors have made most other types of industrial development difficult to establish.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record my determination to secure the maximum commitment from Europe to this industry. With the coming into force of the Single European Act and the new emphasis on targeting the peripheral regions, I think that sea fisheries, and especially aquaculture, represents an ideal candidate as a conduit for development funds which can be productively used.  My Department are taking a number of initiatives to ensure that our industry and its potential is properly understood in Brussels and that projects are presented in the best possible light.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries are widely acknowledged as one of our finest natural resources and the Government are committed to developing this resource with a view to creating additional employment. Recognising the importance of the inland fisheries resource, I was determined to establish a framework which provided additional finance to the boards to supplement the Exchequer grant.  Licences have been required for salmon angling since the middle of the nineteenth century. Trout, coarse fish and sea anglers were enabled under the Fisheries Act, 1980, to register on a voluntary basis which enabled them to contribute towards the cost of administration of fisheries and also to participate in the management of the fisheries boards.  A <Col N="1584" /> very small minority of trout and coarse fish anglers registered.  The registration fee introduced in 1980 was £5, which was increased to £9.50 in 1985.  In 1986 only 4,000 registered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>With even fewer this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised angling licensing system provides an alternative source of income to the fisheries boards and allows anglers to contribute to inland fisheries development through the payment of moderate charges.  Persons under 18 years and those aged 66 and over do not require licences to fish for trout or coarse fish.  I wish to emphasise that all the revenue from the licences will be collected locally and used in local areas for conservation, protection and development of fishing.  I would point out that the revenue from the new system represents only a fraction of Government expenditure on inland fishing.  A licensing system is therefore clearly justified on economic and social grounds.  It is fair to say that those who benefit from State expenditure in this way should make a contribution towards the cost.  It would be unfair in these difficult times to expect the tax-payer to continue bearing the full burden.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the moneys accure to the local boards for spending in local areas and not as general tax revenue. Ownership rights are not at all affected by the licence arrangement &mdash; the payment of a salmon licence is long established and accepted.  A licence is a requirement to use a rod to fish but it conveys no right whatsoever to fish, no more than a gun licence gives shooting rights to a licence holder.  There is no question, as I have again explained today, of placing cages in our major natural fisheries lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite repeated explanations of these facts to those concerned, the campaign against the licence continues in certain parts of the country and is backed up by offensive signs and intimidation.  These tactics are unacceptable and shortsighted. They are out of all proportion to the issue at stake and not only will these people damage their own livelihoods but <Col N="1585" /> also their neighbours' livelihoods.  I accept, of course, that many of those opposed to the licence have no time or part in the campaign of intimidation.  My Department and I have been working tirelessly to identify common ground with responsible anglers within the framework of the legislation.  A positive partnership dedicated to exploit the full potential of inland fisheries is the only way forward; but to yield to the demands of people who intimidate their neighbours, damage the livelihood of people and attempt to hold the tourist industry hostage would be to do a major disservice to the democratic institutions and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>In November 1987 I received a report of the salmon review group.  I have accepted the objectives set out in the report and I am confident that these objectives will form a firm foundation on which the future development of the salmon industry can be based.  I published the report earlier this year and in view of the importance of the proposed reforms I invited interested parties to submit their views not later than 31 March of this year. These submissions are currently being considered and appropriate action will be taken.</P>
    <P>My Department have been given a special responsiblity to promote marine related leisure activites and I intend to pursue vigorously the provision of marina and leisure facilities without State assistance around our coastline.  I recently set up a planning review group for the Dún Laoghaire harbour area and this group will make sure that the long-term as well as the short-term options for the development of the harbour are properly examined and planned.</P>
    <P>In regard to pollution control, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill was enacted into law this year.  A further Bill is in the course of preparation to strengthen the law dealing with the discharges of oil from ships.  The Water Pollution (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which is being prepared by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will increase the penalties for pollution under the Fisheries Acts and <Col N="1586" /> require the pollutor to make good the damage caused.</P>
    <P>In regard to maritime safety, my Department are presently improving the number and standard of VHF coastal radio stations in order to reduce the risks and dangers of using the sea.  The Government consider that the provision of a 24 hour listening watch on VHF distress and emergency channels in all coastal areas is the single most effective contribution they can make to the safety of life at sea.  A programme for the provision of further services in that area is already under way with the modernisation of the stations in Howth, Dungarvan, Rosslare and Belmullet.  I established a National Ferry Safety Committee on October 1987, representative of senior technical officers of the Irish ferry companies and the marine survey office of my Department, to review safety procedures and standards on board Irish registered roll-on roll-off ferries.</P>
    <P>I have included in my speech some other areas of importance which Deputies will be interested in.  I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>An Estimate debate is an occasion on which to review aspects of the past year, in this case the development of marine issues generally.  Regrettably, one of the main marine matters that springs to mind when looking over the past few months is the rod angling dispute.  If the time and energy which has been invested in attempting to resolve the difficulties which the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987, has caused for angling tourism had been invested in a development plan for inland fisheries with the proper structures and financial investment, with pollution control measures and an honest attempt made to come to terms with the illicit drift netting which is devastating our stocks of wild Atlantic salmon, I believe the Government would not be facing the hostility of the anglers, which is but a symptom of a far greater problem &mdash; the serious and insidious decline in angling through the neglect by successive <Col N="1587" /> Governments of an industry which is capable of contributing enormously to our GNP through tourist revenue.</P>
      <P>A recent report and statistical analysis carried out by the ESRI points out the potential a properly developed angling tourist industry could have for this country. Price Waterhouse in a recent report underlined the potential &mdash; the millions of anglers in the UK, Europe and the US, not to mention further afield &mdash; and our present paltry share of that angling tourist market.  As a special activity holiday we have all the ingredients to put our inland fisheries on the world map: 8,600 miles of main channel river, 360,000 acres of lakes, the climate, the accommodation and a country which is relatively pollution free.  We have what money alone cannot buy &mdash; an indigenous product that needs no imported raw material for priming.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to put on record the Government's plans for the regional boards.  What are the plans for the report of the Salmon Review Group, which was much awaited, now long since published, but as yet not acted upon?  We have had submissions on that report, a report I welcome in so far at it goes.  Will tagging and quotas for salmon be introduced for next year's season?  How will these quotas be arrived at?  Who will monitor this system?  Answers to these questions are urgently needed.  Will this report be destined for a shelf, to be relatively undisturbed in future years, like many previous reports on salmon?  The report of the Fisheries Commission, 1933-35, is gathering dust somewhere.  We had the report on the Inland Fisheries Commission, 1975; the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission on the Strategy for Management and Development, 1986; ESRI Papers 68, 75, 78 and 100, all of which direct their attention towards salmon; the report from the Committee on Public Expenditure, 1986; the Hunter Report, 1965, from Scotland; the Hansen Report, 1986 from Norway; the Salmon Management Plan, 1985, from Canada and the recent report of the Biarritz Salmon Conference, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> We are not short of reports or recommendations, we are not short of direction on what we should do and how we should go about it.  All of these reports have pointed out what needs to be done.  At the very least, the bottom line is that there should be strict control of drift netting at sea.  I wonder if this House has got what it takes to make the right decisions and follow them through?</P>
    <P>The differences on these issues, to be quite honest and frank, are not party political; they are within each party.  To date, no Government have recognised that time is running out.  If our salmon cannot return to their rivers to spawn, there will be no tomorrow for the anglers, let alone the driftnet men.  This is the real issue behind the present protest.  The licences were the last straw to a group who had witnessed the insidious decline of their sport, a sport which they hold so dear.  I ask again if the Members of this House have the political will to do what so many reports have told us is necessary?</P>
    <P>Anglers, in particular in the West, fear the licensing system which was introduced last December.  It was introduced on the basis of assurances from the Minister that the Coarse Fishing Federation and the Trout Anglers' Federation of Ireland supported the Bill &mdash; I quote the Minister's words &mdash; not supported licences in principle or gave conditional support for the Bill, but the Minister stated categorically that TAFI and the Coarse Fishing Federation supported the Bill.  The Bill means the Bill in its entirety, the Bill as presented by the Minister.  As we know, major difficulties have resulted from the Minister's interpretation of what TAFI and the Coarse Fishing Federation supported and this has been far from clarified to date.</P>
    <P>Anglers fear the Bill because they regard it as a means of ultimately controlling where and when they may fish, apart altogether from being a revenue collection mechanism.  A licence is seen as revocable by the licensor, or the Government in this instance, without any legal redress by the licensee or angler. The anglers fear that the Minister, or some other Minister at some stage, could <Col N="1589" /> use this system to preclude angling on our game lakes, for example, in Loughs Corrib, Mask and Cong, so as to make way for fish farming.  I know the Minister's views on this but I am afraid the anglers do not trust us in this House. Even if I was giving the assurances the Minister is giving, I doubt if they would be received any better.  The track record of successive Governments in relation to inland fisheries has been so bad that the Minister is mistrusted, and I imagine if any of the rest of us were in the Minister's position we would perhaps be equally mistrusted.  The Minister is heading up this issue at present and I have to say quite frankly that the anglers mistrust his assurances or any statements he makes in relation to this matter because of the appalling track record over the years.</P>
    <P>It is hard for me to express, or for any of us to appreciate, the depth of feeling that has been generated on this issue or to realise the bitter divisions and entrenchment that has taken place.  To show their good faith, the anglers are now collecting money voluntarily from their members.  I urge the Minister to remove the licence concept from the legislation and to replace it with a contribution system for trout and coarse fishing, a contribution which the anglers have already proved they are willing to pay.  I have a Bill on the Order Paper which endeavours to do just that but because of the six-month rule I was prevented until this week from moving it.  As this is the last week of Private Members' Time during this session it was not possible, even if the Minister and the Government were to agree to the First Stage, which apparently they were not, to get the Bill published and circulated in time for a Private Members' discussion at 7 p.m. on Tuesday last.</P>
    <P>I, and I am sure many other Members of this House, will spend the summer months pursuing agreement with all those who care and understand the real issues, with those who bother to analyse the real issues rather than the politics of the situation, with those who want an honourable solution to this most destructive of disputes which is doing so much <Col N="1590" /> damage to our tourist economy, particularly in the west and in Munster.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to indicate what he has in mind for our regional boards.  I put it to him that the Government are reneging on their responsibility to the regional boards who are impotent in the face of organised poaching and vicious attacks on their members.  Witness the appalling spectacle in Donegal last weekend where two fishery protection officers were savagely beaten and ended up being hospitalised.  What steps has the Minister or his Department taken this week to ensure that this will not be repeated in the Northern Fishery Board area or in any board region?  Is it true that but for the contribution of the Donegal Salmon and Inshore Fishermen's Association there would be no protection at all in that regional board area?</P>
    <P>I turn my attention now to another matter that has caused many problems in the last year, that is our lack of success in relation to FEOGA applications under the new structures policy.  In 1987, in the December tranche, for the first time Irish fishermen and fish farmers were let down badly by the Commission in relation to grants in the new structures policy, despite the fact that Commissioner Cordosa y Cunha, whom I had the pleasure to meet, visited Ireland last July at the invitation of the Minister.  It may be coincidental, but it was a major shock to the industry subsequently to find Ireland at the bottom of the pile of recipients. From correspondence that I entered into and a response that I received from the Commissioner himself, it would appear that the EC's reasons for our lack of success were based on the rate of takeup of previous grants and, as the Commission view it, unfavourable cost-benefit analysis of Irish agricultural applications when compared with other applicant countries.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Commission did not know that the technology being used on our west coast to stand up to the rigours of meteorological and tidal conditions was the most advanced in Europe.  I refer <Col N="1591" /> specifically to those applications involving bridgestone cages.  Apparently the Commission, instead of admitting that a comparative analysis was not possible, rejected our applications.  It is obvious that proper dialogue, based on good communications between the applicants and the Commission, via the relevant sections in the Department of the Marine, was missing.</P>
    <P>Again, in the April tranche for FEOGA applications we are bottom of the pile.  We have but an 18 per cent success rate, the lowest of all applicant countries.  I earnestly hope that this communication difficulty has now been resolved.  I await the tranche of September of this year to see evidence of the Commission's support for this most important growth industry.</P>
    <P>Commercial fish farming has shown phenomenal growth in the last few years. A huge increase in the tonnage of farmed salmon is perhaps the best known statistic, involving sea cages and land based water systems.  Sensitive development, in sympathy with environmental considerations and other water-based users is essential, particularly in inland waters, close to the shore line and in bays and estuaries.  Where the technology is available, areas of greatest water dilution should be chosen, especially the open sea.</P>
    <P>I look forward to monitoring the progress of the very latest farm ocean cages for salmon which are built to withstand the rigours of the waves in the open sea. If this is proved to be the way forward &mdash; and time will tell &mdash; aquaculture will continue to make an enormous contribution to our GNP for a long time to come and will be most important from a socio-economic viewpoint, especially on our west coast.  Aquaculture, or fish farming, is not all about salmon &mdash; important as that aspect is.  We have rainbow trout, fresh water and sea water, oyster fisheries and oyster farms, extensive and intensive cultivation of mussels, eels, scallops and clams.  I must pause to pay a special tribute to the Carna Research <Col N="1592" /> Laboratory for their enormous contribution to this industry through their extensive research and development on various species.  Abalone, the most highly prized of all, could be the next for commercial farming.  I am delighted that in recent weeks the difficulty of the uncertain funding of this laboratory appears to have been resolved.  I ask the Minister to outline exactly how Carna will dovetail into his oft-heralded Marine Research Centre.  Apparently, there will be no one centre as such, but a closer liaison between existing centres, including the Fisheries Research Centre at Abbottstown.</P>
    <P>Excellent work is done at the Fisheries Research Centre, particularly in the area of disease control and fish pathology. Given the potential of this area in aquaculture especially, and the difficulties that arose in the last year in relation to the second outbreak of bonamia ostrea in Clew Bay &mdash; detected by French officials, not ourselves &mdash; we must question if sufficient resources, especially in terms of manpower, are being allocated.  One fish pathologist has an impossible task, given the workload, and far more could be done if the manpower were available.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of FEOGA funding that is causing me concern, especially when taken in conjunction with the average age of our fishing fleet.  It appears that the goalposts have been moved by the Commission and an arbitrary age restriction has been introduced for grants for refurbishing and modernisation of vessels.  The age limit is difficult to determine, but appears to be between 15 and 20 years and any vessel over this age will not qualify for a grant. Given that the average age of our average sized vessel is 30 years, this is an appalling change in the ground rules.  This fact, together with the failure of the Commission to allow any grant for new vessel construction at all until all states reduce their gross registered tonnage, augurs very badly for our fishing industry, which we claim has such potential, such a future.</P>
    <P>I put the question to the Minister: with the penally restrictive quotas for the <Col N="1593" /> more important species, no grants now for new vessels and the decrease demanded in our gross registered tonnage of up to 16 per cent by 1991, with the age structure of our present fleet, with licences being issued on a basis of equivalent tonnage being sold out of State or, in the case of beamers not at all, with the ongoing difficulty of flags of convenience, what future has our fishing industry?  The Minister's party claimed that they would resolve the quota restrictions as a priority on assuming office.  We await action.  They have failed miserably to keep their word.  I was present when the Commissioner and the Director General told the Minister not to look for a greater percentage of the total allowable catch, on which our quota is based now, in 1992 or thereafter.  It was not on.</P>

Have they a future in this industry, or was their future sold out in the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations to safeguard agricultural interests in this country?</P>

      <P>In debating the Marine Estimate today, and looking down through the figures as published, taking into account the most recent debate last night in relation to income for the Department of the Marine, I am struck by the fact that there are a number of increases in the non-productive areas of that Department.  Salaries and wages at <Col N="1594" /> the Department headquarters are up by 19 per cent, machinery expenses are up by 31 per cent, office premises expenses are up by 40 per cent and the other funds, such as the inland fishery funds, are reduced by 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>We have had a few discussions and a few ideas from the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Doyle, on the question of rod licences.  I do not want to dwell on that subject.  Suffice to say that we are all worried to a certain extent about the detrimental effect that the ongoing dispute is having.  All I can say on this matter is that we offered the House last night an opportunity to support a Bill which we felt would provide a cooling off period which I believe is necessary at the moment, to allow the Minister to negotiate an agreed settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on a strategy which seeks to bring together all the different elements of the marine and fisheries, which were fragmented heretofore.  It is important to have an overall strategy and plan.  Like every other industry based on indigenous raw materials, for too long there has been a lack of planning and, as a consequence, market return because we have been at the bottom end of the market and subject to commodity prices.  That can be said in relation to our sea fish, dairy products, beef and other products based on natural resources.  Undoubtedly, there is room for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be very careful when we talk <Col N="1596" /> about a fish processing industry and the creation of jobs.  There have been a number of production disasters in the past 12 months, including a very big one in Galway.  I am not attributing that to the Department of the Marine but we must look to our strengths and make the best use of them.  We must not be looking purely for added costs, we must also look for added value which is not a question of added costs.  Our fish quotas are miserable in comparison to our length of coastline.  However, those quotas, to a certain extent, are based on historical facts and low catches when we joined the EC and the Common Fisheries Policy was put together.</P>
    <P>The same could be said about other products.  For argument's sake, our milk quota is half that of Holland although we have four times its land mass.  There is no point in looking backwards at bases on which today's quotas were established. We must try to take a different approach and, in doing so, we must emphasise how disadvantaged areas, the public and the economy in general can contribute to the situation in relation to income in a country which is hard-pressed for natural resources.  If we make that kind of advance in future we have some chance of getting our quotas increased. We do not have much chance of having them increased by beating our breasts and making comparisons with countries which have far greater quotas than ours, even if it appears to be unfair.  It is up to us to develop what we have and to make a stronger case for getting more.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes overlooked, within the context of the EC, that the EC wants to be in a position to pay out as little money as it can by way of supporting economies. It is far more inclined to help economies to support themselves and it is along these lines that we should be making our case to Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fish processing and FEOGA grants.  I am reliably informed that many of the difficulties with the FEOGA grants are that we have understated the value of the industry to this country.  There is a feeling in Brussels <Col N="1597" /> that the marine in general is on the periphery of business in our economy.  It may be in terms of income in relation to GNP but, in terms of its importance to areas with little or no other natural resource, it is of paramount importance.  The Minister should be exploring every instrument available to him under the Common Agricultural Policy to see if he can get aid in terms of development and, in a two-prong attack, try to get our quotas increased.  He could use the argument that if we had a better marine industry we would be more self-sufficient, which would benefit the EC as well as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture, diseases and pollution must be considered in terms of our national attitude to pollution.  There is irrefutable evidence that badly managed salmon farms and their over-intensification in waters which do not have the necessary turbulence to keep them purified, are a risk to wild species.  My information is that there are certain numbers of such farms in this country and that all the wild and natural species have disappeared from the waters in those areas.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated for harbour development is pitiful in terms of the Minister's stated objective.  I advise him to rethink in regard to estuarial authorities because there is no doubt that in Europe today thinking has changed in relation to these authorities.  Estuarial authorities affect about 5 per cent of the cost of operating ports and the other 95 per cent is not addressed.  Ports located outside European estuarial authorities in northern, non-European countries, are taking the business from them and the imports and exports are being ferried overland to and from these ports because costs are so cheap.  Going through the port of Dublin at the monent puts 20 per cent on to the factory gate price of products exported from here.  Neither an estuarial authority nor a bureaucratic board can address this problem.  It can only be solved by free competition.  I would exhort the Minister to think carefully about this.</P>

      <P>I am always delighted when this Estimate comes before the House because it gives an opportunity to deal with the practical matters that affect fishermen.  Whatever Deputies may think, drift-netting is a fact of life.  It is handed down from generation to generation. The Government cannot take away something that has been handed down for years.  It is all very fine if we introduce stringent laws on drift-netting, but are England, Scotland, the Faroes or Iceland prepared to do it?</P>

Of course, he brought back God and now he wants to bring back the other thing, like Deputy McCoy.  We understand how embarrassed Deputy McCoy must be at the moment and I am sorry he is leaving the House.</P>
      <P>Drift-netting is a fact of life, and I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind in introducing legislation.  The Minister should at least have consultation with the people involved.  The Minister published a very glossy book called the <i>Salmon Review Group Report</i> or something like that.  The personnel in the group reminded me more of the Donnybrook set than anything else.  It is comprised of people from the high echelons of the Fianna Fáil Party or senior civil servants who might meet at the golf club. There was not even one fisherman in the review group.</P>

      <P>In relation to the future of our fishing industry, particularly our shell fishing industry, I understand that there is a new net called the tangle net which is being extensively used to catch cray fish. Deputy Collins, who has just arrived, will be a fair authority on what &ldquo;tangle&rdquo; means as far as greyhounds and that sort of thing is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This tangle net will completely destroy the shell fish industry unless the Minister introduces legislation immediately.  The tangle net is set and left for a couple of days.  The cray fish wander into it and at that stage of its life the cray fish is beginning to shed its shell. It is weak and a prey for other fish.  It is killed immediately.  If this is to continue there will be no shell fish, lobster or cray fish along this coast.  I would ask the Department officials to take an urgent look at that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister also look seriously at the people who are diving for lobster and cary fish and will he have the regulations implemented?  A number of people, particularly foreigners, are diving extensively for lobster and other shell fish. Perhaps the Minister would have the corvette or the Garda Síochána monitor those people.  While listening to Radio na Gaeltachta this morning I heard about two Dingle fishing trawlers being caught for drift net fishing off the Kerry coast.  I wonder if the corvette is to be anchored off West Kerry?  Deputy Gallagher, now Minister of State at the Department of the Marine when in opposition made a very serious attack on the Naval Service and said that the corvette was anchored off the coast of Donegal.  It is a well-known fact that a very senior spokesperson for the fishermen in Donegal wrote to the Department complaining that the corvette was not anchored off Kerry but was all the time anchored off Donegal.  Did the Minister issue strict <Col N="1600" /> instructions through Deputy Michael Noonan to the Department of Defence? I understand that there has been a small amount of friction between the Ministers in Limerick about the estuarial authority. Perhaps they agreed to compromise by landing the corvette down around Kerry. Perhaps the Minister might ask Deputy Michael Noonan not to harass the Kerry fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister Collins, I have just 15 minutes.  I have a few points to make.  In relation to EC quotas, I am very disappointed that the bargaining power of our Minister, his Minister of State and his officials in Brussels has been a big disappointment to everybody. When the present Government were in Opposition they told the fishermen that, if a proper bargaining team was sent to Brussels week after week, quotas would be substantially increased.  What has happened? They have been drastically reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very seriously concerned that senior officials of BIM are now going to Brussels with all the cards the Minister used to have stacked up for his bargaining process in Brussels.  The Minister is now meeting these officials on the other side of the table and they already know his hand.  The Minister cannot even play poker with them because they know what the Minister has in his hand.  There should be some restriction on officials, whether civil servants or semi-State officials, so that when they go into the public service they cannot be in opposition to the Government of the day, particularly <Col N="1601" /> when they are privy to confidential information or files.  I am seriously concerned about that aspect.</P>
    <P>A glaring omission from the Minister's speech was the failure to give any word of encouragement to fishermen's wives and families on the west coast, from Donegal to south-west Cork.  The Minister had a glorious opportunity coming in here this morning to announce that he has now decided to recommend to the Minister for Defence that a helicopter should be based on the west coast.  We all know of the very serious tragedy that took place in Donegal in the last few days.  It was one of many.  I am sure this House will extend its deepest sympathy to the relatives of those involved.  It would allay the anxiety of many fishermen's families, families who must pay insurance, hire purchase repayments and so on, if the Minister would say when replying that the Government are seríously considering basing a helicopter either in Shannon or in Galway.  Will the Minister say a few words on that when replying?</P>
    <P>Another matter that seriously concerns me relates to a question I had on 27 January 1988, &ldquo;To ask the Minister for the Marine if he would investigate reports of serious pollution at Mulroy Bay in County Donegal due to fish farming and if he will confirm that white fish no longer spawn there&rdquo;.  The response I got from the Minister was as follows:</P>
    <P>My Department has in the past investigated reports of pollution in Mulroy Bay due to the use of Tributyltin Oxide on installations.  As a result of these and other investigations I have restricted by means of a by-law under the Fisheries Acts the use of antifouling compounds &mdash; the most commonly known of which is TBT &mdash; on certain boats or any part of a pier, jetty, building or other structure, etc. which is on or in the sea or in freshwater. In addition, this restriction will be a condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1602" />&mdash;of Aquaculture Licences issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department has however information for 1987 that species such as dabs, plaice, pollock, wrasse and smelts spawned in Mulroy Bay in that year, and that there was a good settlement of scallops.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about that question.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to negotiations on the proposal for an EC Council Directive on a general system for the mutual recognition of higher-education diplomas which would include the qualifications of lawyers and of other professional groups.</P>
      <P>I understand that at a meeting of Internal Market Ministers in Luxembourg on 22 June 1988 the Council agreed the substantive provisions of the Directive.  It will now be sent to the European Parliament for a second reading.</P>
      <P>Until the Directive has been finally adopted, I am not in a position to say how it will operate in practice for lawyers. However, I can say that my Department has been pressing for the inclusion in the Directive of a provision for a test for lawyers to assess their ability to pursue their profession in the other member state where they wish to practice.  I am glad to say that this has now been accepted by the EC Council.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister, with the permission of Deputy McCoy, if the question was not clear.  It seems to me that what we should be talking about here is professional standards and not so much higher education diplomas but that those who are already practising would be allowed to have free movement within the Community after 1992.  The question is asking the Minister if he and his Department are in favour of such complete free movement or is it the Department's policy to seek further testing of those who might come from other EC countries or a period of training? The Minister of State with responsibility for Trade and Marketing was at a Council of Minister's meeting in early May at which he, apparently, accused the Council of foot-dragging on this issue. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister whether the adoption of the EC directive will have any impact on access to legal education by both non-nationals and nationals in this country?  Will his Department, as a consequence of the directive, be seeking a greater say on the method of induction of students into the profession? Can the Minister advise us on what has been the response of the Law Society and the Bar Council to the proposals contained in the directive to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that supplementary goes outside the scope of the question as tabled by Deputy McCoy.  I would like to point out to the House that unlike previous sectoral directives, this is a general directive which is meant to <Col N="1604" /> cover a wide range of professions.  One of the main criteria for inclusion within the scope of the directive is that the fully qualified professional must have obtained a diploma awarded by a university, an institute of higher education or other establishment of equivalent level after completing a post-secondary course of at least three years duration.  The Department of Education have co-ordinated Ireland's position on this directive and it has been handled at Council of Ministers meetings by the Minister of State with responsibility for Trade and Marketing.</P>
      <P>The question of aptitude tests for lawyers or an examination procedure &mdash; as stated in the question &mdash; was also raised. In the directive an aptitude test is defined as a check on the professional knowledge of the applicant made by the competent authorities of the host member state with the aim of assessing the ability of the applicant to pursue a regulated profession in the member state.  For all professions, other than that of lawyers, it is the migrant who will have the choice between either taking an aptitude test or a period of supervised practice to enable him to operate as a fully qualified professional in another member state. However, in the case of lawyers, and certain other professions whose practice requires precise knowledge of national law, it is now accepted that the host member state can make this choice.  This is something that we, as well as other member states, were pressing for during the past two years and which has only recently been conceded by the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I realise that the Minister has stated that for all professions, except lawyers, there is a different choice available to member states, would he indicate his view, and that of the Department, on the difficulties which will be encountered &mdash; because there are basic differences between the legal systems in this State and in most of the <Col N="1605" /> European states &mdash; and whether there will be proposals to cope with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While the text of the directive has not been finalised as yet it is expected that aptitude tests will be limited to certain subjects.  It must take into account the fact that the applicant is a fully qualified professional in the country of origin and must only cover subjects which are essential to enable him to exercise his profession competently in another member state.  When the directive is finally adopted there will be a period of about two years before implementation.  During that time we will have to designate competent authorities to implement the directive.  We will have to have talks with the Kings' Inns and the Incorporated Law Society.  The Department of Justice have been working very closely with both branches of the legal profession in the negotiation of this directive, and we are grateful to them for the help, advice and assistance which they have given to the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline the circumstances under which a member of the Garda Síochána may open fire in the course of his duties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Detailed instructions in relation to the circumstances in which <Col N="1606" /> firearms may be used by members of the force in the course of duty are set out in the Garda Síochána Code.  However, for the purpose of replying to this question I propose to give only a broad outline of those circumstances.  Firstly, it is important to emphasise that firearms are issued only to members trained and proficient in their use; that firearms are issued primarily as weapons of defence, and that the members concerned must be fully familiar with the instructions governing the use of the firearm entrusted to them. Broadly speaking, a firearm may be used by a member of the Garda Síochána only in circumstances where it is absolutely necessary in self-defence or to repel a serious attack on a person whose life is thereby endangered or to repel a serious attack on premises or property such as might occur during a major incident involving, say, rioting, looting or a serious arson attack.  The use of firearms would be justified only where no other means were available to protect the life or property which was imperiled.  An overriding principle in all of this area is that the use of the firearm must be lawful and that no more force than is necessary should be used.</P>
      <P>I should add that the Garda authorities have assured me that, in every case where a firearm is discharged by a member of the force in the course of his duty, the circumstances are fully investigated to ensure that all instructions are strictly observed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will give details of the actual terms, conditions and procedures whereby a person who is not a citizen of an EC country can apply for and obtain a resident's permit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be helpful if I outline the procedures for (a) entry to the State by a person who is not a citizen of an EC country and (b) the subsequent residence here of such a person.  On the occasion of a reply to a parliamentary <Col N="1607" /> question I can give only a broad outline but I will indicate the sections of the relevant legislation where greater detail is to be found.</P>
      <P>The admission of non-EC citizens to the State, and their subsequent stay here, is governed by the Aliens Act, 1935, and the Aliens Orders, 1946 to 1988.</P>
      <P>Non-EC citizens, apart from citizens of certain states which are listed in the Sixth Schedule to the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended, must have a visa for admission to this State and this visa must be obtained prior to coming here.</P>
      <P>Non-EC citizens coming to the State from a place outside Great Britain or Northern Ireland must present themselves before an immigration officer for leave to land.  The immigration officer may refuse leave to land on a number of grounds which are listed in Article 5 of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended by the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975.</P>
      <P>As regards residence here, an alien must register in the registration district in which he resides.  Aliens residing in the Garda Dublin metropolitan area must register at the Aliens Registration Office, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, and those resident elsewhere must register with the registration officer for that district, that is with the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the district.  When registering, the alien is required to supply information under 12 headings, which are set out in the Second Schedule to the Aliens Order, 1946.</P>
      <P>The general position in relation to aliens who are not citizens of EC countries, is that they will be given leave to land and permission to reside in the State provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that their travel documentation is in order, that they will be able to support themselves and their dependants without recourse to State financial aid, and that they have work permits if coming here to take up employment, or have sufficient finances if coming to engage in business here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a residence permit, I should explain that this is a document which may be issued to EC citizens who satisfy the conditions of the European Communities <Col N="1608" /> (Aliens) Regulations, 1977.  Residence permits are not issued to non-EC citizens.</P>

I believe that a greater percentage of EC and non-EC citizens anxious to live here reside in my constituency.  Will the Minister agree that the outline of information he has put on the record of the House, and its reference to the three sets of regulations, is not as readily available to anybody going to his Department?  Has the Minister considered publishing in a succinct and concise form the regulations people need to comply with in order to obtain a residency permit if they are EC nationals or non-EC nationals?</P>

There was a legal dispute as to what the two regulations taken together might mean.  Will the Minister agree that we need not just the publication of the necessary information but an adjudication on the regulations by his Department, perhaps with the assistance of the Attorney General, as to the exact requirements and conditions sought?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a survey (details supplied) of Dublin city centre business in which one third of firms indicated that they had to spend in excess of £20,000 annually on security; his views on whether this type of expenditure is on the increase; and if he has any plans which will help reduce this cost for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey in question.  Unfortunately, it has come to be generally accepted, and not alone in this country, of course, that expenditure on security is one of the inescapable costs of operating a business. While the Garda play a vital role in the prevention and detection of crime, it is simply unrealistic to expect that they can provide adequate protection for every target which business activity presents to the resourceful criminal.  The business community have to accept a special responsibility for the security of their own businesses and the Garda actively help in this regard by providing expert surveys and advice to business people aimed at enhancing the security of their business and premises.</P>
      <P>It is a truism to say that expenditure on business security will be reduced when the incidence of crime in our society is reduced.  The reduction of crime is, of course, one of the primary aims of the Garda and the evidence is that they are achieving a measure of success in that area.  The recorded level of indictable crime has fallen by over 17 per cent in the period 1983 to 1987.  This is not to deny that crime rates still remain a cause for great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that Garda members liaise closely with business interests, offering crime prevention advice and other appropriate assistance. I understand from the Garda authorities, too, that in 1987 a very high percentage of all recorded crimes of larcenies from shops in Dublin city centre were detected by the Garda and that very substantial <Col N="1611" /> quantities of stolen property were recovered. I also understand that preliminary indications are that the incidence of larcenies from shops in the city centre has decreased by almost a third in the first five months of this year in comparison with the corresponding period in 1987. The Garda attribute this success to the very high level of co-operation and liaison which exists between them and the business community.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities assure me that this co-operation will be maintained and indeed enhanced where possible and that all that can appropriately be done to assist the business community will be done.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that when replying to supplementary questions on 19 April last I said I would be making recommendations to the Government when I had a chance to study the position with regard to this whole area.  The matter is still being considered by my Department.  I said to Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; this can be found in the Official Report in the volume I mentioned &mdash; that there are a number of other ministries involved and the functions are spread over those ministries.  It is my view, as it is the view of Deputy O'Keeffe and was the view of the previous Government, that the matter seriously merits study and analysis with a view to seeing if the whole matter can be put on the right road.</P>

      <P>There was a very full debate on this when the matter was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe on 19 April.  At that <Col N="1614" /> time I outlined my responsibilities in relation to charities.  I will just say briefly &mdash; I hope I am not wasting the time of the House &mdash; in an effort to give the Deputy the information he is looking for, that my responsibility in relation to charities is confined to three areas: the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973, which provide for the jurisdiction and powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in relation to charitable trusts; the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962, which provides for the issue of Garda permits to take up collections in specified areas and the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, sections 27 and 28 of which provide for the issue of Garda permits and court licences respectively to hold lotteries and only lotteries held under court licences under section 28 are required to be for a charitable or philanthropic purpose.  That is my area of responsibility.  There are a number of other Departments who also have responsibility in this area such as the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health and the Department of Finance.  I told Deputy O'Keeffe I am having the matter examined with a view to seeing what would emerge by way of recommendations to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline the circumstances in which the official prisoners' van assigned to Cork prison is used; if there has been any change in policy regarding the use of this vehicle since the ending of the prison officers' strike; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Depending on the circumstances, prison service transport, Garda transport or locally hired taxis are used to bring prisoners to courts, hospitals and other prisons.  It is a matter for the governor of each institution to decide which type of transport should be used on each occasion, having regard to such matters as the level of security <Col N="1615" /> required, the cost, the staff and the type of transport actually available at the time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this policy, which is of long standing, is correct and there has been no change in it in Cork prison or elsewhere.  It is, however, the case that the governor has, for some months now, been trying to keep to a minimum the number of long distance escorts done by the official transport, in order to keep within the available overtime allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his reply.  Would he not agree that it is his concern when policy decisions are taken, either in the prisons or the Garda Síochána, that affect costs?  I can outline to the Minister if he so wishes circumstances under which, since the settlement of the prison officers' strike, policy decision has altered.  The van in Cork prison is no longer being used for long trips but taxis are now being used. Firstly, there is a danger from a security point of view.  The van in Cork prison was specially fitted out for security reasons. There is a division between the cabin and the place where the prisoner is kept. There is a two-way radio in the van which can keep the van in contact with any prison in the country at any time.  A taxi from Cork to Dublin costs in the region of £120 and on top of that waiting time has to be added on.  The driver of the van is employed and paid a salary.  The additional costs, allowing for overtime, diesel and subsistence, would be £66.  The Minister will agree that tax would be paid on a portion of that £66 and the cost to the State in that case is far less.  There has been a change in policy since the prison officers' strike and taxis are being used in lieu of the prison van.  Would the Minister not agree that it should be his concern to see to it that, particularly from a security point of view, the prison van be used?  Would he not agree, from a cost point of view and at a time when we are looking for savings, that the most effective use of the two vans in Cork prison should be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very <Col N="1616" /> clear that the practice we are talking about of using taxis instead of prison vans on occasions is of long standing.  I say that deliberately because I would not like the House or anybody to believe this practice has emerged only since the prison strike.  I have been assured of this because I inquired specifically about this point.  There has not been any change in this practice in Cork or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>The governor decides the circumstances and the type of transport to be used to bring prisoners to court, to hospitals or to other prisons.  Despite what the Deputy said about costings, I had costings prepared for him because I anticipated his question.  I understand that when it is possible and, having due regard to the security element involved and when the governor is satisfied there is no security risk involved &mdash; believe it or not, there is a saving of £100 by using a taxi on a trip to Dublin rather than using a prison van.  If the Deputy wishes, I can at some stage give him details of this saving.  That figure of £100 can be substantiated because I asked for a specific assurance anticipating that the Deputy would ask that supplementary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  As I said, there is a saving of £100 and I can have the actual information made available to the Deputy.  There are two points I want to get across to the Deputy: the governor makes the decision having due regard to the circumstances of the case on the day, and having regard to security and the type of person involved.  These are the prime considerations and costings come after them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is very easy to check if I am right? There are two vans in Cork prison, one is one year old and the other is three years old.  On one van there are 143,000 miles, roughly 50,000 miles a year, and on the second van there are 60,000 after one year, which would suggest the van <Col N="1617" /> was previously used for long runs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought in relation to prosecutions taken by the Garda under the Gaming and Lotteries <Col N="1618" /> Act, 1956, and the details of the different categories of offence committed is not available in the form requested by the Deputy.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of detections of breaches of the Act in the last five years is as follows: 1983, 239; 1984, 816; 1985, 678; 1986, 868 and 1987, 127.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this information and accept that it is not available in the form set out in my question. However, there are a number of supplementaries I want to ask.  Given that in 1983 there were 239 detections and in 1986 868 detections, would the Minister agree that the number of such breaches suggests that there is a need to update the legislation and that the legislation is failing in what it set out to do?  This is the tip of the iceberg.  Has the Minister any information relating to the difference between the figures for 1983 and 1986 and the fall to 127 in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take the latter part of the Deputy's question first.  The Garda have informed me that the decrease in 1987 is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that the majority of detections in 1984, 1985 and 1986 were in the Donegal region and there were fewer breaches of the law in that area in 1987.  Other factors were challenges in the High Court and the Supreme Court of certain aspects of the <Col N="1619" /> legislation and the situation concerning the issue of summonses which obtained in 1986 and 1987.  With regard to the review of the legislation, during the course of the debate in which Deputy McCartan and others were involved, that request was made and is being considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Question No. 8 and Priority Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from an incident in Portlaoise Prison on 18 May 1988, which occurred when a prisoner was being discharged, an investigation is at present being conducted by my Department.  This investigation is concerned with allegations which were made in relation to duty performance at the time of the incident in question and it will of necessity have to go into considerable detail in relation to what occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the information available in the immediate wake of the incident concerned, it was decided that the suspension of an assistant chief officer was warranted, pending further investigation. It was decided last week, in the light of further information obtained in the course of the investigation, that that <Col N="1621" /> suspension should be lifted.  Accordingly the officer in question resumed duty with effect from 18 June.  This resumption is without prejudice to any action that may be required on the basis of the findings of the investigation which is continuing.</P>
    <P>As the investigation is still in progress it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to comment further on events which took place at the prison that morning. The House will appreciate that, in view of my statutory role as Minister for Justice in relation to prison disciplinary matters, I cannot, with propriety, make any comment which might carry with it the danger of prejudging matters upon which I could be called to adjudicate in the context of disciplinary proceedings. There is, of course, the further point that in the interests of security there are severe constraints on what I could properly disclose in relation to security arrangements at the prison.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House, however, that appropriate arrangements exist to ensure proper liaison between all the security services at the prison.  Prison staff receive instructions both by way of formal governor's orders and through &ldquo;on-the-spot&rdquo; instructions from supervisory staff.  I think the House will accept that it would not be in the interests of security to reveal in any detail the instructions under which any of the security services at the prison operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to hear that the Minister has cleared the return to duty of the officer in question. I was not happy he was ever suspended. Can the Minister confirm that there is some form of discussion or review of liaison between the three agents of security at the prison to ensure that there is no misunderstanding as to their respective duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's comments on the lifting of the suspension. Regarding his point about a review of liaison between the security forces, this is a very important matter and I can assure the House that appropriate arrangements exist to ensure that there is <Col N="1622" /> proper liaison between all the security services at the prison.</P>

Can the Minister confirm that there are standing orders or regulations in existence as between the different services operating in Portlaoise Prison, that is, as between the Army and the prison service, and that these regulations have been communicated to the prison staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that appropriate arrangements exist with regard to liaison between the different groups.  I am satisfied that there is liaison between the Governor and the prison management and the officers.  Obviously something went wrong in this case and the matter is being investigated with a view to preventing such an incident happening again.  We must not forget that there is a great responsibility on us because it is a high security prison where we cannot afford mistakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this incident happened on 18 May, about six weeks ago, and that it would be reasonable to expect the investigation to have been completed by now, especially in view of its importance?  A prison officer lost his job for a period of one month and any such investigation should not take more than six weeks. Is it normal to inform a prison officer escorting a prisoner to the gates for release that he is about to be rearrested? Does the onus on the prison officer cease when he gets to the main gate or is he responsible for escorting the prisoner to the footpath?  At Portlaoise there is a <Col N="1623" /> main gate and then another gate beside the public thoroughfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy claims that six weeks should be adequate for the completion of an investigation.  Unfortunately in this case that period is not sufficient, despite the fact that the people dealing with this incident have been asked to conduct with all urgency a full and extensive inquiry, having regard to what is involved.  It is not just that a person was suspended for a number of weeks but the fact that there was a breakdown in communications in our high security prison, a much more important matter.  The urgency of the investigation is recognised by those who are conducting it and they have been keeping in close touch with me.  It is my intention to see to it that it will proceed as quickly as possible.  We must get the full facts.  It is not always easy, but we are making every effort.  I cannot comment on the specific details of what went wrong on that morning but I am sure the matter will be the subject of further debate in this House and I will be as informative as I can.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a statement issued by the Prison Officers' Association it is stated that the prison officer who was suspended was not informed when he was escorting a prisoner out to the gate to be released that the prisoner was about to be rearrested when he reached that point? Would the Minister not agree that in view of the very sensitive nature of this matter it would be only reasonable, no matter what liaison goes on, for a prison officer who is asked to escort a prisoner who is about to be rearrested to be informed of this, especially in a case like this where a crowd had gathered outside?  It is only reasonable that this House should get that information.  There are serious questions here.  There was a crowd gathered <Col N="1625" /> outside from early morning and the prison officer who was asked to escort this prisoner out to the main gate to be released was not informed that this person was going to be rearrested.  That is how this whole thing came about.</P>

      <P>The discharge of Mr. McVeigh, the prisoner in question, did not proceed smoothly.  It is not in dispute that rather than being escorted through the normal outer gate he was allowed sufficient freedom to run into a no-go area at the prison, and any unauthorised person going into that area is automatically assumed to be a threat to the prison and is treated as such.  What happened and what went wrong is the subject matter of investigation, and as soon as the investigation, which we regard as extremely urgent, is concluded we will see what went wrong and we will see where we have to go from there.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person in question was arrested on 23 February 1988 for non-payment of fines imposed at Ballina District Court on 23 September 1984. While in custody at Ballina Garda station the Garda were contacted by my Department and advised that a petition was on hand for some time in respect of the person concerned.  In accordance with normal practice in relation to penalties which are the subject of petition, the Garda deferred further action in executing the warrants and released the person in custody.</P>

      <P>Is it not normal that where there is a petition being considered and the Garda are informed that such is happening they do not take action?  Will <Col N="1627" /> the Minister not agree that in this instance an arrest had taken place and the person was released from the Garda station on paying £80 expenses incurred by the District Court in respect of two summones and a reduced fine of £20? Would the Minister agree that this followed a telephone call to a member of his own party who is an office holder? Would the Minister agree, therefore, that the circumstances under which this took place have given rise to a great deal of concern?  Would it not have been better that the Garda Síochána would have been informed that they should not proceed with any arrest in view of the fact that a petition was in the Minister's office?  Why is it that an arrest took place when the petition was in the Minister's office?  In this instance an arrest took place and the person, therefore, would be delivered to a place of custody.  The circumstances under which the person was released must pose certain questions.  As a result of a telephone call he paid £20, a fine of £20 reduced from £200 and £80 expenses. Would the Minister agree that this is a peculiar way to deal with the petitions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The petition was lodged in January 1985.  It was not processed because additional information was requested and did not turn up.  No reply was received until my office was contacted on behalf of the person concerned on 23 February 1988.  It is contrary to a very long established practice and inappropriate for the Minister for Justice to deal, at Question Time, with individual petitions for the remission or mitigation of penalties.  It is the invariable practice of the Minister not to disclose the reasons for these decisions.  From recollection, I think this is the first time this has happened. In the last year and a half I would have been contacted by members from all parties in the House with petitions which are not being processed as people would like.  There is a further question on the Order Paper, Question No. 16, by Deputy McDowell of the Progressive Democrats, which ranges widely over the processing of petitions which we hope to <Col N="1628" /> deal with.  There is a colossal backlog of petitions.  It is a matter of concern to me, and it certianly must have been a matter of concern to my predecessors, that there is a practice, which none of us would condone, of people whose petitions have been refused repetitioning to put off the evil day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept all that, but would the Minister not agree that where a petition is in the Minister's office the Garda should not go and arrest somebody? This person was arrested and brought to a Garda station and as a result of being arrested I understand his wife made a telephone call to a Member of this House who then contacted the Minister's Department and the matter was settled on the spot.  That is a peculiar way to deal with petitions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 19, 22, 23 and Priority Question No. 31 together.</P>
      <P>All deaths which take place in custody are the subject of a public inquiry in the form of an inquest and I do not consider that any form of public inquiry beyond that would be warranted.  As an inquest on the most recent death at Mountjoy is pending, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any way on the circumstances in which this death occurred.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1985 nine offenders have died in prison custody and no useful statistical or other pattern is discernible in the deaths which have occurred.  Obviously all of these deaths are a matter of the deepest concern and regret.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the level of supervision of prisoners or the standard of psychiatric services available in the prisons were factors in the deaths which occurred.  Every effort is made by the prison authorities to indentify offenders who may be at risk and where such offenders are identified they are given special attention by prison staff so as to minimise the risk of self-injury. Such attention can entail, for example, checking on the safety of an offender every 15 or 20 minutes throughout the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vigilance on the part of prison staff and those who work in the support services at the institutions clearly has a key part to play in this matter.  However, it has to be <Col N="1633" /> accepted that there is no foolproof way by which all potential suicide victims can be identified.</P>
    <P>Reports of all deaths in prison are examined by governors and in my Department to see whether the circumstances indicate any pattern or suggest any procedure or course of action that might have proved helpful in the particular case or that might usefully be introduced in a effort to forestall similar tragedies.</P>
    <P>It has to be accepted, however, that where an offender is determined to take his or her life, and not infrequently there is no prior warning of any such intent, there are limits to what the prison authorities can reasonably do.  Our experience in this matter is similar to that of other prison administrations.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the procedures for identifying and providing for offenders at risk are kept under continuous review and all measures which can reasonably be taken to help in any particular case are taken immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I now want to reply to the question.  Even though we had two competitions organised by the Civil Service Commission for a full-time doctor with the title of medical director, both competitions failed to produce a suitable candidate and as a result it was decided to give a role to the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service in overseeing the <Col N="1637" /> medical services of the prison.  This was possible because the Chief Medical Officer's workload had been reduced as a result of the hiving-off of the Post Office from the Civil Service.  The Chief Medical Officer has been discharging his role in relation to the prisons and there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the deaths which have taken place could have been avoided if a full time medical director was employed.</P>
      <P>Research into the deaths which have taken place is carried out, as I outlined in my reply, by the Department who consider a report on each death in an attempt to indentify any action which might have been taken which might have lessened the risk of a particular case.  Regard is also had to previous cases so as to identify patterns of behaviour in which the deaths occur and measures which can be reasonably taken are taken immediately.  It is hard to see what further research, beyond that which is already being carried out at present in the Department, could be expected to achieve.</P>
      <P>Inquests have yet to take place into the three most recent deaths in Mountjoy.  I have to wait until such time as these inquests are completed before it will be appropriate for me to make any comment on the circumstances in which the deaths occurred.  Regrettably, deaths in prisons are a feature with which prison administrations internationally have to contend. The level of deaths which occur in our prisons is not out of line with international trends, such as in Britain and the Netherlands, and the latter is regarded as having a very progressive penal system.  Some of the deaths which have occurred have been drug-related and successive Ministers have pointed out that while every reasonable effort is made to prevent illicit drugs getting into prisons the difficulty lies, as my predecessors can assure this House if they want to, in striking the right balance between measures to control drug trafficking and the need to preserve a human regime in the prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on the operation of the procedures under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, including the number of applications received from the United Kingdom for extradition warrants; the number accepted; the number rejected; the numbers of persons extradited; and the procudures established under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General has made arrangements with the British Arrorney General under which the latter furnishes him, in each case, with the information which he deems appropriate for the purpose of forming the opinion required of him by the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  I understand that this procedure is working satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statistics sought in the Deputy's question, the position is that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, made no change in regard to the manner in which warrants are submitted to the Garda Commissioner by the British and Northern Ireland authorities. Warrants continued to be furnished in accordance with the provisions of section 43 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The figures I am about to give include all warrants received from Britain and Northern Ireland in the period since 14 December 1987 &mdash; the date on which the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, came into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Warrants in respect of ten persons have been received by the Garda Commissioner. The position in regard to these ten applications is as follows: In six cases, involving a total of 21 warrants, warrants have been endorsed by the Commissioner for execution.  Those warrants were executed in one case and the application <Col N="1639" /> for extradition was refused in the District Court.  That decision is now under appeal.  In three cases, involving three warrants, the requesting authorities have withdrawn the warrants.  In the remaining case, involving one warrant, the application is under consideration.  No warrants have been rejected and no persons have been extradited in respect of the warrants received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is a fair implication, from what he said, that the operation of the extradition procedures is not working satisfactorily, that no person has been extradited, notwithstanding the requests received since 14 December 1987 and that something needs to be done about that?  Would the Minister not agree also that the level of identification evidence required by the courts has to be clarified by this House and that there is an urgent need to do that?  May I ask the Minister if the Government have any intention of giving guidelines to the court, which ever court it might be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was stitching into the record the response I got to a parliamentary question in relation to fish farming, especially the fish farming which is carried on in bays and estuaries.  I have been worried that this operation could be unhygienic and could cause damage to the environment.  I was alarmed to be informed by the Minister, in reply to my question about Mulroy Bay, that an anti-fouling paint containing the chemical TBT has been extensively used on fish farm cages.  There is ample evidence to show that this substance can cause deformities in shell-fish.  This was confirmed to me this morning by one of my researchers who rang the Department of the Marine.  This immediately raises a very serious question mark about its effects on the fish in the cages.  The Minister in his reply to this debate must assure us that the use of this substance is now totally prohibited and spell out for us the methods which will ensure that this paint will no longer be used and that the cages on which it was applied have been taken out of the water until they can be repainted. There are serious issues of public health involved.  The public do not have much confidence that the fish produced on farms are as healthy as natural fish.  It could have disastrous consequences for consumption.  Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate to the consumer <Col N="1663" /> whether the fish that is sold is wild or farmed.  There is a grave danger that any question mark about the quality of farm fish will also affect sales of wild fish and this could cause serious damage to this industry.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the dangers from TBT to fish coming in contact with it are a greater risk than we face from the pollution from Sellafield.  It is a problem of the most serious magnitude and the Minister must assure the public and industry that he has taken effective steps to remove this problem quickly and totally.  I am also informed that large quantities of deleterious matter accumulates beneath, and to some extent within, fish cages, especially in locations that have not a swift current.  Eventually that matter will find its way to the beaches and shores.  Yet we have had no public health investigations as to the size of this problem, or what effect it is having on the local ecology.  In addition, the question is also raised as to the health and purity of the fish in the cages, living in this polluted atmosphere.  It is important for this industry that the Minister would take immediate steps to impose the highest standards so that the public can be assured of the good quality of the fish produced.</P>
      <P>As the hare whom hounds and horns pursue pants to the place from whence first it flew, I come back to Dingle Harbour. Would the Minister tell me what is happening within his Department as far as that harbour is concerned?  The response to a number of Dáil questions was that the matter was receiving consideration. Yet, Deputy O'Donoghue of his party in January gave an exclusive report to all the Kerry papers that £3 million was about to be spent on Dingle Harbour and work was to commence on 1 May.  Yet in his Estimate here today the Minister says that he has something less than £1 million to spend on all our harbours.  I would appreciate if the Minister would stop dangling the carrot in front of the fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>After the last contribution, I plan to be a little parochial.  I am sure that I shall be forgiven for that.  The arrival on the scene of the Department of the Marine was in itself a remarkable piece of progress.  I recorded that in this House at the time and suggested that the establishment of the Department was progressive because it pulled together <Col N="1665" /> diverse strands in the whole range of nooks and crannies in the public administration body who were obstensibly dealing with the area of the marine, maritime policy and marine-related developments. The reality was that under the old system with maritime and marine matters scattered over a whole range of public service bodies, in trying to achieve progress in any area, the first difficulty that had to be faced was that of establishing who was responsible for what.  There seemed to be a never ending group of public bodies that had to be addressed and dealt with before any sort of progress could be achieved in any marine related area.  Happily, that has come to an end with the arrival of the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>Ireland is, after all, an island nation yet our response to that fact has been quite remarkable over the generations. We have failed to see our island nation status as being anything but a problem. The reality is that that status which we enjoy is a quite remarkable advantage to be exploited, certainly to a greater degree than ever before.</P>
      <P>It is a tragedy that in recent times such an extraordinary degree of public attention has been diverted to the rod licence issue.  That issue has grabbed a ludicrous proportion of public attention and time. Opportunistic antics by the Progressive Democrats in this House last night were just one example of what I mean by grabbing the headlines for this relatively small issue.  I commend Deputy McGinley for adopting what appears to be a much more rational approach and the suggestion made by that party's spokesperson that the opportunism of the Progressive Democrats was nothing other than a simple vote catching exercise before the Dáil rises for the summer recess.  That appears to be a reasonable assessment of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only was the issue handled opportunistically by certain politicians but also by certain sections of the media and I single out RTE and the programme &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; in this regard.  Day after day, the nation was regaled with the minutiae of the so-called rod licence <Col N="1666" /> issue.  At one time it appeared that anybody, however remotely connected with the issue, was put on that programme to give his or her views.  I wonder if the same amount of air time would have been given to, perhaps, a group who were interested in arguing against the ludicrously high cost of television licences.  If people stood up anywhere in this country and said that television licences are an imposition and that we are now having broadcasting beamed in from a variety of sources so that the arguments in favour of television licensing no longer hold, and that we should start cutting it out, would that argument get the same type of cover day after day if put to RTE?  I somehow doubt it.</P>
    <P>Rather than focusing on issues such as the rod licence one, we should be focusing on how the Department of the Marine can be used as a way to plough through the log-jam that for generations has impeded any real development in marine matters.  We should be focusing on matters like how we develop our fish catching capacity and our capacity to process fish, to add value to it.  I know that Deputy Begley dealt with some aspects of that. It is a scandal that a nation with huge marine resources should not be exploiting them.  The real resource is not mythical hydrocarbon deposits under the sea but the sea itself and the fish that teem in it and the fact that we still represent one of the few areas of coastal Europe where one can actually get good, clean, quality fish.  It is a scandal that we are not addressing the issue of how to add value to that resource, how to capitalise on it, how to create jobs.  I know that Deputy McGinley shares an interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>The area of aquaculture and mariculture offers us major opportunities for employment.  This is the last unexplored frontier with regard to the creation of employment here.  We can talk about high-tech jobs imported from time to time at huge cost in terms of industrial grants, but these jobs tend to be ephemeral. They can melt and change with the vagaries of the international market. What will not change is the demand for <Col N="1667" /> wholesome food and, in particular, for food from the sea.  Our capacity to develop and exploit that area of aquaculture and mariculture has not been exploited and should be a matter for our attention.  If radio programmes, or the media, or politicians, wish to do something constructive, surely they could focus some of their time, energy and talent on the debate in this area.</P>
    <P>The development of Ireland's fishing fleet is another area which screams out for public attention, for public debate. We suffered a major setback &mdash; and I do not want to make a controversial political point &mdash; with the sinking of Irish Shipping. That is history.  There still remains the scandal of how the families of the workers involved are still suffering.  This is a difficult problem.  I know that many Members on all sides of the House would wish to see that problem resolved.  In the aftermath of the Irish Shipping debacle we are in the extraordinary position that, as an island nation, we must depend to a ludicrous degree on foreign-owned, foreign-flagged and foreign-manned ships to carry our exports and imports.  This is an area of tremendous opportunity which has been largely and scandalously ignored.</P>
    <P>Another area on which, I suggest, people who are seriously interested should focus attention is harbour development. There can be no doubt that many harbours require attention and there should be a coherent policy in this regard.  One of the aims of the marine policy document being implemented by the Department is to pull the various and diverse strands in our marine policy together.  That demands public attention and debate.  If the media are seriously interested in the capacity of the nation to develop this resource, why not focus some attention and discussion on this aspect?</P>
    <P>I mentioned shipping earlier and I want to deal with specific developments introduced by Minister Daly in the last year which have not received anything like the degree of congratulations or attention <Col N="1668" /> they deserve.  Some years back, as a civil servant, I operated in the Department of Transport and Power, as it was then, under the terms of the old Shipping (Investment Grants) Act.  It was good legislation which put some additional tonnage onto the Irish register and it meant that some additional imports and exports were carried on Irish ships.  It also meant additional employment for Irish shipping workers and a tremendous amount of foreign exchange earnings for this country. It meant an increase in valuable visible exports because we were involved in trans-dealing in the Far East and other places.  That all ended prematurely, including the operation of the old Shipping (Investment Grants) Act.  However, this year the Minister has put in place a package of incentives in the shipping investment area that are quite unparalleled and which make Ireland one of the most attractive places in Europe &mdash; indeed, in the world &mdash; for investing cash and capital in shipping.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the Shipping (Investment Grants) Act.  I hope to see more resources put into that area and I am sure most Deputies share that particular concern.  The Shipping (Investment Grants) Act has been used to great effect to date and I will deal with that shortly.  The second major step forward which the Minister has taken has been the extension of the business expansion scheme for shipping investment and the related decision to extend the 10 per cent corporation profits tax on shipping investment profits.  This package has proved to be the most imaginative ever put forward in the history of the State by any Minister with responsibility for shipping.  It is an indication of the lack of generosity that stalks this land from time to time that the Minister has not received anything like his due, fair and reasonable degree of public attention and congratulations in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months it is not an exaggeration to say that we made more progress in shipping investment, than in the previous decade.  That progress is due to Minister Daly, who earned the gratitude of the public and the congratulations of <Col N="1669" /> the House for his efforts.  In Wicklow, Arklow Shipping have availed of the opportunity afforded by the Shipping (Investment Grants) Act and four brand new ships have been built or commissioned within the last year and put on the Irish register.  The Arklow fleet has now expanded, and within the foreseeable future there will be 25 or 26 ships on the register.  Employment will be provided for over 300 people and there will be great progress.  If you go back two years, the prospects were gloomy.  There did not seem to be anything to induce this bright, innovative and progressive young company to move in this direction, because all the pressures at that time suggested that the company should look elsewhere to register their shipping. However, because the Minister introduced this package of proposals and because he was prepared to be adventurous, to cut through red tape and to operate these proposals, a remarkable fleet is now operating out of Arklow.  I want to thank the Minister for meeting Councillor John Sweeney, the chairman of the Harbour Board and myself and agreeing, after 50 years of imploring various Ministers, to make Arklow a port of registration.  It was tremendous to see recently the <i>Arklow Manor</i> and the <i>Arklow Marsh</i>, two brand new vessels, coming in with &ldquo;Arklow&rdquo; on the bow and stern.  I congratulate the Minister for making this possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to marine related leisure activities.  I have expressed, outside the House my incredulity at the activities of certain people in the Dún Laoghaire case.  Some of them were good and well meaning, but I hope that their extraordinary attitude in regard to marine development will be changed. The developers, at my invitation, have looked at Greystones and they liked what they saw.  I hope, that when the issue in Dún Laoghaire is resolved there will be a marina development in Greystones.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister, in the most gentle manner, of the imaginative proposals before him from Arklow. He has also had proposals from Wicklow <Col N="1670" /> in regard to port development, and I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their decision to allow harbour development authorities to seek assistance from the European Regional Development Fund.  That is progress and there are many other areas where progress should and could be recorded.</P>
    <P>As an island nation, our maritime resources are far more extensive than our landmass.  Our attitude towards the sea has been wrong because it has been based on mythology and has been negative.  For generations we have failed miserably to grasp the opportunities offered by the sea and by our island status.  Under this Minister I am sure we are beginning to grasp those opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party take the opportunity to comment on the Minister's proposal of the adoption of the Estimate for his Department in the coming year.  As has been pointed out and signalled by many of the contributions to date, the Government suggested that the establishment of the Department of the Marine would represent and herald a major departure and development in our maritime economy.  One would have hoped that was so but, clearly, the indications to date are to the contrary.</P>
      <P>In the area of the development of a fish processing industry or the industrialisation of the seas, there has been little progress of an effective nature, although The Workers' Party have called for this.  The previous speaker wondered where the problem lies in regard to the non-development of our seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked about mythology, but we would need to plumb the depths of the Irish psyche to understand their attitude. The simple answer lies in abject Government failure over the years to develop economically and invest in our maritime industries.  There is no need to look to mythology, to look to history, or to misconceptions, fears or misunderstandings about the sea.  The answer lies in the attitude of successive Governments. There is a history of abject neglect and failure to invest in our maritime economy. Governments failed abysmally to <Col N="1671" /> ensure the development of a fish processing industry.  If fish which leaves this country in a frozen or chilled state were properly processed it would earn us, on average, an additional £100 million per year and would create many jobs.  It is shameful that this country, surrounded by some of the best fishing grounds in the world, made so little use of a great resource.</P>
    <P>Our record is deplorable compared with other island countries such as Iceland where almost one-fifth of the population is employed in fishing or in fish processing.  In this country, due to persistent neglect, fishing has made only a negligible contribution to industrial development and job creation.  In 1984 we exported 90,000 tonnes of chilled or frozen fish worth approximately £39 million. If that amount had been further processed there would have been added value of some £2,000 per tonne, increasing the potential revenue to the State by £100 million and involving massive savings on some of the £40 million of processed fish products which we import.</P>
    <P>Technology is available for the establishment of a fish processing industry. Exporting fish simply chilled or frozen makes as little economic sense as exporting cattle on the hoof.  We have in Greencastle one of the best and most advanced training schools in Europe for fishermen. While the State, through Greencastle, is providing highly qualified fishermen, it is not providing them with the opportunities to apply their qualifications.  One of the ironies of some development in the area is the fact that putting more boats on the sea through investment in BIM schemes without raising the quotas for fishermen is leading to a loss of employment on many boats.  The more boats we put out without getting the quota levels changed the more there will be a reduction in the take per trawler with a consequent reduction in the manning levels of trawlers.  One of the Minister's main responsibilities, if we are to increase our fleet, is to ensure that our entitlement to increase quotas is established firmly within the EC.  It is a matter of public <Col N="1672" /> knowledge and history now that we went to Europe at the quota negotiation stage with figures that were pulled out of the sky, without any serious reference to the potential of the Irish Sea, at a time when our fishing industry was in a stage of retarded infant development.  It is a basis of negotiation that has been used time and again in arguments against us and something must be done to correct the ground rules that we laid in the initial quota arguments so that we will be given a fair proportion.  We should put forward the argument that our fishing industry represents perhaps one of, if not the greatest single industry that this country is capable of producing and this must be brought home to our EC partners and concessions must be won to renegotiate the bedrock rules upon which quotas are fixed.</P>
    <P>In relation to harbour development, time and again I have raised with the Minister the whole question of Howth Harbour.  I raise this not just because it is in the Dublin North-East constituency but because Howth Harbour is in the midst of the single greatest concentration of population and it is a vital and important feature of our developing fish industry. The Minister has constantly responded, and it is conceded that large sums of money have been invested in that harbour.  However, Howth Harbour has been brought literally 75 per cent of the way.  The facilities there are second to none around the country, but when one compares its proximity to the single greatest concentration of population in the country and its easy access to some of the best international sea and air connections, its importance is way ahead of any other fishery development facility on this island.  The Minister must go the other 25 per cent of the way by investing further money here.  The money invested will redouble many times in benefit to the industry as a whole and in job creation in a very black spot of unemployment in the north side of this city.</P>
    <P>There are no industrial jobs arising from the many millions of pounds that have been put into the development of Howth Harbour.  A very fine fishing fleet <Col N="1673" /> is coming in there and landing their catch on the pier to be collected, salted or frozen and brought into the fish market over 12 miles away to be sold, or taken rapidly down the east coast on to the ferries and on to Europe, England or wherever.  That is an unsatisfactory arrangement.  If the State is not prepared to commit itself to investment in this area it must actively, through the IDA or some other agency, find a processor or the means whereby with very little capital expenditure very good industries can be based directly or close to the pier, to make Howth a working harbour.  Howth Harbour at the moment is a leisure harbour but the jobs on shore that such a scale of investment warrants have not been created.  There are many other issues about Howth Harbour which I have raised with the Minister and I have no doubt that we will pursue those issues when we and the Howth Fisheries Association meet with the Minister as promised in the near future.</P>
    <P>A second feature of our island status is the need for us to maintain and have under State control a national shipping fleet.  The failure of Irish Shipping has been a serious blow to the strategic development of our economy.  It is essential that this country should have a national shipping fleet.  Without it we are vulnerable.  This country already depends to a large extent on foreign fishing for exports and imports.  It is only a few years since the Falklands crisis, when the Thatcher Government requisitioned a large portion of the British merchant fleet, including both car and cargo ferries, for military purposes in the Falklands.  At that time we suffered heavily as a result of that demand and it showed our vulnerability as a nation without recourse to a national shipping fleet.  We must bear this is mind.  The Minister has indicated time and again in this House that he and his Government are conscious of this fact and have made the point that in times of industrial dispute amongst foreign carriers, it is difficult for Irish producers and exporters to survive without a proper shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>In referring to the collapse of Irish <Col N="1674" /> Shipping one cannot but mention the very sad position of the former employees who only two days ago returned to the gates of Leinster House to remind us that their problems in relation to compensation and in relation to a fair deal with regard to the years of service they gave the State in that company have not yet been resolved. The matter last arose in this House on 3 May when the Minister indicated that he was in the concluding stages of addressing the very complex legal issues which he suggested surrounded the whole question of compensating the employees of Irish Shipping for their long years of service. These issues have to be resolved and I would ask the Minister, when responding, to indicate when these issues will be brought to a conclusion.  This issue has been pursued relentlessly inside and outside the House.  We have been told that the investigation is ongoing and we pursued it to the stage when in May of this year we were told we were reaching a conclusion.  It is time the Minister told us what those conclusions are and when the staff of Irish Shipping will eventually be compensated.</P>
    <P>An issue which was raised recently, because of the tragic death off the Donegal coast of two salmon fishermen &mdash; to whose families we extend very deep regret &mdash; was that of safety aboard our fishing vessels.  I understand from a recent announcement that the regulations to be introduced will not include trawlers working around our coasts or registered at our ports.  This is a matter of major concern.  It also concerns vessels under 40 metres.  The Minister has indicated that regulations will be introduced.  Steps must be taken to ensure that safety aboard the smaller craft is included in the regulations and that crews who go out, even in the fairest of weather, tackling nets, cargo and catch, all of considerable weight, are probably equipped for all eventualities and not just eventualities that arise from a major storm.  The need to carry safety equipment must be brought home through a firm Government hand by regulation and insistence on implementation of the law.</P>

      <P>I want to make a point to the previous speaker who suggested that the fisheries rod licence issue should be left aside.  He wondered whether the media would give the same attention to the issue if it was in the context of television licences.  Television licences were introduced by common agreement after negotiation and after long debate in this House on the legislation.  It is not an equal comparison to make.  The rod licences were very hastily introduced, very poorly thought out and although the intent is good, the whole question of State involvement and development of our fisheries is essential.  It is clear that the measure has not received widespread support and it imposes an obligation on the Minister &mdash; as he has done in the Dún Laoghaire context &mdash; to go back, negotiate, discuss and review the matter. It is a difficult task for the Minister but it is clear that the legislation will not work. A <i>via media</i> must be sought and I have no doubt it will be forthcoming in meaningful negotiations.  I hope it will be resolved without delay.</P>

Sílim go bhfuil níos mó teacht isteach ó iascaireacht sa chontae sin ná ó aon tionscal eile.</P>
      <P>Tá féidireachtaí móra ag tionscal na hiascaireachta nár éirigh linn iad a bhaint amach go fóill.  Ceann des na féidireachtaí ba chóir dúinn a chur i gcrích ná forbairt níos nó a dhéanamh ar an tionscal seo.  Tá an fhairrge timpeall orainn uilig agus iasc go flúirseach inti, agus d'féadfaimís níos mó a dhéanamh.  Ach faoi láthair tá constaicí orainn agus ceann dóibh sin ná na quotas atá buailte anuas orainn ag an Eorap sa Common Fisheries Policy.  Bhí mé brónach gur gheall an tAire nuair a bhí sé sa bhFreasúra agus an páirtí len a mbaineann sé go ndéanfadh siad rud éigin faoi seo chomh luath agus a rachadh siad isteach i gcumhacht. Tá siad i gcumhacht le bliain anois.  Tá Roinn úr againn, Roinn na Mara, agus níl aon dul chun cinn déanta san taobh sin den scéal.  Tá rudaí go díreach mar a bhí anuraidh agus athrú anuraidh, tionscal an&mdash;tábhachtach, iasc an-tábhachtach, don chontae is againn, agus táimid i mbliana ag 80 tonna mar a bhí anuraidh agus an bhliain roimhe sin, in ainneoin an méid a gealladh agus an méid a dúradh sna polasaithe a cuireadh amach roimh an toghchán.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt me, tá féidireachtaí móra ag tionscal na hiascaireachta ach iad a fhorbairt i gceart, mar shampla, san rannóg fostaíochta, Is féidir a lán fostaíochta a chur ar fáil atá bunaithe ar achmhainn nádúrtha, postanna go mbeidh bunús leo agus go mbeidh buaine ag baint leo ach cur chuige.  Nuair a chuimhnímid ar an imirce uafásach atá as iarthar na tíre agus gach páirt den tír, tá géarghá le fostaíocht den chineál sin agus is féidir é a dhéanamh i dtionscal na hiascaireachta go speisialta chomh fada agus a bhaineann le próiseáil.  Is uasfásach an rud é go bhfaighimid greim ar an iasc seo, go gcaitear amach as an tír é agus é go díreach reoite, agus b'fhéidir go dtagann sé ar ais don tir roinnt ama in a dhiaidh sin agus próiseáil déanta agus na postanna curtha ar fáil i dtír eile.  Ba chóir dúinn amharc air sin agus iarracht a dheánamh níos mó próiseáil a dhéanamh sa tír ná mar atá déanta go dtí seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Is é an rud mór eile a dhéanann tionscal na hiascaireachta ná an t-airgead a chuireann sé ar fáil don Státhciste agus do eacnamaíocht na tíre trí onmhairiú agus tá géarghá le hionmhairithe.  Tá ag éirí go maith linn agus aon rud a chuireann leis na hionmhairithe, is maith é.  An t-airgead a fhaighimid ó thionscal na hiascaireachta is airgead iomlán é, ní hionann é agus airgead ó chuid des na tionscail eile a gcaithfidh tú an t-amh-ábhar a thabhairt isteach agus cur leis agus é a chur amach arís.  Mar sin, ba chóir dúinn an tionscal seo a fhorbairt.</P>
    <P>One of the other handicaps to which we are subject at present besides quotas, which I have mentioned, is the constraint imposed by the regulation concerning gross registered tonnage.  I understand that directives have been issued from Europe recently requesting us to reduce our gross registered tonnage by 16 per cent.  If that were to happen it would handicap and constrain further development of the Irish fishing industry.  At present the effects of this are to be seen, because it is very difficult for fishermen to extend the fleet since no grants are available.  My understanding is that we have exceeded the gross registered tonnage which has been assigned to us by Europe and we are thereby constrained and handicapped.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to take this matter up at European level, because if we do not resolve this issue it will do irreparable damage to our fishing industry and will constrain further development.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, Deputy McCartan, referred to the tragedy which occurred off the Donegal coast yesterday. Coming from that country, I would also like to avail of this opportunity to extend my sincere sympathy to the two bereaved families.  In Donegal we have had a litany of such tragedies, and near tragedies, in the last few years.  I have mentioned in the House before that there is a great and urgent need to upgrade the rescue services in the west and north-west. I am not saying that the rescue services were inadequate yesterday.  I <Col N="1678" /> understand they reached the scene promptly and that the search is continuing. When we mention rescue services for the west we think of the five helicopters that have been purchased.  I understand that crews have been trained and that the helicopters will be in operation within the next few months.  However, they will be of very little benefit to the west and north-west, where most tragedies occur, if they are based at Baldonnel.  It is said that 90 per cent of the distress calls that go through Shannon come from the west and north-west.  The Government should examine this issue because there is consensus from north Donegal, along the western seaboard and on to the south and south-west that something must be done and that the helicopters should be based in the west.</P>
    <P>I am not specifying where the helicopters should be based.  They could be based in Galway or in Finner in Donegal where there is an Army camp.  The important point is that the helicopters will not be of much benefit to the west or the north-west if they are based at Baldonnel.  We must take into consideration that it takes about two hours and 30 minutes for a helicopter based at Baldonnel to be operational along the west coast.  Time is crucial in rescue operations and that is another reason why those helicopters should be based in the west or north-west.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the de-manning policies being implemented in regard to our lighthouses.  Lighthouse keepers have played an important role in search and rescue operations down the years and it is sad that a policy of de-manning is being implemented.  The UK and other countries have adopted such a policy, but they have a coastguard service or a coast watch system.  I hope the Minister will indicate that there has been a change of heart in regard to this policy.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is causing concern is the proposal by the British authorities to annex Rockall and build a nuclear dump on it.  We should not allow them to do that because such a move would prove a great blow to our fishing industry.  It is generally accepted that the waters along <Col N="1679" /> our coast are not polluted, but if the British are allowed to proceed with their plans it will amount to a kiss of death for our fishing industry.  I understand that although the Department were informed about the plans last September or October they have only come to light in the last two or three weeks.  The Government should take up this matter with the UK authorities.  We should not tolerate the dumping of nuclear or any waste in the North Atlantic.  I understand that the future of Rockall is being discussed at international level.  Our claim to it is as valid as that of the UK or any other country.  It may be that the only solution to this problem would be for us to declare that Rockall is part of our territory; but irrespective of what happens, we should not allow the dumping of nuclear waste there.  After the Second World War explosives and containers of poisonous gas were dumped 70 or 80 miles off the north-west coast.  They caused great concern last year and still present a problem. The dumping of nuclear waste in that area would be a fatal blow to our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Another Member referred to difficulties in regard to conservation in Donegal.  I understand from the Northern Fisheries Board that they had only £1,000 to carry out conservation work for the rest of the season.  In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the Donegal salmon and in-shore fishermen who made a donation to that board of £5,000.  I was present at the annual general meeting of the fishermen and I heard a representative of the fisheries board pointing out how handicapped they were in their efforts to carry out conservation work. We should extend our gratitude to the fishermen for their contribution because if salmon cannot get into our lakes and rivers to spawn that industry will not survive.</P>
    <P>The question of rod licences is a national issue.  The dispute between the fishermen and the Department is doing a lot of harm in my constituency.  Already a number of angling festivals have been cancelled.  I understand that between 20 <Col N="1680" /> and 30 such festivals are held in Donegal each year and that because of the dispute it is not expected that any of them will take place.  That will prove a big blow to guesthouse owners and others who depend on tourists.  The Minister should consider suspending the implementation of the Act until the end of the year or early in 1989.  That would give the Minister, the Department and the angling federations an opportunity to discuss the problem and bring forward an agreed solution.</P>
    <P>San noiméad atá fágtha agam, is mór an trua é nach bhfuil mórán airgid curtha ar fáil le forbairt a dhéanamh ar chalafoirt agus mar sin de.  Tá calafort amháin i mo cheantar féin, Alt an Chorráin nó Burtonport.  Tá job le déanamh ansin, tá píosa le cur leis agus tá sé le déanamh domhain agus ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire amharc go speisialta ar an chás sin mar tá sé ag cur constaic le forbairt ansin go dtí go raibh sé déanta.  Mar fhocal deiridh, as a last word I should like to ask the Minister to tell me the up-to-date position regarding the appointment of a harbour master at Burtonport.  I understand the interviews have been held.  I would like the Minister to say when it is intended to make the appointment so that activities in that area can be regulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some members suggested that we should not be parochial in this debate, but we have heard about places like Howth Harbour and so on. As a representative of an area that boasts the second best natural harbour in the world, it would be remiss of me if I was not parochial.  I should like to ask the Minister to pencil in Cork for consideration as the headquarters of the Marine Institute.  The Minister has spent a lot of time in recent weeks in the Cork area in regard to marine related matters and has visited the harbour.  I do not have to spell out for him the importance of the harbour to the Cork area and I am glad that we have a Department that is capable and willing to deal with the harbour as a unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome in particular <Col N="1681" /> the Minister's expressed view during the year that there should be a single harbour development body for the Cork area, as is the case in the Shannon area.  It is probably the Ministry with the greatest potential for growth if it is handled properly. There will be clashes in certain areas if we have not got a co-ordinated body, be it national or local.  In the case of Cork, there could be a clash between the mariculture industry and water-related sports activities.  This can be avoided by doing what the Minister intends to do, setting up a single co-ordinated body for the whole port area, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a public education programme on what the Minister is doing.  Unfortunately, in the recent past all the input from political speakers has been negative.  Many people in the last few months, who last December had no interest in fisheries or fishermen, have suddenly become experts and are very worried about the position.  They had an opportunity last December to put in their oar &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; but they did not avail of that opportunity.  They have wasted the Minister's time in the last few months.  I appeal to them to allow the Minister to get on with the very important job before him.  He has shown that he is willing to deal with the various issues such as mariculture, aquaculture, inland fisheries, marine safety and others.  He has shown that he has not just a knowledge of the area but a total commitment and interest in improving the position.</P>
    <P>This is one of the areas, as well as forestry and horticulture, which has been identified by the Government as having a natural advantage.  We should be concentrating the public mind on what we are attempting to achieve.  There are many areas that the public will not be aware of and may not have an interest in, for instance, shipping.  The Minister has now made it much easier for people to get funding.  He has given them every possible co-operation in getting involved in the business of shipping.  There are other areas where the public can get involved, such as inland fisheries, the whole pollution area and the preservation and maintenance of fish life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> I mention the need for an education programme because there has been too much scaremongering.  During the year the Minister, on a number of occasions, gave categorical assurances that there would be no fish farming on lakes where there is a natural grouping of wild trout and salmon and yet people went out of this House, having listened to the Minister, and preached that our natural fisheries would be destroyed by the inland fishermen.  This is the kind of thing we cannot afford.  We must be positive.  We have a new Ministry and a Minister who is totally committed.  I want to see him getting every help possible, particularly in regard to the area I represent and the potential there.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan was concerned about industrial jobs in the Howth area. There are plenty of opportunities for jobs under the fisheries heading and related matters such as tourism, but particularly in marine-related matters.  There is greater potential in that area for job improvement than in almost any other areas.  The Minister needs our help and not our hindrance, nor constant slagging in the papers and using up his time and energy on purely negative matters.</P>
    <P>I am glad that some steps are being taken in the area of aquaculture.  Previously, five or six Ministries were involved in these matters.  We needed a licensing system and that has now been introduced.  We needed to take steps in various other areas also.  Deputy McGinley mentioned the whole international shipping area.  The greatest scandal that we have had to deal with is this flag of convenience.  We needed a Ministry with the time and the energy to put forward a solid and consistent case for getting rid of this problem.  Being an island we need to protect our coasts and we were being stymied in this area.</P>
    <P>The European Community's regulations are changing rapidly.  We need to have our case made under the various headings, not least under the heading of the Department of the Marine.  The change from project sponsored funding to the integrated development programme funding will give us a marvellous <Col N="1683" /> opportunity in this area.  I welcome the principle of establishing the single harbour authority, the single development board, because they will obviously be part of a regional programme in any area, whatever the size of the region.  In order to take full advantage of the improved situation, particularly with regard to the regional funds, we need to have an integrated approach.</P>
    <P>The question of the de-manning of the coastal stations was mentioned.  Coupled with that there has been very good development under the heading of safety and this should not be ignored.  The setting up of a monitoring system around the country is going ahead.  It had been stopped previously and that was a mistake. There was a need to modernise and update the radio stations and the whole safety system.  This had been ignored and was stopped in 1979 or 1980.  People will argue about the need for manning in specific areas and I am sure the Minister will deal with that.  Steps are being taken and money is being spent in this area.  This was badly needed.  We need an education programme on the whole question of development under the various headings. We need to explain to people what we mean by aquaculture and mariculture and the different terminology that is used. There is a need to educate the public in this area and I would like to see the Minister's time being spent on that rather than on negative arguments about rod licences.</P>
    <P>The Shipping Investment Grants Act has been brought into law.  I mentioned the commercial opportunities earlier. This is a major aspect of investment in Cork.  We depend very much on the port and on port-related matters.  It was important that the Cork area be given this opportunity.  There are people now investing in shipping who could not have become involved in that area previously. We need to keep the matter under review so that we do not get caught with the transferring of flags and so on, and the Minister is quite capable of doing that.</P>
    <P>The question of inland fisheries and fresh water fisheries has caught the public <Col N="1684" /> attention.  Being a fisherman, I sympathise with the Minister's problems.  I want to tell him that there is tremendous goodwill among the fishing people &mdash; it is dangerous to say fishermen.  I want the Minister to spell out clearly to the public and the people involved where the money has been spent in the last ten years, what money has been invested, and where the money accruing from licences will go. Anglers fear that after four or five years contributing to a licence they may come back to the Minister and say they wish to fish in all the rivers of their county and the surrounding counties, in other words, there should not be any reserved waters because they are paying the licence and they want to go with their children to fish in areas which at present are prohibited to them.</P>

It is rubbing salt in to guillotine this Estimate. If the people's representatives are not allowed to speak on behalf of the people, then the people will speak for themselves by protesting in the streets, on the rivers and on the lakes with terrible consequences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the consultations taking place on the salmon review body report.  I have held extensive consultations and had negotiations with the central fisheries authorities, the regional boards and the major organisations involved, and one of the points most often raised was the financing of inland fisheries.  It was obvious that there was no possibility of getting widespread agreement from the interested parties and we agreed to go ahead with the legislation before Christmas.  That is still the situation.  I challenge any Deputy to come up with any proposal which will get broad acceptance from the people involved in this controversy.  We have had ample opportunity to discuss this subject already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been discussed more than any other in the past five years, and most of the discussion was based on misinformation and misconceptions, not on facts.  In that kind of environment it is impossible to find a solution.  Every suggestion was met with a negative response.  The question we must ask ourselves is, do we want the inland fisheries service to manage, control and develop inland fisheries?  If we do, then somebody has to pay and there must be a reasonable <Col N="1687" /> balance between what the taxpayer puts in and the contribution to be made by the people involved.</P>
      <P>I would like to tell the House some of the constructive measures we have been taking in the Department of the Marine. We have brought our legislation in line with international convention regulations, especially in the area of pollution where we have already taken very important decisions and brought forward very progressive legislation.  There are other proposals we would like to see implemented in the inland fisheries and marine pollution areas and preparation of legislation in those areas is already well advanced.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have replied to questions on the volume of support from the European Community in the aquaculture area.  At present I am endeavouring to rectify the position I inherited.</P>

      <P>We cannot resolve all these complex issues but we will not be diverted from our task in the short term by the petty politicking we have seen last night and over the last few months on the rod licence issue.  I am satisfied that in the new Department of the Marine we have the capability, the expertise and the political will to tackle and resolve some of these issues and we intend to proceed along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the administration of inland fisheries, this is being examined by me <Col N="1688" /> in the context of the overall evaluations under way in the Department.  The exercise is to avoid overlapping and duplication, the waste of scarce human and financial resources and, within the framework of the Department, to streamline administrative arrangements so that they will be able to respond quickly and decisively to some of the issues which face us at present.</P>
    <P>I want to condemn in the strongest possible manner some of the recent incidents and assaults we have seen and heard about on fishery protection staff. These were shameful and disgraceful.  I deplore them in the strongest possible way.  I have spoken about this matter to the Minister for Justice and every effort will be made by my Department and by the Department of Justice to track down, apprehend and convict those responsible for these disgraceful and shameful deeds.</P>

      <P>As regards safety at sea, I want to express my sympathy, and the sympathy of the House, to the families of the people who were lost in the recent tragedy at Malin Head.  This was the second tragedy we have had.  We had another tragedy a few months ago.  I have already set up a preliminary inquiry into the latest tragedy.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind those involved in the fishing industry that the regulations and safety measures which we have in place are designed for their own protection and safety.  They are involved in dangerous situations and provision of safety equipment is essential, as well as compliance with the regulations.  I appeal to all those involved in the industry and in its commercial aspect to co-operate with the Department.  We will give them any assistance and help by designing regulations specifically for their safety and that of their passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Begley that <Col N="1689" /> there is no serious pollution from fish farming in Mulroy Bay.

There was some problem which was investigated by the Department and settlement has now returned.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1988. - Vote 43: Health (Revised Estimate).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,109,944,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The gross non-capital provision in the Estimate amounts to £1,207.414 million. Allowing for Appropriations-in Aid at £138.5 million, the net non-capital grant provision is £1,068.914 million.</P>
      <P>The net non-capital grant provision represents a decrease of £43.111 million on the corresponding out-turn for 1987 (£1,112.025 million).  The decrease is due to additional appropriations-in-aid of over £8.6 million, (which have the effect of reducing the funding requirement from the Exchequer), a reduction of £12.6 million in the requirement for balances of grants due to health agencies, and the additional full year effect of economies achieved during 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase of 3 per cent from July in the rates of allowances to disabled persons is provided for.  The provision also takes account of the writing off of local loans, as well as the restoration of <Col N="1690" /> the community drugs schemes.  There is no provision for the cost of pay increases arising under the 1987 pay agreement. This cost will be met from Vote 46 and will add approximately £20 million to the total available for health services.</P>
    <P>The level of non-capital expenditure in 1987 which can be approved on the basis of the subhead provisions in the Estimate is £1,297.5 million in gross terms, or £1,190.5 million taking account of income which is received directly by the health agencies, such as payments for maintenance in private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals, and the in-patient and out-patient charges introduced last year.</P>
    <P>The gross estimated expenditure of £1,297.5 million represents a decrease of £22.5 million on the outturn for 1987.  It comprises £800 million in respect of pay, £427.5 million in respect of non-pay (excluding cash allowances) and £70 million in respect of cash allowances.  About 81 per cent of the gross expenditure will be met from Exchequer funds.  The approximate breakdown of estimated gross expenditure of £1,297.5 million in 1988 between programmes is set out in Appendix I.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the data presented, the general hospital programme absorbs almost 49 per cent of the total non-capital budget.  I will return later in my statement to developments in this particular programme.</P>
    <P>In discussing the current provision for health services we need to be conscious of the rapid growth in health expenditure that occurred particularly over the last 15 years or so.  In 1973-1974 net expenditure amounted to about £143 million, representing about 5.2 per cent of GNP.  In the current year it will be of the order of £1,190.5 million, representing about 6.7 per cent of GNP.  While this percentage is high, it has, in fact, declined from a peak of around 7.9 per cent in 1982.</P>
    <P>The total health capital allocation for 1988 is £43 million.  In the current difficult financial situation, this is a substantial allocation and it will be spent on the priority capital projects that are included in the capital programme in order to <Col N="1691" /> improve the infrastructure of the health services.</P>
    <P>Construction or equipping work will be continued on all the major general hospital projects that are provided for, including St James's, the Mater, Cavan, Mullingar, Castlebar, Loughlinstown, Waterford Regional Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda (a new maternity unit).  Provision has also been made for major new schemes where construction has commenced in 1988, such as the Sligo General Hospital and the Wexford General Hospital (Phase 1). The planning of the new Tallaght hospital will be continued.</P>
    <P>Equipping work will also commence at the Swinford Mental Handicap Centre and will continue at the new 100 bed replacement geriatric unit at the Sacred Heart Home, Carlow.</P>
    <P>Funds will be made available in the current year to fit out and furnish the new city centre drug centre in Pearse Street Dublin.</P>
    <P>Funds are also being made available in the current year to deal with high priority fire and structural precautions.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling for payment of health contributions has been increased to £15,500 with effect from 6 April 1988. The income limit for a hospital services card was increased to £15,500 with effect from 1 June 1988.</P>
    <P>On 31 March 1988, 38.08 per cent of the population were covered by medical cards.  The figure for 31 March 1987 was 37.73 per cent.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for medical cards were increased from 1 January last.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge the major contribution which the national lottery is making to the health services. Six million is being expended largely on services for disadvantaged persons, with a particular emphasis on community-based projects.  The lottery is making a very important contribution to the following services in the current year:</P>
    <P>services for the mentally and physically handicapped;</P>
    <P>services for the elderly; <Col N="1692" /> psychiatric services;</P>
    <P>community information and development services;</P>
    <P>AIDS prevention programmes; and child care services.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased with the Government's decision last January to establish a new structure for health promotion, a decision which experience has since shown was a very wise one.  I had been concerned about the apparent emphasis on illness services and a corresponding lack of attention to the promotion of positive health and preventive strategies generally.</P>
    <P>The new health promotion structure operates at three levels and is now in full operation.  It comprises a health promotion unit in my Department, an advisory council on health promotion and a committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit, in addition to taking on responsibility for the development of health education programmes, is also responsible for developing a wider policy of health promotion, acting in concert with the appropriate statutory and voluntary agencies in the health and other relevant sectors.</P>
    <P>The unit has been active since its establishment and has already launched a number of significant campaigns both in its own right and in association with a number of voluntary agencies.  These include: participation with the Irish Cancer Society in the &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer Week&rdquo;; the launch of a &ldquo;Drugs Question &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo;, a community-based approach to combating alcohol and drug abuse; and the launch of a major food hygiene campaign, under the slogan &ldquo;Clean watch&rdquo;, which succeeded in commanding wide support within the food trade and the relevant professional groups.</P>
    <P>Recently the advisory council on health promotion made recommendations to me in relation to a number of other programmes related to alcohol, tobacco and nutrition and I am at present studying these.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to be able <Col N="1693" /> to report to Government that, among a number of positive results from the review of the drug agreement between my Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries we reached a new agreement, to terminate in 1990, which will put a voluntary price freeze on drugs and medicines in operation up to the end of October, 1988 regardless of currency movements or increases in UK parent prices.</P>
    <P>One particularly worrying development which impinges on the public health area is the spread of the AIDS virus.  To date, there have been 49 cases of AIDS in Ireland.  Nine have been haemophiliacs, one heterosexual, 18 have been homosexuals/bisexuals, 14 IV drug abusers, four homosexuals/IV drug abusers and three babies born to infected mothers.</P>
    <P>The emerging pattern from these statistics taken in conjunction with the breakdown of the AIDS cases clearly demonstrates that the future pattern of AIDS in Ireland will be dominated by IV drug abuse.  The most serious implication of this epidemiological finding is the risk of spread into the heterosexual community. There is in fact evidence to show that the virus is already spreading into the heterosexual community.  As this pattern has emerged, the Government's AIDS strategy has been developed to meet the situation.  Recently I answered a question in the House as to what the Government have been doing and will continue to do.</P>
    <P>The continuing importance of cancer in all its forms as a major cause of illness and mortality is a fundamental concern. It is widely recognised that one of the most effective ways to monitor the presence of cancer within the community, gain a better understanding of its epidemiology and to devise appropriate preventive measures is by means of a national tumour register.  I have therefore set up an expert committee to consider how a national tumour registry should be established and to determine the operational methodology and funding requirements.  I expect the committee to report in September.  I am also awaiting <Col N="1694" /> the report of a group on cervical screening so that we might look at the possibility of implementing a national cervical screening service.</P>
    <P>The programme of developing health centres is continuing.  Among the new centres completed in the past year are Skerries, Athlone, Shannonbridge and Carlow.  New health centres are under construction while other centres are being upgraded and extended.</P>
    <P>In addition, part of the recently vacated hospital at Baggot Street, Dublin was refurbished for use as a health centre. I expect that similar developments will take place at other locations.  The development of health centres meets a clear need in our primary care service and it is my intention to push ahead with the health centre development programme as resources become available.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Health, I have been increasingly concerned at the rise in the number of cases of alleged child abuse being reported to the health boards.  In July last, my Department published a new set of guidelines which incorporate procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that there is a need to increase the range of services available, particularly for sexually abused children and I have already allocated special funds to enable the services at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals to be significantly expanded.  There is, of course, a need also to improve services on a countrywide basis outside the Dublin area and I have, therefore, allocated special funds of £450,000 from the national lottery to different health boards outside of Dublin to enable them to improve their capacity for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child abuse including child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of psychiatric services is continuing along the lines outlined in &ldquo;Planning for the Future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the same time new facilities are being established in community settings. In 1987 alone, 50 hostels with some 300 places were opened throughout the country. Day hospitals are also being opened <Col N="1695" /> so that people can receive treatment locally and without admission to the psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>There is a capital cost involved in setting up new facilities.  However I am fully committed to our policy in this area.  This is a once-off capital investment and the running costs of community services will be met by redeployment from hospital budgets.</P>
    <P>The level of financing of mental handicap services has steadily increased as a percentage of overall health expenditure over the last number of years.  In 1979, 7.6 per cent of health expenditure was allocated to mental handicap services while now roughly 11 per cent of health expenditure will be used to provide services for people with a mental handicap. I am glad to say that we were able to protect the mental handicap services during a period of financial constraint in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Today I received the working party report on services for the elderly.  While I have not had time to study it yet I would like to place on record my appreciation of the people who served on that committee. I look forward to reading it as I believe it will be a blueprint for the direction of those services in the future.</P>
    <P>Advances in technology have had a huge impact on hospitals and this has in turn forced hospitals to critically evaluate their methods of operation.  There is a greater methods of operation.  There is a greater emphasis now than in the past on concentrating resources on out-patient and day facilities.  I am greatly heartened to see that practically all hospitals are now adopting this approach with the result that far more patients than heretofore can be treated at a substantially reduced cost.  Also, the developing technology and improved management of patients means that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been considerably reduced.  I think it is very significant that, while practically all hospitals reduced their bed capacity in 1987, very many of them in fact treated more patients than in 1986.</P>
    <P>These developments indicate that the <Col N="1696" /> actual bed complement of a hospital is not in itself the critical factor.  Other factors such as diagnostic support facilities and improved patient management can be and are of great importance and these are the areas on which our attention should be focused rather than on bed numbers as such.  All of these are positive initiatives which occurred in the past year and they are initiatives which I intend to foster and encourage in 1988.</P>
    <P>The past year also saw many other positive developments including the opening of the new Beaumont Hospital and the other capital developments to which I've already referred.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the acute hospital rationalisation has been the necessity for reorganisation of the accident and emergency service provided on a rota basis by major Dublin hospitals.  I am aware that problems have arisen in relation to this service leading to dissatisfaction and concern regarding the continuing ability of the hospitals to discharge their various responsibilities in a satisfactory manner and have initiated a review of the services. I have recently suggested discussions to examine current organisation and delivery of these services.  I will be setting up immediately a steering group which will have management and accident and emergency consultant representation from each of the hospitals concerned and it will operate under the chairmanship of the Hospital Programme Manager of the Eastern Health Board which has responsibility for co-ordination of these services.</P>
    <P>December 1987 witnessed the enactment of legislation providing for a statutory scheme of control of clinical trials. This will permit the carrying out of legitimate and necessary testing of medicinal products while at the same time guaranteeing that the safety of participants is protected.  I am currently drawing up guidelines for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will know the Child Care Bill is before the House and we hope to see that progress through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The new Tobacco Bill passed all Stages <Col N="1697" /> in the Dáil last night and will be in the Seanad in the coming weeks and following its passage through the House and becoming law there will be no delay in implementing the necessary regulations to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>Reorganisation of health board services is one of my priorities in improving our health delivery system.  The question of the abolition of the health boards is not on my agenda.  I accept that changes need to be made in relation to the framework of health boards, the relationship between boards and management and the role of boards and improvements in the management of our delivery system.  All these need to be addressed.  At present we are looking at the structures of the health boards to see whether the formulation of programmes is the most appropriate way to deliver services or whether we should look at geographical areas in the future.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have expressed the need on several occasions to review the overall structuring and direction of health and social policy.</P>
    <P>Our ultimate objective should be to determine specific developmental targets for the population as a whole and for groups which require particular attention and whose health status or quality of life requires improvement.  Given that limited resources are available for expenditure on health services and that informed and rational choices must be made it is particularly timely to set down the direction, the principles and the emphasis which will underpin how we approach the question of health and deliver services to promote positive health.  Equity, equality and efficiency considerations must be central to a planned approach to meeting health and health services needs.</P>
    <P>Considerable preparatory work has already taken place.  The major national Beaumont conference on my Department's discussion document &ldquo;Health &mdash; The Wider Dimensions&rdquo; was very successful and focused attention on the future direction of health policy and the factors which should determine how best to proceed.  The removal of identified <Col N="1698" /> health inequalities in line with the Government's stated objective of protecting the vulnerable and less well off in our community will be a major factor underlining my approach to health policy and resource allocations.  It will also be important in this context to have available the findings of the Commission on Health Funding which will concentrate on the central question of health services funding in the future.</P>
    <P>The developments I have outlined today across the full range of health and social service programmes, provide clear and expressive evidence of the positive, planned and organised approach which is currently taking place in our health services.  I have referred in some details to the developments that are taking place in health promotion in the hospital development programme, in the psychiatric services and in the community care programme.  I have informed the House of the reorganisation, planning and funding initiatives which I have taken and which will inform the debate on the future direction, funding and management of services.</P>
    <P>It is important that the short-term difficulties which arose because of the urgent necessity to take remedial action in all publicly funded services, including the health services in the public service, is placed in context.  Notwithstanding these short-term difficulties we have preserved a quality service which is affordable, which can develop and expand on a firm and sound basis in future years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that the concentration in the last 12 months or so in the health sector has been wrongly focused on the economic and financial constraints which have applied in the health services.  While it is so obviously true that we have always had similar constraints in the past it needs to be reiterated to avoid a wrong perception that in some way unlimited resources are available to the health sector.  It is a fact of life that the resources we would like to have available on health and social services will fall short of the demands for services which are generated.  Ireland is not unique in such a situation.  Indeed, <Col N="1699" /> most developed countries are similarly placed.  Nevertheless it is important to record that our health services are sound, that the commitment of those involved is excellent and that a sense of purpose and direction is evident for the provision of quality services which meet the genuine needs of the population.</P>

      <P>With the limited amount of time at my disposal I had better start sprinting.  I regret that in debating this Estimate, totalling almost £1.3 billion, we are confined to 15 minutes in making our contributions, given that we do not have many opportunities in this House to discuss health issues.  First of all, let me say that my party and I believe that an improved and better health service can be provided within the present budget allocation, but in order to provide this we need proper policy and clear-cut thinking. I submit that there is neither at present.  This Government came into office without a policy and I was saddened and amused by the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Just give me time.  I was saddened by the Minister's reference to short-term difficulties but I can tell him that those short-term difficulties have caused hardship and heartbreak throughout the country.  I believe the Minister's speech was a smug, middle class assessment of the health services.  It was totally separated from reality.  I come from and represent a working class area and the people in that area are experiencing grave <Col N="1700" /> hardship and long waiting lists as a result of the catastrophe which has taken place in the health services during the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the Minister's smug assessment is totally out of touch with reality because during the past 15 months we have seen a disorganised State savaging of our health services and a hamfisted attack on this important social service without any consultation with the professions involved in the services or the public who have been affected by these attacks.  We have fewer hospitals, longer waiting lists, and hardship and heartache has been caused, and even fatalities, as a result of the Minister's unplanned approach to the health services.  Despite the Minister's solemn promise to protect the sick, the old and the handicapped, I would argue that the sick, the old and the handicapped are now sicker and more handicapped because of the Minister's insensitive handling of the cuts in the health services.</P>
      <P>As I have said previously in this House the Minister came into office promising a lot but unfortunately he has done the opposite to what he promised to do.  He came into office using a lot of rhetoric and with no policy and the health services are now showing the evidence of this neglect.  Having embarked on an unprecedented wave of savage cuts the Minister set up a commission to guide him along the right path.  That commission have not as yet reported to the Minister and as a result the crisis deepens and the damage to our people increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat once again that people have lost their lives because of the cutbacks. The medical profession are afraid to speak out through a fear of civil litigation but the lid is now slowly coming off the can of worms and I pay tribute to the two consultants in the Meath Hospital who had the courage to speak their minds on the effects of these savage cuts.  Other members of the staff of the health boards have spoken out recently and I am aware that one of them was warned by his management team of what the repercussions <Col N="1701" /> would be in the event of any further comment or protest.  This happened in the Southern Health Board region.</P>
    <P>To this day the Minister has not got a plan for the health services.  On the other hand, my party have brought forward within the last two weeks a rational plan for a better health service.  We are proud to have been in the position to make this plan public.  Our policy document, entitled &ldquo;A Better Health Service&rdquo;, was published against the background of savage cuts, suffering and hardship, especially among the less well off in our society.</P>
    <P>Health costs have continued to escalate and the Minister has done nothing to tackle the fundamental problems afflicting our health services at present.  Since coming into office hospitals have closed down all over the country and I feel the Minister is washing his hands of the hard decisions which have to be taken and is delegating this responsibility to the health boards.  Because of this, the Minister has allowed hospital closures to take place in an unco-ordinated manner leaving huge gaps in the provision of health services to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in this House recently that he foresaw no further hospital closures but I am saying that there will be further closures.  For example, in the Southern Health Board area a major question mark hangs over Edenburn Hospital and I could outline numerous other examples.  These closures will be brought about by the health boards because of the cutbacks in their allocations.  This need not have happened if the Minister had come into office with a proper plan.  The objectives of any Government should be (1) to provide a modern health service for the population with the best quality that is available; (2) provide accessibility to the health services on the basis of need; (3) provide the means by which to make the system effective, efficient and flexible ensuring that the best use is made of the limited resources available; (4) provide a proper allocation of resources to ensure that proper care is provided within the community or the home in so far as possible <Col N="1702" /> and in so doing ensuring that care is provided at the lowest level of complexity; (5) integration of the health services appropriately into an overall social policy; (6) to promote health education widely as part of a concerted campaign to prevent the development of unnecessary illness or disease and (7) provide proper health education programmes and preventive programmes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last point, in the context of the recent OECD report which states that life expectancy in this country is surprisingly low when compared to other European countries, I believe it is wrong that a Minister should preside over the closure of health education programmes and preventive programmes. For example, it is intolerable that at a time when more and more people are dying from cardiac problems a health board would terminate the operation of a health blood pressure clinic, which took place recently in the southern area of the country.  Surely this must be the most retarded and short-sighted policy of any health administration to date.</P>
    <P>The current system for delivering health services nationally is badly managed and cannot be perceived as providing an adequate service or value for money.  The following points must be taken into consideration: there is a considerable waste of resources; there is far too much bureaucracy in a system which is over-administered and under-managed; the present system is not patient-orientated or responsive to clearly identified needs, particularly at local level; the system lacks adequate management controls and accountability; incentives, such as they are, within the system are not geared towards the provision of better value for money, and there is separation of responsibility from authority with no real authority at local level.  The existing system cannot be adapted to overcome the present difficulties which do not permit the efficient management of a centrally funded service.</P>
    <P>To meet the objectives outlined by me it will be necessary to initiate a fundamental restructuring which will allow the scarce resources available to be <Col N="1703" /> directed towards those people who are most in need.  From my experience I know that the present health board system is over-bureaucratic, unwieldly, disjointed, unco-ordinated, uneconomical and inefficient.  I am determined that the health board system will be replaced by a health delivery system which will be responsible for the delivery of the health services to the public, thus replacing the health boards.  This would be a central authority but would have regional and district offices and have an input from public representatives and professional bodies at local and district levels.</P>
    <P>Since the hospital programme consumes over £700 million of our total health board budget, the hospital services must be looked at in more detail.  There is a clear need to formulate a national plan for the development of the hospital services which addresses this problem of inefficiency.  Strong in-house management will be required in all our hospitals, working with a skilled and compact house management team.  Each hospital in our health services must have a definite role and budget with systems to measure performance and eventual accountability.  It is vital at this stage that the professionalism of our nursing staff, paramedical staff and medical staff is matched by managers who have a high level of skill and training.  As I have already mentioned, each hospital must have a skilled hospital management board, representative of the categories of staff within the hospital and with an input from public representatives and other professional groups.  Incentives must be created within our health system to achieve savings but at present there are few incentives in this area.</P>
    <P>In his reply to a question put by me in relation to the VHI, the Minister stated that he is still considering the monopoly position of the VHI in the light of the changes which will be brought about in 1992.  It appears that he may still seek a derogation for the VHI so that they can continue with their monopoly situation. I believe that this is anti-consumer and, <Col N="1704" /> as we have learned in many other areas, competition will bring down costs.  While I acknowledge and pay tribute to the role of the VHI throughout the years in developing a private health insurance scheme I believe this success must not hinder or blinker us in our assessments for the future.  As I already said, a new environment must be created with incentives geared to meet the objectives of providing subscribers with the best care at the minimum cost.  Therefore, I wait with great interest the Minister's decision in relation to the monopoly situation of the VHI, especially in the light of possible changes in 1992.  I believe we should make the changes ourselves rather than have changes imposed on us from abroad at a later stage.  This country must have firm attitudes and policies well before that date.</P>
    <P>In relation to community care, since taking up office the Minister has paid magnificent lip service to community care but in the meantime community care, which was relatively primitive in its development, has suffered further and is now in a crisis situation like many of the other sections of our health services.  The current system of community care has failed and I believe that my party's policy document in relation to community care outlines what must be done in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to psychiatric services, the report of the chief inspector of mental hospitals contained frightening information in relation to the conditions of some of our psychiatric hospitals.  Our Lady's Hospital in Cork was portrayed as a shabby, cold, dirty unit.  The Minister's response to this and other reports on the psychiatric services was lip service once again.  The Minister has instructed the board, who are submerged in a morass of debt, to improve the psychiatric services and to improve the lot of the patients, but not one penny has come from the Minister for this service.  The chief inspector of mental hospitals has expressed concern about the rate of progress in transferring patients from psychiatric hospitals in to the community following his most recent inspections.  In other words, the Minister's response to <Col N="1705" /> the frightening report on the psychiatric services by the inspector of mental hospitals was merely lip service.  The Minister and the Department appear to have totally abandoned the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the psychiatric services entitled &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  The Southern Health Board's response, which was made to the Department in late 1986, was for a capital allocation of £6.457 million over a ten-year period, but not one penny has been given to them.  This is a damning figure and is a damning indication of the response from the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned earlier that he will be introducing amending legislation in relation to advisory committees.  In relation to the charges imposed by some health boards for E1.11 cards and hospital services cards, I ask the Minister if he would instruct the boards who have acted irregularly to refund the moneys to the people who have already paid for applications.  I believe there is a moral obligation on us to ensure that these people get their money back.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of our health services which has caused me concern for many years, and which was recently highlighted in <i>The Star</i>, was the over-prescribing of drugs and, more specifically, tranquilisers.  The Minister and the Department have a duty to make resources available to set up an organisation to help tranquiliser addicts and drug addicts in general.  The Minister must set up, within his health promotion unit, an organisation who will provide counselling and rehabilitation for addicts. The Minister must also initiate an educational campaign to warn people of the dangers of these highly addictive drugs. Some of the roots of Ireland's tranquiliser problems lie with doctors who persist in over-prescribing these drugs.  The position is that the more some doctors prescribe the more they earn.  My party believe that a capitation scheme should be introduced within the GMS.  The Minister and his Department have a responsibility to monitor more closely the performance of doctors and to take <Col N="1706" /> action where there is evidence of over-prescribing.</P>
    <P>The Minister must protect the public from over-prescribing by his own profession and he should also introduce statutory controls to limit the amount of money spent on advertising by the multinational drug companies who produce these dangerous and addictive drugs.  It is immoral that these companies can spend vast amounts of their budgets on advertising and promoting these drugs.  The over-prescribing of drugs is a national scandal, not only on a health basis, but also on a financial basis and leads to a frightening amount of human misery.  The drug Ativan was highlighted in one of these reports, and the indications are that this is a most dangerous and addictive drug.  The Minister must consider having this drug either removed from the market or its dependency characteristics highlighted in a big way. The recent newspaper campaign only serves to confirm what I and many other politicians have learned from the people who come to our clinics, that is, that there is a serious over-dependency on drugs by many of our people, which has brought about a depth of suffering that we do not appear to realise.  Tranquiliser abuse and dependency have long been the silent and unknown disease of our nation and we must not let them remain so.  Addicts must not be abandoned by a system that has become at times too greedy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ongoing discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation on the GMS and common contract, would the Minister, even at this stage, tell us what is happening?  <i>The Irish Medical News</i> and other publications have given us in-depth details of the negotiations between departmental officials and the IMO and it is grossly unfair that even now Members of this House and Opposition spokespersons are kept totally in the dark in relation to these negotiations.  We are coming into the summer recess, when decisions will be made which will affect the workers of the health services in the years ahead.  Agreements that will be binding not only on this Government but on future Governments will be made. <Col N="1707" /> There are major deficiencies in the GMS contract and the common contract on which I shall not elaborate too much.  The Minister must get to grips with the many deficiencies in this area to ensure that many of the gaps in the contracts allowing inefficiencies and abuses are dealt with as a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous comments.  It is very unsatisfactory to be discussing Estimates for any Department halfway through the year in which the money provided has already been expended.  We must find a more appropriate way of having debates of this kind. One would hope in future that debates on the Estimates could take place in advance of the spending of any money. It is regrettable that the committee that was at one stage promised on the health services has not yet been formed.</P>
      <P>This is a time of great opportunity and great difficulty in the whole health area. As we are being asked to approve almost £1.3 billion for current expenditure on health, one would assume that that would be sufficient money to provide our young population with a decent health service. In many instances that huge sum of money is being spent inefficiently, ineffectively and, on many occasions, is squandered.  The Minister and the Department have washed their hands of the matter on some occasions and said that expenditure is a matter for the health board, hospital, or whatever.  Things are so bad in some areas that it is virtually impossible to get into hospital unless one can afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present 7,000 public patients waiting for hip and other joint replacement operations.  In many places the waiting list stretches for over two and a half years.  A senior cardiologist in Dublin recently complained that because of shortage of beds he could not get patients suffering from non-emergency heart conditions into hospital.  He said that the result was that they had become emergencies and had died.  There are about 400 patients on a waiting list for vital open heart surgery in the Mater <Col N="1708" /> Hospital.  This waiting list, which has been down to 300, is expected to increase to 500 by the end of this year.  There are about 250 children on a waiting list for open heart surgery in our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin.  Some have been brought to Dublin for operations from their homes in the country and sent back again because staffing in the hospital was insufficient to allow the carrying out of operations.</P>
    <P>The only Irish centre for carrying out bone marrow transplants on seriously ill children, which was in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin, can now do only one operation a month because of lack of funds.  The most ludicrous situation of all is in our dental services area.  Imagine a Government extending eligibility to new categories while those already eligible cannot get any service.  There are now 23,000 people on the orthodontic waiting list.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity recently to discover the awful conditions existing for many patients at the Coombe Hospital in Dublin.  A constitutent had been given two different appointments to turn up for a hysterectomy operation but she was sent home again and I was approached to make representations on her behalf.  I discovered the following horrific facts. Last year there were 48 beds in the surgical wing of the Coombe Hospital; 13 of these beds were for private or semi-private patients.  There are now only 26 beds in that unit and still 13 private beds and only six public beds and seven day beds.  The result is that recently up to 100 women who were due to go into the hospital for major surgery over the next number of months had to be told they certainly would not be taken before later this year, or possibly next year.  These are appalling circumstances.  We all know that for any woman to have to make the kind of psychological adjustment to having a hysterectomy operation is very difficult in itself.  To have to make family arrangements because one is going into hospital and then discover on the date of the appointment that one cannot be taken is shocking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> Our health service has further discriminated against people who cannot afford their own private health care.  It should be possible for every citizen, regardless of means, to have easy access to a caring health service.  We should be able to deliver our health services in a more cost-effective and efficient way.  We should be able with £1.3 billion to provide the kind of caring services that most of us in this House and in the country would aspire to.</P>
    <P>The single greatest scandal in the health services is the extent to which queues and queue jumping dominate the system as a result of inequality of access, despite the provisions of the 1979 Health Act guaranteeing public hospital services for all.  Another scandal is the number of people with limited means who are entitled, through PRSI or medical cards, to full facilities, who feel compelled to pay for the service on the double by buying voluntary health insurance to ensure access to a hospital.</P>
    <P>Another scandal in this area is that the ordinary member of the VHI is forced to subscribe to help a minority of VHI members who benefit at the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital. The facilities available at these hospitals should be fully paid for by the subscribers to these schemes.  I do not believe that other VHI subscribers should have to subsidise the luxury health care of the few.</P>
    <P>The health service is a minefield of petty bureaucracy and waste, leading to abuses and frustration with consequent loss of morale among most health care workers.  The major drawback of the present system of financing the health services is that hospitals do not receive any specific payments for treating individual public patients.  Public hospitals are paid an annual grant by the Department of Health to cover their running costs for the year.  Consultants working in these hospitals are paid an annual salary by the State.  These moneys are allocated at the beginning of the year and bear no relation to the number of patients the hospital will treat during the year. Therefore, since no additional moneys <Col N="1710" /> are received for public patients treated in the hospital and each public patient treated represents unrecoverable additional costs, the temptation is for the hospital to treat as few public patients as possible and take on instead private patients who will pay money for the privilege and bring revenue to the hospital. This is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>We need to move our health services towards a system where we pay hospitals for patients treated and do not pay them a fixed sum in advance, regardless of what kind of patients they take in.  We need an independent mechanism for assessing the priority of patients to be treated by consultants. I do not believe that those people who can financially benefit as a result of treating patients should be the people who decide on what kind of priority basis patients are taken in for health care.  This is far to important to be left to those who have a financial interest.</P>
    <P>I want also to talk about the position of the VHI.  Like Deputy Allen, I, too, am not in favour of monopolies, but unlike a private monopoly this is a semi-State body.  This House and country have washed their hands of their responsibility to this semi-State body.  I want to instance one fact to bear out what I am saying. Just over three years ago the VHI moved from their offices in Cook Street in Cork 150 yards away, from offices costing them £12,000 a year in rent, and purchased an office block costing over £1 million.  They were not able to dispose of their leasehold interest in their Cook Street office and for a number of years &mdash; until recently &mdash; it remained vacant.  I believe they had to pay somebody to take on the leasehold interest in the office they vacated.  They also have spare capacity in their new offices in the South Mall and again they have had to give a financial incentive to people to take rented accommodation there.  No company accountable to the State should behave in this way.  It is bad management and unnecessary and the ordinary subscribers of the VHI have to pay for their bad decisions.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to see that, even though this happened three years ago, when Deputy Wyse asked the Minister for <Col N="1711" /> Health a question about this matter on 31 May, he was told that the Department had no information, that they knew nothing about it and that he should consult the VHI.  That is not good enough, indeed, it is a scandal.  This company should be subject to the scrutiny of the State-sponsored bodies committee of this House to investigate their management decisions and the manner in which subscribers' money is being used by the VHI. At a time when the City General Hospital in Cork is not covered by the VHI, it is ironic that they engaged in the expenditure of this money in Cork.</P>
    <P>In relation to the withholding tax issue and the consultants, it is a shame that the patients, the vulnerable, innocent people, are becoming the pawns in this political battle.  It was irresponsible of the Minister for Finance to bring in these proposals without making regulations to enforce them.  It is not good enough.  I have a copy of a circular given to a patient recently when asked to pay a hospital bill.  There are four points in the circular and it is clearly stated that it is the responsibility of the patient to pay the consultant.  Patients should not be put in this position and the Minister should have brought in legislation to compel the VHI to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners the amount of fees paid to consultants and tax could be directly collected from the VHI.  The private, very special relationship between a consultant and his or her patient should not be interfered with in this way.</P>
    <P>I have a mixed reaction to the new scheme proposed in relation to general practitioners under the GMS.  I can understand the necessity for trying to have a more cost effective scheme but I hope it will not result in certain public patients not being able to have access to a GP.  I hope it will not mean that on Saturdays, Sundays or at night, certain people who cannot afford to pay a doctor to visit them will be deprived of a full and proper GP service.  In fairness, the one area of the health service about which I never get a complaint is the GP service. People are happy with it &mdash; perhaps the <Col N="1712" /> Minister will say that they should be, as it is costing a lot of money &mdash; nonetheless it is the first port of call when dealing with the health services.  It would not be right if only those who can afford to pay for a GP's private visit will be able to see him or her at weekends and evenings.  If the new scheme leads to that kind of arrangement it would be appalling.  If we move to a capitation scheme, we must be sure that there are strict conditions attached so that every citizen has easy access to a doctor when they need one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the Minister's remarks, the Chair commented that the rest of the House did not object to him straying beyond his allotted 20 minutes.  The reason was that we were probably stunned into silence by the sheer gall of the Minister, particularly in his concluding remarks.  It is tantamount to an insult to anybody who has an interest in the health services for the Minister to state that it is clear that there is evidence of a positive, planned and organised approach currently taking place in our health services.  He also said that he wished to emphasis that the concentration over the last 12 months or so in the health sector was wrongly focused on the economic and financial constraints which have applied in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus on economic constraints can hardly be surprising when the administration and the Minister were elected on a platform of protecting the health services and expanding them, and vilifying the previous Minister on hoardings the length and breadth of the country saying that there was a better way and how damaging the health cuts were.  For them to have turned all that on its head instantly was obviously a cause of focus over the last 12 months or thereabout. Almost exactly 12 months ago, we debated the Health Estimate and at that time I made certain predictions about the implications of the financial allocations being made.  I predicted that 3,700 staff would lose their jobs in the health services, that 300 psychiatric beds would close and that there would be no planned <Col N="1713" /> community alternative despite the rhetoric and the promises.  I predicted that dental and ophthalmic services would be decimated, that the health transport services would virtually disappear, that further hospital closures would occur and that there would be bed closures in the hospitals that survived the Government's axe.</P>
    <P>I predicted that community care facilities would face breaking point under the strain of the financial cutbacks imposed and that waiting lists for surgery would grow to such an extent that many elderly people would be dead before their turn for surgery.  All these things were considered alarmist and it was stated that I was over-emphasising and dramatising the case.  I was considered a nuisance and I was assured that no such disruption would occur.  The sad reality is that everything I predicted has come to pass with a vengeance.  My litany of gloom has turned out to be an under-statement of the sad reality that the Government and the Minister have visited on the poor. Since March 1987, Fianna Fáil have closed 15 hospitals with a total of 1,470 beds.  In addition, several more hospitals face closure as health boards try to grapple with their totally inadequate budgets. this disaster is only a part of the full story. When we look at the beds that have been closed down within the existing hospitals, a truly horrific picture emerges.  No fewer than 3,617 beds, at the last count, have closed over the past 12 months.  No branch of the health services has been spared and, of course, as the beds have disappeared, so have the staff.  However, people are still getting sick and accidents still happen.  Not even the Minister and the Government can legislate that away.</P>
    <P>The same number of sick people and the same number of casualty cases are facing fewer beds, fewer staff and fewer facilities.  Impossible demands are placed on the remaining staff as they endeavour to cope with a worsening and festering situation.  The closure of hospitals and beds is perhaps the most dramatic, chronic and most obvious result of this Government's butchery of the Health Estimates.  However, the destruction of <Col N="1714" /> services to the old and the handicapped and the psychiatrically ill has probably caused more hurt and anguish than any other single act of this Government in the past 12 months.  What is particularly galling is the sudden and unprecedented growth of private medicine in tandem with these cutbacks.  Elderly people must wait two, three or, perhaps, four years for a hip replacement in our public hospitals while those with money can have immediate attention in private facilities.  The dental and ophthalmic services have been reduced to emergency care only in many regions.  I have been in touch with the dentists providing the service and they are at their wits end.  They say they will provide emergency cover only for somebody who arrives in pain.  If one wants orthodontic work or specialised care one can wait for six months, eight months or a year.  That is the situation for all except those who have the money to pay for private care.  They have immediate access to attention and to facilities.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months we have seen another scandal, a scandal alluded to by the Fine Gael spokesperson, that is the introduction by various health boards of charges for hospital and other services which people are legally entitled to and there is no legal grounds for the health board making such charges.  When I pressed the Minister on this at the end of last year he hid behind a mish-mash of excuses and refused to issue a directive to the health boards to desist from implementing those charges.  Initially my parliamentary question was ruled out of order in that the Minister had not responsibility for the health boards and what they did.  Eventually I put down a question asking what legal authority the health boards were acting under and I got a rather evasive answer.  Eventually the Minister admitted to this House that there was no legal authority for these charges.  Until the last two weeks the Minister refused to issue a directive to the health boards to stop charging illegally for services that are the right <Col N="1715" /> entitlement of the people.  I am still waiting for an announcement from the Minister that charges collected will be refunded to those who are foolish enough to pay them.</P>
    <P>It has been a most depressing year for anybody concerned with decent health care, for the many individuals and caring organisations involved in the provision of health care.  Many of them are on the verge of despair.  Lest they and we lose heart and surrender our health care entirely to the economic technocrats currently calling the shots I will outline some of the modest successes against the tide of reaction.  The Minister has sought to rectify the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the charges. I cite the success of the Opposition Deputies in this House in rescuing the National Social Services Board from the axe wielded by this Minister and this administration.  Thankfully that choice of independent information and criticism has been saved.  Unfortunately the Health Education Bureau could not be saved.</P>

      <P>Because the Minister decided to axe it and unfortunately we have limited Private Members' Time in this House.  Given the choice, I would have had a motion on that too.  We could not manage to save that from the Minister's axe and the Minister has planted in its place the health promotion unit in the Department where the Minister has total control and and there can be limited independent criticism of the Minister's cutting tactics.  Success also occurred in the refund of drugs scheme.  When I raised that first, I was accused of being a nuisance and told that I had got my facts wrong.  It emerged quickly after that, that I was all too right again.  Thankfully, by concerted action of the caring organisations, that decision was rescinded and the money was restored when the budget was placed before this House in February. We must keep heart and maintain our resistance to the sort of society which Fianna Fáil want to create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> We cannot, with deference to the Minister, place the entire blame on Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have aided and abetted this Government from the beginning.  Last year at this time I listened to the Fine Gael spokesperson for health act &ldquo;Ramboesque&rdquo; and declare on Friday, grabbing the headlines, that Fine Gael would oppose the Estimate.  By Tuesday, once the numbers had been counted and it was seen that all Deputies would be present that macho effort had been retracted and Fine Gael did not oppose that Estimate at that time.  This week, on a different issue, Deputy Seán Barrett admitted that he and Fine Gael had been conned by this Government over the last number of months.  Fine Gael will have the opportunity again next Wednesday to show whether they are concerned with preserving health services or whether they are again indulging in verbal battles but not tackling the real issues.  The Progressive Democrats who wallow in the title of the &ldquo;architects of economic rectitude&rdquo; can be longer appear to oppose the consequences of the cuts as they happen, but support the global Estimates. Deputy Harney in her contribution today, gave us a litany about queues and hurts and her contribution can only be described as humbug if there is not the determination to do something by restoring proper funding in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Next year, from what we have been led to believe by the Minister and the Taoiseach, we can expect further misery and pain as another £400 million is sliced off public expenditure for 1989.  The Government can choose to continue to ignore my statements concerning our health services.  The Minister can dismiss me as a political aggravator and take no action in regard to my demands, but he cannot ignore the growing clamour from those in the front line.  The Meath Hospital, whose case I raised last week on the Adjournment, is not an isolated case.  Doctors and nurses, ambulance men and health officials are privately in touch with me and with other Members of this House to confirm the intolerable <Col N="1717" /> constraints under which they are expected to function.  Professional ethics has heretofore precluded them from public comment but as the situation worsens day by day, they cannot continue to be silent and will more and more come out courageously in defence of their patients, like Dr. Manson and Dr. Black.</P>

      <P>I will conclude with the words of the senior registrar of the Meath Hospital.  Dr. Manson said that it is the unfortunate position that people could die.  He said the problems had increased in the past few months, that they had kept on working under those conditions because they were under the mistaken impression that somebody in the Government would see what was happening and do something about it, but that nothing is being done.  He added that there was a lack of realisation as to what the health cuts mean in the hospitals.  He said that they were not being allowed to treat their patients properly.  The Labour Party will oppose this Estimate again this year.  We will oppose this Government's excuse for a health policy and we invite the non-Fianna Fáil majority in this House to finally take a stand on this most fundamental of issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to speak in this debate. Deputy Allen has dealt with the broad issues in the context of the newly published Fine Gael approach to the reorgansation of the health services so I intend to confine myself to raising matters which concern me particularly in the way in which the health services have developed over the past year.  The question of waiting lists &mdash; to which the Minister referred in his contribution and it has also been referred to by the previous speakers &mdash; for admission to hospitals and the problems in the accident and emergency and out-patients services are inter-connected.  It is extremely important that the Minister should use the summer period to improve the position <Col N="1718" /> because the delays which people are experiencing are totally unacceptable and also because of the virtual impossibility for a public patient to have elective surgery done.  The only way you can be assured of an operation is if you are an emergency case and then you are not sure about the outcome.  This is not alarmist, it is a reality and it is something that has presented itself more acutely in the past year because of the number of bed closures.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things that can be done in relation to that.  From speaking to management in one of the major hospitals in the north side of Dublin, it is clear that the resources which are there are not adequately used.  Beds in speciality units are perhaps not fully utilised and hospitals, to an extent, are little independent kingdoms.  Decisions are made on the basis of the random interplay of political power between consultants at any particular time.</P>
      <P>As legislators we are responsible for the establishment of a proper system of administration and have a responsibility to ensure that that situation does not continue.  I know the Minister is looking at this and I presume this is the reason he has hesitated for so long in relation to Beaumont Hospital in finalising the structures.  Even with the existing resources a great deal more can be done. I hope the Minister is engaging in a major review of the impact of the total number of bed places lost.  With improved management the problems that are emerging at present in relation to people who need treatment can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have a management structure properly established for hospitals.  I saw in <i>The Medical Times</i> today that the South Eastern Health Board are proposing a management structure of their own.  The Minister will be aware that Fine Gael's policy emphasises the need to take the hospitals under central control, to establish modern management systems and to take the power out of the hands of persons who, as Deputy Harney said, have a direct financial interest in the throughout of patients and give it to managers who have a <Col N="1719" /> responsibility to the State for ensuring that the best possible use is made, on behalf of public and private patients, of the limited resources available.  This is a nettle that must be grasped and if the Minister does something about it he will have our support.</P>
    <P>Another problem which I have raised on a number of occasions relates to national specialities such as the bone marrow transplant unit &mdash; which was referred to by Deputy Harney &mdash; the paediatric heart transplant unit and the national transplant and heart surgery service. The budgets for these specialities are decided at local level and are dependent on the interplay of politics.  Despite the Minister's best intentions, it is clear that he can issue budgets and guidelines but at the end of the day he cannot control what is happening at this level without changing the way we organise the hospital services.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, in their recent policy document, have presented a way of organising our hospitals which would lead to greater efficiency and greater accountability.  It is important that the Minister would indicate what has happened as a result of his review of waiting lists for these speciality services.  He mentioned earlier in the year his concern in relation to the delays for hip and joint replacements for the elderly. Has the Minister arrived at a solution to ensure that specialities are given adequate resources, with hospitals at regional level distributing their own budgets on the basis of competing needs which include providing a general hospital service as well as the speciality service?  The Minister will have to look at unit budgeting where a specific budget would be allocated to ensure that at least a minimum level of service is provided. The situation is critical at present.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister last week &mdash; and I am still awaiting a reply &mdash; in relation to a consultant who contacted me to see if there was anything I could do about a young child &mdash; who is one of my constituents &mdash; whom he assessed would have only months to live without a bone <Col N="1720" /> marrow transplant operation.  In that context the Minister replied to me on the Adjournment and said that the service was continuing.  The service is continuing but at a level that is a non-service.  That was the month of April and only one operation was carried out that month; one a month would be the absolute minimum to retain any comparison with previous services.  One operation in that period &mdash; I do not have the figures for what has happened since &mdash; is not a service at all. It is effectively a closing down of that service.  It was developed because of the commitment of many people.  The Minister has indicated that it is not his intention to close it down but he will have to ensure that his intentions are honoured. If the structures are not there they should be established and identified, through proper unit budgeting for the specialities to ensure the services necessary to maintain a reasonable throughout of patients other than by way of acute emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in the process of introducing very important legislation in relation to child care.  He has indicated in his speech that he hopes to be able to allocate extra resources in that area. Deputy Allen indicated how important it was to have more resources and that is self-evident.  If the Child Care Bill is to have any impact there must be resources and not just in the emergency services but particularly in the area of prevention and in the provision of back-up services for families.  An area which the Minister failed to deal with, and there is no indication of intent in his speech to give it priority, is the way in which we administer our child care services.  The current structures are totally inadequate to give due weight to the development of a proper service for children to protect and to support them in their communities and to prevent family breakdown.  The child care services are tagged on at the end of a health service where, even in budgetary terms, their share of the cake is very small.  The structure as it stands does not encourage or assist the development of a proper child care service.  Perhaps the Minister would look at the Fine Gael <Col N="1721" /> proposal which involves a total reorganisation of the health services by taking the general hospitals into a central control unit under An Bord Sláinte and the establishment of regional management for community services with a project head, particularly for the child care area. We may have to fight in due time for resources but without a proper structure there can be no substantial improvement. I hope the Minister will give some thought to those points during the recess and that he will be able to announce encouraging news in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I am impatient for the results of the review of the services for the mentally handicapped.  That review has been used as an excuse for the lack of action in that area.  It is clear in Dublin that there is an urgent need for residential places for mentally handicapped children and that has been the position for a number of years.  The failure to bring onstream the necessary resources which are in place in Cheeverstown is a scandal.  Any resources available tend to be used to relocate children who were unsuitably placed in the larger psychiatric hospitals. We will not tolerate the excuse of the review much longer.  I hope proposals are announced in the budget to allocate more places for the mentally handicapped. There is a great need for more places in Dublin and in the Eastern Health Board area.  I have been hearing about the review for the past 12 months and I will not tolerate it as an excuse much longer.</P>
    <P>In the reforms we have proposed we estimate that with the abolition of the health boards and a more efficient delivery of the health services we could save up to £30 million in administrative costs. That money could be invested in developing the services requested by Members today.  I hope the negotiations with the IMO in regard to the GMS prove fruitful, that the major element of the settlement will be by way of capitation and that as little as possible will be by way of additional services.  The Minister should consider giving incentives for the establishment of group practices and, where possible, the employment of nurses.  We should ensure that doctors have a better <Col N="1722" /> quality of lifestyle and that their patients have a better standard of services.  A group practice is more suitable than an anonymous call system because doctors in a group practice are known to patients. In the negotiations with the IMO the Minister should encourage such a development.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a plea to the Minister to develop the service for infertile couples.  Deputies from all parties have taken an interest in this matter and requested a meeting with the Minister to exchange views on this problem which affect one in ten couples here.  There is little known about this and we are anxious to have the problem placed high on the agenda for the development of the health services.  We look forward to a positive response from the Minister in relation to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder whether the Minister finds time to recollect his four years as spokesperson for Health for the Fianna Fáil Party.  That party sent the Minister into the Chamber day after day and night after night to protest in the strongest possible terms about every attempt to save money on the health services.  Fianna Fáil sent their Deputies all over the country to help organise protests, sometimes of the most violent kind, against any attempt to introduce proposals similar to those being carried out by the Minister.  I accept that in those days the Minister was speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil front bench, that he was announcing their decision. That was good policy for the front bench because all they were concerned with was making people unhappy and discontented and to stir up strife.  They did everything possible to get votes for Fianna Fáil at the election.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is a busy man and that he may not find time to recollect his four years in Opposition but he should allocate a few minutes of each day to meditate on what happened in the past four years.  He should examine his conscience on the attitude he adopted when in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an exercise would be extremely funny if the matter was not so serious.  We live in an age when politicians are under attack, when the media belittle politicians and accuse them of having ulterior motives for doing this, that and the other.  Politicians are presented to the country as unworthy people but it is not the politicians who are at fault but the system we have.  I cannot think of anything more calculated to damage our political system, and the reputation of politicians, than the attitude adopted by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition and their actions in Government.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are not closing down hospitals one at a time; groups of them are being earmarked for closure.  The Government are refusing to provide elementary medical and dental attention for those in dire need of it.  It is possible to postpone some treatment but any malformation which can be rectified should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  We should not allow such malformations to go untreated.  On 19 February I tabled a question to the Minister for Health in regard to a schoolboy in my constituency who was found in the course of a school examination to have a malformation of his teeth.  He was recommended for orthodontic treatment.  The health board accepted he had a serious problem but they could not do anything about it.  It was pointed out to the health board that a few miles away, across the Border, treatment was available in a hospital.  The health board were asked to fund the treatment for the boy but they refused to do so.  I know that my time is limited.  I put down a question on that matter and the relevant portion of the Minister's reply, given to me on 9 February, reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In the specific case with which the Deputy is concerned I have been informed by the North-Eastern Health Board that while the person in question&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" />&mdash;the person in question is a schoolboy&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;has a serious orthodontic problem he is not a Category I Priority Case.  The health board has stated that there are limitations of the types of orthodontic treatment which it at present can have carried out.  In the circumstances which I have outlined I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate the difficulties which the board have in providing orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>This unfortunate boy had malformation in his teeth and the older he got the more difficult his problem became and he could not eat properly.  This boy is to be condemned to go through life with that malformation. He might even end up by not being able to speak properly.  When he leaves school if he presents himself for any sort of job where he has to meet the public he will be starting off with a handicap.  I ask is that fair?  Is it something that can be postponed?  The simple answer is no.  That reply from a Government who said there was a better way, who ballyragged Deputy Barry Desmond, the Fine Gael Party and every member of the last Government for not providing a perfect system of health services, is simply not good enough.</P>
    <P>I want to call on the Minister, even at this late stage, to do something for this boy.  He has a file on him.  The remedy lies in Northern Ireland.  When the Government were in Opposition they would probably have said that it was not right to send a patient to Northern Ireland or to have anything to do with services provided by Her Majesty, the Queen, but in Government they have come a long way from that.  I would ask the Minister, in the name of humanity, to send that boy to Northern Ireland to have him attended to.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak briefly about my old and very dear friend, the general hospital in Cavan town.  We, in Cavan, have waited for about 50 years for a hospital. During those 50 years we have suffered substandard hospitals, particularly in the surgical field.  It is true that 20 or 30 years ago we got a medical hospital in a building <Col N="1725" /> which was a sanatorium in the days before tuberculosis was brought under control. That hospital is not and never was suited to be a medical hospital and I do not think the Minister would say it was.  After putting on all sorts of pressure, waiting and praying, the hospital has been built in Cavan and we are all very proud of it. It is a very fine building that will serve the people of that region for many years to come, certainly 100 years.  It is of the white elephant variety at present because it is not open.  The Minister will remember that another job he was given as spokesman for Health in the Fianna Fáil Party, was to complain bitterly about a hospital in Tralee that was not being opened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard about Tralee and Beaumont night after night.  I want the Minister to open the Cavan hospital.  I am not satisfied with the part of his speech which says that construction or equipping will be continued on all the major general hospital projects that are provided for, including St. James's, the Mater, Cavan, Mullingar, Castlebar, Loughlinstown, Waterford Regional Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  He does not say how long this will go on, whether it will be completed this year, next year or never.  I want him to give an undertaking that it will be completed now.  I have read in <i>The Anglo Celt</i> that another £500,000 will be necessary to complete the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad economics and a waste of money to leave this hospital unopened when all the work was completed several months ago and it was handed over to the health board.  The State has to provide caretaking facilities and heating.  Admittedly, the amount of money necessary to heat it at this time of year is not as much as it will be later in the year but I am thinking of the winter months.  I want an assurance from the Minister that he will see to it that the hospital is opened.  He should tell us, when replying, what parts of the hospital will be opened and when. When it was handed over it was stated <Col N="1726" /> that a section or sections of it would be opened in September.  I would like the Minister to tell us if that promise still stands and, if part of the hospital is to be opened in September, what part of it will be opened.  Will the surgical section be transferred from the 200-year old building that it is in at present and that has been condemned as a fire hazard and a health risk?  Were it not for the care and attention given to it by the staff it would be an obvious public disgrace.  I would like the Minister to give us that information in precise terms.  The information he has given in his speech is far too general. He mentioned this list of hospitals in a few lines without spelling out what he means.  I am particularly concerned with the Cavan hospital.  I want to know when it will be opened.  I want an assurance that there will be no more waste of money and that this fine building with its fine equipment will be staffed and put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity on behalf of The Workers' Party to respond to the Minister who has what must be the most dismal and difficult job that any Minister in the present administration has to undertake. Often times I am almost given to feeling sympathy for the Minister for the thankless task that has been bestowed on him by the Government, to come in here and try to push and promote one of the most devasting programmes of Government that has been introduced into the health system since the foundation of the State. Its treatment of the elderly and the ill must be the hallmark of any civilised society.  These categories, particularly in the lower income groups, have suffered most as a result of Fianna Fáils health cuts.  Those who can afford private medical care, those who can afford to pay for treatment in the luxurious surroundings of the Mater Private Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic, are not suffering.  The elderly person living alone and depending on a public health nurse, the unemployed person who has to sit for hours in an outpatients' unit awaiting treatment, the mother with a handicapped, incontinent <Col N="1727" /> child, depending on the health board for nappies, these are the victims of the Minister's and the Taoiseach's health cuts.  It is no exaggeration to say that the cuts in funding and the staffing reductions have left the health services in many areas on the verge of collapse.  Putting highly trained medical staff out of jobs is a particularly false economy.  The highly trained doctors, nurses and technicians who are being forced out of work are unlikely to get alternative employment in this country and will have no option but to emigrate and their services and expertise will be lost to us.  The money spent on their training will have been wasted as far as the Irish people are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is no way of establishing how many serious or potentially fatal health problems have not been detected or treated in time because of the health cuts, because the victim did not have the price of a visit to a private hospital or was forced to wait too long for specialist treatment or a hospital bed.  All this is starkly ironic when one considers a quote of the present Taoiseach in an interview given to <i>The Irish Press</i> in September 1984.  He said:</P>
      <P>The health services have been reduced to dangerously inadequate levels and I think if it hasn't happened already people will die because of the unavailability of services in certain areas.</P>
      <P>That was the Taoiseach's view in 1984. Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that the Minister should take time to reflect on his record during that time, but how does the Taoiseach reflect on the current level of services in the health area given the view he expressed in 1984 and all that has happened since?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the litany of woes that are inevitably presented here during Estimates debates and at other times, we often lose sight of some of the more fundamental issues confronting the medical and health services. That is all the more remarkable when one considers that there is available to all, and in particular to the Government, the work of ten years of Professor <Col N="1728" /> Dale Tussing on the structure and development of our health services.  His report, published in 1985, has been given scant attention by the previous and present Governments.</P>
    <P>He looked at the services and came to some very basic conclusions, conclusions which, on behalf of The Workers' Party I would ask the Minister to address.  The first related to the delivery of services and how they should be concentrated.  He concluded &mdash; and all of us on reflection would agree &mdash; that the most important service that must be delivered was the provision of primary care for all.  He looked at all the arguments and the ways this could be achieved and eventually came to the conclusion that any effective service of delivery of primary care in the health area could only come from a free general practitioner service available to all the population.  He also argued that the method of remuneration of general practitioners under the national medical care service must be changed from the present system of payment per item of service to one based on the payment of a salary to every doctor who works the general medical service.  This makes sense.  It is the ultimate way of reducing the demand for hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Government are intent on ignoring the logic of Professor Tussing's position and are trying to reduce demand on hospital services simply by imposing new charges and by reducing the number of beds and other facilities which are available. Needless to say, all that can achieve is an increase in what the National Economic and Social Council call &ldquo;the incidence of untreated treatable illness&rdquo;, by scaring people away from the general practitioners in case they are referred to hospitals and charged the £10 tax.</P>
    <P>Indeed, this £10 hospital tax may even increase the incentive for people to seek hospital rather than general practitioner care since the VHI have provided coverage for this for existing members and a special new scheme for the remaining non-medical card holders who are not already members.  Thus the type of the structural change for which Professor Tussing argued so logically and forcefully <Col N="1729" /> is further away than ever, rather than being addressed by this Government.</P>
    <P>The second major issue on which he reached a conclusion was public versus private health care.  We, in The Workers' Party, tend to argue this from the point of view of equity and equality in the service. In his conclusions Professor Tussing was obliged to recommend &mdash; and we say his recommendations should be supported &mdash; the separation of public and private health care, the reduction and eventual removal entirely of all public subsidies to private medicine, and the progressive improvement of standards in the public health service.  This is an area which has not been addressed and, if anything, we are further away from it as we move rapidly in the direction of Americanised private medicine.</P>
    <P>Another conclusion of Professor Tussing's is so logical and rational that one often wonders why it is not advanced more often in this House.  So long as we depend on a health service it will be impossible through direct central Government to control costs in the area of public health.  He concluded:</P>
    <P>...this is virtually impossible in a system which is decentralised, market-orientated and insurance-based to have direct or effective control.  Under a centralised system, as in the British NHS, spending can be controlled fairly easily, but a system which is dominated by insurance and market forces is not at all amenable to central control.  This is especially so in Ireland, where the effect of the various &ldquo;incentives&rdquo; (such as the present system of paying GPs, the terms of the consultants' common contracts, the VHI reimbursement of medical and hospital expenses, and the tax relief on VHI premia) all serve to encourage private health care, to subsidise it more and more with public funds, to starve public health care resources and to drive more and more people away from it, whatever the cost.</P>
    <P>What this means is that the more health care in Ireland is &ldquo;privatised &mdash; be it through direct measures like subsidising new private hospitals and <Col N="1730" /> closing down public ones, or indirectly by forcing more and more people into the VHI through the introduction of charges &mdash; the more impossible it becomes to control costs; and the more wild, illogical and extreme will become future Governments' efforts to control those costs through short-term budgetary measures and diktats to hospitals and health boards.</P>
    <P>In short, the economic policy of the axe in conjunction with over-emphasis on the development of privatised hospitalisation in this country will never be a remedy for all the problems the Minister sought to address.</P>
    <P>In the few moments left to me, I would like to turn to an issue which must be one of the most urgent in the area of medical health.  Not unremarkably this has been raised by every contributor to the debate so far.  I am speaking of dental and orthodontic care, particularly for the young and for school children.  In response to a question on 24 May last, the Minister told me that in the Eastern Health Board region, which is a little greater than the Dublin area &mdash; there is the unbelievable figure of 1,286 children awaiting complicated orthodontic treatment.  Those are the Minister's own words and they bear repeating.  The implications are horrific. It has been pointed out that the waiting list has grown because the Minister has been unable to fill the vacant post of consultant orthodontist to the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>It is my information that dentists without any kind of orthodontic experience are being trained on an ongoing basis to take on the work in this area in an effort to relieve the problem.  Young children who require major surgery or the fixing of appliances have to wait up to two years for assessment and there is a further delay before they can be treated directly.  In my constituency a young person who requires this type of treatment is assessed locally and then referred to Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin, where the queue grows longer every day.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say there is difficulty in filling a post.  This problem <Col N="1731" /> requires the filling of many posts immediately. The Minister is obviously aware of the problem.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has put it in a far more eloquent way than I could.  I urge the Minister to address this problem before we return to the House in October.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to turn his attention to the introduction of a comprehensive cervical and breast screening service throughout the country, but particularly in the Dublin area.  An horrific number of women suffer death as a result of cancer of the cervix and the breast.  These cancers are easily detectable at an early stage and can be successfully treated.</P>
    <P>We in The Workers' Party do not argue that radical reform and rationalisation of the health service is not necessary.  On the contrary, it is long overdue.  Our opposition to hospital closures is not based on a belief that institutional care is necessary in all cases.  Existing health expenditure is not too high when the needs of our people are considered.  We argue that resources could be better spent on other services, but until these services are in place there should be no reduction in what exists currently.  The Minister and the Government have gone the wrong way about radical reform in the health service.  The blunt instrument being used is not in keeping with the best interests of the country and the health care of the people as a whole.  We, like the Labour Party, oppose this Estimate and will be calling for a division.</P>

      <P>In the short space of time available to me it will not be possible to deal in detail with all the points raised but I will go through them as rapidly as I can.  Deputy Allen claimed we were making a middle-class assessment of the health service.  My policy and that of the Government has always been to ensure that the highest level of service is available to everybody, irrespective of income, within the financial constraints that exist.  We are spending almost 20 per cent of the non-capital <Col N="1732" /> Exchequer funding on our health services.</P>
      <P>Deputies Allen and Howlin referred to two consultants in the Meath Hospital, whom they congratulated on their stand. I should like to ask these Deputies for their views on the fact that beds were available in the Adelaide Hospital when patients were lying on trolleys.  How can they congratulate consultants making statements like that?</P>

      <P>There were beds available in the Adelaide Hospital.  Deputy Allen referred to the Fine Gael plan to abolish the health boards.  I see no evidence in the Fine Gael plan or elsewhere as to why the health boards should be abolished at this time.  If they were abolished, I believe the areas on the periphery would suffer.  Not alone would we have a Bord Sláinte but we would have health boards by another name around the country. There is nothing in the document about health promotion, although it is stated that there will be another document at some other time.  Neither is there anything about funding.  I wonder if Deputy Bruton had any input since he has always advocated that no policy document should be produced without every item in it being funded.</P>

      <P>It contains nothing about drug abuse, although Deputy Allen rightly expressed concern about the abuse of drugs, legally or illegally prescribed. Deputy Allen also referred to Our Lady's Hospital in Cork and said I had instructed the health board without giving them the necessary funding.  I have already dealt with that matter in the House.  I did not instruct the health board.  The inspector of mental hospitals reported to me under the 1945 Mental Treatment Act.  I met the chairman and the CEO of the Southern Health Board and the CEO presented a very comprehensive report on what he intended to <Col N="1733" /> do to improve the situation in Our Lady's Hospital.  He has my full support and initially we will see how far he can go within the £10 million which is available for the psychiatric service in Cork.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the administrative charges referred to by Deputy Allen and Deputy Howlin were not introduced by me in this House.  The £10 charge for out-patient and in-patient hospital treatment was introduced by the Oireachtas and is still in place.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made with Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin to deal with an average of two bone marrow transplant cases per month and this should be sufficient to meet all the cases arising in this country.  Progress will be made in clearing up the small backlog of cases which need to be dealt with.  I want to place on record my appreciation of the co-operation and initiative shown by Our Lady's Hospital in finding a way to solve this problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney referred to the waiting lists, which I agree are a matter of concern.  This problem is not new.  There has been a particular problem in regard to hip replacements. The service has been available for the past 12 years and the waiting list is increasing all the time due to the demand. We are taking some action to deal with it.  We hope that the increased theatre space in Cappagh Hospital, which we are providing in conjunction with the Arthritis Foundation, will be one of the ways to alleviate that problem.  In the negotiations that are going on it is very important not just to look at the method of remuneration for the general practitioners. I am glad to say that the negotiations have gone on in a very constructive way, looking at what was recommended in the report of the working party on general practice, and hopefully they will be brought to a successful conclusion.  The service provided by doctors paid on capitation is equally good <Col N="1734" /> for the patient.  If one looks at other countries where doctors are paid on capitation, the service is very good for the general practitioners.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Howlin, one would think that we had no health service in the country at all.  He must not be aware that we are spending £1,300 million, 18 per cent of the Exchequer non-capital funding, on the health services and that there are almost 60,000 people working in the health service, so that we have a very good health service.  Deputy Howlin shed crocodile tears about hospital beds being closed, yet came into this House and walked through the lobby not alone to close a hospital but, when it was closed, to have it privatised, which is totally foreign to socialist policy.</P>

      <P>On the dental services and the question raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I share his concern about the orthodontic service but that again is not new.  An advertisement was placed for five orthodontists for the health boards and only one post was filled as a result of that competition.  For years the dental services have been the cinderella of the <Col N="1735" /> health services.  Deputy McCartan referred to the long waiting lists but there were long waiting lists last year, the year before and the year before.  I asked my colleague, Deputy Leyden, who is Minister of State, to chair a committee to look at the dental services to see how they could be improved in conjunction with the dental hospitals to ensure that the highest level of service is provided.  I received that report on Tuesday last.  I am studying it at present and would like to place on record my thanks to Deputy Leyden and all those who served on that small working party for their input into it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the very important issue of the accident and emergency services.  The number of patients who turn up at accident and emergency units in hospitals, and the effect that has on elective admissions into hospitals, must be of concern.  Since the beginning of January we have been getting figures from all the major hospitals as to the number of patients and the origin of those patients.  I am also looking at staffing levels to see the level of senior staffing that is available in the accident and emergency departments.  I am looking too at the continuity of general practitioner services available in the Dublin city area.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work that is being done in accident and emergency units. The level of investigation that they are capable of carrying out in a short space of time, sometimes in the middle of the night, by way of laboratory investigations, X-rays and tests on people is amazing.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I dealt with the question of services for the mentally handicapped. I am satisfied that we have more than adequately kept the funding for this free from the cuts that unfortunately had to be made in other areas for the reasons I stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a first class general practitioner service; we have a first class acute hospital service available to those in need.  I accept that there are waiting lists and we are looking to see how we can <Col N="1736" /> deal with them.  Again, they have always been a feature of the service, and I accept that it is something we have to address. Psychiatric services are going ahead in accordance with planning for the future. There are gaps in the community care service but I am glad to say that the percentage of the budget available to me to be spent on community care is increasing each year.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied with our health promotion unit to which has been transferred the functions formerly carried on by the Health Education Bureau.  The health promotion unit is worthy of the support of all Deputies in this House, as is the Advisory Council, chaired by the president of the College of Physicians, who are working on some programmes on nutrition and the abuse of alcohol and tobacco, which will be very beneficial. Accidents and the prevention of accidents is another area that we are addressing and which has a major impact on accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Finally, a committee of six Ministers, chaired by myself, whose function is to ensure that these worthwhile policies are implemented has been set up.  While in the short-term it is hard to see the benefit of health promotion, it is an area that is worthy of the support of the Members of the House.  In conclusion, I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for making available this facility to debate this this evening.  Tonight's debate arises out of the death of a young woman, Antoinette Pepper, who was aged 26 at the date of her death, and her baby, at Holles Street and St. Vincent's Hospitals on 16 and 17 March of this year.  In bringing up this matter I am aware that it is a sensitive matter and I am not in any sense attempting to make any political points out of it or in any sense prejudge the issues that arise in this debate or to attribute blame to anybody.  I hope the Minister will accept that I am pursuing this on the basis of a genuine concern for the issues which arise out of the circumstances of this young woman's death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From information available to me it appears that Antoinette Pepper, a young woman in very good physical health and with no medical problems, was expecting a child in February of this year and, as is often the case in first pregnancies, the birth was overdue.  I am satisfied that the <Col N="1738" /> birth was approximately four weeks later than the expected delivery date.  I know that this is an inexact matter but that that was the extent of the delay in giving birth in this case.</P>
    <P>Antoinette and her mother had expressed grave anxiety about the length of time during which she had been overdue but they were assured by the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street that there was no reason for alarm.  I am also informed and believe that it is the policy of that hospital to permit, wherever possible, pregnancies to go to full term without induction and to avoid, wherever possible Caesarean deliveries.  I am a lay man and I have to accept that that is a legitimate policy for a hospital to adopt, with this comment, that some hospitals adopt a slightly different policy in relation to these issues and it is up to institutions and their management to decide the way in which they will hold the balance between the various policies and medical considerations which decide these matters in the minds of doctors.  I am also informed that Miss Pepper had in the previous week attended at the hospital for the purposes of an ante-natal examination in the hope that they would bring her in to have her child by way of induced delivery but they told her they would not be doing so at that time.  She was told to hold on until the following Monday, 14 March.</P>
    <P>When she went to Holles Street Hospital on Monday, 14 March she was kept in and I am told that on that day several attempts were made to induce the child, even though I cannot be specific on the details, and that these were unsuccessful. I am also told that during these procedures Antoinette suffered some considerable pain and distress and there is some reason to believe that at that stage she suffered some internal injuries.  It seems that heart monitoring of her child on that day showed that the child was alive and well and this continued to be the case into the early hours of Tuesday, 15 March when she went into labour in the fullest sense.</P>
    <P>The father of the child and Antoinette's family have been given no clear <Col N="1739" /> indication as to when exactly the child died &mdash; whether it was prior to, during or immediately after delivery.  They have been given conflicting versions as to the exact moment of the child's death.  They are particularly concerned that a child who died quite shortly after delivery or in the course of delivery was not delivered by way of Caesarean section given the immense difficulties which this mother had had in giving birth to a child in the normal period.  In this regard I ask the Minister to take it from me that there is some concern arising out of the fact that apparently the child in utero was healthy and not giving cause for concern on the day the mother was admitted to hospital and there was no indication of distress on the part of the child before delivery, such as would indicate the application of Caesarean section as a means of seeing the child delivered in a healthy state.</P>
    <P>The father of the child and the family and relatives of Antoinette were informed in the early hours of Tuesday, 15 March that the child was dead and that Antoinette was weak but no indication was given that she was suffering from any serious condition apart from normal exhaustion associated with the birth of a child and emotional distress over the death of the child which she had been made aware of shortly after the child was delivered.  Subsequently, her family were informed that she had been removed to St. Vincent's Hospital suffering from an acute infectious condition where she died in the latter part of 17 March.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the family were obviously deeply upset and from what I have gathered from them they accept that this made it difficult for them there and then in the aftermath of the child's death to come to terms with that fact and to get all the information in a cold and rational way from the hospital.  However, they are very anxious to know the precise cause of the child's death, whether it could have been avoided by an earlier induction, whether it could have been avoided by the application of a Caesarean section, how Antoinette became infected and whether this infection was related to any <Col N="1740" /> of the procedures involved during the delivery of her child and whether it was related to her child's death.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the circumstances were difficult for the hospital and the family I am concerned that these circumstances could occur without there being any obligation on the part of anyone to explain as much as was known on Antoinette's death and the death of her child to the father of the child and to Antoinette's family.  Naturally, they are anxious to ascertain the facts surrounding this double tragedy and it would be entirely wrong if the mere fact that legal proceedings might follow should prevent them from gaining access, to the greatest possible extent, to the available information. My colleague, Deputy Harney, tabled a question in this House seeking information on the cause of death and the circumstances surrounding the death of Antoinette and her child.  The question was not answered on the basis that there was a possibility that legal proceedings might ensue.</P>
    <P>I appreciate without any difficulty that the Minister in this matter is dependent on the information furnished to him by the hospital authorities at Holles Street but it does seem wrong that information which is available to a medical institution, a public medical institution in this case, should be withheld or kept back in any way from those who have the most intimate and obvious right to have access to that information at a time when it would do them most good, the time when they are most upset and most anxious to find out what exactly happened.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that a fair balance has to be struck between the rights of the relatives and patients and the rights of those engaged in delivering medical services. I appreciate that doctors have reputations and that their reputations cannot be, which I am not doing here, flippantly or unfairly challenged in a public forum or be the subject of public controversy in circumstances which are unfair to those people.  On the other hand, it seems that institutions delivering services to the public, where deaths can occur, owe an obligation to the relatives <Col N="1741" /> of people who die in those institutions to make available all of the information which is at their disposal even if the circumstances are such that legal proceedings may be contemplated.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong to say to the relatives of anyone who dies in hospital that information will not be made available because they may sue on foot of that information.  With the greatest of respect, it is even more wrong to suggest that the way someone finds out that information is to commence legal proceedings alleging negligence on the part of some doctor or hospital to obtain all of the documents in the possession of the hospital by way of a compulsory court order of discovery. That would entail asking people to go to law to ascertain what the available information is, putting the cart before the horse, and asking parents to resort to legal procedures to obtain information which should be their as of right.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is aware that in this case a very competent solicitor has been retained by the family, not with instructions to sue everybody but merely to ascertain the facts and if the facts are such as to give rise to legal liability on the part of someone then that is a matter for the family of Antoinette Pepper to consider further.  It is wrong that they should be effectively excluded from gaining access to the information on how their daughter and her baby died.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the position in the event of an inquest.  Section 17 of the Coroners Act, 1962 places a general duty on coroners to hold an inquest &mdash; the words are very important &mdash; where in the opinion of the coroner the death may have occurred in an unnatural manner.  First, he is not obliged to come to the conclusion that it did arise in an unnatural manner but that it may have done.  He is not obliged to pre-judge the issue in determining whether or not to hold an inquest; all that is required of a coroner is to decide that there is a bona fide question to be considered.  Of course, the question then arises: what is an unnatural manner?  If somebody dies in the course of medical procedures or in the course of <Col N="1742" /> childbirth it might be argued that the circumstances are such, because they are accidental and there was no deliberate act on the part of any person which gave rise to the death, it is not unnatural for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    <P>For that reason, it is well worth while looking at similar law in England and the procedures which are applied in English coroners' courts.  The English textbook, the third edition of &ldquo;Thursten's Coronership&rdquo; deals with this matter in some detail.  To cut a long story short, even though someone may die of an acute infection, and the infection is in a sense the result of a natural process because it is a virus which has multiplied and caused death, and even though a child may naturally die in childbirth, where &mdash; and the English case authorities are clear on this &mdash; there is a question as to whether or not the death was occasioned or contributed to by an absence of medical help, inappropriate medical help or by a failure to adopt proper medical procedures, so far as English law is concerned &mdash; and I think there is no difference here so far as Irish law is concerned &mdash; that is an unnatural death and a coroner has a duty under section 17 of the Act to consider whether or not he should hold an inquest. In other words, the mere fact that it was not a deliberate act or an accident in the sense of a car crash, an industrial accident or whatever, does not take it out of the category of an unnatural death.  From that point of view, I say to the Minister that the Coroners Act, 1962, does allow for the holding of an inquest in circumstances such as these.  Not only does it allow that but in another context the Coroners Act leaves it open to a coroner to hold an inquest where there is in his view a set of circumstances in existence which, if repeated, might give rise to other deaths or a repetition of the circumstances in question.</P>
    <P>In that context I should like to call to the Minister's attention that if mothers to be are allowed to go to full term and go past the normal &mdash; and I know the word &ldquo;normal&rdquo; has to be taken with a good deal of qualification to it &mdash; period of bearing their child, there must be a <Col N="1743" /> medical policy as to when and in what circumstances they will be induced and, if they are to be induced, what safeguards will be taken in relation to the care of the child being delivered and in what circumstances, if there is a difficulty or complication with a delivery, resort will be had to a Caesarean section.  I know that doctors differ and I know the other side of that adage but in this case there are questions which certainly need to be resolved so far as the relatives of Antoinette Pepper and the father of her child are concerned.  They are entitled to have those questions resolved in so far as it is possible so to do by an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the same Act allows the Attorney General, presumably on the advice of the Government, to direct that an inquest be held.  I understand that in this case the coroner has expressed some reluctance to hold an inquest.  If there is such reluctance the Government and the Minister have an adequate remedy because it is within the ambit of the Act for such an inquest to be held.  I understand from press reports &mdash; and I know I have to take them with some degree of caution &mdash; that the Minister has directed an inquiry into the matters I have referred to.  He has sought reports from the hospital and a newspaper of last Monday week indicated that the reports were now in the hands of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Alfie Walsh.  I believe that in those circumstances the reports and records in relation to this mother's confinement, the delivery of her child and her treatment should be both made available and interpreted sufficiently for the parents of <Col N="1744" /> Antoinette Pepper and the father of the child.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take all the necessary steps to ensure that there is an inquest held into this tragic case; to furnish all relevant information in his procurement to the father of the child and to the Pepper family; and have an inquiry held into the policies relating to late deliveries and Caesarean sections in the National Maternity Hospital.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that I have been deliberately downbeat and have not in any way attempted to sensationalise this matter nor attempted in any way, as some others do on these occasions, to pre-judge the issue but merely to ask that this information, which I believe is available be made available and delivered to the people who are most concerned &mdash; the parents of Antoinette Pepper and the father of the child.</P>

      <P>I have listened to what Deputy McDowell has said and I have taken careful note of his comments.  On the question of whether or not there should be an inquest I have no power to direct a coroner to hold an inquest.  A coroner has his powers under the Coroners Act and any amendment to that Act would be a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I understand that legal proceedings are being contemplated in this case and as I said to Deputy Harney last month I believe it would be inappropriate for me to make a statement on the matter at this stage.  I hope the Deputy appreciates that position.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 38 on 18 February 1988 in which I outlined generally the procedures which are in operation for dealing with offenders in custody who are identified as HIV positive.</P>
      <P>Since late 1985 testing for the AIDS virus has been available on a voluntary basis to all prisoners.</P>
      <P>In early 1986 it was decided, as a precautionary medical measure and for other reasons, to segregate offenders identified as HIV positive, from the rest of the prison population.  The policy of segregation is being kept under review but I am at present satisfied that the balance of advantage lies with the continuation of this policy.</P>
      <P>Since the identification of offenders as HIV positive, additional medical officers have been appointed at Mountjoy Prison where all such offenders are accommodated in three separate areas.  The medical officers, one of whom deals exclusively with male HIV offenders, attend at the prison regularly and are on call at all times.  In addition, arrangements are made for offenders to attend hospital &mdash; either on an in-patient or outpatient basis &mdash; for tests, treatment etc., when required.</P>
      <P>Within the prison itself a wide range of services are available to these offenders. These include psychiatric and psychological services, welfare and educational services and chaplaincy.  It will be appreicated that members of the prison service itself also have a key role to play in the provision of an appropriate regime for the offenders in question.  In addition to the services outlined, a number of community-based agencies involved with drug addiction problems visit the prison to counsel offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the advent of the AIDS virus presents particular <Col N="1641" /> problems in prisons and methods of dealing with these problems must be kept under continuous review.  A multi-disciplinary team is in place at Mountjoy to assist with this process and to co-ordinate the provision of appropriate services for HIV positive offenders in custody there.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the figures recorded for sexual offences during 1985 and 1986 and the provisional figures for 1987 are as follows: 1985, 339; 1986, 303 (-10.6 per cent); 1987, 348 (+14.8 per cent).</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that all reported incidents of crimes of a sexual nature are fully investigated and that prosecutions ensue in all cases where they are warranted.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission have recently published their Report on Rape and Allied Offences which recommends a number of changes in the existing law. This report is now under urgent consideration in my Department with a view to preparing amending legislation.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental committee, chaired from the Office of the Attorney General, has reported on the legislative steps which may need to be taken to enable Ireland to ratify the United Nations Convenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Arising from this report, it appears that, so far as the Department of Justice is concerned, Article 20 of the Covenant will necessitate legislation to prohibit any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.  Examination of this question is proceeding and any legislative proposals arising from this examination will be announced in the ordinary way in due course.</P>

      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that some reorganisation of the investigation unit attached to the technical bureau has taken place.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>While the gardaí do not, as a matter of course, keep victims informed of developments in the investigation of crimes it does happen, in many cases, that the victim will seek a progress report from the gardaí and this is given to the extent that it is possible to do so without jeopardising the investigation.  In many instances the victim's requirements are covered in informal contact between the victim and members of the Force.  Normally, where an offender is apprehended, the victim is informed and she/he is usually aware of subsequent court development as she/he is generally involved as a witness.  Any proposal to introduce a formal system of keeping every victim informed of developments in his/her case as a matter of course would require examination from the point of view of Garda personnel and other resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to item (b) in Question No. 25, I understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions has invited the Irish <Col N="1648" /> Association for Victim Support to consult with him with a view to seeing what procedures could be devised, within the limits of resources available to him, to ensure that a victim is informed as to the progress of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Legislation would be required to establish a formal system whereby a person convicted of a criminal offence could be ordered to pay compensation to a victim of his crime.  For reasons which have been explained in this House on previous occasions, I could not undertake to indicate, by way of reply to Parliamentary Questions, what specific legislative proposals I might have in a particular area.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to temporary release orders and full temporary release orders made in respect of prisoners for the years 1985 and 1986 is contained in the annual report on Prisons and Places of Detention for those years.  The 1987 report is currently being compiled.  It would not be possible to compile the statistics in relation to the number of temporary release orders made by reference to the length of sentences without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the measures he proposes to take to improve collection procedures for on-the-spot fines for road traffic offences in the light of the large number of uncollected fines in existence and the inability of the Garda to cope with the problem; and in particular, if he will consider the use by the Garda authorities of wheel clamps or the attachment of earnings procedure as possible alternative aid to collection of the fines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group comprising representatives <Col N="1651" /> of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Garda Síochana, has been set up under the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Enforcement of Roads related legislation and is at present reviewing the whole fines-on-the-spot system.  The group has been asked to produce proposals designed to improve the overall effectiveness of the system and is expected to complete its report by Sepember next at the latest.</P>
      <P>It is to be expected that the group will examine means by which the collection of fines might be improved and the desirability of introducing wheel-clamps or other measures will be considered as part of the review.  There is, I believe, a difficulty with the Deputy's suggestion that payment of fines-on-the spot should be secured by attachment of earnings.  Fines on-the-spot simply provide the motorist with the option of paying a prescribed amount as an alternative to prosecution and, accordingly, the amounts in question are not in fact court fines.  However, all possible measures for improving the scheme will be examined and considered for implementation as soon as the working group report comes to hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit continuously from 15 February 1984 and payment was issued to 30 January 1988. Payment was disallowed from 1 February 1988 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable for work.  He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His case was <Col N="1655" /> then referred to an appeals officer for consideration.</P>
      <P>Additional medical evidence was submitted by the person concerned in support of his appeal.  The appeals officer, after consultation with the Department's chief medical adviser has requested a further medical examination in view of this new medical evidence.  This medical examination will take place on Friday, 8 July 1988 and the result of this examination will be referred to the appeals officer concerned for a final decision in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned has been paid disability benefit from June 1985 to date.</P>
      <P>His weekly rate of £90.20 is the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with a dependent spouse and two dependent children.  He is no longer entitled to pay-related benefit.  A deduction of £6 a week is being made to recover the balance of £907.25 which remains from an overpayment of £1,886.02.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of the case shows that benefit has been paid regularly to the person concerned in response to his weekly medical certificates.  Any irregularity in payments has been due to the late arrival of the certificates in the Department.  In fact in recent months payments appear to have issued at weekly intervals with the exception of one payment this month which was delayed as the medical certificate for the week in question was late in arriving.  While every effort is made to process all medical certificates received for payment as soon as possible, disability benefit cheques can only issue when the appropriate weekly <Col N="1656" /> medical certificate is received in the Department.</P>
    <P>All benefits payable to the person concerned have been issued on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity to 13 June 1988, the date on the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <P>To date the number of court proceedings issued for failure to pay rod licences amounts to 63 for the Western Regional Fisheries Board area.  Figures for the cost of each court proceeding are not currently available.  The cost of the court cases and of employing the board's staff will be met from the board's annual budget for 1988 and there will be no additional cost involved.</P>
      <P>The Western Regional Fisheries Board which has primary responsibility for the conservation, development and protection of fisheries in its area arranges for the sale of rod angling licences through a network of distributors throughout its area.  Precise details of sales etc. in 1988 will be supplied, in accordance with established practice, by the board after the end of the angling season.  Because of the widespread location of licence distributors and the difficulty of obtaining reliable comparable data, it has not been the practice for the fisheries boards to make returns on the sales of licences etc. on an ongoing basis during the angling season.</P>
