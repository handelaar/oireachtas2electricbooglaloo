      <P>I wish to inquire from the Taoiseach when Item No. 28 on today's Order Paper will be taken in the House.  This is the Report Stage of the Bankruptcy Bill.  I understand that this matter was last considered by the House in May last year and has not been considered since.  I understand also that the drafting of the legislation in question was initiated by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Justice almost 20 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the many statements the Taoiseach has made both inside and outside this House about the importance of democracy in this House and the importance of the will of the Dáil, may I ask him if he will make a statement this morning as to how he reconciles the statement made by the Minister for Health last night in relation to Barrington's Hospital with the will of this House which voted by a majority vote two weeks ago to keep that hospital open?</P>

      <P>I put down a question in relation to the Ballinora national school in my constituency to ask the Minister for Education if she would allocate funds to match the funds that had been collected by the local community there and you disallowed the question on the basis that it was a repeat of questions that had been asked on 11 February.  The questions you referred to do not relate to my constituency, they do not relate to Cork nor to Munster.  They refer to Mayo, Dublin, Louth, Meath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as I have been in this House it has been the practice for the Chair to allow questions to the Minister for Education in relation to individual schools in individual locations and the funding of them.  I regret very much that you are departing from this.  We have always been allowed this privilege.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire whether there has been a change in policy whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not allowed to answer questions about efforts by the IDA to site industries in particular towns?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As we adjourned last night on this section, I was asking the Minister why he or his advisers considered it inappropriate to include Protocol 84 of the Civil Liability Convention in the legislation which we are now discussing.  It has taken us very many years &mdash; I think 17 if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; to get to the stage we have arrived at today concerning the two Conventions.  What is the reason for the omission of Protocol 84?  It is several years since this Protocol was agreed by our colleagues in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that the Protocol has not been enforced internationally yet and we cannot possibly do it until then.  Section 4 is straightforward, giving the Minister powers to extend the application of the legislation to countries acceding to the Conventions in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ with the interpretation of the Minister of State when he says that other countries have not yet ratified it.  This, to my knowledge, is not so.  I made this point during my Second Stage contribution last December. Let me refer the Minister to what I said concerning Protocol 84 of the Civil Liability Convention.  This was that we were among the last of the nations which sat down at the Brussels International Conference on Marine Pollution in 1969 in the wake of the 1966 <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster and drew up the Civil Liability Convention, to ratify it.  There may be reasons for this not having been done but I ask the Minister to level with me and <Col N="1354" /> with the House.  Probably we shall not get another opportunity for 15 or 20 years to ratify it as it has taken this long to come to the point we are at today in relation to the two Conventions that we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Doyle.  Amendment No. 4 is related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 33 and 34, to delete paragraph (c), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) an owner of a ship which is liable under this section shall not incur any liability for pollution damage otherwise than under this section;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that without this amendment section 7 could be held to bar a plaintiff from proceeding directly against a non-tanker which has caused pollution damage by colliding with a tanker.  The amendment is necesary because of the restrictive definition of a ship in the Convention, which definition has not been incorporated in the Bill we are discussing today.  I hope this amendment is self-explanatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the spirit of this amendment but not the Deputy's <Col N="1355" /> actual wording.  Therefore, we have put down our own amendment, amendment No. 4, which is very similar.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that the liability referred to in subsection (1) (c) is liability for pollution damage.  If this amendment is accepted it will mean that an owner of a ship shall not incur any liability for pollution damage other than under section 7 of the Bill.  We both agree with the necessity for the words &ldquo;for pollution damage&rdquo;.  The advice is that the expression &ldquo;which is liable under this section&rdquo; should not have been included on line 1 of the amendment. However, we accept the spirit of the amendment and we are tabling amendment No. 4 which I believe suffices and, on advice, has the proper wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are probably getting close to agreement but I do not accept that the Government amendment covers fully the point I was making in my amendment. Amendment No. 3 is essential because of the restricted definition of a ship <i>per se</i> in the Convention.  The Minister and his advisers have chosen not to incorporate that specific definition in this Bill.  Why that should be so, I am not sure.  There was much criticism of the Bill as originally initiated because the Government had departed a great deal from the language and terminology used in the Convention.  This is an unusual practice when one of the main purposes of the Bill is to ratify the particular Convention.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain why he decided not to incorporate in this legislation the restrictive definition of a ship as per the Convention and why he feels that his amendment would better serve what I think is the intention of both of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; will be as wide as possible.  The 1984 Act has a very wide definition for the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo;.  We want to be absolutely sure that we are covered by all eventualities.  As a result of Deputy Doyle's amendment we have looked into the matter very closely and the Attorney <Col N="1356" /> General's advice to me is that we should not accept that amendment, although we should accept the spirit of it.  The wording of our amendment No. 4 is &ldquo;after the word `liability' to insert `for pollution damage'.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 35 and 36, to delete paragraph (d), and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" />&ldquo;(d) the servant or agent of the owner of a ship which is liable under this section and is registered in a Convention Country shall not be liable for pollution damage caused by that ship.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The intent behind this amendment is twofold. The immunity from a suit given to the servants or agents of a ship under the Convention need not be extended to ships registered in non-Convention countries. This amendment keeps that benefit from them.  The intent behind the amendment is extremely important and if the Minister feels he could word it in a better way I will be advised by him.  However, I feel very strongly that what the amendment covers and the intention must be catered for in the Bill.  It is only a point of principle but it is most important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking us to insert &ldquo; ... which is liable under this section and is registered in a Convention Country ... &rdquo;.  The converse of that is that a vessel registered in a non-Convention country shall not be liable.  I contend that the Deputy, unintentionally by the use of her wording, would be seeking to apply the Convention to countries which are not party to the Convention and, therefore, not subject to it.  Of those subject to the Convention, the owners will be responsible but, if we accept this wording, the agents or servants of countries who are not party to the Convention could be responsible, which is unacceptable. Many countries are not subject to the Convention, they pass our shores and if one of them was responsible for oil pollution there would be great difficulty in pursuing their servant or agent who was responsible.  We want to pin responsibility on the owner instead of exempting him and making the servant or agent responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objects of the Bill is to enable us to become party to a Civil Liability Convention and a Fund Convention and the intention behind these funds is <Col N="1358" /> to bring about a measure of unification in international maritime law.  If we were to accept this amendment, we would not have unification in international maritime law and, in giving effect to the terms of these Conventions, we are very much bound by the text and provision of the Convention.  The wording of section 7 (1) (d) mirrors the appropriate part of the Civil Liability Convention, 1969, and it would not be acceptable to amend this section as it could exempt the owner from non-Convention countries and holding the servant or agent responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's explanation.  However, this whole vexed area of ships and tankers generally from non-Convention countries, particularly flags of convenience, is not tackled properly by the Bill.  In fact, later on under section 16, amendment No. 11 in my name deals with this again.  It is pertinent to the point I am making here and that is why I draw attention to it.  Under the Bill, a ship registered in a flag of convenience country which is not a party to the Convention &mdash; as the Minister knows, the ships from which, perhaps, we have most to fear are from countries which are not party to the Convention &mdash; would probably not be required to carry any insurance by their home country.  It is unlikely that the law of such a country would generally require it.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that the converse of my amendment would mean an out for some of these countries that we are trying to ensure comply with our requirements in terms of environmental protection from oil damage generally, but there is a general weakness in the Bill in relation to how the law will apply to those countries and ships flying flags of convenience from those countries which are not party to the Convention.  The Minister's reason for rejecting my amendment does not adequately handle that major problem in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot, even by legislation, make it compulsory.  Of course, there is a voluntary arrangement <Col N="1359" /> which will cover these cases.

      <P>In page 8, paragraph (b), line 2, after &ldquo;to do&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;such&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to limit the defence that would be available to a ship owner under the section to cases where another person intended to do the damage which occurred.  I accept that the amendment departs from the wording of the Convention and I am not sure if the Minister is in a position to accept it.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat gratifed by the late conversion of the Minister and his advisers to the necessity to stick to the original wording of the Conventions, a point I made at length on my Second Stage speech.  The Minister, quite rightly, will probably quote it back to me now. <Col N="1360" /> However, in relation to amendments earlier on, I made the point that the Minister does not accept the definition of a ship as per the Convention which could cause problems with this Bill.  He referred to the 1894 Act in relation to the definition of a ship.  There is a lack of consistency in that regard.  Is there any reason for, in certain places, the Minister accepting the precise wording of the Convention and yet, when it suits, departing from it?  I take the Minister's point on the amendment but we either stick to the wording of the Convention or we do not.  We seem to be jumping backwards and forwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, we must stick to the wording of the Convention. However, in this case the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; and its definition is already covered in the 1894 Act.  It is important to retain that definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister completely satisfied that without my suggested amendment or indeed a similar amendment which would have the same intent, there is no possibility a plaintiff may claim his intention was to do other damage than the particular damage he did and thereby escape prosecution?  I fear that the reference on the top of page 8 of the Bill in relation to damage could be interpreted as meaning other damage and not the damage to which we are specifically referring. I accept what the Minister says, that that is the expression precisely from the Convention but with today's legal eagles. that sentence is wide open to different interpretations and could enable people to escape prosecution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>To insert &ldquo;with intent to do such damage&rdquo; instead of our wording, &ldquo;with intent to do damage&rdquo;, would make the provision too restrictive. I must point out to the Deputy that we are bound by the Convention.  If it could be proved that it was intended to do &ldquo;such damage&rdquo; then the individual or company may be only liable for that damage.  &ldquo;Such damage&rdquo; might only cover a bay while damage might be caused to the entire coastline.  It would be creating difficulties <Col N="1361" /> for ourselves to include the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;. The overriding factor is, as the Deputy pointed out, that we should stay as closely as possible to the wording of the Convention. The other reason for rejecting the Deputy's amendment is that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; would make the provision too restrictive.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (c) states, &ldquo;was due wholly to the negligence or wrongful act of any government&rdquo;.  I am slightly concerned about that expression and about the definition of owner in an earlier section.  The Minister will recall the very complicated position that existed in relation to the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> which could still be the source of fruitful litigation if anybody was to state categorically who owned that ship.  That may be an extreme example but we can learn a lot from that case.  The <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> had an owning company and the owning company had a parent company.  There was an operating company which was part of the parent company and that operating company chartered the ship to a charter company. Anybody who would try to define clearly who was the owner of that ship would be brave.  It could be a source of fruitful litigation.  I am not convinced that the reference to owner in an earlier section is sufficient and I do not think the position is clarified in paragraph (c).  Does the Minister, or his advisers, feel that our interests are protected by this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the position of the <i>Amaco Cadiz</i> I should like to tell the Deputy that at all times there is a record on board of the owner.  The owner may lease the ship to a parent company, an operating company or a charter company, but the person whose name is on the record on board is the one responsible, Paragraph (c) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> (c) was due wholly to the negligence or wrongful act of any government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function.</P>
    <P>If the owner of a ship can prove that an incident was due to the negligence referred to in that subsection he will be exempt from liability for pollution damage.  However, this is a matter for the courts to decide.  It is up to the owner to prove that the pollution was due to the failure of the Government or authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or navigational aids.  It is much more than simply stating that the navigational aids were not working.  The owner must make a case and it is left to the courts to decide. In the case of an exemption the fund would pay for preventive measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the points I raised in regard to this section during the course of my Second Stage speech in December.  I made the point that the test which applied under this section for an entitlement to limit liability was the absence of actual fault or privity. As the legal profession will no doubt have advised the Minister, those words have been a fruitful cause of litigation for many years.  However, there is a reference to those words, actual fault or privity, in this and in another section.  If limitation of liability is accepted in principle, which it is, the right to limit should be more or less unbreakable to ensure that certain risks are in fact insurable.  If there was not a right to limit certain risks would be so great that it would not be possible to insure against them.  For that reason the more modern test applied following <Col N="1363" /> recent Conventions is that the entitlement to limit liability should be contingent on the shipowner not committing an act of omission with the intent of causing the damage which gives rise to the liability nor that he or she acted recklessly or with the knowledge that such damage probably would result.</P>
      <P>In December I made the point that some of those issues would be cleared up when we ratified the limitation Convention of 1976.  Has the Minister any news about that Convention?  It is my view that the legal profession must have brought to the Minister's attention the position in regard to those words.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Deputy referred to those words in the course of her Second Stage contribution and we have looked at the provision since then.  The test used in section 10, &ldquo;actual fault or privity&rdquo;, mirrors that contained in the civil liability Convention.  The object of the Bill is <i>inter alia</i> to give effect to the civil liability Convention.  The Bill must not deviate substantially from the provisions of that Convention.  For that reason I must insist on the retention of the &ldquo;actual fault or privity&rdquo; test in this section.  I should like to tell the Deputy that we are working on the general Bill which will implement the Convention on the liability of ship owners and, without giving a definite commitment, it is hoped to bring it before the House this year. We have so much legislation before us at the moment that it is difficult to give a definite date.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1)  For the avoidance of doubt it is declared that pollution damage as defined by this Act is damage done by a ship and section 29 of the Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Act, 1867, section 8 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, and Order 64 of the rules of the Superior Courts, 1986, shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the Court has determined <Col N="1365" /> that a person, who has incurred a liability for pollution damage under section 7, is entitled to limit his liability, and such person has paid into Court a sum of not less than the amount determined by the Court to be the limit of his liability, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Court shall, on application by or on behalf of the owner, order the release of any ship arrested under the Courts admiralty jurisdiction in respect of liability for such pollution damage, or as the case may be, the release of any security given to prevent, or obtain release from, such arrest, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a judgment or decree in relation to any claim for damages for such pollution damage shall not be enforced, except in so far as such judgment or decree relates to cost:</P>
    <P>Provided that the sum so paid into Court, or such part thereof as corresponds to any claim for damages for pollution damage, is available for distribution to the claimant, or would have been so available if the claimant had complied with the provisions of section 12 (5).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section is one of the most pertinent parts of the Bill.  It brings up one of my major objections to the Bill in that there appears to be general confusion between civil and criminal law throughout.  In the long run this will cause major problems for the successful implementation of this legislation and the successful prosecution of any culprits causing oil pollution damage to our shores.</P>
    <P>I have devoted considerable time and effort to making known my views on this section.  I would refer the Minister again to the considerable points I made about this section during my speech on Second Stage last December.  I referred to my grave misgivings about this section, which appears to usurp the role of the Admiralty Marshal.  We would all agree that international maritime law is one of the most confused areas in the legal world generally.  We are doing little to resolve <Col N="1366" /> the existing confusion by adding another layer to the chaos, a layer that cannot be slotted in either at the criminal end or the civil end but is a mixed bag of both.</P>
    <P>The new section I propose is designed to remove any doubt as to the right to arrest a ship in a civil action for oil pollution damage.  In most countries the right is similarly reinforced by statute.  I must underline this point that what I am doing by way of this amendment is intended to bring us into line with those other countries which make this provision by statute.  If we do not accept this amendment we will be out of line with most civilised developed countries.</P>
    <P>The process of arrest is carried out by the admiralty marshal under the rules of court referred to in the amendment.  The procedure contains important safeguards for the ship owner in that the plaintiff must swear an affidavit and may prevent the arrest or secure the immediate release of the ship by lodging adequate money in court.  The plaintiff, for his part, enjoys the security of the money so lodged and from the date of entry into force of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) (No. 2) Bill the plaintiff will be able to arrest the ship anywhere in Europe.  I think I am correct in referring to that legislation as a Bill but it should be only a matter of weeks before it is enacted. Under its terms it will be possible to arrest sister ships, those ships in the same ownership as the ship causing pollution. This changes the scenario slightly from what we were discussing in December as the legislation to which I am referring had not then been passed by this House.</P>
    <P>Are we discussing the section 13 (1) or the entire amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing section 13 and in particular amendment No. 8.  The acceptance of the amendment will involve the deletion of a number of sections such as 13, 34 and 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 (2), as amended, would clarify that the arrest is under the courts' admiralty jurisdiction and it ensures by the insertion of the word <Col N="1367" />&ldquo;such&rdquo; in two places that the release to be secured under the section is limited to arrest for pollution damage for which security has been given.  The addition of the reference to subsection (5) of section 12 is to direct claimants to the specific part of section 12 which affects them.  The provisions of section 12 (5) need to be highlighted because although they are necessary under the Convention they represent an important abridgement of a claimant's rights in that he must bring his action within six years of the pollution incident and within three years of the damage.  The existing law allows six years from the date of damage in those cases where he can prove fault on the part of the captain or crew.  Once the new Bill on the jurisdiction of courts and enforcement of judgments is enacted the old limitation periods will only apply when the claimant can prove fault on the part of the ship owner himself.</P>
      <P>Without unduly detaining the House, I would refer to the procedures concerning the admiralty marshal which would be usurped if the Bill remained unamended at this section.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is one of the few which I feel I must press.  The whole essence of the Bill could be changed if we do not get this section right.  I am interested in getting the Bill right rather than in provoking contention.  We need to clarify our views today rather than on Report Stage since so many other sections depend on this decision.  Perhaps the more prudent thing would be to resolve the matter now rather than wait until Report Stage.  I will be advised by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is an extremely important section and Deputy Doyle suggests that if it is not amended we will be out of line with other countries, that other countries such as the UK would use the Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Act to arrest rather than this Bill when it is enacted.  The Bill does not rule out operating under the Admiralty Marshal procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a confusing Bill. On Committee Stage we try to tease out in plain man's language how precisely to deal with these cases.  My immediate fear is that if we arrest under the Act referred to by the Deputy &mdash; the Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Act &mdash; that system would be much too slow and cumbersome.  We have got to have legislation whereby we can act speedily.  If we look at a hypothetical situation, if we have a serious problem off our coast we must be able to act speedily rather than have the plaintiff swear an affidavit which would include certain specified information.  If the High Court is satisfied that the plaintiff has a case made out on affidavit, and that the action is a proper one in respect of which an arrest can be effected, it will order the immediate arrest of the vessel in question. The arrest could not take place immediately.  It could happen late on a Friday evening.  There could be a question of getting a High Court judge and there could be sufficient time for the ship to leave the jurisdiction.  If we operate under this section we can act immediately.</P>
      <P>The other procedure which we have operated under the 1867 Act is much too slow and too cumbersome.  It necessitates going to the courts and swearing affidavits. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that we can act as expeditiously as possible.  We will be referring later to those who have powers to stop or detain a ship.  They will be there in a very short time and will be in a position to detain a ship whereas if we were to use the Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Act it would take much longer.  We want to have legislation in place that will ensure an immediate detention.  I believe, and the advice available to me is, that this is the way we should operate rather than in a slow and cumbersome way.  The knock-on effects of operating under the other system would be much too serious and could be too damaging for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take issue with the Minister when he said that my proposed <Col N="1369" /> amendment and the procedures contained therin under the Courts of Admiralty (Ireland) Act would be too long and would not allow us to have fairly immediate powers of detention in relation to any ship which caused pollution damage.  In section 2 a very long convoluted procedure is involved to which I draw the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>More important, perhaps, is the whole area of the spirit of the Civil Liability Convention.  This power to stop or detain a ship for a civil misdemeamour was not explicitly part of the Convention.  I believe it is contrary to the spirit of the Civil Liability Convention.  If you read the Convention carefully &mdash; which I took the trouble to do &mdash; it is clear that what is envisaged is that a ship incurring liability for pollution damage might be arrested by the Admiralty Marshal of the High Court under existing maritime law.  I draw the Minister's attention to the Convention which was quoted back to me this morning &mdash; we have to stay within the terms of the Convention and the spirit of the Convention and quite rightly when I attempted to depart from it with an amendment or two for different reasons.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister is trying to depart rather more seriously than any of my previous amendments may have from the Convention.  In fact, this section is the very essence of what this Bill is all about. It is the confusion between civil law and criminal law which compounds the difficulty of what we are discussing.  I have no objection to what is being achieved under the detention provisions of section 16, where those who do not have the required insurance can be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 is unworkable.  There is a time element involved in bringing it to court which the Minister has denied.  The Minister said that what I have suggested would be more cumbersome in terms of getting people to court.  I do not accept that primarily because the procedure I am requesting the Minister to accept in my amendment is well tried and tested and is part of international maritime law rather than now bringing another layer into a confused legal situation.  I am <Col N="1370" /> asking the Minister to allow us to adhere to the existing situation that has been accepted by the IMO.  I am advised that the IMO could find us in breach of the CLC if we do not resolve the difficulties which are so apparent in section 13 which my amendment tries to resolve.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take on board my amendment.  I feel it is extremely important.  The existing maritime law provides many safeguards procedurally for the ship owner.  We are talking about a civil action and not a criminal action, so we need not apologise for trying to keep reasonable safeguards for a ship owner in this case.  The existing situation is a powerful weapon in getting a ship owner who has caused oil pollution damage from an oil tanker carrying more than 2,000 tonnes of fuel oil to appear before the court.</P>
    <P>The suggested amendment would allow the ship to be arrested by the Admiralty Marshal in accordance with accepted international law.  That is essential and I ask the Minister to consider it. I must stick on this point as it is so essential to what the Bill is all about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that the text of the Bill was cleared with the secretariat of the oil compensation fund. I would also like to point out that by creating these new measures, which I agree are necessary so that we can act as expeditiously as possible, we are not usurping the existing powers of the Admiralty Marshal.  The admiralty division of the High Court, being the successor to the Court of Admiralty, will continue to have jurisdiction over any claims for damage received or done by any ship.  By using the procedure under the Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Acts it will be necessary as well to nail a warrant to the mast of the ship and that can create difficulties.  While Deputy Doyle may feel very strongly about her amendment I feel equally strongly that to accept the amendment put down by her would unintentionally result in delays and create difficulties.  I regret that while the Deputy feels very strongly I feel equally strongly <Col N="1371" /> that we must retain the wording which we have in the Bill and I cannot accept her amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point on at least two occasions this morning that this Bill is fundamentally flawed because of the confusion between criminal and civil matters.  In the first part of the Bill we face up to this matter.  To try to amend that major flaw by amendment is unsatisfactory. We are trying to improve the situation without resolving it.  Certain sections should be redrafted altogether. I have tried to do this on section 13. Without abandoning detention provisions in civil matters it is very hard to amend it satisfactorily.  I am convinced that the amendment I have proposed on section 13 goes as close as we will be able to go to resolve this dilemma.  This Bill must dovetail into existing maritime law. It cannot just create a new layer of law above the existing confusion which everyone involved in legal circles accepts is here.  For the reasons I have outlined in detail on Second Stage and also this morning, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my officials, have considered this matter in great detail.  If we were to accept this amendment there are other sections which would fall &mdash; sections 34 and 35.  At the expense of repeating myself, I believe the only way we could act as expeditiously as possible in the event of an incident such as this occurring is under the proposed new regulations and not under the Court of Admirality Act which Deputy Doyle has referred to.  Having given very long and serious consideration to this matter I have to say that we cannot accept the amendment because it would create difficulties for us in the future.  We must ensure that the best wording is inserted so that we would be able to act immediately. The Deputy's amendment will be slow and cumbersome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must disagree completely with what the Minister of <Col N="1372" /> State has said in relation to my amendment being slower and more cumbersome than what is being proposed in the Bill.  Indeed, any of us would be very brave if we were to stand up and say that most legal procedures were not as slow and cumbersome in any event but I contend that what the Minister of State is proposing would be far slower and more cumbersome and be fruitful from a litigation point of view than going down the path of existing and well tried, if cumbersome, maritime law procedures.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware one of the main purposes of the Bill is to ensure the compulsory insurance of any oil tanker in our waters.  We are in agreement on that and with the intent.  If an oil pollution accident occurs and if the tanker is insured could the Minister tell us in what circumstances under section 13 an inspector or harbour master would be entitled to detain the ship and here I am talking about a civil action?  If he has an insurance certificate and everything is in order in terms of his liability and insurance cover in what circumstances would we be entitled to detain the ship? I am talking about a civil case and not a criminal case &mdash; they are quite different.</P>
      <P>I contend that the Minister could detain a ship indefinitely as the procedure for court determination of the entitlement to limit liability could last for months under the proposed section.  Notwithstanding the fact that the owner or captain of the ship or tanker endeavours to comply entirely with the law and complies with the navigational requirements of our country, if his insurance certificate is in order and he is properly covered and a serious pollution incident occurs why would the Minister want to detain that ship and what would he gain by detaining it?  Under what circumstances would the Minister release the ship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If such an incident occurred the need, as I said on Second Stage, to detain the ship would be for security purposes.  Immediately the ship is detained the onus to go to the High Court would be on the owner and not on the State or on the agent acting on behalf <Col N="1373" /> of the State, be it a harbour master or an inspector.  This matter would be covered under subsection (2) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>the Court, shall on application by or on behalf of the owner, order the release of any ship detained under this section in respect of any liability for pollution damage, or, as the case may be, the release of any security given to prevent, or obtain release from, such arrest</P>
      <P>If an incident such as the one the Deputy referred to occurs and if everything is in order the onus to go to the High Court would be on the owner.  If the court decides that the ship should be released it will be released.  It is only right and proper that the onus should be on the owner of the ship rather than on ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that the legal procedure for proving your entitlement to limit liability would take months and not weeks.  I hope the Minister of State will agree with me that that is the practice as of now.  That is what he is suggesting has to be done.  I contend that we must use existing established maritime law practices in relation to the arrest of any ship and the Minister of State is contending that my amendment would be cumbersome legally and take too long. That just does not add up.  The practice which the Minister of State is now saying must be introduced, of the ship owner taking a High Court action to establish his entitlement to limit his liability, is likely to take months.  If it is just a matter of the High Court inspecting his insurance certificate surely there is no need to arrest him at all.  If his documents are in order, his liability is abundantly clear and if, through a genuine accident an oil pollution incident occurs which costs the State dearly, what is to be determined by going to court if it is only a matter for the High Court judge after looking through the documents to say everything is in order and that the ship can be released?  As the Minister will have the insurance certificate before him <Col N="1374" /> what would he achieve by arresting a ship in civil cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to act under the existing legislation it would first and foremost be a matter of obtaining sworn affidavits which would include specified information.  When it comes to the stage of placing a warrant on the master of the ship it could be slow and cumbersome and could take far too long whereas our wording would ensure that the ship could be detained immediately and be detained until such time as the owner goes to court.  There is an obligation on us to protect our coastline.  Our first obligation is to our own State.  If a ship is responsible for a serious oil pollution problem off our coast I could not foresee that within a matter of hours the master of the ship would be taken ashore and the problems resolved within a short period.  It would not be as simple as that. There is an obligation on us to protect our environment.</P>
      <P>When I say slow and cumbersome I am referring to the detention period.  It could take some time to go to the High Court to obtain a warrant for the detention of the ship.  That could take some time and difficulties could be created at that stage. Certainly, it could be amended some time in the future.  Of course, the Bill does not rule out operating under the Admiralty Marshal procedure and we are not usurping the existing powers of the Admiralty Marshal.  The admiralty division of the High Court will continue to have jurisdiction over any claims for damage received by or done by the ship. I still contend that section 13 as it stands, apart from amendment No. 9 in the name of the Minister, should stand and that it is in our best interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being slightly mischievous in suggesting that my amendment or anything I have said would indicate that I was not interested in protecting the environment of this country or of our coastline.  I am interested in clarifying in section 13 that there is a complete difference between criminal and civil liability in relation to this awful problem of oil pollution which we have <Col N="1375" /> already had to face in this country.  I started out by saying, and I would remind the Minister, that it is quite possible for the IMO to find us in breach of the Civil Liability Convention in relation to the provisions of section 13.</P>
      <P>If one of the main purposes of our discussion here this morning is to ratify that Convention, any possible challenge to what we are doing, or any possible suggestion that we would be in breach of that Convention must be taken very seriously indeed.  My point is that if we arrest the ship under the powers the Minister is proposing in section 13 or if we arrest the ship under the powers I am proposing in my amendment to section 13, at the end of the day we have to ensure that the damage done will be paid for by the polluter.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to introduce another layer of confusion into international maritime law which we all know is in an appalling mess at the moment. All the different countries are trying to tie it together and to get international agreement that will resolve existing difficulties in this area.  I have yet to get an explanation from the Minister as to why we have chosen to take a different route from that taken in other countries that have ratified the Convention we are trying to ratify this morning, and why the Minister choses to further confuse the whole civil and criminal area.  We are talking about the High Court and the District Court with its criminal powers in some cases.  The whole issue is totally confused.  I have yet to have an explanation as to why we must be out of step with the rest of the countries that have ratified the Convention.</P>

      <P>I am not being mischievous. I agree that we all have the one objective, to implement the best possible legislation.  I am not putting in place another layer of confusion.  Perhaps the <Col N="1376" /> other countries will come to believe that we have the right legislation and they may follow us in that area.  The fact that all the other countries follow the Court of Admiralty Act does not necessarily mean that we should follow them.  We have many years of experience since this was first ratified in other member states. We have ten years of experience since it was ratified in the UK in October 1978. This experience is of great benefit to us. On that basis I still contend that the legislation which we propose is the best legislation. I say that not just from my own opinion but on the advice of the advisers and the Attorney General.</P>

I would remind the Minister that only ten minutes ago he aspired to Ireland doing its bit in relation to uniformity in international maritime law.  Now the Minister is suggesting that perhaps we should be out of step and should ask the rest to join us.  We cannot have it both ways.  There is enough confusion at the moment without us adding to it.  In this section and in other sections we are confusing civil and criminal law. We are adding another layer to a very difficult situation.  We should pass legislation in this area which would dovetail with existing accepted international maritime practices, particularly as we are an island nation with a very vulnerable coastline.  It is most important that we get our act in order in relation to it.  I must reject the Minister's explanation. Although I accept that what we both intend to do is to get the best protection for our coastline, we must disagree on the method of getting that.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 21 to 27, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Without prejudice to any power to detain a ship contained in any enactment, an inspector may stop or detain a ship in any harbour in the State or wherever such ship may be in the State, or a harbour-master may detain a ship in his harbour, if it appears to the inspector or, as the case may be, the harbour-master, that the owner of the ship has incurred a liability under section 7 for pollution damage caused by any ship which he owns.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 9 is to correct the positioning of certain words which were transposed during the printing of the Bill.  In page 11, subsection (1), line 23 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, the words &ldquo;or a harbour-master may detain a ship in his harbour&rdquo; appear. These words should be included after the second reference to State in line 24.  This may be done in the new subsection (1). The change does not affect the intended meaning of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister's amendment clarifies that an inspector may detain a ship in any place in the State and a harbour-master may detain a ship in his harbour.  However, there are still some objections to retaining the section. As we have said, there is already a procedure in place for arresting ships.  This offers safeguards to both parties and is recognised in maritime law internationally. The Admiralty procedure will shortly be available throughout Europe for damage suffered in Ireland.  Secondly, the new procedure will create difficulties when Ireland attempts to ratify the international Convention relating to the arrest of seagoing ships.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to that and to ask him to indicate when we will ratify that Convention and whether he considers it the right course of action for us to be enacting this legislation with the knowledge that it will need immediate amendment when ratification of the Convention comes before the House.  Thirdly, with the ratification of the arrest Convention, the Admiralty procedure will be available internationally, at least in Convention countries, for damage suffered in Ireland.  Fourthly, the section, taken together with sections 34 and 35, appears to be penal in that it invokes the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
      <P>I have referred under other sections to the confusion throughout the Bill between criminal law and civil law and criminal matters and civil matters and this arises here again.  A ship which incurs civil liability under the Bill may have committed no offence of any kind and being fully insured may not be in contravention of the Convention and, liability under the Bill being strict, she may not even be at fault in the law of tort.  A district justice would have no choice but to release the ship without any security &mdash; I emphasise that &mdash; for the State. The section is against the spirit of the Convention in that there is no provision to launch a caveat in order to prevent arrest or detention, as appears to be envisaged by Article 6 (1) (b) of the Convention. I would like to draw the Minster's attention particularly to that article in the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is radical in that it involves State officials in civil disputes between citizens.  A ship owner might, after all, be Irish.  It also leaves inspectors and <Col N="1381" /> harbour-masters open to claims for damage in cases where plaintiffs have been unable to obtain compensation because the ship was not detained.  Finally, there could be practical difficulties. A harbour-master in, say, Dublin could be asked by an aggrieved party to detain a ship suspected of pollution in, say, Bantry Bay.  I contend that the harbour-master would not be in a position to make an on-the-spot judgment in relation to pollution that might have occurred outside his immediate area of jurisdiction.  After all, a harbour-master is confined to matters within his own harbour.  Those are very important points in relation to the Minister's amendment which must be taken as real objections to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The harbour-master, as defined in the Act, will have responsibility within his own harbour only.  He cannot go to any other harbour and detain a ship.  He is responsible for his own harbour only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstood me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The harbour-master could be approached by a harbour authority in another area or he could be appointed by the harbour authority to act as a harbour-master for the purpose of this Act.  The harbour authority can appoint the inspector under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  People covered under that Act include inspectors, any officer appointed by the Minister, a member of the Defence Forces, a member of the Garda Síochána and every member of the Customs and Excise authorised on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners. They can act in any part of the State whereas the harbour-master can act in his own harbour only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards civil and criminal law it only becomes a criminal offence when a vessel which is detained tries to leave the port without clearance from the High Court. If that happens the inspector or harbour master, under section 34, should obtain an order from the District Court allowing the ship to be detained for a further 48 <Col N="1382" /> hours.  In that case it becomes a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Whether it is under this legislation or the original Act of the Court of Admiralty, I think both Deputy Doyle and I are going down the same road.  After the initial detention by the harbour-master or inspector or, in the case of the Court of Admiralty the arrest as a result of the warrant from the High Court, I think both Deputy Doyle and I are mostly in agreement and in this case the system is the same.  We are not usurping the existing powers of the Admiralty Marshal and the Admiralty Division of the High Court will continue to have jurisdiction over any claims.  As I said, apart from the initial detention in my case and arrest in the case of Deputy Doyle, the system will be much the same.  Either way we must ensure that we act in the best interests of the State and I believe the best way to do that is by acting immediately.  There will be no criminal offence until such time as the vessel might try to leave this jurisdiction after being detained by an inspector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to an Irish inspector detaining an Irish vessel, or any vessel.  All those officers covered by the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 &mdash; officers, inspectors, harbour masters and so on &mdash; will have guidelines laid down in the Bill which gives powers to harbour masters and inspectors.  I do not see any difficulty there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister addressed one of the points I raised in relation to my objection to the retention of this section. Could we deal with the points I raised individually as there was quite a long list? One of the most important points I made was that the new procedure the Minister is suggesting will create difficulties when Ireland attempts to ratify the international convention relating to the arrest of seagoing ships as we are bound to do within three years under Article 36 of the Third Schedule to the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) (No. 2) Bill which passed through the Dáil and the Seanad last week.  That means within <Col N="1383" /> three weeks of the enactment of legislation which passed through these Houses last week we must ratify this convention. What the Minister is suggesting means we will either have to amend the existing legislation at that time or not ratify the Convention.  I do not understand what the Minister wishes to do in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the Minister who brought that legislation through both Houses last week.  That legislation will not be effective until 1 June 1988 at the earliest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years from 1 June the Minister will still have to answer my questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that this is in order and will not create any difficulties as far as arrests or detentions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I disagree and I ask the Minister to look at this again.  My legal advice from maritime quarters &mdash; I do not say this lightly nor do I pretend to be privy to this knowledge &mdash; is that when we come to ratify the international convention relating to the arrest of seagoing ships we will have major difficulties if we enact what the Minister is now suggesting.  Now is the time to resolve these difficulties without necessitating the Bill coming back to the House for further amendment when the time comes to ratify it.  Because of the passage of the Bill through both Houses last week, we have a time limit, three years from 1 June, when we will have to ratify that Convention.  We have already been told there will be difficulties because of what we intend to do in this legislation. Would it not be prudent to resolve those difficulties now rather than have to come back to the House in a few years to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice from the Attorney General is that it will not create any difficulties and that we are in order <Col N="1384" /> to pursue this line and enact the legislation that is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I would have to disagree with the Minister.  There were various other points I raised to which I would like to hear the Minister's response.  With ratification of the arrest convention, the admiralty procedure will be available internationally policing Convention countries for damage suffered in Ireland.  Bearing that in mind, does it make sense to pursue this section, even with the Minister's amendment, and bearing in mind what I said about my amendment which has been defeated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Because most of the other convention countries pursue the Admiralty Marshal line that does not mean we should pursue it.  We have studied this very carefully and I believe some of the other countries will be looking very closely at our legislation which is the result of many years experience.  I expect other countries may be following our line in establishing the most expeditious way of detaining.  I do not see any great difference in the line I have taken and that being taken by Deputy Doyle, apart from initial detention <i>versus</i> arrest.  Outside that point, we are going down the same road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister some information to which the rest of us are not privy when he says other countries who have ratified the civil liability Convention might be changing their statutes to come in line with what he is proposing under section 13?  Has he any reason for making that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not.  This is a personal opinion.  The fact is we look at legislation in other countries and I have no doubt they will look at our legislation. It is common sense that other countries would look at our legislation and they could well opt for it.  Of course, that is a matter for each individual country.  All we can do is look at their legislation and <Col N="1385" /> its effectiveness.  It is our opinion that ours is the correct legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to tease that out with the Minister seeing that it is possible he would have had it indicated to him that what he is now proposing would have some beneficial effects.  My information is that we will be totally out of step with all the other countries that have ratified this Convention if we proceed as the Minister suggests under section 13.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister again that his aspiration and mine is that anything we do in relation to this legislation and any other that may come before the House should be in the interests of unifying international maritime law rather than adding further layers of difficulty to the procedures which we appear to be doing today.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister's amendment to section 13 clarifies the position, that an inspector may detain a ship in any place in the State and a harbour master may detain a ship in his harbour.  The Minister will recall that, when we discussed the whole involvement of a harbour master the last day on section 3 &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; I indicated my intention to move a further amendment in relation to this on Report Stage.  I raise that now lest by not referring to it the Minister is under the impression that I am in any way accepting the role of harbour master in all of this, which I am not.  I indicated quite clearly the last day why I had difficulties and why it is my opinion that anywhere there is reference to harbour master it should be substituted by the insertion of the words &ldquo;officer of customs&rdquo;.  We will go through that again another day but it is necessary as a clarification exercise in our discussions today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On further consideration I cannot accept the explanation which we discussed on a previous occasion, that in relation to the Consolidation Act of 1959, an inspector, by definition, can include an officer of customs.  Not all inspectors are designated officers of customs by the Revenue Commissioners <i>de facto</i>, so there is a difficulty there which will need <Col N="1386" /> to be clarified for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Taking what is before us here today, as it stands the Minister's amendment will clarify that an inspector may detain a ship in any place in the State and a harbour-master may detain a ship in his harbour.</P>
    <P>When the Minister last responded to my points of objection to his amendment, the first point he took up was the eighth point I had raised concerning practical difficulties.  For example, a harbour-master in, say, Dublin could be asked by an aggrieved party to detain a ship suspected of pollution somewhere else, say, in Bantry Bay.  The Dublin harbour-master would have jurisdiction only within Dublin harbour.  Yet, in accordance with the Bill before us and the Minister's proposed amendment, there could be a request from the authorities in, say, Bantry that the Dublin harbour-master detain a ship if they had not, for whatever reason, or it had passed by before the pollution incident was recognised.  Yet, a Dublin harbour-master who has jurisdiction only for, say, Dublin Bay and harbour perhaps would not be in a position to judge whether he should proceed as per the provisions of section 13 with the arrest of the ship alleged to have caused a pollution incident somewhere outside his jurisdiction.  That is the practical difficulty that will arise immediately from the provisions of this section and the Minister's amendment.  I put it to the Minister that that warrants reconsideration as the Dublin harbour-master, in that example, would be placed in an impossible position.  He would literally have to make up his mind what might or might not have happened without having actually seen the evidence of the alleged incident.</P>
    <P>I made the point also &mdash; and the Minister did not respond to it &mdash; that there is already in place a procedure for arresting ships which offers safeguards to both parties and is recognised in maritime law internationally.  We discussed it on my previous amendment which was defeated.  I fail to understand why the Minister does not accept that procedure. I do not agree with the Minister's contention <Col N="1387" /> that it would take longer to process through the courts than the Minister's proposal, accepting, however, that most legal actions can take what to the layman may seem an interminable length of time to resolve anyway.  Therefore, when we speak about litigation and cumbersome proceedings, we cannot be too dictatorial in this area.  But, on the evidence, there is no reason my suggested procedure &mdash; because it has been tried and tested internationally for so long &mdash; should not be less cumbersome than the new procedure the Minister suggests with all its inherent difficulties and potential for litigation because it is untried and untested.</P>
    <P>I also made the point in relation to my objections to the Minister's amendment to this section that the provisions of the section are against the spirit of the convention. The Minister constantly reminds me that our discussion here this morning is all about the Convention.  I accept that. However, it is my contention that this section is against the spirit of the Convention. There is no provision to lodge a caveat in order to prevent arrest or detention as appears to be envisaged by Article 6 (1) (b) of the Convention.</P>
    <P>We are getting down to the essential points of what the provisions of this Bill are all about.  We are here to ratify these couple of conventions.  If you like, we are here to get our act in order with international maritime Acts generally so that we can ratify these international conventions. Yet, on the key section of the Bill, we forego our aspirations for a unified maritime law and decide to go it alone, taking a line that no other country that has heretofore ratified this Convention has chosen.  The Minister suggests that other countries might follow us.  Yet, when I question him, he says that is just a personal opinion, that he has had no indication that they will.  My personal opinion is that they will not, that they will proceed along the lines of procedures that have long since been tried and tested involving the Admiralty <Col N="1388" /> Marshal.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation as to why we should depart from that practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's first and last points together and deal with the question of the advice available to her.  The advice available to me from the Attorney General is that we are introducing the best possible requisite legislation. We appear to be travelling the same road except in relation to detention. The essential difference between us is this: Deputy Doyle is suggesting that we should use the system which has been in place to date.  I should point out that it could take some 48 hours or even more, at least 24 hours, to get the necessary affidavits to ensure that the High Court is satisfied that a plaintiff has a case made out on affidavit and that the action is a proper one in respect of which an arrest can be effected, when the High Court will order the immediate arrest of the vessel concerned.  The difference is that an inspector or harbour-master can &mdash; working within the guidelines set out in the Bill &mdash; immediately detain a vessel. Then it is a matter for the owner of a vessel to go to the High Court to try to secure its release.</P>
      <P>It is the immediate detention about which I feel very strongly.  After that, it goes to the High Court, will be dealt with by the High Court and the Court of Admiralty.  These functions are now exercised by the admiralty division of the High Court.  They will have jurisdiction over any claims for any damage occasioned or done by any ship whether within a country or without.  It appears that, by and large, the Deputy and I agree except in relation to the initial arrest or detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the arresting of ships and the involvement of a harbour master, I should say that a harbour master is responsible for his harbour and should not be asked to go to any other.  We must remember also that we are talking about vessels carrying in excess of 2,000 tonnes. There are only a number of harbours in the country such vessels could enter.  Of course, there could be a question of a <Col N="1389" /> spillage, say, off the west coast which would not be near any major harbour or where there would be no harbour masters located.  We want to ensure that there are as many inspectors as possible available.</P>
    <P>Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act there is provision for quite a broad range of such people, all of whom could be appointed inspectors, all of the Garda, the Army, those Customs and Excise officers appointed by the Revenue Commissioners at every reasonably-sized port this type of vessel would enter.  There would be a Customs and Excise official there whom I presume would have power to detain a vessel.  Therefore, I do not foresee any difficulty in that regard. Rather I see our proposal easing the problem, ensuring that there will be as many officials and inspectors as possible available.  They will be available at very short notice whereas, if it were necessary to go to the High Court with affidavits, obtain a warrant, nail the warrant to the mast, we could lose vital time because those 24, 48 or 72 hours could be critical.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I am insisting that this method &mdash; while it may not be in operation in all other countries &mdash; is a better one.  While the advice available to Deputy Doyle suggests we will be out of line with all other countries, I fail to see how other legislation can be equal to or better than that we are now proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We do seem to have a very serious, fundamental disagreement in relation to the procedures to be taken at the point of arrest.  I should like to pose a specific question to the Minister: what is to prevent a shipowner, as per the rules of court, from lodging a caveat under the system the Minister proposes and thereby delaying the procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our system the onus is on the owner to pursue this in the courts.  The onus is not on the inspector or the harbour master.  Immediately he is detained the owner will have to go to the High Court and it will be a matter then for the courts to decide whether he should be detained for a further <Col N="1390" /> period or released.  If everything is in order, as was referred to by Deputy Doyle earlier, the High Court could possibly decide on his release.  This would take the normal course whereby claims would be lodged against the company and it would be pursued in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Minister the eight difficulties I have with this section.  It appears this is the major point on which we have disagreement.  I cannot agree with him on it.  There are a few points I should like him to clarify for me.</P>
      <P>This section is radical in that it involves State officials in civil disputes.  I should like the Minister to comment on this.  To my knowledge this is the first time we have introduced this provision in any legislation.  I do not condemn it for being radical but when we are being radical in involving the Civil Service and public service I think it needs an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with being radical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why we should be conservative in any way and, indeed, the Convention is radical. The reason State officials would be involved here is that the State officials to whom I have referred under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act would be available at very short notice.  If it is radical then I think the reason is that we want to ensure that there are officials or inspectors available at very short notice to detain a ship. If that is radical I accept that, but I think it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, this is the first time we have involved State officials in civil disputes.  It is a major step forward because once you create a precedent it can be referred to in subsequent legislation.  We have to be quite clear about what we are doing.  I suggest that the intention in this section was not to be radical in this way.  We are <i>per se</i> being radical in what we are <Col N="1391" /> discussing, and perhaps in what will be enacted, but are we fully aware of the precedent we are creating and the implications for officials of the State generally and the implications for future legislation?</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to comment in relation to the problem with this section and the spirit of the Civil Liability Convention.  Could we be open to the charge of being in breach of the Convention? I think we could and I should like the Minister to indicate to me why he obviously feels this will not be so &mdash; I assume that if he felt it would be so he would not be proceeding with it &mdash; and whether he has studied the Convention and, in particular, Article 6 (1) (b) where there is no provision to lodge a caveat in order to prevent arrest or detention as appears to be envisaged.  These are most important aspects and, as I said before, the whole thrust of the Bill is based on getting this section in place properly.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of State officials being involved in this, we realise the absolute necessity of this and, at the expense of repeating myself, once more, if we do not have such officials and inspectors available to us to detain these ships then I think we will be taking a very retrograde step.  I am interested in what is happening in other countries but I am more interested in ensuring that the legislation which we are bringing before this House &mdash; and which, it is hoped, will be enacted in the near future, including section 13 &mdash; is the best possible legislation available to us. Having studied Article 6 (1) (b) and having obtained advice from the Attorney General, I am satisfied that we are not in breach of the Convention.  The Deputy referred to the knock-on effects of having State officials involved in civil disputes.  All of this has been looked at and we are satisfied that the legislation being put in place, apart from amendments Nos. 9 and 10 to this section, is the best possible legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (3), lines 48 and 49, to delete &ldquo;the master of the ship shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the owner and the master of the ship shall each be guilty of an offence and the ship may, without prejudice to subsection (1), be detained, or be further detained, by an inspector anywhere in the State, or by a harbour-master in his harbour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 has been brought forward on the advice of the Attorney General.  The effect of it is to make the owner and master of the ship detained under this section guilty of an offence if the ship leaves or attempts to leave any harbour or any other place otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  The amendment also provides that the ship may be further detained if it attempts to leave any place in the State after being stopped and detained if it appears that the owner of that ship incurred a liability for pollution damage. This is where we go on to the question of going to the District Court.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that this section would have been entirely unnecessary if he had accepted my amendment No. 8.  I do not oppose the principle of this section in itself but if the Minister had accepted amendment No. 8 he could have deleted <Col N="1393" /> this because what I proposed in amendment No. 8 was that disregard of any Admiralty Marshal's warrant would be contempt of court by the master of a ship and punishable accordingly.  Therefore, what we are now talking about would have been unnecessary.</P>
      <P>This adds further strength to my argument that as the Minister intends to proceed under section 13 is incorrect.  Under the admiralty procedure which I proposed, a ship could be rearrested even in places abroad.  I have no difficulty with the Minister's proposed amendment but acceptance of my amendment No. 8 would have made this amendment unnecessary and further strengthens my case for the admiralty procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify the reason behind this lest my not responding would be an admission &mdash; that is not the case.  In the event of a vessel having being detained by a harbour-master, inspector or official and trying to leave the harbour or trying to leave the jurisdiction then section 13 provides that the harbour-master or official may go to the District Court to have the ship detained for a further 48 hours.  If we pursued Deputy Doyle's line it would mean that within those 48 hours of the initial detention we would have to go to the High Court, rather than the harbour-master and the officials having the power.  Within those 48 hours and, therefore, before the warrant would be in place, the vessel could have left, thus committing no offence. In that case we would have no powers whatsoever at that stage.  The section is to ensure that if the ship tries to leave, after having been detained, that we can go immediately to the District Court and have it detained for another 48 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says does not follow in practice, as he probably knows well.  Any ship or tanker in ports or harbours within our jurisdiction can be boarded by the relevant officials, usually officers of customs, for the purpose of ascertaining whether all the documentation is right.  I had envisaged the officer of customs also inspecting the <Col N="1394" /> insurance certificate or insurance bonding position.  If that were in order on inspection and even if the ship's captain then runs from the harbour, as it were, we have a fallback.  We have no major difficulty in claiming compensation for any damage done, providing his insurance certificate is in order.  If, on inspection by the officer of customs, that insurance certificate is found not to be in order it is a criminal offence if pollution occurs and the captain can be arrested under section 16, which we have not yet reached, but which I fully support.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's contention that what I am saying would delay the possible arrest of someone who might have run from the country.  That is not so.  Under the procedure we now have the officer of customs goes on board anyway if a boat is in port or in harbour in Irish jurisdiction and can check the documents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the documents are in order and there is no question of pollution it would be ludicrous to have legislation that the ship could not be released.  This leaves a situation whereby an official can check all the documents that should be on board a ship and if everything is in order there is no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the impression that we are at cross purposes at present.  The Minister expressed the fear that under what I was suggesting a boat or tanker could leave port or harbour, having committed some pollution incident, and if they had gone before the arrest procedures were put in place we would have no redress.  I am talking about the case of where there has been a pollution incident. <Col N="1395" /> We are really concerned about this. Where there has not been a pollution incident, and we are stating that the insurance documents must be in order, the procedures we are discussing for sorting that out are fairly acceptable.  The main problem is where there has been a pollution incident, where a case will have to be proved and must go to the courts. Any ship or tanker in our ports or harbours, or looking for permission to enter our ports or harbours, will be boarded under existing procedures to check that the documentation, etc. is in order.  This is checked out by an officer of customs, who is the usual person, but the Minister is proposing to extend the powers of harbour masters which I do not agree with, but we can discuss that on another day.  Let us say the officer of customs boards the ship and finds the insurance certificate in order but, notwithstanding that that a pollution incident has occurred.  If, before the procedure for arrest I am proposing has been put in train the boat or ship has left harbour, we have nothing to fear because we have means of redress.  We have the means of getting compensation, particularly under the terms of recent developments &mdash; when the Jurisdiction of Courts Bill that we were talking about last week is enacted.  Therefore, I see no difficulty with regard to my suggestion in causing a delay in terms of the power of arrest, providing the insurance certificate is in order on initial inspection.  As all boats will be inspected initially, if the certificate is found not to be in order we are then talking of a criminal situation when there has been a pollution incident and section 16 will apply.  I am not opposing what the Minister is proposing in the powers of arrest under section 16 when there is a criminal offence.  I am only concerned about the confusion between criminal and civil law in the Bill and the extra provision the Minister is introducing for civil offences under section 13.  For the Minister to continue to reiterate that what I am saying would lessen the chances of a successful arrest when someone has committed a pollution incident and <Col N="1396" /> so we would not be able to protect our coastline or get damages for pollution incidents, is a little disingenuous.  That is not what I intended and the Minister probably knows that is not what I intended.  There is no intention to cause delay in relation to arrest but I contend that the procedures for arrest should be correct and should not leave themselves open to such litigation that at the end of the day the State gets nothing.  I am very concerned about that and that is the point I have been making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to ensure, as the Deputy has said, that this does not follow in practice and that we cover all eventualities.  We want to be certain that when the officer or harbour master decides the boat should be detained it can be detained from that very moment.  If we operate under the old system we would have to wait for a reasonable length of time, at least 24, perhaps 48 hours.  If the boat had left we could pursue it whether it was from a Convention country or a non-Convention country.  We can make full use of the fund.  I firmly believe that the legislation we are putting in place would ensure that if a boat is detained, there is always the question of its being held as security or indeed of any other vessels owned by the same individual or company being held in order to ensure that we are fully compensated. I believe it is preferable to have the ship or money within the jurisdiction to ensure that compensation is paid.  If the ship is detained it is a further insurance to ensure the money is paid and that is covered under section 13(2):</P>
      <P>Where the Court has determined that a person, who has incurred a liability for pollution damage under section 7, is entitled to limit his liability, and such person has paid into Court a sum of not less than the amount determined by the Court to be the limit of his liability,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend we are on much stronger ground having the vessel within the jurisdiction rather than pursuing it if it leaves while we are on our way to the High <Col N="1397" /> Court under the old system.  If the master's attitude when leaving is that we have no control at all over the ship we may pursue it certainly but it may take much longer to obtain insurance compensation while the vessel is outside the jurisdiction than if the court takes a decision when the vessel or vessels are in the jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that it may be necessary to detain or arrest a ship for security.  The situation in which it would be necessary to detain a ship or tanker &mdash; fully loaded going about its business, delivering oil, I presume &mdash; for security against damage that had been done would be because we would be worried about being paid by the insurance company or whoever bonded that particular operation.  If there were any question of the insurance certificate not being in order and if at the same time the tanker had caused pollution damage, I suggest that that would be dealt with under section 16.  I think that the Minister is confusing the arguments that pertain to section 16 with those pertaining to section 13.  There is a clear distinction between a civil case and a criminal case.  I agree fully with what the Minister says when a criminal situation is involved, when the insurance certificate is not in order and a pollution incident has occurred.  Then one needs the most draconian powers of arrest to ensure that this State is protected and that any cost to the State will be fully covered.  We need in those cases the very minimum of security that the ship will afford, which probably will not be enough to cover the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking now about a civil situation. In such a situation, the shipowner having complied with all the rules and regulations and, on inspection by our officer of the customs, the insurance certificate being in order, I do not know why one needs draconian powers of arrest in this case.  If the owner is properly bonded and the insurance certificate is in order, there is no risk to the State of not being properly compensated.  To arrest the person involved and delay him going about his business, perhaps for many months while <Col N="1398" /> the case goes through the court, will cause unnecessary annoyance and grievance and the State will not benefit at all. I would accept the Minister's argument if the State were to benefit more from his suggestion than from mine, but we would not benefit providing the insurance certificate is in order.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a civil case where accidental damage has taken place and everything possible has been done by the shipowner and operating company to cover that damage, in other words, where the insurance certificate and bonding are in order.  There is nothing more to be achieved by arresting and detaining that ship indefinitely.  I ask the Minister not to confuse that with my support for section 16.  If the insurance certificate and bonding are not in order, the Minister needs all the draconian powers to keep the ship as security for the country and to do what can be done.  There are two completely distinct issues here.</P>

      <P>If there is a spillage of oil then it follows that the inspector or harbour master's official would be detaining the ship immediately.  If there is only a carrying out of the normal inspection of the certificates which the vessel should carry and if these are in order, then there is no difficulty.</P>

      <P>He would be detained. First, the official is going on board a ship to ensure that everything is in order and if everything is in order there is no difficulty.  On the Deputy's argument, as soon as a custom official steps on board such a vessel then it is detained.  If everything is in order, there is no difficulty.  If everything is not in order, then there is a difficulty.  I would have no qualms about causing unnecessary annoyance to any of these vessels if they are not carrying the proper documents.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (3), lines 45 to 51, to delete paragraph (b), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) if the ship is not so registered, there is carried on board a certificate, acceptable to the Minister and satisfying such requirements as shall be prescribed, issued by or under the authority of the country in which the ship is registered, or such other country as may be prescribed, showing that there is in force, in respect of the ship, a contract of insurance or other financial security which satisfies the Liability Convention.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is vital.  I hope that the Minister will be able to take it on board. Perhaps he could indicate whether he will consider it and come back to it on Report Stage, or whether his mind is made up at this stage, so that we could dispose of the matter one way or other.  I would quite happily leave it until Report Stage to pursue my views if the Minister thought that might make for better agreement on what I propose.  If he has his mind made up, I ask him please to indicate and we shall take it accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the unamended Bill before us, a ship registered in a flag of convenience country which is not a party to the Convention would not be required to carry <Col N="1400" /> insurance at all.  It is unlikely that the law of such a country would require that. There is a certain immediacy about this matter which we must resolve.  I would like the Minister's response to my amendment before I develop my argument further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, I am not saying that there is a drastic change involved here.  Deputy Doyle's amendment states: &ldquo; ...  and satisfying such requirements as shall be described ... &rdquo;. If we are to prescribe, then we are talking about 21 sitting days of this House.  If that is what the Deputy means, then I would have to oppose it.  That is the short answer to the Deputy's question.  The reason for opposing it is that it would tie the Minister's hands in advance.  If it is necessary to prescribe, then the waiting period would be much too long.  The first change put forward in the amendment is that the certificate should satisfy such requirements as shall be prescribed.  I consider that the matter of acceptability of the certificate should be left to the discretion of the Minister for the Marine. This would not be the case if those requirements pertaining to the certificate had to be prescribed.  However, if the Deputy wishes me to have another look into the matter and discuss it further on Report Stage, I certainly will consider that.</P>

My amendment envisages that he will prescribe certificates which may be the certificates of certain other Convention countries to be carried in the ships of non-Convention countries.  This is to protect us and to meet the flags of convenience situation in relation to ships that may be registered in non-Convention countries which do not require the carrying of insurance certificates, or which specify certificates which would not satisfy our demands in relation to adequate insurance.</P>

If we intend to extend their powers, other legislation would need amending to do so more correctly and I have already outlined by reservations in relation to it.  Last week, I accepted advice that under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, reference to &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo; could also cover &ldquo;officer of customs&rdquo;.  However, that can only be so in cases where the Revenue Commissioners so appoint the officer of customs and it does not follow that all inspectors in all cases have the functions of an officer of customs, who has to be specifically appointed by the Revenue Commissioners.  I would not be satisfied with the mere deletion of &ldquo;harbour masters&rdquo; and I should like to substitute &ldquo;officer of customs&rdquo; as it would be more proper to the accepted role and functions of an officer of customs.</P>

The Minister said that on occasions we can better the wording of the Convention.  I am not <Col N="1404" /> saying my suggestion would do that.  I am merely asking whether my interpretation of this section could be right because, if it is, it is wide open to all sorts of difficulties. I understand the wording to mean that in certain rather unusual circumstances it is quite conceivable that the insurer could limit his liability when the owner could not because of the statement there in respect of proceedings brought about without the actual fault or privity of the owner of the ship.  If there is fault or privity the owner will not be able to limit his liability whereas the insurer will.  There seems to be slightly different treatment of the insurer and the owner.  Perhaps there is a good explanation but I should like to hear it.</P>

      <P>There is, in so far as if this provision did not exist it is very unlikely that any of these vessels could obtain a guarantor.  Any insurer would not normally take on unlimited liability and it is to ensure that the owners of vessels can obtain a guarantor and insurance because if it was unlimited it would not be possible to do so.  Voluntary funds certainly could not carry all this if none of the companies had insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said but my concern is the importance of getting insurance cover and we must not put in impossible demands that will weaken the whole system.  I appreciate that the right to limit liability is given to shipowners because of the enormous risks to which a shipowner is exposed in the modern world.  Even with the best intentions, with everything in order and complying with all the rules and regulations, accidents can happen and any accident from an oil pollution incident is usually extremely costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present procedures where shipowners insure their liabilities with the P &amp; I Clubs should be referred to because so great are the risks to which shipowners are now exposed that the professional managers of the P &amp; I Clubs are now discussing whether they can continue to offer unlimited cover, which has always been a feature of P &amp; I cover.  This has <Col N="1405" /> serious implications as the P &amp; I Club managers believe there is a danger that some day they will be faced with a claim which goes through the present limits of cover which is over $1,000 million.  If you are faced with a claim which goes through that ceiling, what happens?  The whole concept of limitation of liability will be gone and there will be no protection. That is why it is important to be quite clear on what we intend to do here.</P>
    <P>The limitation of shipowners' liability generally has to be considered against this background of the unease of the P &amp; I Clubs at present.  Therefore, the right to limit liability should be virtually unbreakable to provide that element of certainty which is necessary when attempting to negotiate adequate reinsurance cover.  It is only from that point of view that I pose the question as to whether the wording of section 17(3) treats the owner and the insurer differently. I think it does.  Could it have consequences for reinsurance and the whole problem of limitation of liability generally as a result?  I am asking the question. I am not saying I am completely sure of the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Having teased it out further I agree that it does, the reason being that the insurer or guarantor would not take on unlimited liability.  Therefore there has to be a reference to the guarantor and to the owner.  I agree that there is a difference but if there were not we would be worse off in that these vessels would have great difficulty in obtaining insurance.  The only way we can be sure they will obtain insurance is by ensuring that the liability is limited.</P>

      <P>Is what the Minister has said correct?

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If liability is limited to some £12 million and the damage caused is in excess of that figure, the compensation fund will be there to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the compensation fund, which is just an international voluntary agreement among tanker-owning companies, would be wound up eventually when all countries ratified the Convention and that this would supersede it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Even boats from Convention countries which are covered by insurance still pay into the compensation fund.  A vessel may have liability limited to the sum of £1 million but any spillage is likely to cause damage well in excess of that figure.  Insurance would be merely for the optics.  The necessary topping up would come from the compensation fund on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  The compensation fund is compulsory in Convention countries.  There is a levy per tonne on each Convention country vessel covered by insurance.  This ensures that the top-up arrangement will continue. When all Convention countries have ratified the Convention there will be no question of terminating the compensation fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says but my understanding was that both TOVALOP and CRISTAL, which are voluntary international schemes, were intended to be interim measures.  It was stated that this would be the case and I <Col N="1407" /> understood that both systems would not run parallel indefinitely.  The Minister says this will be the case and that the voluntary agreements and the compensation fund will be there to top-up compensation for damage which is in excess of the insurance liability.  If those funds are there, why can we not treat the owner and the insurance similarly?  We will be going to this international fund when our damage claim goes over and above the limit of liability.  An owner may get maximum insurance cover and be fully insured in the acceptable sense.  Why should we treat the owner and the insurer differently if, in the event of a breach of the limit, we intend to go to the international fund anyway?  Why should we leave the owner exposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did not do this it would be impossible to obtain any insurance cover and the compensation fund would be carrying all the liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The compensation fund provides for all of the non-Convention countries as well as the Convention countries in a situation where damage is in excess of the insurance cover.  If the insurance company or the guarantor is left wide open, which would be the case if both were treated similarly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying we should treat the owner in the same way as the insurer. The insurer has a limited liability.  Why not the owner as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is very much in line with the convention and it mirrors that part of the Convention.  The CRISTAL fund will only apply to non-Convention countries such as Ireland is at present.  The compensation fund takes over from CRISTAL for Convention countries.  When this is ratified and we become party to the Convention we will then look towards the compensation <Col N="1408" /> fund.  I hope all non-Convention countries will ratify the Convention.  Only a few countries who have ratified have vessels carrying oil as cargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have difficulty in understanding section 17 (3).  The explanation tends to reinforce my view that there is no need to treat the owner and the insurer differently.  I support the concept of limitation of liability but I feel the owner as well as the insurer should be able to limit liability, particularly in view of the Minister's explanation that once the limit is breached the compensation fund makes good the difference.  There is no risk in exposing the owner to any claim over and above the limited liability because the owner would not have to pay the difference.  It would be paid from the compensation fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary fund will only apply to non-Convention countries. As far as CRISTAL is concerned, there is no top-up.  However, there is a top-up from the compensation fund and this is the reason for the difference.  CRISTAL applies to the non-Convention countries and the compensation fund applies to the Convention countries and supplies a top-up.  Hence the necessity to let the wording stand as it is.</P>

      <P>In calculating the consumer price index account is taken of current changes in the cost of all categories of consumer expenditure, that is, food, drink, tobacco, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, housing, durable household goods, other goods, transport, services and related expenditure.  The total number of items for which price changes are measured each quarter is 722.  These are surveyed on a wide geographic basis covering 81 cities and towns throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The price quotations on which the index is based are voluntarily provided each quarter by an extensive panel of retail and service outlets throughout the country.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the Government have any plans to ensure that Ireland will be able to participate fully in the internal market by 1992; if there are such plans, when he expects to announce them; and, if there are no such plans if he will make them as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the administrative arrangements with a view to the completion of the internal market by 1992, I am very conscious of the need for all sectors of the Irish industrial and services community to be fully aware of the opportunities and challenges which this event will present.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I will continue to avail of every appropriate opportunity to highlight the imminence of this event to the appropriate promotional and representative bodies.</P>
      <P>I have also been exploring how best to supplement and intensify this information process so at to ensure that the business community will be fully prepared to exploit the opportunities which realisation of the internal market will present.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided to initiate an awareness campaign that will be launched by the Taoiseach this summer.</P>
      <P>There is no question of seeking a derogation from the principle of the completion of the internal market.  In areas where we have difficulties such as those in relation to harmonisation of indirect taxes and liberalisation of capital movements, we will be seeking for appropriate arrangements to safeguard the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to confirm one point he <Col N="1424" /> made in his answer.  Is there now a coordinating committee among various Government Departments, for example, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Education and Foreign Affairs, set up to study the implications of the internal market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is a coordinating group under the Taoiseach's Department dealing with our preparations for the completion of the internal market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they represent interests in other Departments?  For example, are we now going to pursue the teaching of foreign languages between now and 1992 or is it solely in the business area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are under the Taoiseach's Department under the co-ordination of the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, with the Minister of State acting as chairman of a group representative of a number of Departments all seeking to make sure that Irish industry is fully aware and prepared for 1992.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of matters which come before the internal market are not all industrial and promotional but generally they are of a business nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the main difficulty facing us in 1992 would be the harmonisation of the indirect taxes, would the Minister of State not agree that unless there is a phased programme towards harmonisation, we will inevitably be forced towards large scale variegations in 1992 and a programme of phased reductions should be announced at this stage, targets set by ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy.  That is our approach to many of the items of the programme.  The Deputy will recall that an EC White Paper published some time ago listed some 300 items the EC were seeking to harmonise.  We made it clear in a number <Col N="1425" /> of cases, including the case I mentioned, the tax harmonisation area, that we have to move very slowly with that and be very careful about it.  We have to be careful in a number of areas but the previous Government and this Government have made that very plain.  We are for the principle of the internal market.  In a number of areas it is important to be sensitive to Ireland's demands.  One of those areas was mentioned by the Deputy and we are sensitive about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are anxious to participate fully in the internal market by 1992 we must at this stage have a phased programme towards that full participation and it is incumbent on the Government to announce details of a phased programme so that the country knows exactly what faces us between now and then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I agree.  The difficulty is that with the EC changing Presidencies every six months you find different Presidencies have different priorities and among the proposals of 300 or so originally laid out priorities change. Therefore, it is difficult for any Government here to be very specific in regard to what proposals might come forward in the immediate future.  In so far as we know the ones immediately coming forward, we will take appropriate steps to deal with any one in that area that affects the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>There are over 300 proposals.  For example, I dealt with the insurance one personally some time ago and that was all over the financial pages of the newspapers.  We have been talking about tax harmonisation for cars and for alcohol and standardisation of VAT rates.  That has received wide media coverage.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that harmonisation of taxes can take place only by a unanimous decision at Council and not by majority decision, and the EC recognise that we insisted on that because of the very great difficulty it presents for this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given there are only four budgets between now and 1992, I support Deputy Cooney in his request that the Government spell out step by step what moves industry has to prepare itself for here in the next four years.  For example, has any work been done on the equalisation of excise duties which will have huge effects?</P>

I take Deputy Cooney's suggestion that we try to publish a clearer list.  There is a list which has received substantial coverage.  It is not simply a matter of putting dates behind each proposal because some of those dates are outside our control.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State be interested in the proposal made by Commissioner Sutherland that an all-party group composed of representatives here and representatives of various business and economic interests be brought together to promote the matter?  In view of its national significance this should not be left exclusively in the hands of the Government of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome the suggestion that we involve the broader community.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have repeatedly invited Irish industry, the representative bodies on the trade union side and other areas of Irish life to involve themselves in bringing to the public the information necessary from their point of view.  We will be looking for the widest possible involvement of all sections of the community including Members from the parties opposite.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that at the end of the day the Government have to take their own decisions in this matter.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that the harmonisation of VAT rates in 1992 or subsequently and the movement towards a standard rate of VAT would involve a single rate between 17 and 18 per cent on all items including items at present exempt and food?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the present proposals are not acceptable because of figures like the Deputy suggests. I am not clear whether his figures are correct, but they are of that order. There would be difficulties for us.  A <Col N="1428" /> figure has been quoted many times that immediate agreement to the proposals could cost the nation between £300 million and £500 million and from a budgetary point of view that is not on, as we have made quite clear.</P>

The trade mission is the most effective device in trying to increase market share in the countries in question. A list of specific trade missions and sectoral missions to the Far East projected by CTT for 1988, will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>CTT have researched the potential for Irish manufactured exports to Latin America as recently as last year.  While some countries show signs of emerging from severe economic difficulties, tight import regimes and high tariffs are being maintained by many.  Economic and political instability in the region, together with the long travelling distance involved, imply limited export opportunities in the short term.  I have asked CTT to keep the situation under review.</P>

Further, there was a trade mission in Europe from that country with a spending budget in excess of $1 billion in the last couple of months but they did not come to this country because we are not showing sufficient interest in that very attractive and potentially big market.

The Minister for Industry and Commerce will visit that country in the next couple of months and I hope to lead a trade mission there some time in the autumn.  We are targeting on Japan as a major area of opportunity, particularly given their strong situation. The trading houses which have recently been cleared by the EC represent an area that the Japanese understand very well and I hope to have talks with Japanese interests in terms of considering the trading house structure here to see if they can be of help in developing a link between the trading house movement here and the Japanese situation.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware, from his period in Industry and Commerce, of the difficulties in finding a definition that is suitable and that does not change the whole operation of the society.  At the same time we have to bear in mind that Kerry Co-op have made excellent progress under that same legislation and that Avonmore will be coming into the market soon.  It is the definition that is the problem and I am sure the Deputy has encountered it in his time as Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily disagree with the Minister that the current legislation is not a prohibition or an impediment on the creation of the societies.  Nonetheless, would the Minister not agree that the legislation has many shortcomings and is grossly out of date, considering that the Principal Act is dated 1893?  Will the Minister indicate in what way he is responding to the submissions of the Society of Co-operative Studies in Ireland with regard to new legislation and what steps, if any, he intends to take in the legislative area at any stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The request made by the society would involve some changes in the legislation.  However, they appreciate the problems encountered in that regard.  We have received a submission from the credit union movement in this regard also and the whole area is being looked at in that light.  I have not yet made up my mind on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

Why does the Minister disagree with the conclusions of that report that amendments should be made to the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already, the definition of co-operative covers every type of co-operative activity and at the same time is sufficiently watertight to exclude from registration organisations which are not bona fide co-operatives.  As I have said, the whole question is being re-examined in the light of the recent meeting with and the submission from the co-operative society and of the submission, received within the last seven or eight days, from the credit union movement. The general principles underlying co-operatives are well understood internationally. The principles do not have the precision which is necessary in a strict statutory definition.  A restrictive definition could be counter-productive, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, in that it would limit the registration of some bodies which could be of long term value but do not meet the strict definition in law.  However, as I have said, the matter is being re-examined in the light of the two recent submissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 41 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced on Thursday, 25 February 1988 that new regulations will be introduced in early 1989 relating to the fire safety requirements for upholstered furniture. This decision was taken on the basis of a report which I requested from the National Standards Authority of Ireland last October and which I have now received.  I asked for this report because of the need to keep our regulations up to date in this area of extreme danger potential.  Technological advances in foam manufacture in recent years mean that we can now set higher <Col N="1435" /> levels of fire resistance for furniture on sale in this country.</P>
    <P>The present regulations relating to the flammability of upholstered furniture have been in place since 1980.  They require that from 31 December 1982 upholstered furniture must be resistant to smouldering cigarettes and either be flame resistant or carry a warning label indicating that it is not flame resistant.</P>
    <P>These regulations were introduced at the same time as similar regulations in the UK.  They have served, over the years, to reduce the risk of fires occurring in furniture, bearing in mind the state of technology, materials available and the cost of alternatives at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that between 80 and 90 per cent of all furniture on sale to the public at present is filled with polyurethane foam?  Is he also aware that homes can become toxic infernos when polyurethane furniture ignites? Can the Minister indicate what foam products he intends to ban in the regulations he has announced he intends to introduce?  Could he state when those regulations will be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Kingdom and Ireland are two of the few countries which exercise stringent controls, far more stringent than the other member states, in this area.  In the United Kingdom a number of deaths occurred over the Christmas period and there was a certain amount of media attention.  As a result the United Kingdom authorities announced they would be introducing new legislation dealing with foam filled furniture and mattresses from the end of February 1989.  We are aware that there are polyurethane materials being used at present which are flammable and dangerous. It is estimated that 90 per cent of furniture on sale is filled with polyurethane foam.  While the increasing use of this relatively cheap material since the fifties has brought comfortable upholstered furniture within the reach of many people who could not previously afford it, nonetheless it is quite dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> The type of regulations being introduced here will be in line with those in the United Kingdom.  We will be banning the use of high resistance foam and only combustion modified high resistance foam will be permitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When will our regulations be introduced?  The United Kingdom regulations will come into force at the end of February 1989.  Is it merely a coincidence that the Minister took action in this area six weeks after the United Kingdom authorities announced the action they were taking?  What steps does the Minister intend to take to warn the general public in this country of the dangers posed in 90 per cent of homes by the presence of both standard quality foam and the high resistance foam which he now intends to ban?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a series of supplementaries and I will try to reply to all of them.  If I omit any I have no doubt he will let me know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incorrect for the Deputy to say we acted after the United Kingdom.  We commissioned a report by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in October last, which anteceded the statement made by the United Kingdom Government, in the light of the information available on the possible dangers of the polyurethane furniture which was available here.  The United Kingdom announcement was made in the light of the tragedies which occurred over the Christmas period.  We had acted much earlier and the announcement I made last week was as a result of the report commissioned last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the timing of the introduction of the mandatory regulations, it is appropriate that the regulations to be introduced here and in the United Kingdom should be similar.  It would be inappropriate that there should be dumping from the United Kingdom on the Irish market and <i>vice versa.</i>  Their regulations <Col N="1437" /> will come into force at the end of February 1989 and we will time the introduction of our regulations so that they will more or less coincide with what is happening in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the regulations which require the furniture to carry warning labels are not being enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the 1982 regulations furniture must pass two tests. One is the smoulder test and the other is the match ignitability test.  The furniture has to pass the first test but it may not necessarily have to pass the second test. In other words, an item of foam filled furniture may be ignitable by a match under the present regulations but a label must be attached by the manufacturers before it is offered for sale.  I am aware that the type of labels being used for this purpose at present can be easily detached.  This may happen but I have no information that it has.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>My third question asked if the Minister envisaged increasing the personnel in his Department to police the existing and new regulations to avoid dumping.  This is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>When they come into force the mandatory regulations will ensure that there are permanent nondetachable labels on the solid part of the furniture so that the consumer will know exactly what he is buying and with what tests the furniture complies.  As regards dumping, this will be under the control of the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  At present there are seven inspectors who will ensure that furniture which was sold, assembled or manufactured in this country may not be sold, assembled or manufactured if it does not comply with our regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any EC proposals for regulations governing foam in furniture?  If so, are their standards as high as those which will be in the mandatory regulations to which the Minister <Col N="1439" /> referred?  If not, is there a danger that our regulations might be struck down as being inconsistent with a fully free internal EC market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any EC regulations but I can assure the Deputy that from my information, the United Kingdom, Ireland and France are the only European countries with any legal controls over the fire safety of furniture. The regulations as they obtain here and in the United Kingdom are far more stringent than those in any other European country or indeed in any other country in any part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it would be desirable that there should be EC-wide regulations in order that there would not be constraints on trade within the Community in this obviously desirable area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it would be most desirable, since we are an active participating member of the EC, that there would be uniformity of regulations right across the board particularly in relation to something as serious and important to people's lives as dangerous furniture which might be flammable and cause loss of life.  Obviously it is very important.  We will ensure that the regulations we will introduce will be stringently observed and that controls will be instituted to ensure there is no infringement of those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put three brief questions to the Minister.  Is he aware that the English regulations will provide for a lighted match test or open flame test? Will he say whether our regulations will so provide?  In the context of the stringency of our regulations, will the Minister say whether he has any intention of introducing an amendment to the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961 under the terms of which a breach of the current regulations, or of the new ones the Minister is proposing, could result in a fine of £100 only being imposed whereas the fine imposed at present in England is £2,000 <Col N="1440" /> and they are talking about reviewing their legislation?  Will the Minister agree that the penalties to be imposed under this legislation could render the regulations about which he is talking meaningless unless we introduce reforming measures here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>With new technology available there is now foam-filled furniture available which is not ignitable; that was introduced on the market last year.  I might add that the increased cost will be minimal compared with that obtaining at present.  I believe that the penalties should be strict and sufficiently severe to ensure that the regulations are not infringed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, agreed with the social partners and published in October 1987, is the definitive statement of the Government's plans, for the period to end-1990, for:</P>
      <P>intensification of practical measures to generate increased job opportunities on a sectoral basis.</P>
      <P>Section V, paragraph 10 of the programme states that the objectives of policy in manufacturing industry involve creating approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years, the actual provision accelerating as the programme policies take effect. Section V, paragraphs 15 and 16 of the programme indicate certain of the areas in which new job opportunities have been identified.  However, since it is less than six months since the programme was introduced, it would be too early at this stage to attempt to quantify the job creation for the first year.  On the basis of ongoing contacts with the industrial promotion agencies I am confident that the overall targets set in the programme can be achieved.  At this stage, however, it is too early to give, with the requisite degree of precision, an indication of the sectoral composition of the extra jobs that will be created in the first year of the programme.</P>
      <P>In so far as the references to biotechnology and information technology might be regarded as related to the science and technology development programme, initiated by the Government in June 1987, I should say that the long-term objective of this programme is the upgrading of the scientific and technological capacity of Irish industry.  Its effect on job creation is therefore intended to be more indirect than direct. However, the programme already provides employment for 114 graduates, either in third level research centres or in companies.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that the word processor in the Minister's office has been working overtime producing this material, may I ask him if a single job has been created in any of these sectors about which we heard so much at the last general election from the Minister's party?  Could he name just one job, other than a public sector job, that has been created as a result of his initiatives? Would he further indicate if he has set any target for this year, next year or the year after in regard to actual jobs, as distinct from public service jobs, that might be created?</P>

      <P>I am not here dealing with public sector jobs.  If the Deputy was listening to my reply he would have heard that I said the programme already provides employment for 114 graduates, either in third level research centres or in companies.  I might also refer the Deputy to the programme itself.  Individual targets have been set for the various growth sector areas which have been identified by the Government.  Indeed, the chief executive of the IDA is already on record as taking the targets in hand and committing the IDA to fulfilling those targets in his domain.  In the other areas, targets have been set for the food sector, fishing, tourism and forestry.  The Deputy will appreciate that they do not all come within my jurisdiction but those that do we are on target to meet.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be well aware from his period in the Department that it is a completely imprecise science to try to forecast what closures might or might not occur.  The Deputy will also be only too well aware that this Government are confronting the root causes of factory closures which he will also be aware have arisen because of lack of competitiveness over the years, the cost of money, the rate of inflation being too high and so on.  In that regard the 1987 actions of the Government, in attacking the lack of competitiveness of Irish industry, will bring their rewards in this and ensuing years.</P>

      <P>The reduction in the rate of inflation to approximately 3 per cent &mdash; targeted for two and a half per cent in 1988 &mdash; a reduction in interest rates, in the cost of money, no increases in electricity charges in 1987, no increases <Col N="1445" /> in postal and telecommunications charges in 1987, are all very important factors in input costs of which the Deputy is well aware.

Indeed, the ESB are on record within the last day or so as committing themselves to freezing the cost of electricity up to the end of the year 1990.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for improved legislation in relation to product liability was recognised by all member states of the EC when the decision was taken to adopt the Product Liability Directive.</P>
      <P>The directive, when implemented, will introduce into Irish law the principle of strict liability which imposes liability on the producer of a defective product irrespective of whether any negligence was involved in the manufacture of the product.  The directive is not intended to amend or replace existing law but rather to supplement it.  The consumer will, therefore, have additional rights to those he already has under contract law and under the law of tort.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am making every effort to have the necessary implementing legislation in place by the deadline of 30 July 1988.</P>
      <P>As regards consumer rights generally, I would point out that there is already in existence a substantial body of consumer protection legislation, such as the Consumer Information Act, 1978, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  On a number of occasions recently, I have advised the House of the progress my Department are making in the implementation of the additional measures to improve consumer rights, at a time when resources generally are limited.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 16 in the name of Deputy Avril Doyle.  The more pertinent amendment is that which has been circulated on a single sheet.  I understand this is a revised amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (1) (c), line 43, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;he was not given a fair opportunity to defend his case, including, where he could not be present in the Convention Country, due to political circumstances, an opportunity to give evidence in the State before an examiner appointed by the relevant authority in the Convention Country; or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a revised amendment which I circulated to the House this morning and one on which I hope the Minister has had <Col N="1496" /> time to take advice.  This amendment is necessary and I would nearly go so far as to say that it is abundantly evident why it is necessary.  It is really to close off a loophole which I think is very evident in this section whereby in certain circumstances it would not be possible for a person to gain entry into a country to defend a case.  The claimant must have access to the courts of the relevant State in the event of a claim for pollution.  In fact, such an amendment was accepted from the Israeli delegates during the drafting of the Civil Liability Convention in Brussels in 1969 and I wonder why we have no provision for it in our law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only refer to the Deputy's earlier amendment because I have only just now received a copy of the revised amendment, No. 16.  I want to refer briefly to the original amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the original amendment would have caused problems for the Minister.  He may like to take the revised amendment to Report Stage and comment on it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>After reading the amendment, I would like to be able to respond to it.  I would refer the Deputy to section 28 (1) (b).  I believe that the amendment to which the Deputy refers is already covered by this subsection. Section 28 (1) (b) states that a determination made in a Convention country shall not be recognised or enforced in the State if it is manifestly contrary to public policy in the State.  I have been advised just now that that subsection covers the amendment which Deputy Doyle has tabled.  While there is some merit in the amendment, it is covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister has said, with respect to him and his advice.  Quite frankly, I do not accept that section 28 (1) (b) covers what my amendment is intended to cover. Inability to gain access to or entry into a State to defend a case might not be public policy in that State because of particular circumstances, which is quite different <Col N="1497" /> from public policy generally.  Political circumstances often give rise to inability to gain entry into a country.  In this case it would be political circumstances preventing entry to defend the case.  An example given during the 1969 drafting of the Convention which, after all, is what we are trying to ratify today, was that an Israeli in a Syrian court would have particular difficulties in making his claim. Where one draws the line between what is manifestly public policy and particular internecine type or other disagreements between two neighbouring States, I am not sure.  I do not accept that section 28 (1) (b) covers the point which is alluded to in section 28 (1) (c), effectively, as well.</P>
      <P>My amendment is to flesh out, as it were, subsection (1) (c) and to clarify exactly what is being alluded to there.  I feel very strongly that as this amendment was accepted from the Israeli delegates during the original drafting in 1969 of the Civil Liability Convention, we should have it here, too.  In one argument the Minister says that we must stick as closely as possible to the wording and intention of the Convention which we are trying to ratify and then, with respect, he departs from that argument whenever he feels that he can and justifies that by giving different reasons, usually telling me that his view is now better than the Conventions. We really ought to sort ourselves out on this.  Either we stick strictly to the Convention line on this or we do not.  In this country, above all, we are aware of difficulties that can arise from political circumstances.  We should take cognisance of this aspect.  I ask Minister please to take my amendment on board for those very reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My early intervention referred to public policy in this State and I am quite satisfied, having discussed this with the Attorney General, that the original amendment and the advice which is now available to me from the Attorney General since the amended amendment was substituted this morning covers this adequately.  Despite what <Col N="1498" /> people may do in other countries, I take the view based on the advice available to me that section 28 (1) (b) more than adequately covers the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not foresee circumstances when it would be in the interests of this State to be able to defend a case which is brought?  He is putting the matter solely from the point of view of protecting the State's interests, that they will not defend a case taken against us if the public policy of the country concerned causes particular difficulties on entry.  When it is in the interests of this State, or any claimant, or any person involved in this State in relation to another country's claim, surely we should ensure that a determination is not made or a hearing does not proceed without those involved being able to gain entry to defend those proceedings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look to the next section or, possibly, to an earlier one, in the event of one not being in a position to defend oneself, to enter a plea &mdash; and I assume it is a plea of not guilty &mdash; when one is not there to put forward an extenuating case then it is not a question of not defending the case.  One is innocent until proven guilty even if one is not represented in court.  It is a matter for the courts to decide.</P>

      <Col N="1499" /> SECTION 30.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 30 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one part of this section about which I have some reservations. It concerns subsection (3), which states:</P>
      <P>The Court may relieve the owner of a ship, his guarantor or the Fund wholly or partially from liability to a person for pollution damage if it is proved that the damage resulted wholly or partially from the negligence of that person or that the damage was contributed to by any act or omission of such person which was calculated to cause damage.</P>
      <P>Again, during the drafting of the Civil Liability Convention in Brussels in 1969, the USSR had an amendment to the draft Convention in relation to this area.  I think I am right in saying that this section was amended in the Seanad.  I am subject to correction on that.  I am refreshing my mind as I read this.  Any difficulties that may have arisen were, I think, resolved in the Seanad.  Could the Minister confirm that that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is coming back to me as I speak.  This is the amended version and it was amended in the Seanad.  It is normal procedure, when a State is ratifying a Convention, that one tries to take on board the wording and script of the Convention so that there is unity among the different Convention countries in relation to the application of the different laws.  The original amendment from the Seanad &mdash; and I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; was not as worded under section 30(3).  However, I believe that what is before us now is the wording according to the amendment proposed by <Col N="1500" /> the USSR in 1969 when the original Civil Liability Convention was being drafted. I wonder if the Minister could confirm this?  If so, why did he not have this Amendment included in the Bill as circulated originally.</P>

      <P>In page 21, subsection (2), lines 29 and 30, to delete paragraph (g), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) require a witness to make and subscribe a declaration of the truth of any statements mady by him at his examination; such subscribed statements shall be deemed to be a document kept in pursuance of this Act for the purposes of section 41;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to plug the loophole that exists due to the absence of the Civil Evidence Act in Ireland whereby declarations of the kind to be made under this section may not be admissible in the courts.  The amendment is necessary to ensure that the declaration is covered by section 41.  Amendment No. 37 is intended to permit a captain who has joined a ship after a pollution incident to make certified copies of the entries made by his predecessor.  This is also necessary because of the absence of the Civil Evidence Act here.  The Act operates in the UK where they do not have this kind of difficulty; it is part of the complications of our present legal system.  My amendments are necessary because of the Irish <Col N="1502" /> situation in relation to evidence and evidential presentation in court generally.</P>

      <P>In inserting a new section 41, having discussed with the legal advisers after the Second Stage debate and the points made by Deputy Doyle then, we have gone as far as we can in inserting a further amendment.  The statements referred to in section 32 (2) (g) concerns the powers of enforcement and will be covered by the provisions of section 41 of the Bill.  The new section 41 takes on board the suggestions made by Deputy Doyle and it is not now necessary to amend paragraph (g) as proposed in her amendment.

Amendment No. 36, in the name of the Minister, does not make it entirely clear if the successor in office of the person who made the original entry may make a certified copy, which is the point I want to establish beyond doubt.

      <P>My advice in relation to the Minister's amendment <i>vis-à-vis</i> my amendments is that the Minister's wording is not entirely clear.  Section (b) could be a fruitful source of litigation in the event of the person keeping the document at present not being the original person who made the copy of the document. I do not know if it would be accepted that the person now keeping the document could certify it was a true copy if he was not the person who made the original copy.  There is room for argument. I accept that the Minister's intention is to cover the point I made on Second Stage but my advice is that there is still ambiguity in that regard.  I do not have any other difficulty with it and I accept that its thrust is what I requested on Second Stage and that the Minister has accommodated me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of my amendment is to make it clear that provisions of section 34 relating to the detention of ships refer to an inspector or harbour-master exercising the powers conferred on them by section <Col N="1505" /> 13 (3) or section 16.  In the case of section 13 (3) a ship may be detained or be further detained if he attempts to leave any place in the State after being stopped and detained if it appeared that the owner of that ship had incurred a liability for pollution damage.  Under section 16 a ship may be stopped and detained in any place in the State if it attempts to leave in contravention of that section which provides that the master of a ship shall produce a certificate in relation to the existence of a contract of insurance in respect of a ship.  I am meeting the point made by the Deputy in amendment No. 22 by the inclusion of reference to section 13(3) in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be opposing the Minister's amendment.  It attempts to clarify a section that I, and the general public, found very confusing.  I made that very clear on Second Stage.  The Minister has dealt with my main fear, that under section 13 there could be contravention of the Civil Liability Convention.  I accept the Minister's assurance that his amendment brings in sections 13 and 16 in relation to the powers we have been discussing. Had amendment No. 8 been accepted I would have been requesting the deletion of section 34.  Had it been accepted in lieu of the detention provisions under section 13 (1) the powers of detention would remain in the Bill under section 16 for ships which do not have certificates of insurance.  It would then be unnecessary to bring such ships before a court to continue their detention as per section 34.  They would simply remain detained until they produced a valid certificate. That is the procedure under the merchant shipping Acts where certificates are required before sailing.  As amendment No. 8 was rejected by the House we must accept section 34.  I would prefer if the House had deleted this but the second best thing is for the House to accept the Minister's amendment which goes some way towards meeting the fears I expressed on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I made the point that it appeared that words were missing from <Col N="1506" /> subsection (b).  Has the Minister resolved that difficulty?  In the course of my Second Stage speech, I said that under section 34 an inspector who detains a ship will have to go to the District Court and indicate that there is a contravention of the Act when, in fact, there would be no contravention of the Act because the Act provides that if the ship is insured we would be dealing with a civil action.  Have my fears in relation to that aspect been dealt with in the Minister's amendment?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before section 36, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever security is given by a defendant pursuant to section 35 for the payment of the maximum or any fine imposed in respect of an offence under this Act and for the estimated costs of any trials, appeals or other proceedings in respect of such an offence, the court may, when the trial, appeal or other proceedings, as the case may, has or have been finally determined, if it decides that it is proper so to do, on application from the Minister, direct that the whole of the amount of the security, or such part thereof as may be necessary to discharge the amount of the fine imposed in respect of the offence together with the amount of any costs awarded in respect of any trial, appeal or other proceeding, be paid out to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put forward on the advice of the Attorney General.  Section <Col N="1508" /> 35 provides that when in respect of an offence under this Act an order is made detaining a ship a district justice may, if satisfactory security is given, order the ship to be released pending the hearing of the charge against the ship.  The object of this amendment is to make it clear that following the hearing of the charge the fine, if any, and the costs of the trial may be paid to the Minister for the Marine out of the security lodged in the court. When a bond is lodged in court it is a guarantee to the court and there is no liability on the court to pay the fine to the Exchequer out of that bond.  This is to enable any fine at District Court level to be paid for out of the bond or security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This comes back to mixing criminal law and civil law.  If the Minister had seen fit to accept my amendment No. 8 to section 13 this would be unnecessary. Now we are seeing ministerial amendments to several sections designed to resolve the difficulties I highlighted in relation to section 13 on Second Stage.  It would have been a far tidier and legally more acceptable operation to have deleted section 13 and accepted my new section.  This amendment would then be entirely unnecessary.  The draconian provisions could effectively be worthless. The security envisaged for disposal under this section will, in the major cases where limitation of liability is involved, have already been released by the court under section 13 (2) (a) and in minor cases where no limitation of liability is involved there appears to be no provision for meeting the claims of the public, such as fishermen and environmental groups who have had to clean up damage caused by oil pollution.  It appears that some proceedings will take place in the criminal courts and some in the High Court.  Again there is confusion between civil and criminal proceedings, a point I have reiterated several times.  This Bill must dovetail into existing law rather than create a new layer, which it will effectively do.  All this confusion stems from section 13 which is quite unsatisfactory and will prove a fruitful source of litigation over the years.  I fear it could make <Col N="1509" /> the Bill unworkable in many instances. We are all trying to make the Bill a success and to protect our coastline from pollution damage.  Even in the best regulated circumstances accidents will occur, but we must ensure that the country and the immediate community are adequately compensated for any damage.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with this amendment. It may be necessary since we are stuck with section 13 and it may help to ameliorate the difficulties which are evident in that section.  The draconian provisions could be worthless since those we are trying to help may not get any damage compensation.  It may not be available for them when it is needed.</P>

      <P>I agree that if we had accepted amendment No. 8 to section 13 it would have made the Bill shorter rather than tidier but not as effective as it should be.  This section is designed to deal with fines arising out of criminal proceedings. It has absolutely nothing to do with liability actions.  This refers to a case where a vessel which has been detained tries to leave the jurisdiction.  If a bond is lodged in the District Court in order to have the vessel released and a fine is subsequently imposed when the case is heard, that fine may be paid out of the bond.  Heretofore that would not have been possible.  I agree that if we had accepted amendment No. 8 it would have changed the Bill completely and sections 34, 35 and 36 would have been unnecessary.  I hold the view that it is absolutely essential to give the officers and harbour-masters the power to detain these vessels so that we can act as expeditiously as possible.  We have covered that ground many times and we agree to differ.</P>

      <P>I would like to receive confirmation from the Minister of State that following the passage of this Bill all will be in order in relation to section 36 which states that in every case within two years from the date of the offence summary proceedings may be instituted under this Bill.  I mentioned earlier that <Col N="1510" /> there could be an important abridgment of a claimant's rights in relation to his bringing an action within six years of a pollution incident and within three years of the date of damage.  The present law allows him six years from the date of damage in those cases where he can prove fault on the part of captain and crew. Once this Bill is passed the old limitation period will only apply where the claimant can prove fault on the part of the shipowner. This again refers to the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Bill and I wonder whether it will have any knock-on effects in relation to this provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">

      <P>Absolutely none. The time of three years and six years will refer only to civil cases in the High Court. In this new section a time of two years will apply from the date of the offence. The part of the section which reads &ldquo;if, at the expiry of that period, the person to be charged is outside the State, within two months of the date on which he next enters the State&rdquo; refers to criminal proceedings. Therefore, one will not affect the other.</P>

    <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash;Sections 2 and 3 of this Act shall not come into operation until provisions relating to the investigation of complaints from the public against officers of Customs and Excise, and the adjudication by a body other than the Customs and Excise of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and hope his document meets the concerns we had raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment under discussion was proposed to try to bring some form of equity or uniformity or regime between the conditions under which members of the Garda Síochána are obliged to operate and conditions under which officials of the Customs and Excise will be obliged <Col N="1514" /> to operate, in view of the fact that the powers afforded customs officials under the Bill are equal to those afforded to the Garda.  If we are giving a range of powers to employees of the Department of Finance, powers to stop, search, question and detain members of the public those people should be made answerable to some form of independent public body of complaint.  All of the reasons for that type of regime were advanced here in the House in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, so there is no need to go over them again.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response.  This type of amendment is needed particularly in view of the wide import of the Bill as was highlighted here by Deputy Noonan, Deputy De Rossa and myself when we were discussing who would be in a position to be designated an officer for the purposes of this Bill.  For those reasons I commend this amendment to the House and I would be delighted to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2, as Deputy De Rossa said, might appear a bit heavy handed.  The powers of search now sought in the Bill, as I said before, are marginal additions to the powers of search already exercised or capable of being exercised by the Customs and Excise service.  It is a mistake to associate this Bill with the Criminal Justice Act 1984, in which extensive new powers of detention were assigned specifically to the Garda.  Moreover, the Garda have to deal with a whole range of criminal law, whereas customs officers' powers are confined to the enforcement of Customs and Excise legislation alone.  The Customs and Excise service has earned a reputation for courtesy and efficiency, a reputation which has not been impugned by the difficult task which they faced over the last 11 months in implementing the 48-hour rule on travellers' allowances at the Border frontier.  No complaints were received in the last 12 months about personal searches <i>per se</i> by the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance.  The Revenue Commissioners are also unaware of any member of the <Col N="1515" /> public seeking to have the question of a personal search resolved by a senior customs officer or a district justice, as is the right of every member of the public. This is probably due to a number of factors including ignorance of the law.</P>
      <P>Customs officers are in a position to explain a traveller's rights when the need arises.  The system of red and green channels is extremely useful in that before contact is made in the normal course between customs officers and travellers, the traveller is obliged to determine his or her obligations and to proceed accordingly through the red or green channel. Basically, the situation is that the traveller has already made a conscious decision as to whether they have goods to declare.  If a person has a doubt he can go through the red channel and have the doubt clarified or he can go through the red channel thereby automatically declaring the goods and indicating that he is prepared to pay the necessary customs duties.  The law is very flexible.  The structure is simple and reasonable.  I have no doubt that discretion has always been well used.  I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear the Minister's reply before opening up a little more the purpose of the amendment. I am surprised that the Minister has tried to suggest that the powers being afforded the Customs and Excise officers under this Bill are marginal additions to what already exist.  One could not describe the regime that will run from this Bill as anything like a marginal addition. Even if they are only marginal additions, that does not defeat the point of the amendment.  What is already there is extremely extensive.  It is important to get an appreciation of the general type of powers an officer of Customs and Excise will have.  The argument will come up under later amendments about the definition of what is the vicinity of any port or airport and it has been argued in the Seanad on this point that, given the proliferation of regional airports around the country, that section and the power <Col N="1516" /> to stop, to search, to seize, would probably be exercisable almost throughout the Thirty-two Counties.  In relation to search warrants, again an officer will be entitled to apply not only to a court but to a peace commissioner for a warrant to pursue an investigation, and there is no limit whatever geographically on the extent of that investigation.  What is happening in this Bill is a very definite deterioration between the limit of the Customs and Excise officer's investigation and the beginning of the Garda Síochána investigation. That is a very worrying aspect of the Bill generally.  This was highlighted on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Customs and Excise officers should be confined or should confine their activities to their traditional areas of operation about the airport, about the port and on usual points of crossing when it comes to talking about the Border.  On Second Stage Members of the House gave an all-embracing welcome to the provision for Customs and Excise to move into general day-to-day detection of drugs about the country wherever, and that is the whole intent of section 3.  Maybe the Minister will respond and say that that is not the intent, but nothing in the Bill will limit or delimit geographically or jurisdictionally limit or delimit the powers of customs officers in the exercise of these duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anything, the clear intent of the Bill is to allow Customs and Excise officers to move out from their traditional points of duty and pursue the drug trafficker, the drug importer and the drug offender, to follow on information they may have gathered through their own intelligence gathering, their own initiative or their own process of gathering facts or whatever will come their way at their point of first contact, and pursue those by going to a peace commissioner or district justice, getting a warrant and heading off with their warrant to any house in any location or to any building around the country. That is a worrying development.  There must be a point very close to the initiating of an inquiry where Customs and Excise would hand over to the very experienced, trained and equipped drug squad of the Garda Síochána the carrying on of that <Col N="1517" /> kind of work, getting the warrant and pursuing down the line, in co-operation with Customs and Excise people, any drugs inveigled into the country, spirited away from the point of contact and hidden in buildings.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong about all this and the Government and the Minister are intent that Customs and Excise would have this expanded role, it becomes clear that there must be some form of independent policing and we are talking about a departure in policing far wider than any suggestion of marginal addition.  We are getting a completely new dimension to the policing of drug trafficking that is not necessary in view of the resources, expertise and successes of the drugs squad to date in dealing with this problem.  In fact, at this time there is a trend in an opposite direction.  The chief superindendent of the north-east sector of the Garda Síochána in the city of Dublin is intending shortly to open up a Garda sub-office on the tarmac within the confines of the airport at Dublin.  His belief is that the Garda Síochána should have a presence in close co-operation with the other policing agencies within the airport.  That is the movement within the Garda Síochána.  This Bill tends to suggest the opposite move.</P>
    <P>Very wide powers are vested in these persons.  I will not have an opportunity until later in the evening to consider the Minister's memorandum with regard to who those persons are, but the contribution the last day indicated it could be anyone within the Department of Finance called upon to act in support of the officers in the full employ of the Garda Síochána.  The wide scope of the powers coupled with the wide catchment of the person who will be invested with these powers require some form of regulation, of independent control, so that persons out and abroad will be answerable if they overstep the mark.</P>
    <P>Lest it be suggsted that I am engaged in some form of attack on the Customs and Excise officers, I make the point that that is not what I am about, just as I do not in any way seek to cast aspersions <Col N="1518" /> upon the Garda Síochána as a force in suggesting that modern day policing, as has been accepted by this House in the previous term, requires independent complaints investigations procedures, and this has been conceded this very week by the authorities in Northern Ireland. Where people are given powers that impinge upon our liberty, property and free movement, it is essential that they are subjected to regulations that require independent inquiry and independent access for those seeking to make a complaint about the abuse of those powers. Customs and Excise officers operate in plain clothes.  Unlike the Garda Síochána in the city of Dublin and, I hope the Minister accepts, other parts of Dublin they are not obliged to carry on their clothing indentifying marks of their rank or number.  The identifying marks are there for a purpose, that the Garda can be made answerable to complaint if and when it arises; they are identifiable for the purposes of being answerable for their activities in exercise of their powers.</P>
    <P>The first principle says we are all entitled to our liberty, free of interference; then we legislate to give extraordinary powers to persons in positions of responsibility or policing.  As a result of this Bill, Customs and Excise men will be in almost the same position in terms of power and authority as members of the Garda Síochána.  They will not have the same period of time during which they can detain a person, but they have powers of detention, and it matters little to the ill-intentioned officer whether he has one hour or 12 hours if he is to abuse his power.  It matters even less to the person who is detained if he or she is subjected to any abuse whether it is one hour or 12 hours.  The power of detention is there, the power of search is there, the power of seizure is there, and the Customs and Excise use of power in the past of seizing property has been a matter of public comment.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will have forgotten the series of articles carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> not many years ago complaining about the apparent excesses by Customs and Excise in seizing property, <Col N="1519" /> motor cars and so on and the great difficulty people had in getting redress.  There is more to this then meets the eye.  It seems that two things have to be suggested.  The fact that this Bill does not emanate from the Department of Justice suggests that it is &mdash; if I may use the term &mdash; a little less sinister.  The point has to be made that we would have a major&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan is making many interesting points but I am not sure they are all entirely relevant to his amendment or to Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage the Deputy is required to indicate with what precisely in the section he is taking issue or to sing the praises of his own amendment.  I do not think I have heard Deputy McCartan do either.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to appreciate you ruling.  Perhaps I should read the amendment again and explain what it is about.  The amendment seeks the non-implementation of the powers under sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  The powers of search, detention and seizure should not come into effect until there is established a body that would investigate and receive complaints from members of the public against officers exercising those powers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very brief in my initial remarks because I wanted to hear the response of the Minister before I stated why I believe it is important to have such a body.  I was attempting to in some way address the suggestion that what is being proposed in this Bill by way of additional power is a marginal addition to what was already there.  I am trying to explain the importance, from the civil libertarian point of view, of having some form of independent complaints investigation. In short, I am saying that I believe that the code of powers contained in this Bill, in addition to what already exists, is such as to give to customs <Col N="1520" /> officers very similar, though perhaps not as extensive, powers as are invested at the moment in members of the Garda Síochána in dealing with suspects.  For that reason and no other there should be uniformity of procedure in dealing with complaints if and when they arise.  One would hope that complaints would never arise but I think the Minister and every Deputy in this House, as practical men and women, must realise that the inevitable happens, that complaints will arise and that members of the public should have the redress to pursue their complaints before an independent body who will investigate and adjudicate on them, a procedure that all members of the Garda Síochána are currently subjected to and which is perceived by the public to be an effective and fair way of dealing with such matters.  I appreciate the constraints under which the Minister is pursuing this Bill and the amendments to it.  I ask him to bring this amendment back to his colleagues in the Cabinet with the reasons I have advanced.  I hope that we can revert to this matter again at a later stage if the Minister is not prepared to concede to it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the House I will reiterate much of what I have said in the Seanad and here pertaining to the powers of search that are currently available, and were available before this Bill was comtemplated, to officers of Customs and Excise.  Customs officers may search, without warrant, any person who has entered the State by land, sea or air, or any person suspected of an offence in relation to the exportation of goods. Customs officers may search aircraft and ships or vehicles within 20 miles of the land frontier and vehicles anywhere else in the State upon reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  Customs officers may also search, under warrant, any house, shop, cellar, warehouse or other place. That is the law as it currently stands which empowers customs officers to search people and places, with or without warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An all-party committee of this House, the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness <Col N="1521" /> and Vandalism, recommended the extension to customs officers of the powers of search already assigned to the Garda Síochána under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The Garda, who have the general job of implementing law and order and ensuring that all criminal activities are taken care of, have a specific function pertaining to drugs.  In order to assist the Garda it is now proposed, as a result of an all-party committee of this House, that similar specialist powers be given to the customs officers in an effort to combat the drugs problem.  There is absolute consistency in this.  We are not proposing to give to customs officers the same powers as the Garda Síochána have.  They have a totally different role to play, a very general role with clear specifics.  The customs officers also have a specific role to play.  Both the Garda Síochána and the customs officers have specific duties to perform in relation to drugs.  Customs officers are constrained as of today <i>vis-à-vis</i> their facility to deal with the drugs problem and we are asking that this would be reconciled and synchronised and that the Garda and the customs officers, in their handling of the drugs problem, would have an absolutely consistent system under which to operate.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy McCartan has said.  I would like to remind the House that sections 2 and 3 &mdash; we are dealing with section 2 &mdash; plug a real gap in the powers of search of customs officers in relation to drugs.  The Government are therefore anxious that these powers be assigned as expeditiously as possible.  The amendment now before us can only add to the delay in the assignment of these powers and to no particular purpose because the customs service discharges its duties with efficiency and courtesy, as, I think, the vast majority of experienced international travellers would concede. <Col N="1522" /> Moreover, there are existing statutory channels of appeal and complaints may be laid with the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Finance or the Ombudsman who would fully investigate them.</P>
    <P>I would like to correct one point made by Deputy McCartan, in that he inferred that I suggested that all staff of the Department of Finance would be given these powers.  What I said was that the customs officers within the Revenue Commissioners, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, would be given these powers.  We are talking about fewer than 700 people in the customs service who are actively involved in apprehending and enforcing the various customs Acts.  The fact that the Garda consider that they would need to have a sub-station at Dublin Airport is, I hope, a clear indication of the role they play and the role of the Customs and Excise officers, and the two agencies of State doing a similar job in a specific area.  It would be very good if we were to ensure that there would be automatic on-the-ground co-operation at any given time.  I would welcome such a move.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept what I say in good faith.  We have given detailed consideration to the points raised on Second Stage in this House and in the debate in the Seanad.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this is fundamental to the whole issue and to our approach to the Bill.  No view has been expressed that the powers should not be made available to the customs officers. However, as in all matters, I believe a balance must be struck.  For that reason the need for an independent complaints tribunal is an essential prerequisite. Therefore I must press my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2a.</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section (2), to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1)  The Minister for Finance may, where he is of opinion that any <Col N="1525" /> officer of Customs and Excise is by his experience and training a suitable person to exercise the powers conferred on an officer of Customs and Excise by the <i>Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988</i>, by written warrant authorise that officer to exercise such powers.</P>
    <P>(2)  In any proceedings before any Court it shall be presumed that any officer of Customs and Excise who purported to exercise any powers under this Act held a warrant authorising him to do so unless the contrary is proven.</P>
    <P>(3)  A warrant issued under th section shall be in the form prescribed by regulations to be made by the Minister for Finance, who shall have power to amend, vary or revoke any regulation made by him under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to limit the class of persons who can exercise the far-reaching and draconian powers which the provisions of the Bill propose to confer on everyone who is considered in law to be an officer of the Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>It is as well that the substance of what the Minister of State has told the House is his understanding of the law should be read on to the record of the House.  The definition, in section 1, of &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; includes a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; in that context does not mean any person who holds any particular office; the ambit of the definition is wider than that.  It means that any person for the time being can be requested by the Revenue Commissioners or by the State &mdash; quite apart from the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; to carry out duties which relate to the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  Any person, no matter of what standing, quality or training <Col N="1526" /> who is in the public service, who is asked by the Revenue Commissioners, or indeed by the Government for the time being, to carry out those duties falls within the very wide definition of &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; being offered here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this amendment is drawn from section 1 of the Customs (Amendment) Act, 1942 and section 1 of the Customs Act, 1956 which carry an identical definition.  That is true. He also says that the 1942 Act made provision, among other things, for personal searches in respect of the illegal exportation of goods.  The 1956 Act also deals with exportation offences.  The Minister informs the House through this memorandum that both the 1942 and 1956 enactments apply the definition in the 1987 (No. 2) Bill to the entire body of Customs and Excise legislation. Accordingly the existing powers of search without warrant assigned to Customs and Excise officers apply to those persons covered by the definition, which this new Bill contains as well and which may be regarded as the standard definition of a Custom and Excise officer.</P>
    <P>With respect, this calls into question the entire issue as to whether we are prepared to invest in certain people wide-ranging powers in relation to other people, powers which are, in effect, a right to curtail their civil liberties of movement, their right to liberty and the right not to be interfered with and searched.  If we are going to give those powers to a wide group of people, the definition of which is unduly loose, I think we are making a fundamental mistake from the point of view of civil liberties. This is a fundamental civil liberties question.</P>
    <P>Although I fully accept the Minister's reasoning that it is the definition of the officer of Customs and Excise that applies in other enactments, the powers which are now being given do, and this cannot be denied, extend the ambit of an officer of Customs and Excise's activities to cover the right to stop somebody, to detain him, to bring him some where to remove all his clothing if he is of the <Col N="1527" /> same sex as the officer, to search him personally and to use, if necessary, a medical practitioner to search him.  I will return to that issue later.  It is quite clear from the Act that this is a very substantial power and it is a power which is conferred on this very broad definition of officers which, as I said, could include a porter in a Civil Service office who is asked to help out by a Customs and Excise officer or somebody who, for the time being, the Revenue Commissioners have pressed into service regardless of whether that person had any training, qualification or necessary knowledge of the law.  This is very far reaching.  None of these temporary officers of Customs and Excise who could come into existence under this definition have to have any legal qualification or knowledge.  I am not suggesting that they should be lawyers but I do suggest that they should have a knowledge of their powers and how precisely they are expected to carry out their powers.  That involves a degree of training. It seems to be a fundamental error to give these wide powers to people who are untrained and who are not responsible to any particular group, disciplinary body or disciplinary or complaints system.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House that at present only the Garda Síochána and certain officers of the Revenue Commissioners exercise the existing powers of search confered by Customs and Excise legislation and that it is not intended to change this practice.  I do not care what the intentions of the Minister are.  When the Offences Against the State Act was made part of the statute law of this country, the intentions of the Legislature were very different from the practice and operation of the Act as it now is.  The courts have interpreted the Act literally and in accordance with its ordinary meaning.  It is not good enough in the area of basic civil liberties to rely on statements of intent.  The law is the law and the rule of law requires that it should be carefully tailored to meet the exact need for which it is being enacted and that it will go no <Col N="1528" /> further than is reasonably necessary to achieve its aims.</P>
    <P>Therefore, anybody who has proposals to invest in a particular class of the community powers of an extensive kind which they can operate in respect of other persons has a relative duty to come before this House with a tailor-made and tight definition of the people to whom these powers are to be given and to exclude from the possible exercise of these powers &mdash; as a matter of law and not as a matter of ministerial intention, which is something that can come and go like the will-o-the wisp &mdash; people who ought not to exercise them.  It is not good enough to say that the Revenue Commissioners are men who act in good faith and that they will employ only people who in their judgment are for the time being suitable to carry out these powers. The simple fact is that an inexperienced trainee on his very first day in his job as a public servant is given these powers, potentially, under this Act and there is no legal redress or remedy to somebody in respect of whom those powers are invoked and who suffers as a consequence. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells the House in his memorandum that there are 675 such officers at present, all of whom carry identification which must be produced on request.  As Deputy McCartan has pointed out, and so far as I can see, most of them operate in plain clothes.  I appreciate fully that at some points of entry and exit a considerable number of Customs and Excise officers wear their uniform but those who are about the business of detecting abuses frequently wear plain clothes.  I have seen them doing so and I know that they do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister assures the House in the memorandum that it is intended that the new powers of search sought in this Bill will be exercised by the 675 officers only. If that is the Minister's intention why does he not bring in a law to that effect? If he is saying that these 675 people are the ones to whom these powers are intended to be given why not put down a statutory definition which restricts those <Col N="1529" /> powers to those 675 people and to members of the Garda?  Why not do so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not automatic and I will tell you precisely why it is not automatic. On the last occasion the Minister conceded to Deputy Noonan that a public servant who was for the time being asked to assist the Revenue Commissioners or who was transferred temporarily to the Revenue Commissioners would fall within the definition of these officers of Customs and Excise.  The Minister later indicated to the House a slightly more disturbing fact &mdash; that section 22 of the 1940 Finance Act, provides that every member of the Defence Forces who is authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to act as an officer of Customs and Excise shall have and possess and may use and exercise the powers and authority of an officer of Customs and Excise.</P>
      <P>The inexorable consequence of these Acts and the whole customs code being read as one is that every private soldier and recruit in the Army is a potential exerciser of these powers if the Revenue Commissioners ask him to do so.  Every recruit has the right in the vicinity &mdash; whatever that ridiculously vague phrase means &mdash; of an airport or port to arrest somebody, detain him, search him and physically strip him of his clothing provided the member of the Defence Forces is one authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to assist and is somebody who is of the same sex as the person he has reasonable grounds to suspect has controlled drugs on his person.  That is too broad a definition.  Of course, it is easy for the Minister to come to this House and say that he does not intend, and that it is highly unlikely, that members of the Defence Forces would be used in these circumstances but the fact is that the basic civil liberties are an issue &mdash; the liberty of not being arrested except by somebody who knows what he is about and is required by law to know what he is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is bringing in a Bill the second section of which as at present <Col N="1530" /> constituted allows members of the Defence Forces to have very extensive powers to search, detention and personal inspection, including body searches, of ordinary civilians just because the Revenue Commissioners authorise them to carry out those functions.  This Bill could be drafted so as to exclude members of the Defence Forces from carrying out these functions and the Minister has said that that is his intention, but he will not put that into the law, for some reason.  I submit that is wrong.  If he wants these 675 people to be the only ones who exercise these powers, why does he not say that notwithstanding section 22 of the Finance Act of 1940, the members of the Defence Forces shall not exercise these powers?  Why should he not say that people on temporary assignment to the Revenue Commissioners or under their temporary authority shall not exercise those functions?</P>
    <P>The clear way of getting around this difficulty is to require that any person who is intended to exercise these specific new powers contained in sections 2 and 3 should be somebody specially authorised by the Minister for Finance so to do. There is no reason why this should not be done.  It would not be the end of the world, or be a huge complication, or cost that much money if the Minister were to agree to an amendment, the gist of which would be to confine these powers to authorised officers as opposed to the generality of Customs and Excise officers which is an unconscionably wide definition in the context of a power of this kind.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2a on the list of additional amendments states in its first part of the proposed new section 2 that the Minister for Finance where he is of opinion that any officer of Customs and Excise is by his experience and training a suitable person to exercise the powers conferred on an officer of Customs and Excise by this Bill &mdash; which would then be an Act &mdash; may then by written warrant authorise that officer to exercise such powers.</P>
    <P>Then there is the related amendment No. 7a which states that only authorised officers of Customs and Excise would be entitled to exercise these powers.  Perhaps <Col N="1531" /> the Minister may have difficulty with my drafting and it may not be perfect &mdash; that I do not know.  I cannot see any reason, if you are going to give these new powers of arrest, detention and strip-searching to individuals, why you should not put in place a reasonable safeguard which is that the Minister or somebody under his control has especially to authorise an officer to be a person who can exercise those powers and that he has to do so by reference to his view of his experience and training.  Is there any legitimate reason why an untrained and inexperienced person should be given these powers?  I submit there is none.  It is wrong, on the face of it, to do so.  If the Minister asked 100 people whether they thought that correct, he would be told they did not.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism asked for equality of rights for customs officers and members of An Garda Síochána but no recruit in Templemore is ever put into the front line to organise the fight against drugs.  Any recruit in Templemore who misbehaves in the course of a search is subject to a very rigid and strict disciplinary code.  I have no crow to pluck with the public service in general but I will say this, that in relation to the exercise of these powers there must be a very strong disciplinary regime which goes along with such a power.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to Deputy McCartan, mentioned the green and red channels in Dublin Airport.  I have seen what has happened at these channels. Most Members of this House have gone through the green channel on occasion and have been stopped and asked to open their baggage.  That is a spot check and I am sure that everybody wonders from time to time on what basis a spot check is carried out.  Is it that you look shifty, or that the official is stopping every fifth person, or that you look as if your pockets are bulging with excess duty-free goods or whatever?  Nobody knows the mind of a customs official, which is probably just as well; otherwise they would simply tailor their appearance or behaviour to <Col N="1532" /> suit.  This is fundamentally a matter of hunch.  I have seen young people, in particular, coming from places like Amsterdam and London, who are not respectable-looking people in suits, being stopped.  They have beards, wear anoraks and open-toed sandals and perhaps have a guitar over their shoulders.  They are stopped with great regularity and subjected to a much greater degree of scrutiny on the grounds that they are, quite rationally, more likely to be involved &mdash; as the customs officer believes &mdash; in bringing in drugs for their own use, or are more likely to be of an age group where that type of thing would occur.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, to give somebody a right to stop somebody else, to require him or her to go to a room, to submit to being strip-searched, as this Bill as at present constituted clearly contemplates, requires that those powers must be exercised only by experienced people who have received training, people subject to a strong code of discipline.  Just because a smart remark is passed in the green channel, or there is a little reluctance on the part of the examinee, these powers must not be invoked on an arbitrary basis. There must be this co-relative disciplinary code, the sanctions which apply to a member of An Garda Síochána.  A member of An Garda Síochána who uses his powers improperly does so subject to the threat that he will be disciplined, fined and punished, in terms of his career and his promotional prospects, if he makes an error of this kind.  There is an authority now to consider complaints against members of An Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that an untrained person without any experience should exercise the same powers without any of the same or co-relative disciplinary inhibitions on his behaviour.  It is equally the case that somebody who attempts to exercise powers of this kind should be excluded until such time as somebody in responsibility, such as the Minister for Finance, decides that by reason of his training and experience he is a fit and proper person to carry out these duties. That should not be just a matter of grace and favour on the part of the Minister for <Col N="1533" /> Finance, it should be a matter of his legal obligation.</P>
    <P>That is why these 675 people to whom the Minister says these powers are intended to apply should be the only persons to whom they apply and, even among them, that it is only those who receive training or who are sufficiently experienced should be entitled to exercise those powers.  We as a House, irrespective of party or personal view on many ideological or economic issues, have a common duty as legislators to ensure that civil liberties are protected and that these wide-ranging powers are confined to a group of people who have the requisite training and experience to operate them.</P>
    <P>I also put into the amendment, to make it workable and prevent anybody from attempting to avoid its consequences, a presumption that in court proceedings &mdash; a presumption which could be overturned, of course &mdash; a person who purported to exercise these powers had a warrant authorising him to do so.  He could be asked to produce it by somebody who said he did not have it or he could be asked if he had such a warrant.  Therefore, there is a concession to practicality, designed to make sure that I am not erecting an insuperable obstacle or a major operational impediment to the proper protection of this country from the importation or wrongful exportation of drugs.  It is reasonable, in the circumstances, to cut down the ambit of this power.  The right way to do it is to require the Minister, or some officer under the Minister, to exercise a particular faculty of judgment in respect of the capacity and suitability of that person to carry out these powers.</P>
    <P>Nothing I am proposing would in any way delay the coming into operation of the Bill and, therefore, the reasons tendered by the Minister for rejecting Deputy McCartan's amendment &mdash; with which I disagree &mdash; do not apply in this case.  It is not the case that by introducing an amendment to this effect the Bill will be delayed in its operation or made more difficult to operate.  All it requires is that a warrant of the officer should exist in relation to these specific powers.  I know <Col N="1534" /> the Minister of State will say that every officer of Customs and Excise has written identification and a warrant of appointment but that does not mean that he is trained and qualified to exercise these powers.  I am suggesting that these powers require a degree of subtlety and training which, as the Bill concedes, are difficult and sensitive.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer the House to section 2 (1) (i) (c) which says that where a search of a person being detained involves removal of clothing other than &mdash; and then there is a list of external clothing &mdash; no officer or person of the opposite sex shall be present unless that person is a designated medical practitioner or the officer considers that the presence of that person is necessary by reason of the violent conduct of the person to be searched. It is quite clear from that phraseology that strip searching is contemplated, that external clothing can be removed in the presence of an officer of the opposite sex but that when you come to non-external clothing, in other words, the ordinary clothes that a person wears which, I suggest, include underwear or overwear, it could only be done in the presence of a person of the same sex.  That, by implication, clearly indicates that there can be strip searching of a person detained under this section.</P>
    <P>A search of a person may be carried out by a designated medical practitioner. Does that include internal searching?  I do not want to be excessively crude but if we are talking about vaginal or anal searches, why are we not told that that is what is being discussed?  Can that be requested by an untrained and inexperienced 18 year old who just happens to come within the definition of a Customs and Excise officer?  That is a a very draconian measure, that a young man or woman on their first day at the airport are give the right, because they are customs officers, to request a medical practitioner to assist in an internal search of another citizen's body.  It is a very far-reaching power; we read about it in Armagh and say it is wrong &mdash; perhaps some of us say it is a necessary evil &mdash; but it is certainly something which will give rise to very <Col N="1535" /> considerable disquiet.  Why should it be open to people without experience or qualifications to do that as a matter of law?  Why should we have to depend on the good intentions of the Minister of State, which are his intentions now but which may not apply in some isolated Border post or airport on a bank holiday weekend when nobody will have access to the courts to put things right?</P>
    <P>We should adopt an amendment which confines these powers to people who have been expressly authorised by virtue of their experience, age and suitability, to exercise those powers and to carry them out.  It is not opposition for opposition's sake.  This is the stuff of which civil liberties are made and the kind of legislation which chips away constantly at civil liberties. I would not mind the Minister taking an obdurate view of this amendment if I was suggesting something that would make the Bill more difficult to operate or more impractical.  I am merely suggesting that the Minister for Finance should designate the officers by reference to their age and experience as suitable persons to exercise these powers.  If any respect is paid to the concept of civil liberties and to the vindication of people's rights under the Constitution to which we are all subject, I cannot for the life of me see why the Minister cannot accept an amendment which requires him to select those officers who, by their age, experience and training, are suitable people to exercise such powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy McDowell's amendment which affords us the opportunity to revert to the very first issue that was addressed by the Deputies in opposition to the Bill and some of the provisions of the first amendment dealing with the definition of officer of Customs and Excise.  It is important that we revert to that issue because we now have the advantage of the helpful memorandum prepared by the Minister as promised in the last discussion.  The intent of the memorandum is to identify and clarify the Government's interpreation of the various measures that <Col N="1536" /> bore upon the definition of officer within the ambit of Customs and Excise.  There has been a great deal of confusion and the permutations and numbers of personnel who could be caught by the definition were becoming almost endless and gave rise to a great deal of concern.</P>
      <P>The other benefit of discussing and reverting to this issue by reason of the amendment is that we now realise that, on the defeat of the previous amendment in the name of The Workers' Party, we are dealing with a group of officers who would be exercising their authority without the benefit of supervision by an independent complaints body which was proposed.  That being so, it is very important to consider afresh who, and in what circumstances, will people be allowed to exercise the powers to be conferred upon them under sections 2 and 3.  The amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell is an eminently suitable one because it throws on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance a positive duty to form an opinion and to issue a warrant of authority to such members of his staff within the Customs and Excise who he feels are the appropriate persons to enforce the powers.  That in itself is a useful device to ensure that proper standards apply and that where we invest wide powers of authority in members of the community, they are carried out by persons who have been scrutinised and found to be eminently suitable to carry out the particular duties.</P>
      <P>The point was made by Deputy McDowell &mdash; and it is a very proper and correct one &mdash; that the definition within section 1 of officers of Customs and Excise is so wide as to be all-embracing. The definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; under that section includes:</P>
      <P>... a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister tells us, in response to Deputy McDowell's amendment, and on the strength of his memorandum, that on Report Stage he intends to introduce an <Col N="1537" /> amendment to reflect the intention or, in his view, the restricted definition of that term, I will be happy to sit down and accept that as an achievement.  In that event perhaps Deputy McDowell, with grace, will acknowledge that his amendment served a useful purpose.  If it is the Minister's intention to give the precise definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo;, as suggested in the memorandum, to be that of 675 identifiable persons we will have achieved a lot in this debate but I suspect that will not be so.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the memorandum that definitions in other pieces of legislation indicated that not only are we talking about those 675 officers immediately employed in Customs and Excise but about 1,115 officers involved in other work in the area, all the personnel in the public service, the members of the Army, the Naval Service and the Garda Síochána.  It is hard to know where the definition will stop.  It is because that is such a wide and all-embracing definition that the need for scrutiny at some level is essential.  I accept that the memorandum was produced for our assistance but while it contains a stated intent it cannot have impact on our consideration unless it is backed up with a legislative amendment to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell has recalled the debate on the Offences Against the State Act and what was said about it in the course of its passage through the House. He recalled it was said then that its provisions would be confined to unlawful organisations but we all know that that has not been the case.  Some people may say that that is not a terribly bad thing but that was not what was stated when the Bill was going through the House. When the Forcible Entry and Occupation Act was going through the House in 1971 a Deputy, who is well known to Deputy McDowell, indicated to the House that it would never be used to deal with occupations or demonstrations by workers involved in disputes.  That was a remark by Deputy O'Malley but, because the Bill was so widely drafted and did not have any specific restrictions, it was later used <Col N="1538" /> to deal with trade union members and workers involved in disputes with employers during which they occupied buildings.</P>
    <P>Ministerial intent or declaration at the time legislation is presented is not law, is never part of and will never be law.  It can never be relied on if a Bill that is widely drafted is used to its full potential. Will the Minister indicate if he intends to introduce a more specific amendment on Report Stage?  If he does not I must press him, for all the reasons outlined by Deputy McDowell concerning the range and depth of powers contained in sections 2 and 3, to introduce some form of scrutiny, some form of policing within the Department so that this does not remain the <i>ad hoc</i> regime that seems to leap out from the definition section.  I am referring to the number of persons who could be defined as officers within the meaning of the Bill and the use of the words, who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we debated the Bill the Minister said that officers must be afforded the latitude of calling in from the Department, and Customs and Excise, other people to assist in operations that are wider than anticipated. This notion of calling in people for the time being to relieve officials, this <i>ad hoc</i> method, is not a satisfactory way to deal with legislative provisions that have wide-ranging implications in regard to civil liberties. It is important to emphasise that we are not talking about marginal additions to existing legislation.  This represents a major departure in policing generally in regard to drugs and the relationship between Customs and Excise and the Garda Síochána in their investigation and detection of drug offences.  We are not dealing with just another piece of legislation.  Deputy McDowell's amendment is a small gesture to try to ensure that proper standards are applied and that abuses are not allowed to creep in for whatever reason.  I commend the amendment to the Minister <Col N="1539" /> and I should like to ask him to give it serious consideration.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome the amendment in so far as it gives us an opportunity to debate some of the issues that arose when we were discussing section 1.  I agree with the case made by Deputies McDowell and McCartan.  The latter will recall that both of us recited similar arguments at an earlier stage in the debate.  It is good that they are being presented again.  On the last occasion the debate centred on an amendment in my name which sought to delete the words, &ldquo;who is for the time being&rdquo;, from the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 1.  I withdrew my amendment on the understanding that I would resubmit it on Report Stage if I was still not satisfied about the scope of the application of that definition.</P>
      <P>The Minister's explanation in the memorandum is helpful and is more precise than that given on the last occasion when we debated the Bill.  If what the Minister says was written into the Bill in some form it would satisfy all of us.  We are worried about the wide range of people who could exercise power under the Bill.  I am not sure if the suggestion put forward by Deputy McDowell is the best way to confine the powers of the Bill.  Legislation such as this that impinges so strongly on civil liberties, legislation that is so necessary to combat the awful ravages of drug abuse in our community and stretches the powers of police officers and customs officers into an area where if abused will impinge on civil liberties, should be examined very carefully.  To vest the power in the Minister for Finance to decide who should exercise the powers of the Bill is not the way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is such a serious case it should be left to the House to decide who should exercise the powers.  I would prefer an amendment that would change the definition section to the amendment before us which delegates the powers of the House to the Minister for Finance and allows him on warrant to decide who may, or may not, exercise this power.  He <Col N="1540" /> will be constrained somewhat.  He will have to take into account the experience and training of people exercising the power in order to decide if they would be suitable persons.  That is very loose.  If one has never exercised the power of strip searching previously, how can one's experience be used as a criterion?  &ldquo;Training&rdquo; is also a loose term.  Would it be in order for the Minister to hold a two-day seminar for appropriate officers and then authorise all of them to exercise the powers contained in this Bill?</P>

However, if the amendment is pressed we will not support it at this point of the proceedings.  The appropriate amendment should be made in the definition section and I will be re-entering my amendment to confine the definitions to members of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  My main concern is the phrase &ldquo;who is for the time being&rdquo;.  That phrase makes the definition so elastic that it could extend to any of us in certain circumstances.  In serious legislation like this which has the potential to impinge on all our rights the House should decide who has the new power and it should be clearly stated on the face of the Bill.  We should not delegate, even to a distinguished member of the Cabinet such as the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Customs officers already discharge their functions under a warrant issued by the Revenue Commissioners and accordingly this amendment is unnecessary.  I have previously made the point that the powers of search already assigned to customs officers are substantial.  The powers here sought are a relatively marginal increment to the existing powers and so the operation of a separate warrant in respect of this Bill is not appropriate.  Moreover the Revenue Commissioners are the employers of customs officers, not the Minister for Finance, which illustrates my earlier statement <i>vis-á-vis</i> staff of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I want to clear up a number of points. It is not and never has been the intention or the practice to recruit a person into the Customs and Excise section of the Revenue Commissioners and to put him immediately in the front line.  Neither upon appointment have such persons been asked to do strip searches, body searches or frisking.  Neither has it been the practice to appoint members of the Defence Forces to do this type of work, nor is it intended.  We want to maintain the position whereby they would be available as a back-up to assist with, to observe, to maintain and to be of help to the Customs and Excise officers in the carrying out of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Customs officers receive extensive training.  Initially there is a three-month period of preliminary training, followed by on-the-job training as an unattached officer moving from station to station doing different jobs.  Inexperienced officers do not operate except under close supervision from senior officers and as part of an experienced team.  There seems to be an attitude prevailing in the House that inexperienced customs officers are being asked to do very serious <Col N="1542" /> jobs.  That has never happened and will not happen in the future.  Only those who get a warrant of appointment exercise the powers and already these powers of personal search are available to Customs and Excise officers.</P>

I will read for the information of Deputies a warrant of appointment.

The said John Edward <Col N="1543" /> Farrell to observe and obey all such orders, instructions and directions which have been received, or which will be received from time to time, from the said Commissioners and to hold the appointment of Officer of Customs and Excise at the will and pleasure of the Government.  The warrant is signed and dated by the Revenue Commissioner.</P>
    <P>That warrant is issued to the corps of 675 Customs and Excise officers. Approximately 80 per cent of those people are uniformed officers, so they are easily identifiable.  A new officer of Customs and Excise has the status of unattached officer, which means that he moves from job to job at different stations. He would never be allowed to take part in a strip search or anything of that nature in the early part of his career.  He is always subject to disciplinary action if he goes further than he should or is allowed go.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell who moved the amendment covered a fairly wide area of ground and we will have to accept that the whole range of Customs and Excise law has operated successfully for a century or more.  In section 2 we are taking the powers of search for drugs in order to deal with meeters and greeters where a gap exists in the law.  Deputy McDowell must be aware, as I am, that substantial powers of search already exist for customs officers and I am satisfied, and I think the House will be satisfied, that these powers have been exercised with restraint and with integrity over the years.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that the Minister for Finance does not employ Customs and Excise officers, they are employed by the Revenue Commissioners, and that we are not talking about giving these powers out <i>ad lib</i> to anybody, only to the person who holds a warrant, who has extensive training and who is only appointed and given powers after a long period.  I have taken into account all of what the Deputies have said and I would like to be as accommodating as I can.  I regret that I cannot accept these amendments but I <Col N="1544" /> am prepared to accede to a request to have another look at the definition before Report Stage.  As the Minister for Finance does not appoint Customs and Excise officers these amendments are irrelevant as such even though we can accept and debate, as we have done, the content and meaning embodied in them. For that reason I ask the House to accept my rejection of the amendments and to accept my undertaking that I will have another look at the definition before Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): We have received a very interesting response from the Minister of State and I am glad that he has given a commitment to have another look at the definition.  In doing so he might accept the following suggestion. I was interested in his reading of the facsimile warrant.  If the Minister of State were to change the definition section so that officer of Customs and Excise would read, &ldquo;includes a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service employed under warrant of the Revenue Commissioners in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods&rdquo;, that would confine it and would satisfy us, in other words, a phrase to include the idea of appointment under warrant of the Revenue Commissioners in the definition section.  That would meet my objection and we could take it on from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Noonan has said and I thank the Minister of State for demonstrating an openness of mind on this issue.  It seems that he could define in the definition section an officer of the Customs and Excise by a qualification that the officer, for the purposes of this Act, must hold a warrant under the 1872 Excise Management Act or the Customs Consolidation Act and the two sections which the Minister of State has cited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only worried about the powers under sections 2 and 3, I am not worried about the other powers.  The definition section deals with the definition of an officer of Customs and Excise throughout <Col N="1545" /> the whole Act.  There are other circumstances where they can do various things where I would be worried about them having special qualifications.  This particular qualification is only in sections 2 and 3.  I accept that my amendment may have drafting frailties and it may be that the best thing to do would be to provide in sections 2 and 3 that an officer of Customs and Excise should not exercise the power unless he holds a warrant. You are not excluding from the general extension in extreme emergency cases members of the Defence Forces but in relation to that power you do say that a soldier, for instance, can never stripsearch somebody unless he is assisting somebody physically present with him who has a warrant.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is plenty of room for manoeuvre.  As long as the Minister of State can give me an assurance that he is positively disposed towards the principle of what he stated in his memorandum, which is that the intention is that the power should be exercised by warranted officers under the 1872 Act and the Customs Consolidation Act, I am quite willing not to press the amendment.  I do that without asking him to commit himself to the course I have just suggested or to the course Deputy Noonan has suggested. I am sure the principle can be happily accommodated in some way by a fairly short and tightened amendment to the Bill in the Minister's name on Report Stage when he could bring forward an amendment, the gist of which would be that sections 2 and 3 are ones which cannot be the subject matter of an extension or of a temporary appointment of a fellow who happens to normally check for bovine TB or foot-and-mouth disease at an airport to stand in while somebody else is out at lunch.  That is the kind of thing that I want to prevent.  I want to make sure that people have training. There is no problem about doing this if the Minister of State and his advisers set their minds to drafting a suitable amendment. If I get an indication from the Minister of State along those lines I will pull back amendments, 2a, 2b, 5a, 5b and 7a.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief remarks in regard to what the Minister of State has said.  I was glad to see that his remarks were drafted cautiously and that the powers are not just being referred to as marginal additions but marginal increments to the powers which already exist.  As we are all now looking again at matters I would like to re-emphasise that there is very curious phrasing in sections 2 and 3 which befuddles the mind when one talks about impreciseness.  Let us look at section 3 (3) which deals with the power of search on warrant.  I would like to quote part of it:</P>
      <P>A search warrant issued under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named officer of Customs and Excise, accompanied by such other officers of Customs and Excise and such other persons as may be necessary ...</P>
      <P>That is the incredible definition that has not in any way been explained.  I suppose we will come to it later when we discuss section 3.  Section 3 contains a far more worrying regime than section 2.  In the context of talking about marginal additions or increments I suggest that section 3 goes way beyond anything that ever existed in the range of powers of Customs and Excise officers to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is envisaged is, that with the nod of a peace commissioner &mdash; we will come to talk about that creature later under section 3 and I will have some very hard words to say about him &mdash; or a district justice, Customs and Excise officers would be able to search any building or land anywhere in the State for drugs.  This would not have to be in the pursuit of an investigation which necessarily originated from something which happened at an airport.  Border crossing or port. There would be no necessity for it to be in the active pursuit of something which had occurred or originated at a point of crossing, port or airport when the officers would be in hot pursuit or in hot investigation of an incident which had <Col N="1547" /> occurred at their point of duty.</P>
    <P>This is an entirely different order of things.  It talks about officers at any stage getting a warrant on an unspecified basis and then within a month enforcing that warrant.  In the pursuit of that enforcement they can bring this rather nebulous and curious person with them and such persons as may be necessary.  Who decides who the persons are?  Where do they come from?  Will there be a swearing-in of posses in the high street to head off to invade the properties of persons? Where did this expression come from? Who decides who the persons are and on what basis they become necessary?  That notion written into the Bill is worrying and it accentuates the worry about which Deputy Noonan spoke earlier.</P>
    <P>To go further, in talking about increments and additions to what was originally there, section 2 allows for, as Deputy McDowell indicated, the body search, the penetration body search, but also it allows for an arrest and detention for the purpose of searches in places that are not terribly well specified.  Where does an officer bring a person who is stopped on the road driving a vehicle he wants to search if he decides to take the driver off to a place to be searched?  There is no definition in regard to that.  This Bill allows for the arrest of a person for the purpose of charging that person if he does not comply with a requirement to be detained or to be searched.</P>
    <P>Section 3 allows Customs and Excise persons, as a new departure, to arrest and to detain people until an examination is carried out.  The periods of time involved will be far in excess of anything that a customs officer can employ at the moment.  A person can be detained until a doctor is summoned and brought to whatever place, or to a point of encounter. What happens if the Customs and Excise officers decided to head off to some remote rural area?  The customs officer has power under this Bill to detain and arrest persons until a doctor can be <Col N="1548" /> summoned or until some other arrangements are made to enable the examination to be carried out.  We could well be talking about hours or even longer until an examination is carried out.  We have to scotch this notion of marginal additions because we are talking about a whole new era of policing, a totally new departure, where this legislature envisages that our Customs and Excise officers will move out of their traditional role in the highway accompanied by other unspecified persons who might be necessary to carry out searches under these sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister on Report Stage must address these points which are of major concern.  They must be addressed in the context of my not accepting that we are dealing with marginalised changes or alterations.  Even if I lose this argument and the Minister can convince me by quoting chapter and verse that these changes are marginal, the situation which will exist from the passing of this Bill requires us to address very seriously to whom we will give these powers and under what circumstances.  The Garda Síochána are being rapidly overtaken by the Customs and Excise officers with regard to the powers under this section. Gardaí must have two years minimum training, formal in-house training and then on-the-beat training under supervision by an officer with the rank of sergeant or higher for the initial period. Under this Bill men and women will be afforded three months training before going out on the beat so to speak and there is no question of supervision or of the necessity to be accompanied by persons of higher rank.  That is another feature of this Bill that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The reason Deputy McDowell's amendment is attractive is that it allows for accountability to this House.  If we are not going to have the Complaints Bill, let us have someone who can answer to the Dáil for the appointments, for the misdeeds or the misprints in this thing if it is to be implemented.  I can imagine Deputy Noonan, Deputy McDowell and myself putting down questions to the Minister, <Col N="1549" /> the present Minister being the man who saw the Bill through, and to the Minister for Finance as the person with overall control, asking about incidents that occur at various locations.  We will be asking the Minister, for instance, about the appointment of someone who has overstepped the law or unfortunately misused the powers available.  The answer will come back, not from the Minister, but from the Ceann Comhairle saying that the question has been disallowed because the Minister has no authority and no responsibility in this area and that the matter is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer the suggestion in Deputy McDowell's amendment which means that the Minister must make a positive decision, must evaluate that decision on general suitability criteria and will be in a position to come back here and answer the questions of Deputies when and if things go wrong.  While we would regret things going wrong, it is inevitable that things will go wrong and that mistakes will be made.  That is human nature.  I am not at all happy that the Minister appreciates the level of concern on this side of the House on the issue, or that he appreciates the urgent need to look very carefully at this definition which, if properly defined, will specify precisely who has the powers and will address in some way the question of who can confer the authority provided for in these sections and will also include some element of training, education and accountability.</P>
    <P>All these matters must be looked at on Report Stage if we are to abandon this argument at this point.  These are far wider definition questions than relate to merely taking out a few words or the substitution of a formula.  These questions are not being addressed at all in the context of this Bill and I regret that they have not been addressed by the Minister and his Department in drafting this Bill. Neither has the Minister addressed the implications of these powers in terms of the numbers, accountability and the training of the persons who will eventually <Col N="1550" /> be investigated with such powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been well teased out.  While we are dealing with section 2 Deputy McCartan seems to be dealing with section 3 also.  We appreciate fully the concern expressed by the House on all matters.  In the Seanad we appreciated that and within reason we accepted amendments we thought suitable. We gave them consideration, we came back, maybe we amended them slightly and we accepted them.  We improved the Bill in accordance with the wishes of the House, taking into consideration everything that was said and the effect it would have on existing legislation. Nobody in this House, no Minister, Government Department nor Government of any day want to impose extra measures on any officers of State that are unnecessary.  If there was not a necessity for them the request would not be before this House to give legislative effect to conferring the necessary extended powers on any officer, in this case Customs and Excise officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a recourse any person has, whatever the reason pertaining to any question put to any Minister of any day, at any time, he can complain to the Revenue Commissioners who appoint the customs officers.  The Minister for Finance who lays down policy, the Ombudsman and, of course, the courts are options available to any individual pertaining to action taken on misuse of powers imposed or exercised by an officer of the State.  I assure the House that we will give detailed further consideration to the definition section.  We will try to come up with what we hope will be fairly clear if at all possible.  We must take into account the constraints placed on us and on the Customs and Excise officers, the job they have to do and the reasonable flexibility needed, the existing powers they hold, the powers held by the Garda Síochána and other matters.  We are taking everything into account.  I will come back on Report Stage with what I think feasible and possible.  I suggest to Deputy McDowell, in view of that, that he withdraw <Col N="1551" /> the amendments he has proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will withdraw the amendments on that understanding.  I do not want to teach the draftsmen how to do their job but I suggest that if the definition of &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; is cut back it would have carry through effects on the Bill which would not be necessary.  I am worried about section 2.  I am not sure I am worried about section 3 because the remarks I made about civil liberties presumably will be taken into account by the judicial or quasi-judicial control exercised by a district justice or peace commissioner. Really I am worried about section 2, therefore I ask the Minister of State not to worry about the implications in relation to other sections or changing the definition of &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; if he can restrict its ambit to section 2 or perhaps section 3.  There are all kinds of references later in the Bill to officers of Customs and Excise doing all sorts of strange, technical things, and it would be foolish to have the simple liberties issue cropping up by inference in relation to their other functions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;at or in the vicinity of any port or airport or the Land Frontier.</P>
      <P>We aired this very well on the last day we discussed the issue and I do not want to detain the House very much by going through it again.  The inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;in the vicinity of any port or airport&rdquo; is going to create difficulties when this section is applied.  The powers being given to officers of Customs and Excise under this section, as the Minister says, are intended to deal with meeters and greeters.  Customs and Excise officers have extensive powers already to deal with other categories of people.  If a Customs and Excise officer has reasonable cause to suspect that a person is in the possession of a controlled drug which has been imported or is intended to be exported he may act in certain ways, but the power of a customs officer is confined to a person who is in the vicinity of any port or airport or the land frontier.  There are a number of airports in the country. The Minister gave a figure the last day of 50 or 60.  The land frontier covers a great deal of ground and when we come to ports I presume the Minister is not confining it to seaports and that it will include river ports of all sorts, whether at Carrick-on-Shannon, Athlone or anywhere else.  The definition is wide enough to include any pier or jetty where a boat comes in either under its own steam or otherwise, whether it is a row boat or anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one examines this phrase in a Bill which on the face of it purports to confine the areas in which a particular power can be exercised by customs officers, it seems the power can be exercised anywhere in the country.  It is possible to claim that any place in the country is in the vicinity of a port or airport.  I am sure there are areas in the midst of the mountains which might be exempt, but persons in the midst of the mountains might not be involved in the activities anyway.  A third of the population live <Col N="1553" /> in Dublin.  On the north side you are certainly in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. If you are anywhere in Dublin city moving to the south side you are in the vicinity of the port of Dublin, or Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey or Bray if you move further south.  If you move into west Dublin you are coming into the vicinity of Baldonnell.  Certainly the whole city is covered by this definition.  It would be difficult to find any area in the country where somebody would not claim either for reasons of geography or local pride that they were in the vicinity of a port.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think it extends to ports of call.  I am not making a facetious point for the sake of tidying up the rationality of the Bill.  If an officer of Customs and Excise were to proceed against a person in an area which was not within the precincts of an airport that would be challengeable under this section.  We could have great debates, and I am sure my colleagues with legal qualifications would enjoy the experience in court of arguing that the officer had exceeded his powers because where he operated was not in the vicinity of a port or airport, and the prosecution would argue very strongly that of course it was and if it was not it was a land frontier. We should remove that uncertainty from the Bill.  Persons who are believed to have imported drugs may move far south of the land frontier before the customs officers-get their hands on them.  I would be very disturbed if somebody who, on the basis of the evidence, seemed to be involved in importing a significant amount of drugs or was in possession of drugs which were intended for export was to escape the rigours of the law because it was possible, because of this section, to make the case that the officer of Customs and Excise exercising the powers had acted <i>ultra vires</i> because he was not in the vicinity of a port, an airport or the land frontier when he exercised those powers.  The phrase should be removed <Col N="1554" /> and the section would then read: &ldquo;an officer of the Customs and Excise who, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person is in possession of a controlled drug ... &rdquo;.  That should apply anywhere in the country.  It seems the section will be applied in that manner anyway and it will apply throughout the country.  The Bill should say what we intend it to say and that uncertainty should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would tend to disagree with Deputy Noonan that the power should be made general, because it is so loose.  It would be possible to tighten it up slightly to provide that an officer of Customs and Excise who, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person at, or in the vicinity of, any port, airport or the land frontier is in possession of a controlled drug which was imported or is being or is intended to be exported through that place, should have this power.  Words should be inserted to suggest that you cannot simply arrest somebody because he happens to have marijuana in his pocket, because he happens to have taken a day trip to a port. The intention of the Bill, as I understand it, is to prevent an importation or exportation taking place through a land frontier, a port or an airport.  The mere fact that a day tripper happens to come within the vicinity of a port means that he would then be amenable to arrest by the officers of Customs and Excise.  That is not the intention of the Bill.  It seems that some kind of an amendment could be put down which would relate the suspicion of the officer of Customs and Excise to importation or exportation at the port, airport or area of the land frontier in respect of which the power of arrest exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Noonan is saying, that this provision is very vague but I think it could be made more specific, not by saying what &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo; means but by saying that the suspicion must be that the importation or exportation has taken place through the port, airport or land frontier in respect of which the power is being exercised.  That could easily be done by inserting the words &ldquo;was there imported or is being or is intended to be <Col N="1555" /> there exported&rdquo;.  That would make the position clear.  The problem outlined by Deputy Noonan that Customs and Excise officers would have to go around the country looking at their maps to see where they have powers would be avoided and we would not be making the power a general one by giving customs officers a free rein throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment proposed by Deputy Noonan would be to extend the powers of search here sought from the vicinity of a port, airport or the land frontier to the whole State.  Adequate powers of search in relation to drugs are assigned by the Misuse of Drugs Act to the Garda Síochána. These powers may be exercised anywhere in the State.  The intention of section 2 is to assign similar powers to the customs service, but only in the vicinity of a port, airport or the land frontier.  As regards the position alluded to by Deputy McDowell, what we are trying to trap are the meeters and greeters or day trippers who are receiving these controlled drugs, be they cocaine, marijuana or whatever. When these people are allowed to roam <i>ad lib</i> into a port area, an airport area or a land frontier area and receive drugs or have drugs in their possession, the powers must also be available to deal with them, and this is what the Bill is seeking to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of search here sought for customs officers have already been assigned to the Garda Síochána by the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, with the important distinction that the Garda powers may be exercised anywhere in the State.  The Government view the Misuse of Drugs Act and section 2 of the present Bill as complementary.  Since Garda powers extend throughout the State, it is proposed to confine these new powers of search for customs officers to ports, airports, the land frontier or their vicinities. Basically, the warrant of appointment refers to these areas and states that the customs officers are appointed to work in a particular environment or area. This is in line with the spirit of the existing <Col N="1556" /> powers of search of the customs officers which extend to persons who have entered the State by land, sea or air or who may be suspected of an exporting offence.  In the nature of things, these powers are exercised at the State's land frontier or at ports and airports.  It would be anomalous and impractical to extend formal powers of search for drugs to customs officers throughout the State.  Fewer than 700 officials of the Revenue Commissioners will exercise the powers of search contained in section 2 and, in practical terms, it does not make much sense to empower such officers who are, in the main, on duty at ports, airports or the Border to carry out searches for drugs throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, since the powers here sought are powers of search without warrant the Government are anxious that such powers be confined to the appropriate focus of the customs service, the various points of entry to the State.  Accordingly, I regret I must reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I expected that response.  It is unwise. Identical powers are available to the Garda Síochána at present throughout the State.  There is an attempt here, which is drafted very loosely, to confine the powers being extended to Customs and Excise officers to the areas where Customs and Excise officers normally work. I have a vague memory of reading that Customs and Excise officers operate quite deeply into the country, especially in regard to the land frontier and its vicinity. For example, do the Customs and Excise officers in mobile patrols not come far south, half way to Dublin?  Have we not all heard stories of people being stopped 30 or 40 miles from the Border because the Customs and Excise officers were carrying out their duty very diligently and trying to prevent items being smuggled into the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose a Customs and Excise patrol involved in searching vehicles 30 miles from the Border on the main Dublin road come across a consignment of drugs being imported into the country and they proceed under the terms of this Bill, would <Col N="1557" /> it not be a defence in court that the Customs and Excise officers who were operating without a Garda presence exceeded their powers because they were not in the vicinity of the land frontier.  They were a long way from Dublin and therefore they were not near a port.  The case would be thrown out of court and the importer of illegal drugs would walk away free because the Minister will not accept the reasonable arguments being put forward from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be met but I am not saying that my amendment is the way to do it.  I put down the amendment so that I could speak on the matter and highlight the problem.  I accept the bona fides of the argument that the Minister simply wants the powers to be exercised where Customs and Excise officers normally work.  He does not think it would be appropriate to have the powers vested in Customs and Excise officers extended throughout the State, similar to the powers which the Garda have.  I accept the bona fides and the validity of that argument but in the manner in which the Minister has approached the matter he has created a possible gap in the law through which people involved in drug trafficking may walk away free.  The Minister should close that gap between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>When I moved the Adjournment I was indicating that the ambit of this motion, with the greatest respect and with no acrimony towards Deputy Noonan, was a wee bit pussyfooted, and that while some of his colleagues had accused members of my party of throwing rubbish on the pitch, I thought this motion was so tame as to be seen as kicking the ball in your own penalty area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also indicated the strong view I and my party have that there should be privatisation as an option in virtually every area of public commercial enterprise.  That view is not a religious one or one of religious fervour, it is based on an openness of mind and a flexibility of approach.  I reiterate the call I made last night to the Minister for Finance that the Government should abandon the rigid position taken by the Taoiseach coming up to the last general election when he indicated a total opposition to the concept of privatisation.  It was not warranted then and is most unsuitable now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to use my time this evening to call on the Government to issue a White Paper which goes through the entirety of the public sector, not simply the semi-State commercial area but the public service itself and local government services and local government itself to see what activities in those sectors might better be carried out by others and, in particular, by those in the private sector.  I indicated yesterday, and I reiterate it today, that <Col N="1559" /> there are a vast number of things done by the State to which Government resources are allocated where commercial criteria should hold sway in respect of the allocation of those resources but at the moment do no such thing.</P>
    <P>I have in mind such services as the Ordnance Survey.  There is an arm of the State engaged in the business of producing, printing and updating maps of this country.  I do not profess to be an expert on cartography or on the ins-and-outs of that organisation but it strikes me there are good grounds for suspecting those activities could be carried out with more commercial criteria in mind.  This is not a case where I say on some kind of <i>a priori</i> principle it must be privatised, but it is an institution which could do with examination with a view to seeing whether some or all of its functions might better be carried out by others.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for the State in this day and age to carry on the business of cartography as if we were an imperial power preparing the country for war.  It is not necessary that those involved in producing maps for public and private purposes should necessarily be part of the public sector.  It is not necessarily the case that they should not either.  What I am asking is that the Government should commit themselves at least to a programme of examining all these issues.</P>
    <P>If there was a White Paper on privatisation which was not simply confined to a discussion of the immediate prospects or difficulties which Irish Life would present as a project for privatisation but which was wider in its ambit, I have no doubt many people in the public service would make available to the State in the course of the preparation of that White Paper and in the course of advertising for submissions which I hope would precede it, a great deal of useful advice and would mention areas where there could be privatisation.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that there is no reason to confine the notion of privatisation to the placement of shares with the public in semi-State commercial enterprises which are now limited liability companies. <Col N="1560" /> There are many services carried on by bodies which are not companies but semi-State agencies.  There are other services which are carried out by offices within the public service, such as the Office of Public Works.  There is a host of areas where different forms of privatisation could take place.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at the broadcasting arm of the State to see that certain portions of their activities can easily be carried out by others.  For instance, is it necessary that RTE should own Cablelink? Is it necessary that the State should retain publication of the <i>RTE Guide</i> as a monopoly of RTE?  That is an issue which has never been examined critically by this House.  There is not a body or a commission in this House whose job is to look at all these activities to see if they are worthwhile activities for the State to commit its capital, its supervisory and governmental resources, or if these activities could be carried out more profitably, sensibly, efficiently and better by other people.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government to look afresh at the concept of privatisation, not to see it as an opportunity to place shares but to see it as a way of getting the State to concentrate on what it is imperative for the State to do, that is, to govern the country.  I am asking the Government not to simply dwell on the precise ambit of Deputy Noonan's motion but, on this occasion, to abandon the rigid position adopted by the Taoiseach and to say that every part of the State is a potential area for privatisation.  I am asking them to say there is nothing which, in principle, is excluded, that the Government have an open mind in respect of every sector of the State's activities in order to reduce the size of public indebtedness, to reduce the obligation of the State to finance, fund and supervise various commercial activities and to free the commercial forces of enterprise and competition which are latent in our economy and which at the moment are not being given an opportunity to show themselves.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that my party fully support Deputy Noonan's motion but regret it does not go far enough. <Col N="1561" /> Although we will support this motion by our votes this evening if necessary, it is a pity that Private Members' Time should not be used in a more open-minded and constructive way than simply to deal with one narrow issue.</P>

      <P>As chairman of the committee which produced the report on Irish Life and launched it last week, I wish to pay a compliment to my colleagues on all sides of the House for their input and dedicated service to the committee when producing this report.  I want to put on the record our appreciation of the work done by Cooney Corrigan.  That committee inherited the investigation into Irish Life after the last general election. We went back over some of the ground already covered and decided that we should give all the parties concerned adequate opportunity to update and express their view in order to endeavour to reach conclusions regarding Irish Life which would have a broad consensus of support within the House.</P>
      <P>We met, for the second time &mdash; based on the work of the previous committee &mdash; the chairman, chief executive and senior management of Irish Life, questioned them on their updated views and policies. We also extended an invitation to staff representatives who came before the committee and gave a very comprehensive analysis of their views in regard to the debate that has since arisen and which forms the very core of this report on which everybody is focusing, namely, pages 45 to 53, inclusive.  I would suggest that they formed the basis on which Deputy Michael Noonan tabled his motion in Private Members' time regarding privatisation, the Minister for Finance accepting the intent of the motion on behalf of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the consensus beginning to emerge in regard to Irish Life is <Col N="1562" /> reflected in the general thrust of economic policy throughout the country, that a mixed economy with the State sector where it should be, the private sector where it has a more dynamic role to play, or a combination of both, is the way matters should progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that we would look back on this debate as the starting point of a recognition of the achievements of a number of our very successful semi-State companies.  Failures are always adequately highlighted but successes tend not to make the same headlines.</P>
    <P>The reality in regard to Irish Life is that, as a company, it is very much at the crossroads.  The Minister and Deputy Noonan last evening highlighted the crunch issue for Irish Life.  It has virtually outgrown and monopolised the Irish market.  By reason of that success there is very little room for their further expansion or growth in the Irish market.  They are successful within the existing limitations in the United Kingdom market. They have a very ambitious investment programme in the United States market subject to their having the necessary liquidity and working capital.  Therefore it will be readily seen that privatisation is at the very core of the company's future strategic plans.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the Minister's remarks last evening about the &ldquo;Golden Share&rdquo; option or that other dangerous sounding poison pill type of share arrangement which effectively gives the Government of the day arms length &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; control but which would still allow Irish Life to raise the necessary equity to allow them to expand, allowing them particularly to enter the lucrative market in the United States where there is grave reservation about Governmentowned companies operating from abroad.</P>
    <P>Those are the major possibilities open to Irish Life which must be addressed. While I accept some points made by Deputy McDowell about the publication of a White Paper and so on, it is my opinion that the business in hand is too urgent and that there is a slight contradiction <Col N="1563" /> in what he had to say.  He went on to say decisions needed to be taken. He said we needed to put all of these semi-State companies up for consideration to the private sector in order to ascertain whether they could be made more efficient, yielding a better return to the taxpayer and the public at large. Rather than await the publication of a White Paper we should remember that Irish Life is unique in its success and is therefore a very obvious candidate for consideration for part-privatisation.  I would not for one moment suggest that this House should consider favourably the total privatisation of Irish Life.  It is my belief that the Minister for Finance should retain a substantial shareholding in the company.  Nonetheless the company is now hamstrung, its growth and expansion curtailed.  If it is to continue operating in its present structure it will be unable to create much further employment, which it has the potential to do.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of very complex legal matters that must first be clarified. First there is the original shareholding structure with the &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; policy issue referred to in the report to which I have referred in some detail.  It is said that it may become a test case in the High Court or Supreme Court before the Minister can take any definitive decision on the company.  Nonetheless it is my belief that Irish Life is an ideal candidate company for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the debate would not become bogged down on ideology &mdash; on the question of whether the company should be private or State or whatever. One would assume that, with control in regard to the issue of the shareholding, the Minister would endeavour to ensure that the Irish public can invest in the company.  Whether it be by way of a vote of the Oireachtas that taxpayers' funds are invested in Irish Life or through a shareholding issue &mdash; with people investing in that manner &mdash; surely there is great similarity between the public investing in a public company and the State, by way of votes of the Oireachtas, taking public <Col N="1564" /> funds, through taxation and borrowings, and investing in State ventures?</P>
    <P>The whole matter of State companies warrants detailed study.  I disagree with Deputy McDowell when he got hung up repeatedly on the Taoiseach's comments when Leader of the Opposition.  The Minister dealt with that matter very clearly in the course of his remarks last evening.  It may be an updating of the party's approach, now that we are in Government.  Indeed we are quite broadminded in adopting that stance.  The Minister said last evening that the Taoiseach, in an address to an Irish Life function last October, set out candidly what was happening, when he indicated that the proposals advanced by Irish Life were being examined and that the Government would take a decision on the basis of what was best in the public interest. Those are the parameters within which such an important decision must be taken.  The House is being kept fully informed, which is what the Minister said he was doing last evening in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the issue in regard to Irish Life is its lack of flexibility to expand and invest abroad.  If we in this House are content to accept the successes and growth of the company to date and put a semi-freeze on the company's potential, that will be the result of not giving fair, open-minded consideration to the question of privatisation.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators referred to the committee's report, contending that we had not actually recommended privatisation.  I should like to place on the record that that is correct.  That is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet of the day.  But, as an indication of the drift of our thinking in the committee debate I should say we analysed in detail the very complex steps that needed to be pursued.  They are dealt with under the heading &ldquo;Privatisation&rdquo; in the report on pages 45 through to 53.</P>
    <P>There is a very complex series of questions to be asked and answered before any company can be considered for privatisation. I would accept Deputy <Col N="1565" /> McDowell's suggestion last evening that the State merchant bank, ICC, should be given the task of collating the documents that would be required to be considered to allow Irish Life to be privatised.  That would allow the Minister for Finance to analyse the submission from the company at present before the Cabinet and recommending favourable consideration of privatisation. The ICC would be in a position to carry out that in-depth analysis which our committee was not.  We did not embark on any decision as to whether we would recommend privatisation or otherwise; we did not have the necessary resources or back-up information available to us to do so.  If a company is to go to the Stock Exchange and ask the public to participate there must be many safeguards built in and many difficulties that would have to be overcome regarding the structure of the shareholding in Irish Life as at present constituted.</P>
    <P>The other point that would have to be addressed is whether having regard to the smallness of the Irish Stock Exchange and the Dublin financial market it would be capable of coping with a 49 per cent flotation for a company the size of Irish Life, which could be in the region of £100 million to £150 million.  It would have to be ascertained how that would affect the liquidity of the market.  For example, would it have a medium or long-term effect?  What would be the position should the London market be available for such a flotation?  Those are the issues that must be addressed in any consideration of privatisation.  Either the Minister for Finance and his officials are analysing those issues or they are asking Irish Life.  It would be helpful if a State merchant bank, such as ICC, were asked to analyse them.</P>
    <P>Continuing from there, there is the whole concept of what I should like to think would be the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; that we would serve as an ongoing forum for debate, perhaps filling the void to which Deputy McDowell referred when he advocated the publication of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>Out of the 20 or so semi-State companies <Col N="1566" /> the committee have responsibility for, there are probably five or six who could do with having the shackles of Government control or ministerial approval for very many of the forward plans they may have stymied.  For that reason, I think it is worthwhile that those companies in the State sector who would benefit from additional funding and liquidity should be favourably considered for raising funds from the Stock Exchange on the understanding that the important services many of them provide are guaranteed without diluting their potential for private venture investment and their opportunity to operate as a commercial body.  The recent success of Aer Rianta in the Soviet Union is another example of the potential that is there when you have State investment.  There are new markets available which cannot be overlooked and the Eastern bloc and the Soviet Union are new areas which are opening up for this country.  We are a neutral country and very acceptable and Aer Rianta have proven that there is business to be done in those areas, there is employment potential for Irish people and there is a plethora of opportunities that will arise if we pursue them on a State venture basis.  That is a contradiction to privatisation.  I believe that if the mix is right the Government should probably retain control where practical.</P>
    <P>As regard the issue of the debate, I think that as a party Fianna Fáil have always had an open-minded policy of participation. The late Seán Lemass was probably the architect of State investment where the private sector failed the economy and where it was necessary for the State to move in.  I do not think we should be hung up on that indefinitely. Today, Seán Lemass might well have a different view of State involvement in particular areas of the economy.  This is really a value for money time.  If the taxpayers are going to have the burden of tax lifted from their shoulders there is going to have to be either a cutback in Government spending or a raising of funds.  To release funds that are locked up in the profitable semi-State companies and to allow central Government to <Col N="1567" /> invest it, possibly in the areas of education and health, is surely prudent management of this economy.  Irish Life may be a very worthwhile vehicle for this on the understanding that the funds raised will be used in very important areas where there have been cutbacks and about which there has been much criticism from various sides of the House.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to put on the record of the House. Because of the way we have operated our State companies, stifled and penalised them very severely and consecutive Ministers for Finance have issued letters of comfort and bank facilities to these companies, they have been crippled by borrowing at high interest rates instead of having share capital and working capital.  There is an opportunity now to identify those companies who have potential so that some of them with very heavy burdens and debts could be relieved and could benefit greatly from having working capital and liquidity to expand.  Far too many of our State commercial companies and other State agencies are very heavily overborrowed.  This is one area that needs to be addressed and privatisation is the vehicle for considering this direction of policy.</P>
    <P>Irish Life are the ideal candidate for consideration as one of the first companies to be assessed by the Cabinet for privatisation.  I have been informed by the management representatives that it would not in any way create any complications, employment-wise which would be the consideration of all Members of this House, if a central Government policy decision was to be taken.  If anything, it would give Irish Life the opportunity, as outlined by their management in their hearings, to create additional employment.  It would give very many qualified capable young Irish people the opportunity of working for a company based in Ireland and operating abroad.  Surely that is a direction in which people on all sides of the House would like to see progress.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that we would analyse the other companies we are <Col N="1568" /> presently investigating, some of which are in a very sad state and a far cry from consideration for privatisation.  This House has very soon to devote something like £11 million of taxpayers money to the B &amp; I while the private venture, Sealink operate on the same route and do not take any taxpayers' funds on board. Would we not be better using that £11 million for some of the other needy areas of Government investment?  These are the questions that arise when we start considering privatising the State sector and, in particular, the semi-State companies. We are also looking at the Irish Sugar Company, Irish Steel, An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Some of those companies have excellent potential for raising funds to provide a better service.  They are looking towards this report and the debate in this House as an indication of the way the Government are going to go regarding their policy towards the semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in accepting the principle of the motion, has given a fair indication of Government thinking. I believe it is the right policy but one that needs to be carefully monitored and considered and that the &ldquo;Golden Share&rdquo; option is the way forward and is the way in which the House and the Minister for Finance should look at this issue.  The whole drift of Government policy in the area of home ownership, which was announced today, and of allowing the public to invest in State companies through public flotations is very worthwhile. Privatisation also gives a great sense of belonging and there is support from the public and the employees who set an equity holding in the company because not alone are they operating and working for the company but they have an actual investment in it.  I urge that in any decision, whether for part privatisation or otherwise, there should be a very attractive staff share option scheme so that those people who have given a lifetime of service to the company should get the opportunity to take some equity on a very preferential basis.  The company is big enough and the need to raise funds is adequate and for that <Col N="1569" /> reason the employees should be given a fair and equitable opportunity to partake and benefit from the prosperity and growth of the company.  I compliment the Minister on accepting the Fine Gael motion.  I hope that he will make a decision quickly on the report and the issue of privatisation of Irish Life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank my colleague, Deputy Lawlor, for giving me the opportunity to come in on this important debate.  Like him, I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies who examined the whole issue of Irish Life.  Quite a lot of the debate included deliberation on whether Irish Life should be privatised. We took statements and evidence from both the management and the union and I have to compliment both sides on that. I must compliment also the other members of the committee in that the exercise was very interesting and rewarding. It is helpful to all of us and to this debate that we have this report before us.  I understood that the report was to be tabled before the House for debate and perhaps this motion is somewhat premature in that it is basically saying what we concluded in the report.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Lawlor has said, we came in for some criticism when we gave a press briefing in relation to whether we had made a recommendation.  We did say that going on the facts that were before us we would like the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet to make a decision as quickly as possible on the submission made by Irish Life management.  I made the point at that press briefing that we were just a committee meeting every fortnight, that we had a number of meetings in relation to this company but that they were not detailed meetings.  We did not have before us the knowledge of the taxation experts, actuaries, stockbrokers and legal people in relation to this whole aspect.  We did not even have the submission from Irish Life before us.  In effect, it would have been very difficult for us to make a decision one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of members of that committee <Col N="1570" /> came out and gave their own personal views and I give my view here tonight &mdash; as I did at that press meeting &mdash; that, based on the information that was put before the committee, I think that in the interest of all concerned, of the State and the people of Ireland who ultimately are those who will benefit, this company should be privatised, or the capital base should be restructured in such a way as to facilitate expansion of the company.  Someone has referred to the company as being the jewel in the crown of the State &mdash; that is not an exaggeration. The company have performed excellently over the past number of years. They are in their 50th year, I understand. Having said that, the dividend or return to the State has been very small.  The State had to become involved with the predecessors of the Irish Life Company in order to bolster them up with State finance.  That is how the State at this stage has such a large shareholding.  Yet, its dividend over the past 30 odd years is only, I think, a net figure of £1.8 million while the value of the assets over that 30 year period has increased to £2.6 billion. We call it a State company but, in effect, it is the most private of the State companies.</P>
    <P>The management made the point that their progress in the future would be stunted because their present capital structure is such that they cannot expand properly.  The major problem is expansion into the US market.  They made the point &mdash; and I think it is a valid one &mdash; that 31 of the 50-odd states in the United States had objections to State-owned companies becoming involved in those states.  Irish Life have, accordingly, been looking at alternatives as to how to get into the American market.  They have tried a number of alternatives but I do not think these have been particularly successful.  They tried to take over the Mid-Western United Life Assurance Company, but that fell by the wayside for one reason or another.  It is not exactly clear why.  Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that this was a State-owned company.  I feel &mdash; and stress that it is a personal feeling &mdash; that Irish Life <Col N="1571" /> should be privatised in such a way that they can get into the very lucrative US market.</P>
    <P>Another reason for saying that their progress has been stunted is that the Irish Life Company are experiencing much greater opposition and competition both on the home and European markets.  The fact that the EC is in play and doing away with all sorts of barriers, trade and other kinds, will lead ultimately to a situation in which companies from Europe will be able to deal freely in the Irish market. Obviously this will have a detrimental effect on a company who are orientated, because of their structure, to the Irish and the UK market.  To allow that to happen and, at the same time, not allow the Irish company to expand their horizons would be harmful.  If the company were privatised in some shape or form that would lead to quite substantial funds for further expansion.  This is an aspect which cannot be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The State share at the moment is 90 per cent and yet, as I said, the dividend is minimal.  This has happened over a number of years because of circumstances. I feel that if the company were privatised it would not cause the State a major problem in that even though the State has a major share the dividend is very small.  We have put a lot of money in over the past number of years but that has helped to build up this company into probably one of the best of the State companies.  I have the benefit of a very detailed and good submission from the ASTMS, and we had the benefit of their evidence before the committee, to which we listened in great detail.  They have problems in relation to possible loss of jobs.  There may be an argument for that, but I believe that expansion can only lead to more jobs.  Mr. Kingston, in his submission, told us that there are 150 jobs already available in Dublin arising out of the UK involvement.  If we are to get into the United States and the Spanish and French markets, obviously more jobs will be created in Dublin and in Ireland. This cannot be overlooked.  In their submission, the ASTMS seem to feel that <Col N="1572" /> this company would be in a position to get into the US market, that the argument being put up by the Irish Life management in favour of privatisation because they could not get into the US market was not correct and that this was being used as a lever towards privatisation. I do not accept that.  I believe that what the company say is true, that these US states make it difficult for any company which is State-owned to become involved in their economies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor mentioned the &ldquo;Golden Share&rdquo; and the whole idea of retaining some State involvement.  All those options should be examined and the Minister for Finance is looking at these because he adverted to them in his submission.  There is also in France the possibility of restriction on foreign-owned companies or foreign holdings in those companies.  That is also something that should be looked at.  The ASTMS made the point that Dublin might become a sub-office if there was a takeover. I do not particularly accept that. The company are an Irish one and if the proper restrictions and guidelines are put in by the Minister for Finance we will be able to ensure that they will remain a wholly Irish company.</P>
    <P>I again compliment all involved in the Oireachtas joint committee and I hope that a decision will be made sooner rather than later.  The ASTMS made the point that a delay in making a decision would be detrimental.  That was also the opinion of the management.  I ask that a decision be made coolly and calmly, but as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Life, as we know, are the largest life assurance company in the country and one of our largest financial institutions.  They have funds under general management of nearly £3.4 billion and had investments of about £2.5 million at the end of 1986.  They have a major annual premium income of about £600 million per year and employ some 1,700 people.  They dominate the insurance market and hold one-third of the market on a premium income basis <Col N="1573" /> and their very size raises a fundamental question in the contest of privatisation.</P>
      <P>Is it wise, proper and appropriate that the State should lose, in effect, control over such a major financial sector?  The 700,000 policyholders in this country &mdash; of whom I am a very minor one in terms of a life and house mortgage protection policy &mdash; are entitled to be protected by the State, the Government and the Minister for Finance and not see this company drift over a period of years into foreign control and into the hands of other financial institutions whose concern for the 700,000 policyholders and the 3,000 group pension and life assurance arrangements would be put in jeopardy or their entitlements diminished.  The Minister for Finance did not answer those questions in his contribution to the House last evening.</P>
      <P>I submit that Irish Life and the Minister for Finance, as the major shareholder, have a statutory responsibility to their policy members for their life and pension funds.  One would get the impression at times, listening to some of the senior management of Irish Life, that the funds were their property.  They are not.  The moneys belong to the policyholders and the shareholders in the <i>persona</i> of the Minister for Finance who is responsible to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party are convinced that this responsibility can be best discharged &mdash; and continue to be discharged &mdash; as a normal State company rather than as a private entity subject to fluctutating share ownership over the years and to Stock Exchange fluctuations.  It is also subject, inevitably, as a private entity to very short-term insurance profits criteria.  It is argued that if you privatise a company it will become more efficient.  Irish Life and their management would hotly dispute that criteria.  Is anybody suggesting that Irish Life are wholly inefficient?  Is anybody suggesting that it is another ICI or Irish Shipping?  I was not sorry to see the end of Irish Shipping because it was an appalling drain on State funds.  Irish Life would be the first to dispute that they are lacking in competitiveness and that they <Col N="1574" /> do not have good access to share capital in the future.  They have plenty of share capital and, therefore, the argument that they must be privatised to bring more market discipline into their operations does not stand up.</P>
    <P>It is also argued that privatisation would extend the narrow range of Irish equities available for investment.  In the context of Irish Life that is a load of nonsense because, as we know, Irish Life are the single largest individual investor in AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  The company are a major holder of Government securities and they are one of the largest individual investors in the commercial banking world.  To privatise the company would not provide a greater base for Irish equities available for investment. That argument can be disposed of in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced is that privatisation would, inevitably, eliminate any prospect of contingent demand on the Exchequer if companies got into difficulties. We have sufficient faith in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and in the reports from Irish Life to know that they are not in financial difficulties.  In fact, they have about £300 million more than they disclosed, because it is only recently they have been obliged to disclose the hidden reserves in their accounts. Indeed, I have good reason to believe that there is substantially more available in the company than has been disclosed to date.  The documentation is available to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Why are we, therefore, seeking to privatise Irish Life?  We are doing so because it is now a political good thing to do.  The British are doing it so why should we not?  British Telecom and BP have been privatised so we must follow the fashion. It is largely that ideological attitude that privatisation is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing which caused the senior management of Irish Life to feel somewhat old-fashioned because they happened to be a State-sponsored company.  They say, for example, that they want to invest in the United States.  I will draw a simple parallel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> Has anything ever inhibited Aer Rianta from investing in the United States?  They have been able to set up subsidiary companies to buy hotels and to engage as a State company in profitable undertakings in the United States and they are still a State company.  The manageing director of Irish Life said that some of the states in the United States do not permit national companies.  He forgot to mention that 19 states in the United States have no such prohibition. He also forgot to mention in his various statements that the French have had successful entry to the United States in regard to insurance and industry.  This was achieved by national companies who have not suffered any grave inhibitions in terms of new market penetration.  The argument that we must privatise Irish Life to get into the United States is a load of hogwash.  It does not stand up to examination because if that were so there is a counter-argument that Irish Life should not go near America, as the United States, because of their protectionist attitude, would prevent them from getting in.  That argument does not stand up.  We know that Irish Life have staff and an operation in America.  The company are receiving favourable reaction but I do not think that is a substantial reason in favour of the argument for privatisation. That argument does not hold water.</P>
    <P>I submit that it would be profoundly unwise for the State to divest itself of such a fundamental holding particularly at a time when we anticipate substantial penetration of the Irish market by EC insurance conglomerates.  For example, we know that when the administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland concludes it will attract substantial interest from a German company.  We know that EC insurance companies have great interest in and concern about penetration into the Irish market.  For those reasons it is essential that we retain Irish Life, to ensure that a strong Irish insurance entity is retained.  We must do that in the national interest.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to stop Irish Life <Col N="1576" /> making substantial investments in the European market.  I read in today's newspaper that through their European property subsidiary Irish Life have invested £5.5 million in a 46,000 square feet development in Brussels.  Did the company have to be privatised in order to do that?  They did not.  I commend the ambition of the company in that regard. Why is it that we have this hoo-ha around?  We have it because if Irish Life is privatised it will be worth at least £280 million and probably between £380 million and £400 million.  Who will benefit from that?  Will it be the policyholders, and I am one of them?  That is highly unlikely, although I know that a substantial body of policyholders will be quick to take legal action to protect what they rightly regard as their savings and their accumulated moneys which over the years built up the reserves of Irish Life. What will happen if the Government decide to sell off Irish Life?  The Minister for Finance will collect between £280 million and £380 million.  There was great confusion in the documentation which I examined when in Government as to the precise value of the hidden reserves of the company.  We will learn of their value when a search for documents is sought in a High Court case.</P>
    <P>Who would benefit from the sale of Irish Life?  The Government would have between £200 million and £300 million available but for what?  In my view it would be used for a once-off tax reduction.  The Minister for Finance made no reference last night to using the money for job creation.  Would the money be invested in Irish industry?  We did not get any indication of that last night.  Would the money be spent on restoring the major reductions in the public service, in environmental services, health services and social services?  We did not get any indication of that last night.  In my view it would be used as a once-off tax reduction.  The tax reduction in this year's budget will cost £154 million in a full year and in the 1989 budget we will learn that as a result of the privatisation of Irish Life there will be a once-off tax reduction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> In the event of a decision to sell Irish Life who will take over the company? In my view the multi-national insurance conglomerates will move in despite all the posturing by the Minister for Finance about the criteria of protection he will lay down such as golden shares and so on. Two-thirds of what the Minister said last night is contrary to EC competition rules. I have no doubt that if he attempted to impose such restrictions on the flotation of shares of the company it would be fought bitterly in the courts.  We are all aware of what has happened in Britain when such a move was attempted, despite the heroic efforts of Margaret Thatcher to protect shares on a general flotation. She did not succeed and it is highly unlikely that our Minister for Finance will succeed in protecting the greatest State-sponsored company we have.  The company is about the only thing we have in the State sector that is worth selling.  I am not suggesting that Aer Lingus is not worth selling but such a move would cause considerable problems because two-thirds of the company is owned by Boeing while half of the hotel side of the business is owned by the Dunfey Corporation of America.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why the company, if it is so badly off for capital investment, is unable to get capital moneys.  I have not been over-impressed by some of the pension portfolio decisions of Irish Life but I would prefer to keep my views on them to myself. However, I am impressed by the growth of the company and their general competence. I do not intend to cast any reflection on the senior personnel of the company.  No rational argument of any great consequence has been advanced to convince us that we should privatise the company.  The Labour Party will not support a move by Irish Life, in consort with the reformed Taoiseach smelling of Irish Life roses, with tacit support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, to privatise the company.  We are not sure why the latter parties are in favour of such a move but I am sure they would privatise CIE if they thought it could be sold despite the £112 million subsidy that is <Col N="1578" /> put into the company annually to keep a public transport system in operation.  We will not support a decision to withdraw annual profits from policy holders.</P>
    <P>I have supported this company down the years and there is no way that I will agree to selling off the profits to private shareholders who do not have any connection with the company.  In fact, most of the purchasers would not have any connection with the country.  In my view there is no obstacle to Irish Life expanding their operations in the UK.  Just five years ago the company's general share of the market in the UK was miniscule but today they have close on 3 per cent of the market and are performing very successfully. The company have not had to be privatised to operate effectively in the UK.  There is no obstacle in the way of the company operating in America or in any part of the EC.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party feel that the Department of Finance could be better engaged doing work which is long overdue.  For example, for the past eight or nine years I have been waiting for a Bill from the Department to control the commercial banks here.  I saw sight of the draft heads of a Bill in 1981 to deal with the public accountability of the financial institutions here but I have not heard anything since. It is unwise that the limited legal expertise and actuarial ability of the Department should be involved in the privatisation of Irish Life.  They should produce the Bill we have all been waiting for to ensure that the financial institutions operate in a responsible, publicly accountable way.  The Department of Finance would be better engaged in that exercise.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have great difficulty internally because in their history they have not particularly favoured privatisation and by instinct they are suspicious of this exercise and do not want to make a mess of it if they go ahead.  They are aware of the reports of the Tillinghast Nelson and Warren international consultancy group and I challenge the Minister for Finance to put those reports on the Table of the <Col N="1579" /> House.  I will gladly take a copy from him, but I may have to get it elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Government and the Minister for Finance would be very wise to have those reports laid before the Oireachtas before any irate group of policy holders or shareholders other than the Minister decide to take him to court on a search of documents before any privatisation proposition develops further. There is nothing which should prevent the Minister from making that information available.</P>
      <P>Irish people at home and abroad have invested their savings and their life's money in Irish Life.  They have done so because it is a State company and has a degree of State backing.  That is as it should be and we are intensely proud of it.  I see no reason for a privatisation enterprise whereby the auditors, the sponsors, the stockbrokers, the accountants and the taxation and legal advisers will stand to collect anything up to £12 million or £14 million on a floatation.  I would have no desire to see that exercise take place at the loss of Irish Life money. For what?  Capital?  There is no shortage for Irish Life.  Pentration into the United States?  By and large there is no problem in that regard and in any case they would need to be very careful about such an exercise because it is a costly operation at the best of times.  I am all in favour of the expansion of the company.</P>
      <P>Those who feel they should be freed from the Gleeson constraints in terms of the salaries of the top echelons can get additional emoluments from their subsidiaries. The Minister for Finance has never turned a cold eye towards such additional emoluments.  I leave that between the Minister and these concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify the true valuation of the secret reserves of this company.  Without that information we cannot come to a real assessment of <Col N="1580" /> the company's value.  Some of that information is available but much of it is not.</P>
    <P>I support the views of the trade unions concerned in Irish Life.  There are 1,700 people employed there and I do not want to see Irish Life in Abbey Street as a branch office of a multi-national insurance conglomarate worked by computer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every area of economic activity is open to private enterprise to develop.  There are huge areas which are practically untapped.  Fishing, fish farming, fish processing are industries which are only in their infancy compared with other countries in western Europe such as Iceland, Norway and Spain.  Why not put money there and develop these industries?  Why does the private sector not develop the food processing industry, which is also in its infancy?  Private enterprise could <Col N="1581" /> process the produce of the State forests. They could produce timber for use in construction and make chipboard, hardboard and paper.  Nobody is stopping them but they are not doing it.  They could build a smelter for our raw ore but they are not interested.  They wait until the State has built up strong, profitable enterprises and then they whinge and cry and say &ldquo;give me that&rdquo; like a spoiled child.  They want everything handed to them on a plate, ready and running.  Then when it is run into the ground they call on the State to bail them out.  This occurred in the famous case of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, an example of private enterprise failure where the State had to step in and bail them out with taxpayers' money.  Now that this company is viable again they want it back.  This I find very difficult to understand.  Why do they want to use the companies the State has built up when it is open to them to build up any companies they want?</P>
    <P>Dublin Gas Company is another example of the danger of letting private enterprise loose on essential services. The record of Dublin Gas has been disastrous from an economic and safety point of view.  The legacy of bungling private enterprise has been seen over the past few years in a thousand holes all over Dublin.  If this had been a State company there would have been howls for its privatisation from the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, Deputy Liam Lawlor and the privateers in Fianna Fáil.  They would say that private enterprise could do it much more efficiently.  All the people in favour of private enterprise got together and suddenly became socialists, calling for the nationalisation of the gas company. So we nationalised the gas company. Why?  Because the State could do it better.  That is why these essential services have to be nationalised and it is highly dangerous to give them back to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The pressure for privatisation has been coming mainly from speculators who wish to make a killing on the Stock Exchange or from senior management in <Col N="1582" /> Irish Life who stand to benefit financially from privatisation.  This has been proved in Britain and, as Deputy Desmond pointed out, we have to do the same as them.  An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> indicated that privatisation leads to great financial rewards for those at the top.  For instance, it gave the example of the boss of British Telecom who gave himself a £60,000 rise in 1985-86.  Of course, the great advantage of privatisation is that once privatised you can give yourself a rise as David Kingston well knows.  The boss of Cable Wireless was paid £11,291 when his company was in public ownership but when it went into private ownership his salary was increased five times to £56,000 and by 1986 his salary had soared to £238,000.  You can name your own sum.  The salary of the boss of Britoil went up from £65,000 to £106,000.  I could give many other examples.  Those in management in Irish Life who are calling for privatisation should not be listened to as naturally it is in their great interest to be privatised.  It is personal interest that is making them shout &ldquo;privatise, privatise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to make is that Deputy Lawlor's contribution makes it clear this is just the beginning of massive take-overs of State assets, which are the people's assets, by privateers.  His speech was straight from Maggie Thatcher, even to the point where he lauded the great times ahead when everybody will be a shareholder.  He also made the point that there would be no loss of jobs. In fact, privatisation in Britain has shown a loss of jobs in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for Finance referred last night to the contribution of Irish Life to the economy since its foundation and I want to join with him in expressing our congratulations and admiration to them for that period of success and growth.  The company has continued to increase its share of the domestic life assurance market and it is well worth mentioning that by the end of 1986 the company had 43 per cent of the life assurance market here.  The company has also demonstrated, as the House will agree, its ability to compete and grow by keeping pace with developments in the market over the years.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1986 Irish Life policyholders' funds amounted to over £2 billion out of total Irish funds of almost £4.5 billion.  That is clear testimony to the expansion of the company and the size of the market overall.  We should not forget either that it has a payroll of in excess of 1,400 people and, as such, the company is a very successful employer. There is a further 200 people employed in the company's overseas operations.  I join with the Minister for Finance in congratulating the company on its excellent success down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given Irish Life's present dominant position in the Irish Market and the strides made in developing a base in the UK, I think the House will agree it is a natural step for the company to seek to expand its activities into other foreign markets. However, in order to do this the company requires additional capital and the general conclusion appears to be that the availability of share capital is perhaps the <Col N="1584" /> best way of supporting such expansion plans.  State involvement in this case can act as an impediment particularly in relation to the lucrative American market.  These two factors more than any others give rise to the question of privatisation. However, I feel that this issue was dealt with very well by the Minister for Finance last night and I will not dwell on it in the few moments available to me.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce have overall responsibility as the supervisory authority for monitoring the activities of life assurance companies and the insurance industry generally.  Let me make very clear this evening that the Department would have to be satisfied that the interests of policyholders are treated with paramount importance in any restructuring plans.  In this regard let me assure the House tonight that any reorganisation or restructuring of the company would only be carried out in the context of existing insurance legislation which is effectively designed to ensure that the interests of these policyholders are adequately and fully protected.</P>
    <P>Let me spell it out even more clearly. This position of overseeing the industry remains regardless of whether the company is privatised or not.  Despite the very high proportion of shares held by the Minister for Finance, all Deputies are aware that it has been the policy down through the years not to interfere with the day-to-day management of the company. Therefore, given the position in regard to dividends, the company have effectively operated as a private company.  That is an important point to remember.</P>
    <P>Let me now respond to points which have been raised.  Deputy Desmond expressed concern about overseas take-overs in the medium term.  I want to make it clear that Irish Life and all life assurance companies are required under the supervision rules to maintain within the State not less than 80 per cent of the assets representing liabilities to Irish policyholders and, as such, that is a large element of protection in this area. Deputy Desmond also spoke about the danger of policyholders no longer having <Col N="1585" /> a guarantee in the event of the Government taking a decision to go in a particular direction, a decision which they have not yet made.  The State, in a commercial sense, does not formally give a guarantee to the policyholders of Irish Life.  It is a company to that extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there is no formal, legal guarantee given in that regard.  The company is supervised, as are other companies, and it is required to maintain the same solvency ratios.  My main reason for taking part in this debate is simply to reassure this House and the public that very stringent rules and regulations in regard to solvency margins, the operation and the general conduct of the insurance industry are operating in this State.  I want to assure the House that the Department of Industry and Commerce will do their job in that regard whether a particular company is privately owned or State-owned.  Those rules and regulations are very stringent and tough and we will be applying them.  The Minister for Finance referred to that point last evening but it is important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude by saying that the privatisation of Irish Life is a complex issue, that the House can be assured that the Government will examine all aspects of the proposal and that we will take a very pragmatic and not an ideological decision in the interests of the nation.  To repeat my own commitment to the House, that irrespective of whether the company is private or public the Department of Industry and Commerce will make sure that the very stringent solvency margins and other regulations are very strictly applied to whatever insurance company, and whoever owns it, operates in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, as is obvious from the debate so far, has the support of a very sizeable majority of this House. Irish Life are also anxious to privatise. In the interests of Irish Life and in the interests of the shareholders they should be allowed to privatise.  This House must recognise the support of the shareholders for this company since its foundation. The shareholders must be uppermost in the minds of everybody contributing to this debate.</P>
      <P>It is the accepted view that this company should expand as it has done since its foundation.  The management, the directors and staff and a majority of the shareholders are anxious that the company expand.  Any delay at this stage will inhibit expansion and it would be wrong to delay a firm decision.  In his address last night, the Minister accepted the tenor of our motion and said that he accepted the motion that the Government should make an early decision on this issue.  The Minister explained that the Government are considering the best advice available on where the balance of advantage lies and are considering what practical steps are necessary to resolve the complex issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, said tonight that the privatisation of Irish Life is an extremely complex issue which cannot be taken lightly.  Our party do not take this decision lightly.  We have considered it deeply over a long period.  It is in the best interests of everybody that privatisation is proceeded with immediately and not at some future date.  We cannot sit on the fence any longer on this issue.  I know there are complex issues involved but further prevarication on the part of the Government can be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that this company is the jewel in the crown of our semi-State <Col N="1587" /> bodies.  That was not an accident.  The reason this company was so successful is because of the dedicated work of its staff since its foundation.  The staff have shown by their work that companies of this nature can be successful.  If there are further delays on this issue the company could lose some of its most capable, top class personnel who have brought this company to its present position.  If the House decides to wait, the company will also have to wait.  Firms like Smurfits, Crean and Company, and Cement Road-stone Holdings would not have been so successful if they had not tackled and resolved complex issues.  We are very proud of the success of those Irish companies. There is a challenge here to resolve complex issues in the interests of Ireland.  If the companies I have already mentioned had sat on the fence their expansion would have been curtailed and the country and the shareholders would have been the losers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned that this company can work in the US, but there are problems.  There are many states in America where Irish Life could not set up because they are a State company. <Col N="1588" /> Admittedly they could set up and operate trust companies but this is only a device and it would prevent and curtail the company from expanding into the US.</P>

Instead of inhibiting that company we should encourage them to expand into every available market.  We are a small country and we need to take opportunities to expand.  If people hold firmly to narrow views it will be to the detriment of this country.  We must be enlightened in our approach.  We must take our courage in our hands and pass the necessary legislation to allow this company to privatise and expand in the best interests of the company, the shareholders and the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the action, if any, he proposes to take with regard to the contents of the recent Restrictive Practices Commission report on a comparison of grocery prices in Dublin and in England, in particular the statement on page 110 of that report which shows that almost half of the 160 items evaluated were some 10 per cent or more, more expensive and over a quarter were 20 per cent more expensive in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to the Consumer Association of Ireland survey which was published in the September 1987 issue of <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine and which was carried as an appendix to the report made by the Chairman of the Restrictive Practices Commission into alleged differences in grocery prices between here and the UK, including Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman, in his report, found that most of the price differences disclosed in various published surveys (including that of the CAI) were accounted for by differences in taxes, movements in currency rates and by monetary compensatory <Col N="1449" /> amounts (MCA) on certain products. When these factors were excluded, the differences shown by the surveys were comparatively small &mdash; generally from less than 2 to about 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless the chairman made a number of recommendations which he felt could help to reduce grocery prices here and I am looking at these in so far as they fall within my area of responsibility. Many of the recommendations relate to matters which are the responsibility of other Ministers and I have, where appropriate, drawn these to attention.  Others of the recommendations are addressed to the trade itself and I have no doubt that these will also be looked at closely by the parties concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the present methods of inspection with regard to labelling of products, including aspects of safety and the accuracy of such labelling, indicating the number of inspections or checks which are carried out; whether any prosecutions have been pursued; whether he has satisfied himself regarding much of the descriptive-type labelling which at present applies including the labelling of certain goods where non-active ingredients are not listed; and if he will outline the action he proposes to take in the whole area of labelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps, at the outset, point out to the Deputy that the labelling of products is not the responsibility solely of my Department.  Depending on the product, responsibility for labelling is spread over a number of Departments, such as the Department of Labour for dangerous substances or preparations, the Department of Agriculture and Food for particular foodstuffs and the Department of Health for poisons and medical preparations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within my own Department's area of <Col N="1450" /> responsibility there are regulations relating to labelling in a number of specific areas, for instance, foodstuffs, textiles and upholstered furniture.  These regulations were formerly enforced by various sections of my Department but in the past few weeks, following the coming into effect of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, responsibility for enforcement has passed to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade. I should point out that the health boards also have enforcement powers under the food labelling regulations.</P>
    <P>During the period that my Department enforced these regulations, their efforts and resources were concentrated on advising traders of their obligations under the regulations, responding to complaints and inquiries by members of the public and carrying out checks and surveys to establish the level of compliance with the regulations.  In general this approach was effective and compliance overall was good.  Only one prosecution was undertaken by my Department but I understand that a number of prosecutions have been taken by the health boards in relation to food labelling.</P>
    <P>I believe that the transfer of enforcement powers from the Minister to the Director can be expected to result in the more effective and efficient enforcement of the regulations in question.</P>
    <P>With regard to what the Deputy refers to as &ldquo;descriptive-type labelling&rdquo;, I should point out that, whether or not there is specific provision with regard to this in regulations on particular products, there are general provisions in the Merchandise Marks Acts which require that descriptions and claims on goods must be truthful and not misleading.  Again, these provisions are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    <P>In general, I am satisfied that the present labelling requirements in those areas for which I have responsibility are adequate.  These requirements are of course reviewed from time to time at national level and in the context of our EC obligations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the fact that paraffin oil, which is used by some elderly people in the lower income group for cooking and heating, is costing only half as much in the North of Ireland as in this jurisdiction; if he will take steps to have the position remedied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to regular kerosene which is used mainly in central heating systems as I understand that no other form of paraffin is available at consumer level.</P>
      <P>My inquiries reveal that the schedule price for a litre of regular kerosene is about 26p Irish in Northern Ireland and a little over 22p in the State.  Various discounts and rebates are available on these prices and the actual retail price is, apparently, significantly lower in the North, mainly because of these discounts and the fact that no VAT or duty is charged on the product in the North whereas between 5½p and 6p per litre is charged here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will give consideration to the introduction of a third tier of electricity tariffs in order to assist the development specifically of small industry; if he will consider other strategies in this regard, including the encouragement of personal savings for investment into industry loans and a selective review of industrial rates; and if he will outline his policy in relation to small industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the introduction of a third tier of electricity tariffs to assist small industry, I understand that in accordance with section 93 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 the ESB are <Col N="1452" /> required to ensure that their rates are not preferential or discriminatory.  This precludes the ESB from setting tariffs which are more favourable to a particular sector of industry.  In any event, I consider the overall reduction of 5 per cent in electricity charges for industry generally, announced in the recent budget, to be a more appropriate way of adjusting industry costs.  The ESB have indicated their firm intention to keep their charges at or below the new reduced levels for the next three years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the encouragement of loans to small industry, I believe that one of the existing weaknesses of this sector is its undue reliance on loan finance, the cost of which can impact adversely on viability and growth prospects. One of the remedies for this problem is the promotion of equity investment in industry, and the existence of the business expansion scheme is a major positive feature in this regard and one which I support fully.</P>
      <P>With regard to a selective review of industrial rates, the levying and collection of rates on commercial-industrial valuations is a matter strictly for the local rating authority.  However, rating authorities have power under the Underdeveloped Areas Acts to remit two thirds of the rates on new industrial undertakings for a period of ten years in areas designated under the Industrial Development Acts.  Under section 5 of the Gaeltacht Industries (Amendment) Act, 1971 local authorities may also grant a similar remission of rates on premises erected with financial assistance from Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; remissions may also apply in the case of improvements or extensions to existing premises. While both categories of rates remission are provided at the discretion of local authorities and there is no provision for recouping the loss of rates income arising, they are generally granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also provision for remission of commercial rates in inner city areas designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 and in the Custom House Docks area.  In general these remission schemes provide for full remission of <Col N="1453" /> rates for a period of ten years on the valuation of new development in the designated areas and on any increase in valuation arising from improvement and/or development of existing property.</P>
    <P>As to my policy in relation to small industry generally, this was outlined in my address to the annual conference of the Small Firms Association last November. In brief, it is to ensure that in these times of scarce budgetary resources, account is taken of the fact that only a proportion of new small industry projects will have significant growth and export potential.  Such projects will receive the full range of incentives currently available. They may also avail of the recently announced special trading houses scheme, whereby small firms will have the facility to supply their products to special trading houses as a means of getting such products on to world markets. Other projects with less potential but providing viable jobs at reasonable payback to the Exchequer will receive a package of employment, management and product development grants, but at a lower overall cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to Irish industrial costs, the comparisons in relation to the other EC countries, under each appropriate heading, at the present time; and the action he is taking under each such heading to deal with the relative disadvantage under which Irish industry labours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent review of industrial costs by the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group indicates a significant improvement in our cost competitiveness compared with other EC member states. The review shows the following:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Inflation Rates</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With our average inflation rate of 3.2 per cent in 1987 the differential between Irish rates and most of the other EC <Col N="1454" /> member states, has been eliminated.  Our forecast rate of 2.5 per cent for 1988 is less than the rate forecast for many EC countries and less than 1 per cent in excess of that forecast for West Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Interest Rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>At the end of 1986 Irish interest rates were much higher than those of our competitors, with the Irish rate for prime borrowers at 14 per cent compared with 11 per cent in the UK, 9.5 per cent in France and 6.8 per cent in West Germany. By December 1987 the Irish rate had dropped to 8.75 per cent compared with 8.5 per cent in the UK, 9.45 per cent in France and 6.25 per cent in West Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Electricity Costs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The latest available comparisons with all EC member states relate to July 1987. They show an improvement in our competitive position, compared to January 1986 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Heavy industrial users</i>&mdash; from first position (the highest) in January 1986 to fifth position in July 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medium industrial user</i>&mdash; from second position in January 1986 to sixth position at July, 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small industrial user</i>&mdash; from third position at January 1986 to fourth position at July 1987.</P>
    <P>The ICMG review states that despite decreases in electricity tariffs in the period 1986 to 1987, ranging between 7 per cent and 20 per cent, prices for Irish industrial users continue to be more expensive than those for many of our trading partners.  However, prices for all volume levels are more expensive in West Germany and for certain volumes in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The drop in Irish electricity prices of approximately 4.8 per cent associated with the imposition of VAT at 5 per cent from 1 March will mean a real reduction of 4.8 per cent for industrial consumers who are eligible to reclaim the VAT element.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The impact of the 4.8 per cent decrease together with the freeze on prices indicated for the next three years is expected to contribute towards increasing our competitiveness.  The UK is due to implement an increase of 15 per cent over two years from 1 April 1988.  This increase together with the decrease in Irish charges will improve our competitiveness <i>vis-a-vis</i> the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Postal Charges</i>
    </P>
    <P>In July 1986 Irish charges for internal post were the highest in the EC while charges for external letter post were joint second highest.  The position has improved since then by virtue of the fact that our postal charges have remained the same while those of most of our EC competitors have risen.  By June 1987 Ireland had fallen to third highest for both internal and external post.  For internal post our charges at July 1987 were 8 per cent higher than the EC average compared with 22 per cent higher in July 1986 while our external post charges had dropped to 5 per cent above the EC average compared with 18 per cent higher in July 1986.  This improvement should continue in 1988 as no increase in Irish postal rates is expected during that year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Telephone Charges</i>
    </P>
    <P>For local calls Irish charges are now third highest compared with second highest in 1985.  For trunk calls Irish charges are shown as fourth highest.  For calls to the USA we are also fourth highest but there are proposals by Telecom to reduce the US, as well as other international call rates by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Insurance Costs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The group was unable to obtain comparative data on employer insurance costs in other EC member states.  Nevertheless, there is every indication that Irish insurance costs are substantially higher than those in the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Transport Costs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The review of the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group indicates that Irish road transport costs compare unfavourably with those in the other EC member <Col N="1456" /> states and that costs increased at a comparatively faster rate over the period 1982 to 1986.  In 1986 the group concluded that road transport costs were almost certainly amongst the highest in the EC and feel that there is little doubt that this position remained unaltered during 1987. Since 1986 passenger fares to the UK and Europe have reduced substantially thereby reducing the costs involved in developing and servicing export markets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Labour Costs</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the period 1980-1985 Ireland had a substantial hourly labour cost advantage against its major trading partners within the EC.  In 1986, due to exchange rate movements, the UK dropped 5 per cent below the Irish level but it is estimated that during 1987 this comparative advantage had reduced to 2 per cent.  The provisional index of unit wage costs in manufacturing industry since 1980 which takes into account productivity gains, shows Ireland as being substantially more competitive than its main trading partners in the EC with a further substantial improvement recorded in our position during 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petroleum Product Costs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The ICMG Review indicates that following the reduction in petrol prices imposed by me in July 1987 the differential between Irish prices and average EC prices for petrol and heating gas oil has narrowed.</P>
    <P>As regards the action being taken to tackle excessive costs I would refer the Deputy to my detailed reply on this aspect to a similar parliamentary question on the 27 January 1988.  However, I can once again assure the House that no effort will be spared in our determination to further improve the cost environment for industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 40, 47, 49, 74, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>While there is a wide range of both life and non-life insurance products available generally, I am aware of certain difficulties in the areas referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunately the case that equestrian, community, voluntary and sporting groups' activities do give rise to a particular risk of injury to and claims by members of the public.  Likewise, the particular problems of certain inner city areas of Dublin give rise to high claims and, therefore, premium costs.  The cost of claims can only be met by insurance companies if an adequate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.</P>
      <P>My primary responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that companies meet their statutory reserves and solvency requirements and as such I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An arrangement exists with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist where difficulties are experienced in obtaining liability insurance.  Before a case can be referred to the federation it is necessary that at least half the market (including <Col N="1460" /> Lloyds) be approached without success. Evidence of these approaches together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the Insurance Section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation.  It must be emphasised that no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in every case referred in this manner to the industry representative body.</P>
    <P>In relation to property and related insurance, I am not aware that the unavailability of insurance cover has led to the widespread closure of business in particular areas.  Following discussions in February 1987 between the Inner City Development Steering Group of Dublin Corporation and the Irish Insurance Federation, the federation emphasised that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;insurers do not regard any area in Dublin City as a &ldquo;no-go area&rdquo; for the purposes of providing cover; each case is assessed on its own merits, but a very few risks are genuinely uninsurable;</P>
    <P>&mdash;city centre social problems which give rise to high claims and premium costs are neither within the control of insurers nor unique to Dublin; such problems and their consequences are, if anything, more acute in Britain and elsewhere;</P>
    <P>&mdash;claims and premiums are directly and closely linked; premiums cannot be reduced unless and until claims fall.</P>
    <P>In cases where property cover cannot be obtained despite reasonable efforts to place the risk in the Irish market, the Insurance Section of my Department should be contacted with the details.  The Irish Insurance Federation's Property Standing Committee is prepared to reexamine such cases on the strict understanding that they cannot guarantee to provide cover.</P>
    <P>Third party motor insurance is ultimately available through the mechanism of the Declined Cases Agreement.</P>
    <P>The reduction of high insurance costs is an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and <Col N="1461" /> significant measures are already in train to tackle the problems of cost and availability. Insurance industry representatives have assured me that reductions in insurance premiums will follow the introduction of an improved framework and I will ensure that they live up to their promises to ultimately benefit consumers.</P>
    <P>The <i>Blue Book</i> detailing results for 1986 was published on 6 January 1988. The 1987 results are expected to be published during the final quarter of 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring fullest co-ordination between them and maximum effectiveness in the export marketing of goods and services, in the promotion of tourism and of Ireland as an attractive country for industrial investment, the Government has decided that in cities abroad all official entities should, to the greatest extent possible, be brought together in one location.</P>
      <P>As the first step in this process the question of a single location in New York is now at an advanced stage of consideration. Accordingly I expect to be putting a proposal to Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>The experience in New York will be a valuable yardstick in carrying the process forward in other cities.  The Deputy will appreciate that complex and costly issues such as the identification of suitable locations and the acquisition and disposal of leases will have to have regard to existing stringent financial conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the primary agency for the attraction of foreign investment is the Industrial Development Authority.  While it seeks to maximise this investment through its network of offices abroad, diplomatic representation also plays an important role in support of the authority's efforts as it does, also, for CTT in export promotion.  While I am satisfied with the level of support provided by Irish embassies abroad in the general area of industrial promotion, I <Col N="1464" /> am anxious that every opportunity be availed of to enhance performance in this regard.</P>

I am, however, aware of the unemployment situation in the Ballina area, having recently met at their request a deputation from the town.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the IDA that it regards Ballina as a priority location for industrial development in 1988.  During 1987, the IDA completed negotiations with Rowear Clothing Manufacturers for a £1.3 million expansion which will lead to 104 new jobs over the next three years. In addition four small industry projects were approved which will lead to the creation of 26 additional jobs.  I understand that the IDA is actively promoting for industrial purposes, two advance factories in the Ballina area of approximately 28,000 sq. ft. and 26,000 sq. ft. respectively.  Moreover, the Government's decentralisation programme should result in considerable benefits for the town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>I consider that the optimum approach to the promotion of enterprise in this country is as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with its emphasis on (i) the creation of a climate conducive to economic growth, (ii) greater equity in the tax system, and (iii) practical measures to increase job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Evidence of success in promoting enterprise can be seen in the cessation of the outflow of funds from the State and the 5 per cent increase in investment by manufacturing industry in 1987.  Great potential for further success is ensured by the recent budget's move to place almost two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate of income tax, since nothing is more certain to promote enterprise than the prospect of being able to reap the rewards of one's efforts.</P>
      <P>Specific measures to stimulate enterprise and innovation are the IDA's Enterprise Development Programme and the provision by the Government in 1987 of a special £2.7 million budget for science and technology which has subsequently been increased to £3.1 million.  The former offers special categories of entrepreneurs with high potential in growth and exports the full range of State assistance in terms of employment, capital, management and research and development grants, in addition to loan guarantees on working capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main components of the Science and Technology Development Programme are (i) the National Biotechnology Programme, (ii) Advanced <Col N="1466" /> Manufacturing Technology Programme, (iii) Teaching Companies Programmes, and (iv) National Programme for Technological Innovation.</P>
    <P>The fostering of enterprise in educational curricula is most directly effected through the establishment of the NIHE's, whose purpose is to provide courses directly related to the industrial and commercial life of the country.  This is reflected in (i) the composition of their governing bodies, (ii) the mechanisms which they have put in place to interact with business and industry and the State industrial promotional bodies in their areas, and (iii) the courses they provide and the general culture of the institutions.</P>
    <P>I consider that education for enterprise courses or modules on school curricula is very desirable and we will be monitoring carefully work that is being done by Shannon Development in this regard.  I have already discussed these matters with the Minister for Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the concern which has been expressed recently regarding the fire danger potential of loose car seat covers.</P>
      <P>This matter arose previously in 1985 following a number of tragic deaths related to motor vehicle fires and was the subject of special consideration then by the IIRS.  Though it was recognised that there was a need for extreme care on the part of motorists to protect themselves and their children from the dangers involved, the conclusion reached was that specific legislative action would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Available statistics from the Department of the Environment would indicate that no deaths occurred in recent years from this cause.  However, in the light of recently expressed concerns, I have now asked the National Standards Authority <Col N="1467" /> of Ireland to examine the question of the safety of car seat covers in detail.  When I receive their findings I will take whatever measures are necessary to minimise risks in this area.</P>

      <P>Success in achieving these targets has already seen manufacturing investment increase by around 5 per cent in 1987 for the first time in five years, while industrial production increased by 10 per cent in real terms.</P>
      <P>The promotion of industrial development in north County Kildare is of course a matter for the day to day administration of the IDA.

      <P>I do not intend to assign to any special trading house exclusive trading rights in relation to specific markets or specific products.</P>
      <P>The European Commission gave approval to the special trading house scheme on 3 February last following prolonged negotiations.

      <P>Countertrade, an umbrella term for a range of reciprocal trade deals including counter-purchase, buyback, compensation trading and barter, is becoming an increasingly significant feature in international arrangements worldwide.  We in Ireland cannot afford to ignore this development.  It is essential that we exploit to the fullest extent the potential it creates for industry here.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, on foot of a recent Government decision, I have asked all Government Departments and their semi-State agencies to examine critically the potential for entering into countertrade deals in any case where they must place large orders abroad.</P>

      <P>On 18 December last, Swansea Cork Ferries Ltd. applied for an Exchequer grant of £1.8 million towards the cost of operating the Cork-Swansea ferry service.</P>
      <P>On 16 February 1988, the Government decided that £300,000 should be made available to the company from the budget allocation of £4 million for a package of special measures for tourism in 1988.  The purpose of this grant was to assist Swansea Cork Ferries Ltd. in marketing and promoting the company's services to Cork in the interests of increasing the number of foreign tourists visiting the south-west region.</P>
      <P>The grant was an exceptional one and was facilitated by the availability of the special budget allocation for tourist development purposes.  It continues to be my policy that the Exchequer should not grant-aid the operations of private commercial ferry companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bonamia has been found in Clew Bay, County Mayo.  This is the second instance of the disease in Irish waters.  Bonamia was first discovered in oyster stocks in Cork Harbour in March 1987.  Following that discovery, I made an Order banning the movement of all molluscan shellfish within Irish waters except for human consumption or under licence from my Department.  An intensive programme of testing was put into operation at that time, taking samples from oyster beds all around the coast.  To date Clew Bay is the only area other than Cork Harbour where the disease has been confirmed.</P>
      <P>The effects of this latest discovery of Bonamia are:</P>
      <P>(a)  a ban on the movement of shellfish from Clew Bay for re-laying in other areas, and</P>
      <P>(b)  a ban on the re-laying of Clew Bay oysters in French waters, although Clew Bay oysters may still be exported to France in baskets for direct sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to reports from France, my Department received unofficial reports from France in January to the effect that French scientists had discovered Bonamia in a consignment of Clew Bay oysters.  I sent a member of the staff of FRC to investigate and report back.  It transpired that French scientists had developed a technique &mdash; only perfected in February <Col N="1485" />&mdash; of using heart blood samples only and which is capable of detecting Bonamia at very low levels.  This method of testing is now being used by the FRC which is now carrying out extensive tests of Clew Bay to establish the extent of the outbreak of Bonamia there.  The testing programme in other areas around the coast will be continued.  The regulations governing the movements of molluscan shellfish will be kept under review in the light of the results of the tests which are being carried out.</P>
    <P>I would add for the information of the Deputy that Bonamia, which is a difficult disease to detect by any means, is completely harmless to the human consumer. It affects native, edulis, oysters only and can lead to high mortalities in adult oysters. It does not kill pacific, gigas, oysters and there is no evidence to suggest that any other species of shellfish can spread the disease.</P>
