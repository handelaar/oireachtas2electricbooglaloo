    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1988. - Vote 38: Defence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>,<i>Limerick West</i>): I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,700,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for the payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Financial year ending 31 December 1988, which was passed by the Dáil in May last, was for a net sum of £252,144,000.  The Supplementary Estimate for Defence which I am now introducing is for an additional sum of £3,700,000.  The Supplementary Estimate provides for additional expenditure mainly on new naval vessels and fishery protection communications facilities and also on transport, defensive equipment, medical equipment and building work.  The gross extra expenditure requirement is £16,820,000.  This is partially off-set by savings and increased Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £13,120,000, thus reducing the net supplementary requirement to £3,700,000.</P>
    <P>The main item of additional expenditure is £13,800,000 under Subhead P in respect of the acquisition of two Peacock class patrol vessels for the Naval Service. The additional expenditure also caters for the installation of a computerised information system for use in fishery protection activities.</P>
    <P>The new vessels, which came on the market recently, have been acquired from the British Ministery of Defence and will be re-named L.E. <i>Orla</i> and L.E. <i>Ciara.</i> They were taken over by personnel of the Naval Service on 27 October 1988.  These vessels are relatively new and are in very good condition.  They are replacements for the minesweepers which were taken out of service in 1987 <Col N="1030" /> because they had become unseaworthy. As in the case of the minesweepers, the role of the new vessels will be of a fishery protection nature.  The vessels have an effective operational range of 3,000 nautical miles and have a maximum speed of 26 knots, which is considerably faster than the speed of our existing patrol vessels.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the acquisition of the new craft.  I have made arrangements for an intake of 100 recruits to off-set wastage and to enable the Naval Service to meet the extra staffing requirements arising from the purchase of these vessels.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £1 million is included under Subhead P for the provision of a modern communications and information system for the Naval Service. The facilities are being provided in connection with the fishery protection activities of the Naval Service.  They comprise communications, radar and data-processing equipment.</P>
    <P>The installation of a satellite communication link between the naval base and each patrol vessel will considerably improve communication facilities and provide a high quality voice and telex link with vessels irrespective of weather, position, or time of day.  Four of the patrol vessels are being refitted as necessary with more powerful radars, thereby increasing their detection range.  A modern data-processing system is being installed at the naval base which will have data links with the patrol vessels and the Air Corps at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnell. In addition four of the patrol vessels are being provided with all-weather boarding boats.</P>
    <P>This programme of improved fishery surveillance facilities, which will significantly enhance the efficiency of the fishery protection service provided by the Naval Service, has been approved by the European Commission.  The total cost involved will be over £2 million, of which about £1 million is due for payment this year.  It is expected that part of the cost involved will be recouped from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Provision for an additional sum of <Col N="1031" /> £1,500,000 for the purchase of vehicles is included under Subhead J.  Some additional expenditure arises under Subhead H in respect of defensive equipment which is now expected to be available before the end of this financial year at a cost of £840,000.  Similarly under Subhead I, an earlier than originally planned for expenditure of approximately £180,000 on X-ray equipment for St. Bricin's military hospital and other medical supplies is provided for.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 has been a good year for making progress on building works &mdash; probably because of the favourable weather conditions.  As a result, expenditure on the construction and maintenance of buildings has been heavier than expected in the year to date.  Some essential building works were undertaken and completed ahead of time.  It is anticipated that an additional sum of £500,000 will be required under Subhead S by the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The total increase of £16,820,000 is partially off-set by savings amounting to £9,220,000 and increased Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £3,900,000.  Apart from the savings on the pay subheads, the main savings arise on Subhead O2 dealing with aircraft, where a saving of £3,300,000 is anticipated due to aircraft maintenance requirements being less than expected.</P>
    <P>The increase of £3,900,000 under Appropriations-in-Aid consists of additional receipts from the United Nations in respect of arrears due.  This arises mainly because of a change of heart by one of the major powers in regard to paying its arrears of contribution to the UN fund for the United Nations interim force in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Now I turn to the Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions for the year ending 31 December 1988.  The Estimate for Army Pensions for the current year was also passed by this House last May and was for a net sum of £40,385,000. The Supplementary Estimate is for an additional sum of £2,350,000 net and is required to enable my Department to make payment of the December 1988 <Col N="1032" /> issue of pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts and the Defence Forces pensions schemes in the middle of the month instead of at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The proposed early payment will facilitate the introduction during 1989 of a new system of payment of pensions and allowances by payable orders instead of by warrants.  The change will bring my Department's system of payment into line with that in operation for other public service pensioners such as civil servants and gardaí.  I might also mention that the maintenance of the present system of payment, which involves daily settlement with the Central Bank in respect of warrants presented for payment through the commercial banks, would create considerable difficulties in the context of the decentralisation of the Finance, including Pensions, Branch of my Department to Galway in mid-1989.</P>
    <P>The December issue of pensions and allowances would ordinarily be made at the end of the month and would fall to be met from the following year's Vote. This is because, unlike payable orders, which are charged against the Vote on the basis of the date of issue, warrants are not charged against the Vote until they have been presented for payment. Thus, the early issue of the December pensions and allowances will result in 13 months issues, instead of the usual 12, being charged against this year's Vote and hence the need for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The gross extra expenditure requirement is £2,740,000.  This is again partially off set by savings, including increased Appropriations-in-Aid, amounting to £390,000, thus reducing the net Supplementary requirement to £2,350,000.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. If Deputies require more information on any points I have raised, I shall be glad to respond within the time available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Supplementary Estimates as presented by the Minister, I have no trouble in accepting the figures mentioned or the reasons for <Col N="1033" /> the expenditure.  I will come back to the savings later.</P>
      <P>The coastal patrol capability is a most important security aspect and we lack the resolve to tackle the job seriously. Today's expenditure of £13.8 million on two secondhand naval vessels does nothing other than replace two minesweepers which had to be called ashore because they were unseaworthy.  This raises several questions.  I contend that the naval services are so under strength at the moment in both staff and equipment that their undoubted efficiency is absolutely under siege and they are unable to carry out their brief to the extent that they and indeed we as legislators, would like.  The high seas have always been renowned for rough justice and in centuries past it was the survival of the fittest and down through the centuries not much has changed.  A Spanish or Swedish factory fishing vessel which decides to plunder our fishing stocks does our economy great damage.  A boatload of illegal arms or ammunition earmarked for the IRA or others will probably kill or maim thousands of innocent people and will help to weaken our security strategy.  The mind boggles at what illegal dumping of drugs and drug trafficking will do to our young people.  The Naval Service has to deal in part with all of this and maybe do a great deal more.</P>
      <P>Because of the responsibility thrust on the international community to suppress terrorism, Ireland, with others, should receive much greater financial assistance from the EC.  After all, drug trafficking and illegal arms smuggling are problems common to all countries and can be stamped out only by a co-ordinated patrol strategy.  Ireland has too much coastline to patrol and too few taxpayers to pay for it.  I estimate that we would need at least to treble our naval strength to be anywhere near the point of reasonable surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, our present naval protection is far from adequate.  I understand that at any given time there are only two naval vessels in action because of the necessity to carry out maintenance on the others and to maintain a roster of crew.  Some <Col N="1034" /> fishermen would say they would not see a naval patrol vessel for days.  If this is true, then the position is clearly not satisfactory. Have we made any headway with our application to Brussels for funding to purchase extra vessels?  Did we look for or receive any funding for the two patrol vessels we have purchased or was an application made to Brussels for such funding?  I would like to ask the Minister if we have an overall plan for the Naval Service and how technology can be introduced to provide a better service.</P>
    <P>Why has it taken so long to equip the <i>LE Eithne</i> with a helicopter?  The ship has the facility for this and now the Dauphin helicopters are operational this should be looked at immediately.  Have the new boats for which this Supplementary Estimate is being brought in today the facility to carry a helicopter?  This brings me to the whole question of our search and rescue service.  Everybody now accepts that a new approach is called for with our rescue service.  Our most vulnerable area, the western seaboard, is least equipped to deal with the all too frequent accidents. My party's proposal to relocate the entire Dauphin helicopter range from Baldonnel to Shannon, in my view is very reasonable.  It makes sense to place helicopters at a point where maximum advantage can be gained.  Let me add here that, following a number of queries to the Minister in the House at Question Time the day before yesterday a great schemozzle seems to be going on in some newspaper reports today as to whether we have the capability as far as manpower is concerned in the Air Corps to shift the squadron anywhere because so many Air Corps pilots want to leave.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rescue service, if the pilots are now trained to the stage where they can fly at night, as some reports from the Department of Defence suggest &mdash; others suggest they cannot, and to be honest, I am not 100 per cent sure whether they can, but I assume we are nearing the point where our Dauphin helicopters can be flown at night &mdash; because they have a range of 100 miles or so, it makes great sense to relocate them at Shannon.  Recent tests which my <Col N="1035" /> party carried out with the aid of a helicopter proved what everybody knows but had to be proven, that thus one was at least one hour closer to the centre of the calamity or disaster.  In the context of rescue on the high seas, that is extremely important.  I take this opportunity today to ask the Minister to ensure that no consideration, good, bad or indifferent, will stand in the way of the effort to ensure that the best possible cover is given for the amount of equipment we have and for the areas most in need.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that if the helicopter squadron is placed at Shannon the east coast will be left wide open.  That is not so because the other helicopters are there and there is the very fine working arrangement we have with Great Britain.  There are almost twice as many life boat stations on the east coast as there are on the west coast.  On behalf of the 4,000 or so strong island communities, the many thousands of people involved in the fishing communities and the isolated mainland communities from Cork to Donegal, I appeal to the Minister to make this change as these people would feel much safer.  I hope there will be no foot dragging on the matter and that it will be done immediately irrespective of inside pressures to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> There is great public pressure at the moment for this change.</P>
    <P>This, in itself, would not be enough to deal with the great disasters far out at sea.  There is no reason the Department of Defence should not have an arrangement with a private helicopter company to have on 24 hour standby a huge helicopter like the British Seakings with the capacity to fly 200 or 300 miles out, to carry at least 20 or 30 persons and the ability to hover in the air for a couple of hours.  Such aircraft exist.  I am not saying for one moment that our economy could afford to purchase one but that does not mean we cannot supply it.  Other countries such as Great Britain, Norway and others have this system.  It would allow us to provide the service at a reasonable cost without having to lay out the capital <Col N="1036" /> cost.  There is no reason an outside firm could not complement the work of the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister overall appear to be all right.  I find it difficult to understand how, at the eleventh hour, a saving of £9.2 million could be arrived at on an Estimate which we passed in this House last April or May.  This is quite a substantial amount of money and if it was achieved by efficiencies within the service I would congratulate everybody concerned. I assume the reason for the saving is that many things were not allowed to happen.  One of the things here, a saving of £3.2 million on aircraft relates, I assume, to the maintenance of aircraft. It has been indicated to me recently that because huge numbers of technicians have left their jobs, there are none to carry out the work.  It would be a very negative thing if that was the way we actually saved £3.2 million.</P>
    <P>At a time when there is huge unrest in regard to the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces, the fact that we are able to say that there is a saving of £9.2 million will, I imagine, ring very hollow with the Army personnel and their spouses when they believed they would be getting a sum far greater than that.  In the light of the savings made I have to ask the Minister how soon can we expect an announcement of a worthwhile increase in pay and allowances and conditions for our Defence Forces.  The figures I have here in front of me today will not make good reading for those people who are so hard pressed.</P>
    <P>Also on the question of pay and conditions, I find it difficult to understand why the interdepartmental committee are taking so long to give their findings or proposals to the Minister who in turn would bring them to the Cabinet.  It was well known when the Estimates were being framed last year that all was not well in the Defence Forces as far as pay and conditions were concerned.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy, particularly since there is a limited time at his disposal, but I see nothing in the Supplementary <Col N="1037" /> Estimates before us today appertaining to pay and salary scales.  A fleeting reference is in order but I would not wish any Member to go into the matter in depth.  It is not included in the Supplementary Estimates before us this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that when I was told about the savings it would have been in order to talk about the entire Estimate.  However, I bow to your ruling on it.  I would hope that the question of the poor pay and conditions in the Army will not have to be mentioned on the floor of this House again and that that problem will be solved by the next occasion we are here.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the question of communications and the new data processing system being installed at the naval base.  I understand that this has been sought for a long time and it is very important. I hope the whole thing can be co-ordinated when the helicopters are actually brought to Shannon.  I must confess that I do not fully understand this technical end but I understand that one of the problems in regard to helicopters landing on the <i>LE Eithne</i>, apart from the fact that the helicopter is not there to do it, is that the communications link has not been got right.  I hope the investment we are hearing about here today will get us over that problem.  Obviously we have to be as good in the field of technology as the people we are trying to keep out of our waters for whatever reason.</P>
      <P>Many of these people are geared with the best telecommunications technology in the world and if we cannot be as good, if not better, we will find ourselves outdated once again.  I hope the Minister can assure the House that the communications system built into this is the best available and will not be outdated in three or four years time.  Nothing less is any good in the circumstances.  I hope that from 1989 onwards, until we get our strength up, we will be able to buy or lease the type of naval patrol vessels that are important for the task in hand.</P>

      <P>Finally, I welcome the fact that the Department have purchased the two vessels.  I hope the 100 persons will be recruited shortly and that they will be very successful because we will be depending on them.  I should like to pay tribute to the Naval Service who have been doing a fine job under the worst possible conditions.  It is with a certain amount of sadness and distress that I note that the Estimate for 1989 does not contain sufficient money to enable the Naval Service to do their job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on purchasing the two vessels for the Naval Service and I am pleased to note that he intends to recruit personnel for those vessels.  The seas around our coast are constantly being used by drug and arms smugglers. We are all aware of the huge quantities of arms that were landed here in recent years.  Like others I am concerned that our seas are not patrolled properly.  The law of the sea amounts to the survival of the fittest and for that reason our Naval Service must be kept up to a proper standard so that they can combat the dangerour events that take place from time to time.</P>
      <P>It is a poor reflection on the commitment of this Government to our Defence Forces that the reason we are here today debating these Forces is not the crisis currently afflicting them, not the need to tackle the numerous and serious problems facing them but to approve a Supplementary Estimate for the amounts required in this year for retired pay, pensions, compensation, allowances and gratuities payable to the members of the Defence Forces and certain other people and to approve a Supplementary Estimate for the amount needed for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence and certain services administered by that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that none of these items, important as they may be in their own right, has any relationship to the really <Col N="1039" /> critical issues facing these Forces.  They will have no effect on the problems of appalling conditions, low morale and the appalling pay of the Defence Forces and they will not tackle the allegations of intimidation and abuse of personnel whose spouses are members of the National Association of Army Spouses.</P>
    <P>The truth is that our Defence Forces are in an atrocious state.  They are facing many problems.  These problems have been developing for many years but nobody has done anything about them. It was only over this summer when these problems reached the headlines of our newspapers and television screens that any action was taken.</P>
    <P>Since the summer, however, little has changed.  The committee appointed by the Government to investigate the problems of the Defence Forces, and particularly to examine levels of pay, have not yet reported.  However, I was delighted to learn that an improvement will be announced before Christmas.  The Minister for Defence was not able to tell the House on Wednesday when he expected the committee to make their report but I welcome the statements in the media that it is expected soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify what exactly he means by saying that the results of the report would be positive.  It will simply not be good enough to throw a couple of extra pounds a week at these soldiers and say that this is positive. Levels of pay for these people have fallen way behind what is an acceptable wage. Action must be taken immediately to restore these levels to a reasonable level and it must be taken immediately, not over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Pay, however, is only one aspect of the problems facing the Defence Forces.  The conditions under which these people have to operate are equally bad and, therefore, are in equal need of review.  The living accommodation and even the standards of the equipment being used by our Defence Forces are all in an atrocious state.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that with conditions as bad as these there should be problems <Col N="1040" /> with morale.  Again, it has been quite obvious for some time now that these problems would arise.  In January of this year I warned about the worsening situation. I did so because it was obvious that it was serious.  In November of 1987 an extra 400 people were taken into the Defence Forces.  Despite this, however, the number at the end of the year was still some 200 lower than it had been the previous year.  More significantly, over the year of 1987 an average of between 60 and 70 people were leaving the forces each month.  These were people who were not leaving the forces to become part of a booming economy; they were leaving to join an economy which had massive emigration and huge levels of unemployment, but they still preferred to take their chances with that than stay part of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Over the past year this situation has not got any better.  In fact, I would be very amazed if the number leaving this year is not significantly greater than was the case in 1987.  The seriousness of the situation was demonstrated by the fact that the Government have recently had to go to the court to prevent an Air Corps pilot from leaving.  In fact, it is a tribute to the dedication, loyalty and commitment of the men and women who serve in our Defence Forces that the problems of morale are not much worse than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The very high standards which we, as a country, receive and which we have come it seems to take for granted, from our Defence Forces has been highlighted over recent weeks by the fact that a representative of the Irish Army has been chosen by the United Nations Peace-keeping Force to accept the Nobel Peace Prize which the peacekeeping forces won this year as a recognition of their role in safeguarding the cause of peace throughout the world in recent years.  It is against this background that the recent allegations of intimidation and abuse against members of the Defence Forces whose spouses are members of the National Association of Army Spouses must be seen.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Defence was <Col N="1041" /> asked about this issue at Question Time in the Dáil on Wednesday he denied having any knowledge about it and asked Deputies to cite to him details of individual cases.  In view of the present climate in the Defence Forces, however, it is wholly impracticable to expect such information to be forthcoming.  Throughout yesterday, however, representatives of the National Association of Army Spouses again repeated claims that this intimidation and abuse was going on and specific reference was made to three barracks in the Dublin region.  In view of the seriousness of these allegations, I believe that the Minister should now undertake an investigation to ensure that no such intimidation or abuse is occurring.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing thing about the various problems currently facing the Defence Forces is that they are a reflection of the general approach which successive Governments have taken to the whole issue of defence and the whole question of our military role.  The fact is that successive Irish Governments have viewed our stance as a neutral country as an excuse to do nothing about our Defence Forces.  This is a serious error. Being neutral is no excuse for ignoring our responsibilities.  In fact, our neutrality should demand that we take extra interest in and care of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Under international law, neutral States must take whatever military measures are necessary to ensure that their territory is not used in any way by one belligerent to the disadvantage of another.  Those countries which fail to comply with this provision may lose their neutral status and a belligerent which feels that its interests are threatened by the military weakness of a neighbouring non-belligerent State may legitimately take whatever military or political action is necessary to ensure that the territory of the non-belligerent or neutral country is not used to its own military disadvantage. A country does not become neutral simply by declaring itself neutral.</P>
    <P>The contrast between how we, as a neutral country, organise our military affairs and how other neutral countries <Col N="1042" /> in Europe, namely, Austria and Finland do so, reveals a lot about how we deal with the issue.  Austria has a population of 7.6 million.  It maintains a total armed force of just under 55,000 or 0.7 per cent of the population.  It spends 1.2 per cent of its GNP on defence.  The Austrian army has 170 heavy and 240 light tanks, 460 armoured personnel carriers and 200 pieces of field artillery plus 460 anti-aircraft guns.  Its air arm deploys 38 modern fighter aircraft and has 18 more on order, the same air arm also has 14 transports and 85 helicopters with 36 training and general-purpose aircraft.</P>
    <P>Finland has a population of some 4.9 million people.  It maintains an armed force of some 35,000 or 0.7 per cent of its population which is the same proportion as for Austria.  It spends some 1.7 per cent of its GNP on defence annually. Its army has 150 heavy and 15 light tanks 30 armoured cars, 200 armoured personnel carriers, over 400 pieces of field artillery and 300 anti-aircraft guns.  Its 3,000-man navy has two modern corvettes, 14 fast attack craft with four more on order, five anti-submarine patrol vessels, two minelayers and 14 minesweepers. The Finish air force has 74 fighters, 20 transport aircraft, eight helicopters and 83 trainers, 48 of which have an additional light strike capability.</P>
    <P>In this country, we have a population of some 3.5 million.  Our Defence Forces consist of some 13,000 people which is equivalent to 0.4 per cent of the population. We spend annually some 1.3 per cent of our GNP on our Defence budget. Our 11,000-man Army has only 14 light tanks, 52 armoured cars, 20 armoured personnel carriers, 60 pieces of field and 28 of anti-aircraft artillery.  Our Navy, with a strength of less than 1,000 has only seven coastguard vessels of minimal military potential.  Our air arm which has a similar strength has no true combat aircraft and consists of 15 trainer or light-strike aircraft, eight light-army co-operation or communications aircraft, four transport aircraft and 15 helicopters.  Two of our transport planes are used for maritime patrol.</P>
    <P>We can see from this, therefore, that <Col N="1043" /> we currently maintain Defence Forces which have a strength little more than half those of Austria or Finland, relative to population.  In contrast to this, however, we spend a slightly higher propoetion of our GNP than Austria and slightly less than 70 per cent that of Finland in doing so and we equip our forces to a much lower level than those of either of these countries.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that we are not taking our neutrality seriously.  It is also obvious that we are not even getting value for money for the money we are spending.</P>
    <P>When comparing figures like these people will obviously say we are not in as serious a situation as either Austria or Finland and that, therefore, we can afford to take our neutrality a little less seriously.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The fact is that not only does this country have to contend with the possibility of an outside threat, we also have to deal with the very real and immediate threat posed to this State by the campaign of armed subversion being organised against it and against our immediate neighbour, by the IRA terrorist organisation and the possibility of terrorist action from a much wider range of organisations.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the consequences and responsibilities of this threat.  We must ensure that we have a defence force capable of dealing with it.  Up to now this country has never really been sure exactly what role we wanted our Defence Forces to play.  On the one hand we expect them to fulfil what we regard as the normal role of a Defence Force.  On the other hand, however, we also expect them to protect us against terrorist subversion and at the same time to look after our interests when various public bodies go on strike.  We have told them to run our buses, to clean our streets, to man our power stations and to empty our bins.</P>
    <P>But while we have told them to do all this we have refused to recognise their value by paying them a proper wage, by <Col N="1044" /> keeping whem well equiped or by ensuring that their conditions are up to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The consequences of this appalling attitude are now plain to be seen.  Action must now be taken to ensure that we address those problems and take action to ensure they will not arise again.</P>
    <P>In particular the Government must without further delay take action to end the appallingly low levels of pay and must begin to improve the conditions under which we expect these most important and loyal people to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Defence I would like, very briefly, because it is not necessary to repeat some of the points that have been made forcibly already in relation to conditions in the Army, to emphasise that very point.  This last session of the Dáil has seen the wives of those serving in the Permanent Defence Forces organise and come to Leinster House and present their case for better conditions, not only for their husbands, I emphasise, but for their families.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister given in the last few days that there will be a quick report from the review.</P>
      <P>I worry about the implementation of the conclusions of such a review when there appears to be little provision of a financial kind made for its implementation in the short term.  That point worries me.  It is very important in the interest of morale in our Defence Forces that the issues of pay, of promotions, of conditions and of a general review be regarded as of extreme urgency.  This is a matter to which Deputies Pattison, Bell and others have drawn attention during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time that is available to us in discussing Supplementary Estimates only a number of points can be made.  I would like, therefore, to confine myself to a few.  In the course of Dáil questions answered this session and in the previous session and, indeed, in the last few years, a number of us have asked what the position is in relation to female participation <Col N="1045" /> in our Defence Forces.  What we have heard can give nothing but grounds for disquiet.  The evidence presented to myself shows that those who have reached officer grade within the Army are regarded, because they are women, as people who are not suitable for combative duties and, so, find themselves limited to simply administrative functions. This is an extraordinary prejudice which, of course, predominates within our culture generally.  To find it within a Department of State and within an activity responsible to a Department of State is particularly appalling.  There is another side to this as well and that is that an analysis of the recruitment pattern shows that the recruitment of cadets does not include females.  Certainly there is no encouragement to suggest that women can look forward to an equal career in the Army.</P>
    <P>In relation to discussions I have had with members of the Army, many of them from a long macho tradition, they have informed me that some parts of the service have been saved from women's participation.  &ldquo;Look at the effects of it in Britain&rdquo; was one of the remarks I heard. I appeal to the Minister for Defence to ensure that the future philosophy and the future policy of the Department of Defence will be such as will honour the equality principle in practice.  I do not want to hear a great deal of guff to the effect that that is the position.  What I want is a straight answer to a straight question.  What functions are women who are officers in the Army precluded from? Are they entitled to a full range of participation as equals?  What is the position in relation to recruitment practices?  Are they being treated equally or not?  I do not want to be given the bland answer about how well all the women in the Army are doing &mdash; that is Christmas card stuff &mdash; I want straight answers to those two kinds of questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I want <Col N="1046" /> to make in relation to the general discussion which is developing now relates to our Naval Service.  I welcome any commitment that is made to improve our Naval Service and indeed there is specific reference to that.  I should like to say that our Naval Service was placed in an incredibly difficult position following our accession to the European Community. When we were involved in the heady days of the entry campaign I recall a small number of TDs &mdash; Deputy McGinley, the late Clement Coughlan and some others &mdash; being interested in addressing the issue of what the implications would be for the future of the fishing industry but one was swimming against the tide in relation to the benefits for milk and the large scale commercial agricultural producers.  We ended up in a disgraceful position in relation to our fisheries resources where no effort was made to seek protocol that would have defended our fisheries resources, a protocol which I might say was available.  In the end because of the insufficiency of the guarantees given the Norwegian Government decided not to proceed with their application.  The work at diplomatic level was done but it was once again a hasty rush to what were perceived to be the benefits of butter and beef to the exclusion of the national interests, including fisheries.</P>
      <P>During the time I was a member of the first Oireachtas joint committee between 1973 and 1977, of which the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, was chairman, he, other Deputies, and I visited the European Commission.  At that stage it was clear that we were arguing against limits which had been given away and quotas which had been badly established. It was very clear that what had emerged was that we did not have the capacity by way of naval protection to even protect the crumbs which had been granted to us late in the day.  I think we are becoming a nation akin to the political postulance of St. Jude in relation to the European Community when we find thrown into speeches phrases such as &ldquo;it is hoped that the European Community can assist in this regard&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the status of an aspiration such <Col N="1047" /> as that?  The fact is that we had a responsibility and we exercised it badly.  We are now moving very slowly for an inadequate level of protection.  We have brave and good officers and I must say that I regret that some of them have been intimidated in seeking to implement conservation policies which are in the interests of not only ourselves but also of the Community, but the thinking of the European Community in this regard is not very wholehearted.  We have seen an invasion of our fishing grounds by fleets. I can look out from my home in Galway any evening I care to choose and see the lights of foreign vessels fishing off the Aran Islands and our facilities are totally inadequate to deal with this problem.  It is a matter of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>A great deal of reference has been made and I disagree with Deputy Clohessy in this regard &mdash; to the confusion that exists in this House.  There are Members here, somewhat arrogant people I might say, who suggest that the theme of neutrality has never been debated.  I was chairman of the Labour Party for ten years between 1977 and 1987.  Prior to that we had published a policy document on neutrality.  We had agreed with other parties and groups of the Left that we should use our neutrality within the context of a positive neutrality. Let me say only a word about that.  Externally, positive neutrality means that it informs ones foreign policy in all respects.  Secondly, it also means that there be a cohesive approach, for example, towards seeking to align oneself with other neutral nations such as the countries of Scandinavia or the progressive members of the non-aligned movement.  It also means that it informs one's human rights policies.  Internally it means that one educates in the values of peace and neutrality so that it is not perceived as a burden.</P>
    <P>The first person to write on the subject of neutrality comprehensively was Tom Johnson.  Before the formal foundation of the State a paper was submitted by Tom Johnson on the role of a future <Col N="1048" /> Ireland.  One of my predecessors as chairman of the Labour Party, the late Deputy Michael Keyes, also addressed this issue comprehensively.  It is not a policy which began with Mr. de Valera and it is not a policy hedged with conditions, that we are only neutral if Ireland is united.  That is a peculiar piece of Fianna Fáil casuistry. It is not a policy which says we are militarily neutral but that we are really part of the West.  It is in that latter part that the greatest danger lies.  If people say we are only militarily neutral they should tell the public that.  When those of us on this side of the House speak of neutrality we do not speak about the strange notion that we are ideologically of the West and at the same time somehow militarily neutral, thereby setting up a false dilemma and paradox where there is no consistency between our policy of neutrality and our defence relationships, and going on to argue that only a country with enormous defence potential can really afford to be neutral.</P>
    <P>That is a limited view based entirely on a false premise.  It ignores altogether the role of neutrality within foreign policy and the general community of nations.  In this city 12 months ago my party organised a conference which I chaired.  Many of the neutrals of Europe are now seeking a new relationship with the Community and they would be very anxious to find Ireland participating with them in a new alternative to the WEU and other groups within the European Community.  Here, I am speaking about Austria, to which reference has been made already, and many other countries, such as Malta, who are seeking relationships and who see in their different patterns and historical paths towards neutrality a great enrichment in the concept.  In the confusion which has been sown there has been a drift inevitably to the idea that in a large integrated market post-1992 one will inevitably acquire obligations in regard to defence.  I also see the drift to the argument which suggests that one is required, not only because of the integrated market but because somehow or another it is communautaire, to be part of the common defence.  Our views on <Col N="1049" /> neutrality, those of us who take it seriously, are not negative and defensive but we see it as a building principle towards a wider theory of neutral interdependency and the playing of an effective role in international agencies and as something dynamic which can be used, for example, to widen space between the superpowers.  There is evidence of this everywhere.  Therefore, neutrality is not reducible to military neutrality except for those who want to fudge on the issue, and neither can it be reduced to a defence issue.</P>
    <P>A number of other points have been made.  There was a reference to our peace-keeping role.  Has it struck anybody that one of the great reasons we are welcome in providing our forces and we are almost at the top of the invitation list to serve in a peace-keeping role is precisely because of our historical conditions and because people have perhaps an exaggerated sense of our independence in foreign policy.  I join with other Deputies who paid tribute to the United Nations peace-keeping force on the receipt of their award which will be accepted in Stockholm by Perez de Cuellar and be received by a member of the Irish Defence Forces.  Many of the Irish people who have served have died in the interests of peace, some of them from my own city.  They have been part of the great principal structure of the United Nations whose great achievement was the drawing up of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights whose anniversary we will be celebrating tomorrow.  I almost tragically made the mistake of saying celebrating here, because our own Minister for Foreign Affairs will be joining in in the celebrations in Paris and there will be celebrations in most of the European capitals.  I have yet to be made aware of any significant celebrations organised by the Government to celebrate the signing, on 10 December 1948, of the most important charter of human rights of this century.</P>
    <P>This speaks volumes because we have neglected to understand the internal principles of neutrality through our hostility to studying political social studies and <Col N="1050" /> we have also precluded any discussions among our school children of the importance of human rights.  I do not blame the present incumbent at the Department of Foreign Affairs for this as I know he is a man deeply committed to peace and to making a significant contribution abroad.  It is a great pity that we are not celebrating these events formally.  It would be useful if we were to have a brief session of Parliament to recall the moment we signed the declaration. When we come to discuss another Estimate I will deal with the manner in which we have failed to ratify some of the conventions.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by making a very specific request for information.  It is only on occasions such as this, in discussing the Estimates for the Department of Defence, be it the major Estimate or a Supplementary Estimate, that I can ask what is happening on the Irish Sea and in regard to the activities of submarines of foreign nations in the Irish Sea.  Newspaper accounts, investigative accounts and reports on fishing vessels which have been damaged have been allowed to fade away without any effective answer being given.  This is my question: what are we doing within the realm of defence to ensure that the waters over which we have jurisdiction by several Statutes are not used as an information corridor by the superpowers?  What is happening in relation to this submarine activity?  What information has the Minister to tell the House &mdash; does he require assistance from abroad or what extra assistance does he need?  Is it not possible, for example, for us, along with other neutral and peace-loving countries who do not want their waters to be used for subversive acts of aggression and information gathering of different kinds, to apply new technology sensitively so as to ensure jurisdiction over the waters for which we have responsibility?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of The Workers' Party to indicate that this Supplementary Estimate moved by the Minister for Defence is most unwelcome, untimely and should not earn the support of this House.  We completely reject the <Col N="1051" /> Supplementary Estimate and intend to vote against it when the opportunity arises.  It is remarkable that, when we have an opportunity to discuss savings in the areas of pensions, wages, allowances and expenditure in other areas, we cannot muster into the House more than four Deputies at any one time.  One thinks of the times during the past few weeks when we were honoured by the presence in the Public Gallery of the spouses of the enlisted members in the Defence Forces and there was hardly a seat available in the House.  It is also to be noted that not one member of the press is here to listen to anything which has to be said by the various Deputies and the Minister.  While interest in this matter, both within the House and elsewhere, seems to be waning.  I want to make the point that the issues have not changed and that the resolution of those of us within The Workers' Party and on the Left will be maintained until something effective is done to resolve the problems in relation to the pay and conditions of the members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the members of the Defence Forces and their spouses have highlighted such issues as the pay and working conditions of the members of the Defence Forces, and the shame of the major reliance on the family income supplement scheme as a means of propping up and helping to cope with the real poverty imposed on members of the Defence Forces, the inadequate housing and medical services available to the Defence Forces &mdash; and I note that in a pitiful letter sent by the Minister to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights he admitted that the barracks where soldiers are obliged to live are &ldquo;substandard and unhygienic&rdquo;&mdash; and the fact that promotions within the Defence Forces are almost negligible.  In spite of all this, we are now being asked by the Minister for Defence to agree to a Supplementary Estimate which involves savings of almost £3 million in the area of wages, allowances and benefits.  The Minister has got to tell the House how he has achieved these savings and on what basis he can <Col N="1052" /> find the courage to stand up here in the face of all the evidence of real poverty within the ranks of the Defence Forces and ask us to agree to this Supplementary Estimate.  I attended a meeting in Dublin of representatives of the spouses of the members of the Defence Forces and I listened to one woman who told of her pitiful experience of having to maintain a husband and five children on approximately £140 a week.  That cannot be tolerated nor allowed to continue for much longer.  There is no way any member of The Workers' Party could agree to a Supplementary Estimate that allows for savings in the areas of income, wages, allowances and benefits when conditions like that exist within the Defence Forces. This is an utter disgrace.  I want to refer to some of the areas in which the Minister has achieved savings.</P>
    <P>I have already raised with the Minister the question of the outpost allowance. This is a very meagre payment which is not being entirely abolished but is under attack and being modified.  Because this allowance affects so few members the Minister believes that it can be done down.  The practice of describing what are effectively major military activities by the Defence Forces as nothing more than training exercises is a mean and typical example of the way the Minister treats his soldiers.  These activities have been carried out on numerous occasions this year, and I instanced one such occasion in the Dundalk area.</P>
    <P>Soldiers are mobilised to engage in a search and seize operation to look for the huge numbers of weapons landed in this country by the Provisional IRA on their <i>Eksund</i> expedition.  These soldiers are out of doors 24 hours of the day, they sleep in ditches and are fed from barrack tents.  They are told that it is not a military exercise or part of the remunerative area of their work for which they would be paid an allowance but is a training exercise. They carry out this work along with members of the Garda Síochána who, for doing exactly the same job, are paid overtime and get time-and-a-half or double-time for the same work carried <Col N="1053" /> out by these soldiers.  That is an intolerable situation and it is insulting that this is happening at a time when the Minister has come in here and asked us to agree to savings in the payment for this type of work.</P>
    <P>Of course, all of this highlights the fact that soldiers are not allowed to form their own representative association.  This is the kernal of this issue.  The spouses of the Defence Forces can come in here, when their domestic duties allow them to do so, and draw our attention to the issue and Deputies can raise their voices when the opportunity arises at Question Time or during the debate on an Estimate but the only effective way to deal with pay and working conditions in the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis is for the men and women involved to be represented through their own ranks by a representative association.  There is nothing in law or in the Constitution which would prohibit the establishment of such an association.  It has nothing to do with a prohibition on people meeting and, as the Minister told us recently, talking to public representatives about military matters; pay or working conditions or other details affecting the daily lives of soldiers does not amount to military matters and are matters which should and must be dealt with through the proper organised channels of a representative association.</P>
    <P>That message must go out from this House today and it must be repeated until soldiers stand up and say &ldquo;this is our association &mdash; not our spouses association but our association &mdash; which was formed by the men in the Defence Forces&rdquo;, as happens in every other European army. This matter was agreed to unanimously by the European Parliament as long ago as 12 April 1984.  The resolution has regard to such things as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which we hope to celebrate on the morrow.  There is reference to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, to which we are a party.  The resolution goes on to state that such professional organisations must have the right to take part in negotiations concerning the professional <Col N="1054" /> and social interests of their members. It refers to a resolution adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 8 May 1979 which allows police officers, military police, armed forces personnel and militiamen performing the functions of the police to establish, join and actively participate in, professional organisations.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate and for their tributes to the personnel of the Defence Forces.  I will have great pleasure in conveying those tributes to the military authorities.  I should like on my own behalf to re-echo those tributes, which are very well deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the limited time at my disposal I will deal with some of the points raised by Deputies.  The Naval Service has performed highly efficiently in its fishery patrolling role and in coastal surveillance. <Col N="1055" /> Facilities are adequate to cater for our needs.  Application has been made to the European Community for financial assistance towards the cost of the two vessels which have been purchased and it is expected that arising from discussions with the Commission positive proposals will be made in the near future regarding new financial arrangements which will benefit this country.  These discussions are at an advanced stage and are being actively pursued by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for adequate strength in the Naval Service.  Present numbers of personnel are adequate to meet requirements, bearing in mind the 100 new recruits who are being taken on for the ships which will be operating in the new year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the Air Corps.  They are quite capable of operating helicopters from the <i>LE Eithne,</i> as was demonstrated last year to EC officials.  The new Peacock class vessels cannot take helicopters and were never intended to do so.  Night flying training is continuing in the Dauphin helicopters and a number of successful rescue operations have taken place at night.  The question of improving air rescue services is being actively considered by me and my colleague, the Minister for the Marine. Decisions on the matters raised by Deputy Connaughton will be taken in the very near future and I hope they will be adequate to meet needs, keeping in mind all other constraints.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the anticipated saving of £3.2 million on aircraft.  This is due mainly to certain orders for aircraft spares and components not falling due for payment this year.  Spares ordered in 1988, costing in the order of £3 million, will not fall due for payment until 1989. This reflects the longer lead-on time on the part of manufacturers in the delivery of spare parts.  Certain efficiencies were also effected in the ordering of spares, which contributed to the reduction in costs.</P>
    <P>The new communication facility comprises a link by satellite between the <Col N="1056" /> patrol vessels of the Naval Service at sea and the naval base at Haulbowline and with the Air Corps base at Baldonnell. Fast voice and telex connections between these three activity centres is the kernel of the new system and it will certainly enhance operational capabilities significantly. The system is up to date and will serve the interests of the Naval Service for many years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned savings on pay and allowances.  The provision for pay this year was over £200 million and the anticipated savings on this provision amount to a little over 2 per cent of the total.  The saving on the Army pay subhead is approximately 1.2 per cent of the provision.  The level of expenditure on pay is affected not only by strength but also by the pattern of wastage and recruitment.  There are other savings in relation to the pay and salaries of the staff of my Department and civilian employees who are employed in barracks from time to time, depending on the need at any time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy referred to the interdepartmental committee on pay and allowances.  I do not propose to make any statement in the matter until the work of the committee has been completed.  It is a comprehensive investigation and a report will be issued very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy and other Deputies raised allegations about the intimidation of soldiers.  I am surprised that Deputy Clohessy is not here.  I have not received a single piece of evidence of intimidation of Army personnel by officers.  No instructions were issued by me with regard to the intimidation of soldiers. Until such time as I get the name of the person involved, the place and the time, I cannot carry out an investigation.  I want to give the assurance to the House again that an investigation will be carried out and the necessary action will be taken if any person is found guilty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said he was disturbed that he did not see any provision in the Supplementary Estimate for a pay increase, if that is recommended by the pay review committee.  Special arrangements <Col N="1057" /> will be made in that regard.  He also raised the point about women in the Defence Forces.  Again, we have to consider the question of recruiting additional women. That matter is considered from time to time but we also have to consider scarce resources, the combat role&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, moved the main 1988 Estimates for his Department in this House he had, because of time constraints, to limit his remarks on the tourism sector.  However, he promised <Col N="1059" /> Deputies he would deal mainly with tourism matters when the Supplementary Estimate was being taken for his Department. The Minister is attending a ministerial meeting in Brussels today and cannot be with us but I, on his behalf, will honour that promise now.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to look on this Supplementary Estimate not just as a simple book-keeping exercise but rather as part of the ongoing development strategy that we have pursued since taking office.  The occasion offers me an appropriate opportunity to review the progress that has been made and to sketch the path of our future progress.</P>
    <P>The economic philosophy behind this Supplementary Estimate is the use of buoyant revenues, generated by our imaginative tourism and air transport policies, as the feed stock investment for further development in the tourism and aviation sectors.</P>
    <P>I will deal with gross expenditure first. The main proposals in the Supplementary Estimate are to allocate an additional appropriation of £5.3 million to tourism, the provision of £1 million for grants for local airports and to make a number of minor adjustments within the other expenditure subheads in the Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>As an offset to these the Appropriations in aid for the Department of Tourism and Transport are £7.1 million higher than forecast in the 1988 Book of Estimates due principally to a £2 million increase in the Aer Rianta surplus, being surrendered to the Department, and £5.1 million in additional receipts from the Eurocontrol user charges.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address myself to the question of our tourism policy and performance.  As the House is aware this Government have chosen tourism as a sector for special development because of its potential for wealth and sustainable job creation.  We set ourselves high standards and targets.</P>
    <P>The targets as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are: to create an extra 25,000 jobs; to attract an additional £500 million in foreign tourist <Col N="1060" /> revenue; to double the number of foreign tourist visitors.  These are ambitious targets. We were confident, however, that with hard work, the right policies and increased investment they would work. In the course of my remarks I propose to show that our policies are working and that they provide a sound base on which further development can take place.  Our core strategy to maximise the potential of Irish tourism was set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Briefly it is to improve our price competitiveness; develop and improve the quality of existing products and expand our product range; improve the promotion and selling of our tourism products.  The results that we have achieved speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>1987 was a record year.  For the first time ever, total tourism revenue topped the £1 billion mark-up 18 per cent on 1986.  Out-of-State tourism revenue amounted to £723 million &mdash; up 12 per cent on 1986.  Over 2.1 million overseas visitors came to Ireland &mdash; an increase of 12 per cent over 1986.  The domestic market, disappointing in previous years, also improved dramatically with revenue exceeding £290 million, a 34 per cent increase on 1986.</P>
    <P>The momentum seen in 1987 has been maintained in 1988.  Estimates for the first nine months show an almost 13 per cent increase in visitor numbers compared with 1987.  All the indications are that we will be very close to achieving our 15 per cent growth target for 1988 as a whole. However, for me the most gratifying indicator of our success is that an estimated 12,000 new jobs have been created both directly and indirectly because of the increases in tourism numbers and revenue in the past two years.</P>
    <P>These results amply confirm that we are on course to achieve the targets in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> However there is no room for complacency. We must press ahead, continuing to keep our costs under control and improving the quality of the product.</P>
    <P>In the growing international tourism market, price is a significant factor in the choice of holiday destinations.  A major handicap for Irish tourism before we took <Col N="1061" /> office was the level of price inflation here and the impact which it had on our competitiveness. A central plank of the Government's overall economic policy is to control inflation.  Our inflation rate for 1988 is estimated at about 2 per cent which is well below the average predicted for EC and OECD countries and has helped keep price increases in the tourism product to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>At the level of the industry itself, we have also tackled price competitiveness. Among the measures we have taken have been a pilot car rental bonus scheme in autumn 1988 under which US visitors hiring a car for seven days were entitled to a $50 discount and the amendment of the VAT Refund Order, 1986, so that more imported tour coaches will benefit from the effective 10 per cent rate of VAT.  Tour coach operators can thus improve their product and compete effectively with UK operators.</P>
    <P>I singled out increased investment as a key factor for maintaining a buoyant and developing tourism industry.  We have achieved this by direct action and by creating an environment conducive to and rewarding for investors.</P>
    <P>The extension of the business expansion scheme to the export tourism sector has been a remarkable success.  Already Bord Fáilte have approved marketing and development plans for 28 projects involving planned investment of about £23 million.</P>
    <P>We have negotiated substantial special assistance for tourism development in the Border counties and Sligo through the ERDF and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last but by no means least in our list of direct achievements is the package we announced in August for the development of regional airports for tourism development purposes.</P>
    <P>The various practical initiatives in increasing investment, improving the product and providing the infrastructure are essential ingredients for a vibrant tourist industry.  However, we then have to sell our wares in international markets against fierce competition.  When we took office we recognised that our marketing <Col N="1062" /> was jaded and lacking in penetration and that an urgent reappraisal of our approach was necessary.  We introduced our own crash programme in May 1987 as a stop-gap measure.  We then did something that no other Government in this country had done before.  We went to the coal face to meet the practitioners in the industry.  We convened a tourism forum involving some 100 representatives from the industry to get the industry's views on the marketing and other initiatives which were needed for the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>The forum was a resounding success and as a result of its recommendations the Government allocated an additional £4 million for a special marketing programme for the 1988 season.  This involved an innovative series of marketing measures recommended by a specially established tourism task force which significantly boosted tourist traffic in 1988.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry reacted most positively to the campaign contributing over £2 million to top up the Government's contribution.  This was a most heartening and welcome development not only for the extra resources provided but also for the clear demonstration that the industry again had the confidence and commitment which had been sapped by ineffective leadership in previous years.</P>
    <P>In 1988 we continued at many levels the constructive dialogue we had established with the industry.  In September Bord Fáilte convened a forum of both domestic and foreign operators in the Irish tourism market.  Once again we have taken full account of the industry's views in adapting and developing our policies for tourism development.  We were also thrown out a challenge by the industry at this forum.  The President of the ITIC stated that if the Government allocated an extra £5 million to tourist promotion this would be matched by the industry.  We took up this challenge in the spirit in which it was offered.</P>
    <P>As a result the main provision in the Supplementary Estimate before us provides Bord Fáilte with a further £5 million for marketing purposes to boost traffic <Col N="1063" /> in 1989.  However, the industry are also making a matching contribution, so that we now have a special £10 million marketing programme in place for 1989.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that the direct involvement of the industry in this way is a welcome reversal of past trends when many operators in the industry tended to sit back and wait for the tourist to land on their doorstep.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I feel I should notify the House of a few very important developments in EC tourism policy over the past year.  In May the first ever meeting, albeit an informal one, of Ministers of Tourism in the Community took place. It was convened by the German Minister for Tourism.  Mr. Bangemann.  In September the Greek Presidency also convened an informal meeting of Tourism Ministers.  However, on Wednesday next, 14 December, we will see the first formal meeting of Ministers of Tourism since the Community was founded.  It may be a small step but it is a welcome one which shows that the importance we attach to tourism is also being accepted by most of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>I would also like to assure the House that we will take full advantage of this new and improved environment for tourism within the EC when devising our national and regional programmes for assistance from the Structural Funds.  We have continually emphasised to our colleagues in the various Councils of Ministers that there is no shortage of good quality tourism generating projects, particularly in the cultural and specialist leisure areas available in Ireland but the finance is not there to develop them as quickly as we would like.  Financial assistance from the EC would not only make a major contribution to accelerating the provision of such facilities and support services expected by tourists but would undoubtedly encourage further successful investment by the private sector in these products.</P>
    <P>A lack of appropriate resources is also responsible for our inability to develop major products such as the theme parks and outdoor pursuit centres which are <Col N="1064" /> now being established in other Community countries.  These developments incorporate accommodation, all weather cultural, recreational and day visitor attractions and act as major tourist magnets for a region with significant spin-off benefits for the economy, especially in terms of employment creation.  We have had discussions with a range of national and international entrepreneurs on the question of establishing such major projects in Ireland.  However, because grant assistance or other incentives are not available currently for such projects entrepreneurs could not proceed.  The lack of such facilities places us at a disadvantage with our Community competitors in the international tourism market.  Therefore, we have argued that funds should be made available for the specific purpose of attracting such large scale projects here over the next four years.  We will keep the House informed of progress in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to pay tribute to all who have contributed to regenerating the Irish tourism industry over the past two years.  I do not have the arrogance to pretend that we in Government did it on our own.  We provided the leadership, resources and the framework but, without the co-operation of the industry, these would not have yielded the excellent results we have achieved. We were also fortunate in receiving some excellent advice from a range of sources, including I readily acknowledge, Members from all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>The theme of a Bord Fáilte promotional campaign this year was &ldquo;together we can do it&rdquo;.  I would prefer to change the word &ldquo;can&rdquo; to &ldquo;should&rdquo; because, mar a deirimíd inar dteanga dúchais, &ldquo;Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister's gracious remark at the end of his introduction was preceded by some rather ungracious ones earlier.  I am afraid I would have to make some comments on some of those less gracious <Col N="1065" /> remarks.  For example, I could not possibly let pass the following statement from the Minister:</P>
      <P>A major handicap for Irish tourism before we took office was the level of price inflation here and the impact which it had on our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>I might point out to the Minister that Fianna Fáil left this country with an inflation rate of 21 per cent which was reduced by the Coalition Government, of which I had the honour to be a member, to 4 per cent.  It is important to remember that inflation was galloping out of control under Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned also the crash programme they initiated in May 1987. Those were an unfortunate choice of words because the greatest crash in Irish tourism was occasioned by the utter bungling of the rod licence issue, leading to so many losses for people all along the west coast and which is on course for even more losses next summer.  The results of that crash programme are unknown as yet because of the late production of statistics.</P>
      <P>I welcomed, as did many other people, the establishment of the Tourism Task Force.  We have yet to ascertain the results of their efforts.  I note that everybody leaving the country, including emigrants being forced to do so by Fianna Fáil, is being asked to sell Ireland abroad. However, I wish we had some earlier indication as to whether such endeavours have any real effect on the tourism market abroad.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Supplementary Estimate. Even if it came rather too late we are glad that Bord Fáilte's marketing efforts have been allocated some extra money.  Of course they are experiencing some difficulty because many of the private sector who are required to match that input have already spent their allocations to tourism for 1988 and are now having to borrow.  Bord Fáilte, in turn, are having to accept promises because people just have not got the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since every time the Minister for Tourism and Transport speaks he implies that everything is wonderful, that we have the <Col N="1066" /> best of all possible worlds, I regard it as my job to talk about reality.  The reality is that Irish tourism is beset with difficulties. I readily acknowledge that some of these are outside our control.  Of course the biggest problem is caused by the wrecking of our image abroad by the violent men here, in particular the IRA, who destroy the work of so many good people in the tourism industry and that of so many well-intentioned Ministers for Tourism.  That is a sad feature of our overall tourism.</P>
    <P>There are other factors outside our control also &mdash; such as shifts in exchange rates &mdash; but others that are within our control.  For example, we are becoming a smoggy, dirty place in a Europe increasingly in search of pure air.  It is disgraceful that our capital city should be so far behind environmentally that we allow such impure and dirty air to not alone clog the throats and chests of our unfortunate people but give us a very bad name abroad.</P>
    <P>We charge outrageous prices for car hire here.  We appear to be unable to improve that position or tackle its root causes.  This problem could be tackled by deferring the payment of excise duty on cars until they have been sold on after use by the hiring public.  We seem to adopt short panic-stricken, Mickey Mouse measures in an endeavour to tackle some of these problems, such as the once-off cheap car hire arrangement which was too little and too late.  Again it is too little, too late.  There is a fundamental problem here and every tourist interest identifies this as a major one.</P>
    <P>I would have appreciated if the Minister in his speech when talking about what had been done by the previous Government had been gracious enough to mention the sterling work done by Deputy John Bruton, when he was in charge of that area.  We reduced VAT rates on meals and hotels and reduced air fares by introducing competition.  The tourism industry is ready to recognise that the beginning of the reduction in Irish costs and considerable steps on the <Col N="1067" /> road were taken by the former Government and that this Government are continuing some of them.</P>
    <P>We are forcing more and more people off the beautiful countryside because we refuse to exempt landowners, including the State, from totally unjustified public liability claims.  By doing that, we are storing up trouble for ourselves.  The countryside has great tourism potential. In Great Britain, 10 million people are involved in outdoor walking activities. Here, this week, we had an announcement from the Department of Energy refusing to open two new walking routes, one on the border of Dublin and Wicklow and one in Galway-Mayo, on both of which a considerable amount of public money was spent.  The Department of Energy will not now open them because of the public liability claims they have had to deal with.  I raised this issue with a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who may not have noticed himself signing a letter about it to me, as it was only a letter passing it on to someone else.</P>
    <P>Finally, I decided I would go to the oracle of all wisdom, the Taoiseach, who passed me on to Deputy Séamus Brennan, who is supposed to look after insurance.  Last week, I got a letter from him saying it was a matter for the Minister for Justice.  About six Ministers, including the Taoiseach, have passed this on to somebody else.  This is a problem that must be dealt with.  The countryside offers a potential golden egg because of the growing interest in health and activity holidays.  In Britain they have a countryside Act which enables people to open their land for recreation purposes and which exempts them from public liability insurance.  I cannot get any Minister in the Government to even listen to this idea, but I will keep pressing it until I do.</P>
    <P>We appear to be passively accepting one of the greatest threats to tourism which is on the horizon, the imposition of high VAT rates on European sea and air fares in 1992.  I have made the point time and again about the dire implications for what will be, in 1992, the only <Col N="1068" /> island nation in Europe.  This could easily set back efforts that have been made to reduce our costs.  I am very unhappy with the laid back attitude of this Government to that enormous threat to our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I brought up the question of the refusal to issue any plan for tourism.  We have money dished out in fits and starts and today we are passing some of the latest money which should have been available to the industry last January.  One of the greatest unsolved mysteries in tourism under this Minister is a speech made by the Taoiseach in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, in November 1987 to the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation when he talked about the ambitious targets that had been set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and said that the means by which they will be achieved would be set out in a medium five year programme for the development of the tourist industry to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that an action plan for the tourist industry would be produced by the end of the year and that it would concentrate on improving competitiveness, reducing access costs, internal costs, effective development, and marketing of special interest holidays and that it would involve a new mechanism for ongoing close co-operation and so on.  The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation who had been calling for a plan of the tourist industry were delighted with that speech.  However, no plan appeared and again the industry has been left dumbfounded as to how they can be presented with targets and no plan as to how they can be reached, except task forces, late money, rod licence debacles and no co-ordinated transport policy. Neither have the Government faced up to the European challenge in relation to tourism for 1992.  Tourism is beset by problems, a great many of them of our own making.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the extremely late appearance of all the relevant statistics on tourism, statistics such as hotel bed occupancy which is a real measure of how we are doing in tourism.  We should have <Col N="1069" /> statistics on how the new specialist holidays are doing.  If we had those figures in the autumn, we would be able to plan properly for the following tourist season. The statistics should be broken down as between what we are called real tourists and emigrants visiting friends and relatives. The Minister mentioned a 13 per cent growth this year.  It should be noted that that has gone down from the 15 per cent which the Taoiseach repeated again and again.  I do not understand what the Minister is basing his figure on because he has not got the statistics.  We do not know how many of that 13 per cent are returning emigrants visiting friends and relations.  This is far too late in December for us not to have the full figures available.</P>
    <P>Since planning of the following year should be in full operation by early November, I wonder has the Minister ever heard of computerisation, of setting up a system in conjunction with the Tourist Industry Confederation, the hotel federation and Aer Lingus to get all the statistics as they come in so as to have a really good information bank available before Bord Fáilte try to sell this country abroad.  We do them damage enough with debacles like the rod licence one, where Bord Fáilte had to put stickers on brochures saying that they were not sure if there will be any fishing in that area and advising people to check before they come.</P>

      <P>It is up to the Minister to get all these figures together.  The EC transport infrastructural fund which we are most anxious to see up and running should have £485 million available over a five year period.  I will question the Minister next week on how much he has achieved this week in Brussels on that point.  We must reduce transport costs which amounted to 9 per cent of total export values, compared to a 6 per cent average for our competitors.  The CII have identified £480 million savings which are possible and necessary.  Airport costs <Col N="1070" /> are very high in Ireland.  Why?  Aer Rianta charges are way out of line.  Why should that be at a time of huge increased traffic, when we should be lowering Aer Rianta's costs.  What about the unfair competition which the road hauliers face from Northern Ireland and so on?</P>
      <P>When we get euphoric statements about wonderful progress, with every thing being great in the tourist and transport industry, it is time for realism to be brought to bear and for somebody like ourselves in the Opposition to point out some of the realities and make sure that we get answers and actions on our points. If we do not have a unified, realistic, energetic policy coming from this Government in the transport area, we will fail in 1992.  We will also miss, and miss grievously, the targets so grandiosely produced on tourism in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the Supplementary Estimate introduced by the Minister really relates to additional promotional expenditure which is being made available to Bord Fáilte.  As the Minister has said, it is being matched by the industry.  I welcome this, because promotional expenditure is obviously very much needed if we are to improve on the number of visitors coming to the country.  It is a good example of a State agency combining with the private sector to achieve a common objective.  That objective is very much in the national interest.  The more visitors we attract to the country, the greater the benefit to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism, as we in this House all know, is the fastest growing industry in the world.  Promotional spending is necessary if we are to be effective in our efforts to get a greater share of that expanding market.  Having got it &mdash; and that is another area that needs to be looked at &mdash; we must be able to hold on to it.  The tourism industry is vitally important to us.  It is a major foreign currency earner and if the industry is properly developed it can lead to major job creation opportunities, particularly in remote parts of <Col N="1071" /> the country where the likelihood of getting other industries located is not very good.  Tourism has that great capacity to generate jobs in remote areas.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, a more sophisticated marketing strategy is needed, particularly targeting in on niche markets.  If this is done sucessfully, the promotional investment made both by the State and the industry will pay dividends quickly. Research has shown that every £1 spent on promoting tourism generates about another £2 in tourism revenue and out of that revenue about 49p in every £1 goes back to the Exchequer through direct or indirect taxation.  When we are allocating funds for promotional expenditure, we must realise that Ireland will never be a major holiday destination since it does not meet the international tourism market's main demand, which is for the sun. By its very nature, size and geographical position, Ireland will always be a marginal market in that sense.  That does not mean that it cannot be a successful market.  If we are to succeed, we must compensate for the drawbacks and cultivate those areas where the country enjoys significant natural advantages.</P>
    <P>What we need is to have a sharply focused strategic plan.  Deputy Hussey spoke about plans and I agree entirely with her.  There is a dearth of them as far as the tourist industry is concerned.  We need a strategic plan and it must be based on individually small but overlapping niche markets.  We have identified those markets before in this House.  We are talking about the leisure areas and the specialty markets.  We can talk about sporting areas, cultural and historical tours, golfing, angling, equestrian sports and activities of that nature.  We have a lack of indoor leisure facilities.  They are very badly needed if we are to overcome the natural disadvantages, the main one being the undependable weather.  The ongoing development and selective marketing of this type of facility and pursuit would clearly attract new visitors to Ireland, as well as encouraging the domestic market to holiday at home.</P>
    <P>On that latter point, it is quite clear <Col N="1072" /> that the Irish tourism market has lost the support of its own domestic consumers. Irish holidaymakers have become disenchanted with holidaying in Ireland and spend more money on holidays abroad than they do in this country.  The primary reason for that is the climate but, equally important, domestic costs and lack of wet weather facilities are also major factors. The industry and the Government will have to make strenuous efforts to reverse this trend, as every £1 switched from a foreign holiday to a home holiday by a domestic consumer is every bit as valuable to the balance of payments as £1 spent in Ireland by a foreign tourist.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have correctly put great emphasis on the need for promotional funding, but it is only one factor in a whole range of actions that are required if the targets which the Government have set themselves in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are to be achieved. Market research is one of the areas that need to be tackled urgently.  We can no longer rely on the ethnic markets in the United Kingdom and the United States to sustain growth in this industry.  We must determine what will attract people to this country who have no connection with it.  There is a vast market, as we know, in the European Community.  Germany is the largest tourist market in the world, greater even that that of the United States.  We must tap into those markets, but first we must establish what will entice these new visitors to come here.</P>
    <P>I note that the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation have commissioned a major research project which is funded by its own members.  Aer Lingus have contributed £200,000 out of a total cost of £500,000 for this project.  This will undoubtedly be of great help to the industry in determining what market strategy should be pursued.  Having identified those new markets, we must also ensure that we make full use of modern technology, such as computerised information, reservation and selling systems that are plugged into the principal tourism markets and which foreign travel agents rely on to sell holidays to foreign <Col N="1073" /> destinations such as Ireland.  That is a very important development which needs to be addressed.  We have moved into the technological era and tourism cannot be excluded from that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey mentioned the high cost environment of Ireland.  Undoubtedly, that is one of the major handicaps to the growth of the industry.  This has been borne out by surveys carried out by Bord Fáilte last year.  Only a quarter of the visitors to this country confirmed that Ireland, in their opinion, was good value for money.  Two out of every five visitors thought that it was poor value.  That is very serious because we all know that a bad experience in relation to high costs is likely to be talked about much more frequently than any good experience a tourist may have while here.  It also has another adverse effect in that, apart from inhibiting new visitors from coming here, it certainly does not encourage or entice those who have already visited here to come back for a repeat visit.  Our high cost environment is undoubtedly a major problem for us.</P>
    <P>The factors contributing to the high cost environment were touched on by Deputy Hussey, among others.  They are mainly car hire rates and also high petrol costs and eating out in restaurants and so forth is particularly costly.  On the car hire aspect, I would agree with the Deputy.  I have suggested before to the Minister that we should defer payment of duties on new cars being used by car fleet hire companies until the cars are being sold. Duty should then be paid on the written down value of the car at that point.  This would help enormously the cash flow in a car fleet car company.  It would lead to a greater uptake of car hire facilities here, which would have very beneficial effects in that one would have visitors travelling to the more remote regions of the country and their stay would be likely to be longer if they obtained satisfaction in the level of car rentals.  In the context of 1992, if we are to harmonise duties and taxes generally, we should certainly start with car hire because it would have an enormously beneficial effect on the tourist industry.  It makes no sense that we <Col N="1074" /> should have such very high costs here in comparison with what is available in competitor countries.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the targets set out by the Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with regard to the tourism sector.  That programme states that, within a five year period, 25,000 jobs will be achieved and that there will be a doubling both of tourism revenue and tourism numbers in that time.  These targets are very ambitious, but I believe they can be achieved. However, they can be achieved only if we approach them in a planned way. There is an absence of a coherent strategic plan to ensure growth in the tourism industry to the extent that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> claims.</P>
    <P>If the targets set out in the programme are to be achieved, we need a 15 per cent growth rate per annum.  We are now two years into the programme and the Government claim that their efforts in this area have been successful.  The Minister said that the growth rate this year was 13 per cent and Deputy Hussey rightly pointed out that, up to recently, the Taoiseach was claiming it was 15 per cent. The growth rate last year was 12 per cent and the percentages are not meeting the 15 per cent required to ensure that the programme will be achieved within the five year period.  In any event, in relation to the claims the Minister made, where is the evidence?  The claim is not supported by the industry, hoteliers or restaurant owners and shopkeepers are not saying that things have improved to the extent that they would measure them in terms of 15 per cent, 13 per cent or even 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister claim a growth of 13 per cent this year when, on his own admission, they have not even quantified the statistics for this year?  Deputy Hussey also drew attention to this.  We do not have any details about the revenue losses arising from the rod licence dispute on the basis that the figures have not yet been compiled.  Similarly, the Central Statistics Office on the passenger inquiry figures for 1988 say that they will not be able to extract the information in that <Col N="1075" /> regard until early next year.  We are operating in a vacuum and it is very difficult to know on what the claims for growth in the tourist market are based.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, a body comprised of everybody in the tourist business and who are highly respected, wrote to me on 25 November in relation to the growth and achievement of targets.  He said that experience this year tends to confirm that, despite lower access fares and improved competitiveness of the product in Ireland, the significant growth rates required are not being achieved. That is the view of someone who has his finger on the pulse of the industry and knows what he is talking about.  He does not accept the Minister's claims.  We must listen to factual comments like that instead of the unsubstantiated points the Minister made in the House.</P>
    <P>Access air fares have, undoubtedly, made a great contribution to tourism but, in the context of a five year period, they cannot go on making that level of contribution each year.  Lower air access fares must be looked at on a once off basis, somewhat like the recent tax amnesty.  They can certainly make an initial, major contribution.  They have been reduced <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK to a level where they are unlikely to be reduced further.  There is plenty of scope for reducing them <i>vis-à-vis</i> continental Europe but, in any event, they can only make a sharp contribution at a particular point in time.  We must identify other areas for growth over the whole programme period of five years.  There is nothing in any Government programme to indicate where that will come from.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey also touched on the fact that 35 per cent of the visitors are Irish people returning home to visit their relatives.  They are very welcome and make a contribution to the economy but, in terms of sustained growth to the tourist industry, they are not particularly effective because they do not stay in hotels, eat out or spend in the areas on which we have to rely if the tourist industry is to develop and if encouragement is to be <Col N="1076" /> given to the private sector to expand and provide the facilities to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that we need a strategic plan.  The Government's claims have not been accurate.  I quoted the remarks of the chairman of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation who confirmed that the targets are not being achieved.  If we are to have any meaningful debate on this issue it would be far more appropriate if the Government produced factual evidence instead of us having to talk in a vacuum.  The people in the industry, who have their finger on the pulse, do not agree with the claims of the Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Estimate as it shows the Government's feelings about the potential in relation to toursim which is one of our greatest assets.  One of the best things at present is the control on inflation.  Irish people who spend holidays in Ireland are always saying how expensive things are and, naturally, inflation is one of the major causes.  The Government's actions over the last two years have helped greatly in that regard and they should be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things with which I have been associated for a long time is the car hire business.  Many times I approached various people as to what is the best course to follow regarding its high cost. This year, a grant was introduced &mdash; especially applying to American visitors &mdash; in relation to cars hired outside the country.  That was a move in the right direction.  It should also be noted that the Government have been in office for only two years and it takes quite a while for major changes to come into force.  When someone brings a car from England they can drive to Holyhead and travel to Dún Laoghaire at a very reasonable rate.  This service operates every day but I hope the ferry terminal in Dublin will be used more <Col N="1077" /> often and that any moneys available will go towards developing the port.</P>
    <P>We were looking at statistics in relation to the new channel tunnel between France and the United Kingdom.  They carried out a survey in one of the major airports near London which showed that 50 per cent of people who travelled by air would be prepared to use the channel tunnel if it was cheaper.  It is surprising that such a high percentage of people were willing to travel by the tunnel.  One of the things that should concern us is that we will be the last major land mass in the Community following the completion of the channel tunnel in 1993, that will have access only by air or sea to the rest of Europe.  We will be completely dependent on the car ferries and airports. Only a short few years ago many of the present Government were severely criticised about Knock Airport.  It is now a commercial success and there is a move to have more airports built throughout the country.  All these moves are good for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I spend most of my holidays in Ireland and have always got great value for money whether it be in the west, Cork or my favourite place, Wexford.  A family can have a very good holiday without spending an arm and a leg.  Many people have been complaining about the fishing licences, but the fee is very reasonable if you want to fish in the rivers.  I have always gone sea fishing and there is no licence fee involved.  There is a small charge to hire a boat and one can spend many wonderful hours sea fishing.  These are the advantages we should be selling &mdash; our beautiful seas, mountains and rivers.</P>

      <P>We must all pay for our sport, and the present Minister has done everything in his power to solve the rod licence problem.  He has worked very hard and I compliment him for all he has done.  He considered every suggestion put to him and he tried to sort out all the problems.  Many of the people who do not accept what he says are doing a great <Col N="1078" /> deal of damage.  In my opinion they are misguided.  However, I know this problem will be sorted out to everybody's satisfaction.</P>
      <P>We have some of the greatest sea fishing waters in the world and we should do more to promote this amenity.  A few years ago when in Fenit I caught a 148 lb. skate, one of the biggest caught in Irish waters.  People interested in this sport would say that was not possible, but it happened.  Sea fishing is one sport which is not promoted enough as a tourist attraction.  People do not realise the great potential that exists from hiring boats, renting equipment, selling bait and so on. All these activities can provide a very good living for many people for the best part of the year, because people can go sea fishing until the end of October.</P>
      <P>My colleague across the Floor mentioned smog in the city.  We had a bit of smog which was very dangerous admittedly for a short period, but this is the first time any Minister has attempted to sort out this problem.</P>

      <P>At this time of the year <Col N="1079" /> we have very few visitors and we should not get too involved in discussing smog in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  As I said, the Minister will be sorting out this problem very soon.  I met some of these Americans and had a chat with them.  They told me they had enjoyed Dublin.  Approximately 10,000 American visitors that weekend thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  Making these people feel welcome is as important as spending millions of pounds providing new buildings or something like that, important as they are.  The average Irish person can play their part in attracting tourists by looking after visitors, particularly those who have come to Ireland for the first time and do not have any family connections.  These people enjoy our atmosphere, pubs and so on.  The first thing they ask is to be brought to an ordinary pub and we usually bring them into some pubs in town.</P>
      <P>Promoting tourism is something like the &ldquo;Buy Irish Campaign&rdquo;.  People say if we spend money in Ireland or if we holiday in Ireland we are protecting our neighbours jobs.  These are areas we must promote and as politicians we must ensure that this is done.  I am a member of the Dublin Regional Tourism Organisation and consider that we should look at the larger hotels which provide more specialist type holidays.  I believe each area should have a specialised office, whether in the west, the south or in Dublin.  People only stay a few days in each place and these offices could help them plan their holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contributed to this debate to compliment the Government on their attempts to look at these areas.  So many <Col N="1080" /> people say we should do this or that, but in my view we have started off extremely well and I want to compliment the Minister on his hard work, which I hope will show great dividends next year.</P>

      <P>However, having said that, I want to take up a matter immediately with Deputy Stafford, that is, the question of smog.  I am also a Dublin City Councillor. We well know that the Minister for the Environment has gone against the considered view of the council and their officials by allowing two things: first, peat briquettes and, second, the full burning fire from CDL which will only help to engender the culture of burning smoke-emitting bituminous fuels in areas where these fuels should be banned entirely. That is a regrettable development and something the Minister will ultimately answer for.  The Minister is not dealing effectively with the smog problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal, in particular, with the points raised in the Minister's speech today.  The romantic view of Ireland with its mountains and clean air, beautiful fishing facilities and other natural amenities which Deputy Stafford spoke about is matched only by the very unrealistic overview in the Minister's statement on the present position of tourism.  Some of the major statements in the Minister's speech must be challenged.  With regard to the overall targets and trend developments, the Minister says the indications are that we are on target to meet what was <Col N="1081" /> set down in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves that the targets for the five year period 1987-91 were, it was hoped, to double the revenue from tourism, to double the number of visitors travelling to this country and to create 25,000 new jobs in this sector alone.  It has been admitted that to meet the targets of that type of programme requires a 15 per cent compound annual growth in tourism. At the moment the Minister says we are proceeding towards a 13 per cent increase but independent commentators and people who have studied the statistics in depth concede that, in fact, the real rate of growth in this current year will be closer to 10 per cent.  I believe that is something the Minister must deal with. How is it that independent commentators in the market-place do not agree with the Government estimates?  Even if we accept the figure of 13 per cent growth, it is still short of the Government's target for the current year.  In that context it must be said that the forum convened by Bord Fáilte in September was a salvage operation to try to put right the very worrying statistics developing from the summer trade in order to see what could be done in the final three months of the year to put things back on track.</P>
    <P>At that time it was established that the number of visitors from America was 6 per cent down on the figures for September 1987.  However, 10,000 Americans came over <i>en bloc</i> to the American football game, but where would we have been if we had not had the major event of the Dublin Millennium running throughout the year?  International conferences, competitions and events attracted an inordinate number of visitors and were an unexpected boost to the tourist industry.  I wonder what would have happened to the Government targets if we did not have that particular boost.  We do not have another millennium to celebrate in 1989, so I seriously question whether the Government can maintain the momentum to reach their targets in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have restated their commitment to the <Col N="1082" /> development of tourism as a major industry. This has to be looked at a little more closely.  The net contribution of tourism to the economy is negligible in the overall Irish economy and even in the overall figures of the industry itself.  The figure we have to look at much more critically is the figure of the net balance, that is, the difference between what we gain from tourism spending in Ireland as opposed to what Irish people spend on holidays abroad.  That figure vacillates almost uncontrollably from year to year.  I believe that the absence of a plan contributes primarily to this.  In 1981 there was a £10 million deficit.  In other words, we were spending more money on holidays abroad than we were gaining from tourism spending in Ireland.  In 1986, the deficit stood at £18 million but for the first time in 1987 it showed a surplus of £25 million &mdash; a modest figure when one considers the overall £1 billion tourism budget.</P>
    <P>From the figures available, I understand that over £1 billion was spent by Irish people on holidays generally, but only 13 per cent of that came to the Irish Exchequer, either from moneys earned by the carriers taking Irish people abroad or on holidays at home.  While Deputy Stafford enjoys holidays in my home county, the problem is that he is an exception. I, for one, rarely spend a holiday in Ireland because it is simply not a place where one can expect to get sun and a good deal.  Let us face up to that fact.  We do not facilitate Irish people who wish to spend their holidays at home.  The country is expensive, it is ill-equipped with facilities and that has to be challenged. When the Government say they are targeting tourism as a major industry and as a major input to our economy, we have to understand that they are a long way off in terms of correcting the balance between what we spend abroad and what we should, in fact, be spending at home.</P>

      <P>Our reliance on the American market exclusively is fraught with difficulties, particularly when one considers that country's economic problems and the great drive now afoot to keep Americans at home instead of going abroad which adds to their deficit problems.</P>
      <P>This exposes in part, if not entirely, the very highly vaunted words of the Minister in promoting what he believes is an entirely successful package for tourism in the current year.  It is anything but that.  What must be challenged in the Minister's statement, which I believe is entirely inaccurate and erroneous, is the suggestion that 12,000 new jobs have been created in tourism this year.  That is not so, and cannot be so if one begins to examine the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment has virtually remained at the same number, with 240,000 on the live register this year, which is much the same as it was last year and, indeed, the year before.  In the current year we know &mdash; and this has been admitted by the Government &mdash; that 30,000 people have emigrated.  The Government also maintain that they have created 20,000 new additional jobs in manufacturing.  If the foregoing figures are correct, there is no way you can maintain that 12,000 other jobs were created in tourism.  The figures simply do not add up.  We are maintaining the same number on the live register.  A huge number are emigrating.  The Government take credit for creating jobs in the manufacturing area, but the figures do not add up.  There is something wrong <Col N="1084" /> with the figures somewhere.  If we look more closely at what the Minister said in his statement, we might begin to understand that he has not said what he intended to say.  I quote from the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>However, for me the most gratifying indicator of our success is that an estimated 12,000 new jobs have been created both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>That expression &ldquo;directly and indirectly&rdquo; and estimated numbers and indicators add up to the Minister picking a figure and hoping it will be passed over uncritically and accepted as an achievement. To me it means the Government do not know how many new jobs were created in this sector, if any at all.  In any event, the overall figures available to us on unemployment, emigration and jobs in other sectors do not add up to a suggestion that 12,000 new jobs were created in the industry.  I do not believe anyone out there would support the Minister on that statement.</P>
    <P>I have said one important area we must try to develop in tourism is the adventure sport area which previous speakers have mentioned and I wish to add my voice to theirs.  The rod angling dispute must be resolved without delay.  Last year I had the benefit of visiting areas of Europe and in the course of that the opportunity of speaking with a Bord Fáilte representative in the north European area. The adverse impact that dispute was having on the tourist figures from Germany, Belgium and the north mid-European area was immense.  It must be put right.  We thought it might be put right even in time for last year's angling season but now it drags over into yet another year.  That is regrettable when one thinks of the figures involved and where the Government together with the industry are putting up a £10 million additional promotional package which obviously must centre on adventure sports which do not rely on the sun but on our clear air, outdoor sports such as golf, riding, swimming, sea angling and so on and angling on our inland waters.  It is a huge gap in the portfolio of promoting Ireland <Col N="1085" /> that we cannot assure travellers coming to this country that they will receive a welcome and unimpeded access to our inland waters to engage in what is clearly a very important aspect of tourism here. We are spending £10 million.  Are we going to raise even a fraction of that if the rod licence fee is imposed fully and comprehensively?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an increased allocation to Aer Rianta.  It would be wrong to pass from this debate without paying tribute to the pioneering work of that company in expanding markets for the Irish tourist transport industry and in particular the new pioneering work being done with Aeroflot in Moscow and the ongoing contracts and revenue that is offering.  Often it is not appreciated, both in the work done there and in the reciprocal revenues received from Aeroflot involvement at Shannon.  If I recall correctly, the figure is about £60 million over a five year period in revenues at Shannon. That is to be welcomed and we hope it will develop.  In particular, one would hope that soon the agreement with the Cubana airline will be completed between the Minister's Department and Cubana who are anxious to open up a traffic route for travellers through Shannon.</P>
    <P>Finally, while the Estimate deals primarily with the tourism aspect of the Minister's portfolio, he has another job, that of transport.  I have to make an urgent plea here today that on his return from business abroad the Minister for Agriculture and Food will impress on him the urgency of dealing with bus transport in Dublin city with is now chaotic and almost at a standstill.  It is a great pity to see the innovative &ldquo;nipper&rdquo; service which was introduced on the streets in the past few days being completely put at nought by snarled up traffic and buses practically at a standstill.  Dubliners badly need a good, effective, public transport system and the current state of affairs in Bus Atha Cliath is not satisfactory.  I hope the Minister will take that on as a major issue on his return so that in the new year we can get back to moving in Dublin again.</P>

      <P>First, I assure the Deputies who have spoken, and who obviously have a deep and in general positive interest in this area, that I will, of course, as a matter of priority relay all the points made today by them to the Minister.  I thank them for participating in the debate.  The Minister will want me to acknowledge that this has been a feature of the attitude in this House on this issue in relation to tourism, and that all the points that have been made will be taken on board in what is a crucial area for our economic development programme where we have a great potential.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan talked about a romantic view of mountains and clear air and seemed to convey, in response to what Deputy Stafford was promoting very effectively as being a special advantage, that this did not somehow match reality.  This is an area where the reality measures up to the romantic view, and it is very important that this unique advantage we have be promoted at every possible time in every possible way.  When we do an objective analysis and maybe make an appropriate criticism of our failure to exploit potential, we should be very careful not to denigrate in any way the most unique characteristics we have, namely, the mountains, the clean air and, let me say, the climate.  I know there is concern that we have adequate facilities for weather and I take Deputy O'Malley's point on that, but let it also be acknowledged that the international perception of Ireland is a very positive one towards our climate.  Just now we are facing the middle of winter.  Where anywhere in Europe will you get a climate such as we are enjoying?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time we used and promoted that.  Let me say as Minister for Agriculture and Food, because the matter here is interlinked with what I am responsible for, that the perception of Ireland abroad is very positive at this moment in terms of our climate and all <Col N="1087" /> the natural characteristics of Ireland including our quality products.  We need an integrated approach to all of this. People who come here from the FDR, the Netherlands and anywhere else come to appreciate especially what we alone have and that includes our wholesome food produced in a natural environment. It is very important that we continue to promote that.  Now donning my appropriate hat, let me say I have been in constant contact with my colleague on this area in promoting what is special, and equally it has to be said that we are seeing results.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to some of the points raised because there seems to be some degree of doubt about some of the statistics.  I had better take things <i>seriatum,</i> in the order in which they were taken.  I appeal to Deputies, in the manner in which they have approached this debate generally, to use every possible means to support the programme the Minister launched last Wednesday which is called the new ambassador programme for Ireland.  This scheme is designed to get every Irish person wherever and however occupied to involve himself or herself abroad as an ambassador for Ireland.  People will respond to that. There is a sense of pride and patriotism out there and it is time we acknowledged that, and instead of what has been a trend of promoting cynicism, which I am glad to say is dying every day, we now promote that positive element of patriotism, an old-fashioned virtue but one that can be applied even more effectively now. Members of the House particularly through their own friends and contacts can be assured they can get the available literature for this promotion.  I ask everyone to take as active a role as possible in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the rod licence the Minister for Tourism and Transport made a significant statement on 8 November.  In view of what I have heard I would assume that each Member of this House, particularly the spokespersons, associate themselves fully with that statement and I would have expected <Col N="1088" /> that they would actively and vocally support it.  I was in the House at that time and I recall that Deputy Hussey's party vigorously supported that issue when it was introduced.  I do not see where the change has arisen.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley stressed the economic importance of tourism, particularly its job creating potential.  I want to endorse his remarks on lease marketing which were apposite and he also mentioned sharper marketing focus.  Again we agree on this.  His approach to product development is something I share with him and I have no doubt my colleague does as well.  There must be more emphasis on wet weather facilities.  I know that Deputy O'Malley is also a Connemara man.  He was not going down there as early as I was but that is not a criticism of him&mdash; maybe the years gap accounts for that.  In any event I was going before it became a congested political district. Nevertheless we can enjoy the place. Let us acknowledge, however, that wet weather facilities need to be provided. On the other hand we should also promote the fact that our weather is one of the great attractions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> In relation to the high cost environment it is fair to say that we have reduced inflation dramatically but we do accept that some items are dear, for example, petrol, car hire and drink.  We must remember also that the high taxes derive almost directly from public expenditure but we are making effective and rapid progress in that direction.</P>

      <P>Some people said that we had special potted developments this year because of the Millenium.  There was also the special fact this year that American tourism notoriously drops in an American presidential year and has always done.  The fact is that one can reasonably expect that there will be a major increase in American tourism next <Col N="1092" /> year over this year.  This has always been the case.  Allowing for the drop our numbers here have been much better than elsewhere.  The 6 per cent drop in American tourism this year refers to Europe generally.  The drop in respect of American tourism to Ireland was only 1 per cent, showing that we have a very positive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> others and we will have a very big increase next year.

      <Col N="1094" /> Supplementary Estimates are required, however, as savings on one Vote may not be used to meet a shortfall on another Vote.  Since the overall education budget will not be exceeded these Supplementary Votes may be considered as technical adjustments within the Education group of Votes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the various ameliorative measures adopted by consent in the House have meant that we were able to contain our expenditure within the overall Education Vote.  It is a great credit to the officials of my Department that we were able to do that and return a correct Estimate at the end of the year. Three years ago a suggestion was made that the Education Votes should be combined under one Vote and an effort was made to do that but it appears that the idea did not find favour.  However, I think that such a move would be a proper one because it would mean more flexibility within the system.  That is for another day.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the resources which the Government allocated to the education sector in 1988 have been used in the most efficient and effective way possible. During the year, by careful planning and control, I have ensured that there has been no unnecessary duplication of resources and have fostered and encouraged various educational, business and community groups to pool their resources and skills for the benefit of young people. For allocation purposes the main criteria used by my Department were equity, efficiency and effectiveness and particular attention was given to encouraging greater participation by the disadvantaged in all levels of the education system.</P>
    <P>I am seeking the approval of the House for a Supplementary Estimate amounting to £2.6 million which is now required for the Vote for First-Level Education. When determining the provision for teachers' salaries in the 1988 Estimates, the implications of certain measures decided on by Government affecting the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools were taken into account.</P>
    <P>Following discussions under the aegis <Col N="1095" /> of the Central Review Committee set up under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> adjustments were made which reduced the number of teachers who were available for redeployment and who would be given an opportunity to retire early.  A total of 374 teachers availed of the early retirement scheme and 445 teachers were redeployed.  I gave that information to Deputy Quill yesterday. The amount already provided for the salaries of national school teachers is £324.9 million and an extra £5.6 million is required to meet the resulting additional pay costs.</P>
    <P>Additional funds were provided in the Estimates for superannuation of primary teachers in anticipation of the additional pensioners under the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme.  As a result of the adjustments made, savings of £2 million are now available to offset against the £5.6 million required for salaries. Receipts appropriated in aid of the Vote will exceed the estimates by £1 million. The bulk of these additional receipts are superannuation contributions payable from the gratuities of teachers retiring under the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Vote for Second Level and Further Education a Supplementary Estimate of £6.2 million is required.</P>
    <P>The effect of demographic changes on the overall number of teaching posts was less than expected.  An additional 25 posts were allocated for the disadvantaged as a result of discussions under the auspices of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Fewer teachers than originally anticipated were redeployed or offered early retirement as it was not always possible to match the subject requirements of vacant posts to the qualifications of teachers available for redeployment and as the Department gave an understanding and sympathetic response to the many appeals made by school authorities about the particular difficulties they faced.  A <Col N="1096" /> total of 74 teachers were redeployed and 179 accepted early retirement.</P>
    <P>The provision for salaries and allowances of secondary teachers in the 1988 Estimates is £204.82 million.  An additional £5.8 million is now required. An additional £1.7 million is being sought for the running costs of comprehensive and community schools.  Savings were not as high as anticipated from the introduction of a common second-level pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1, from redeployment and from early retirement-voluntary redundancy.  An additional 16 posts were allocated to meet the special needs of the disadvantaged and 21 posts for vocational preparation and training programme courses.</P>
    <P>The provision for grants to vocational education committees is £119.926 million. An additional £2.6 million is now required.  The main reason for this is that savings expected from the amalgamation of VECs will not be achieved until legislation is introduced later.  In addition, following discussions between the various parties a significant number of additional teaching posts were allocated in this sector in order to ameliorate the effects of the change in the basic pupil-teacher ratio in vocational preparation and training programme courses in line with arrangements in secondary schools.  A further 134 posts were allocated as concessionary posts for disadvantaged areas and some 30 posts to meet the special needs of smaller vocational schools which are the only post-primary schools in their catchment areas.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5.02 million has already been provided for payments to local authorities in respect of the superannuation of VEC staff and an additional £300,000 is sought to meet the total amount of claims which are now expected to be received during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>A number of savings are available to offset against these overruns.  As fewer teachers were offered early retirement, the number of pensioners will be less than provided for and there will be a consequent saving of £1 million of the <Col N="1097" /> provision for the superannuation of secondary, community and comprehensive school teachers.</P>
    <P>An estimated £1.3 million will be saved on the provision for examinations due to some overestimation of candidate numbers and to efficiencies in the administration of the examinations in my town of Athlone.</P>
    <P>Receipts appropriated in aid of the Vote will exceed the estimate by £1.9 million.  The bulk of this represents additional receipts from the European Social Fund.  Some represents additional superannuation contributions payable from the gratuities of teachers retiring under the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education, I have already mentioned that there are compensatory savings.  Savings of about £1.3 million will be made on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education. These savings are due mainly to unfilled vacancies on the staff of my Department and to economies achieved in the operation of the school transport service without any increase in the school transport charges in 1988 to the parents who are already paying them or, indeed, any cutback on eligibility.</P>
    <P>Savings of £7.5 million approximately are anticipated on the Vote for third level and further education.  It is expected that additional receipts from the European Social Fund will amount to £3 million approximately.  When the 1988 Estimates were in the course of compilation precise information on the level of the 1987 final claims was not available and it was not possible to determine exactly the level of ESF approvals for 1988 programmes. That has been a continuing feature of the ESF-funded educational programmes since they started back in 1983-84.  I remember when I was in Opposition this was constantly coming up.  It is difficult to be precise about an appropriation-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Savings of £5 million are now projected on the provision of £66.4 million for the running costs of VEC colleges.  These savings are due to a number of factors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> Payments are not now expected to be made in 1988 on foot of a Labour Court award to part-time teachers.  That will come later.  Fee income in the colleges will be greater than expected.  In addition, credit balances were carried over from 1987 and there was a measure of over-estimation in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>In 1988 within the overall education budget it has been possible through careful planing and with the full co-operation and support of the many committed teachers, school managers, educational administrators and parents, to maintain and indeed improve upon the quality of the education programmes in all our educational institutions.  I wish to assure the House that I intend to continue to carefully plan, monitor and control educational expenditure and to ensure that voted moneys will be used in the most efficient and cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>There was one point I made at the beginning which I want to go back on.  It is this.  I stated in my commitment to the House last March on the overall education budget that I would not be back looking for a supplementary budget in the fullest sense.  Since the overall education budget will not be exceeded, these Supplementary Votes, within the overall education budget, may be considered as technical adjustments within the education group of Votes.  I have to give the technical detail of moneys to the House and I know the House is interested in the running of the Department.  There will be many other issues which members of the various Opposition parties will wish to raise and on which I hope to have an opportunity to comment at the end.  Out of the moneys allocated to me &mdash; despite the strictures which lay upon every Government Department &mdash; there were some measures which I was enabled to carry out.  It gave me great satisfaction that I was able to undertake initiatives of that sort.  I will be leaving out some.  The first one I would like to refer to is a small one in money terms but it is important. We were able to continue the mature women's grant and will be doing so for this year.  Next week I will be meeting <Col N="1099" /> the recipients.  We will be able to have a modest increase next year.  It is a measure which we were able to keep even though we thought it would not be possible.</P>
    <P>There was also the fact that the NCCA &mdash; the National Council for Curriculum Assessment &mdash; came out with their new syllabi.  The introduction of the new junior certificate was greatly welcomed. I have just completed a programme for very intensive in-service courses involving the teachers' unions and the various course committees who will report to me by the end of January and we will then embark on that programme.  We cannot introduce a new exam next September without having proper in-service courses. I am glad we are on the path to that.</P>
    <P>Also in January I will be launching a special languages programme for second level schools to encourage a much greater take-up of European languages other than French.  A large number of our students take French and a very small number take German, Spanish and Italian.  I have had discussions over the months with the cultural institutes, with the professors of those languages, the subject associations, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the CII and I have been in Europe twice.  In conjunction with the Lingua report, about which I will be in Europe next week and in January, I will be launching our programme of diversification of European languages which is intensifying as we approach 1992.  These are just some of the measures.  There were many more. There was a modest increase in school books for necessitous pupils.  We have been enabled to keep school transport costs in 1988 at the same level as in 1987. They are all small matters and I am aware that Deputies will have their own particular interests on which they wish to dwell when they speak.</P>
    <P>I would like, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to put on the record my appreciation of the lively interest in education which is expressed in this House.  I am always conscious of it and I was conscious of it in Opposition.  It is enormously supportive. I wish people would view it as <Col N="1100" /> that.  To come in here for Question Time is one of the best one and a half hours one can spend because of the questions and the rapport which exists between people.  It is aggressive but that is part of the system.  It is enormously important that the views of all people be listened to.  I have set myself to do that and from morning to night I meet with people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak to this Supplementary Estimate with sorrow and foreboding.  Sorrow because, as a teacher myself, I have seen the education service of which we are all justifiably proud, being decimated by mindless cuts in education expenditure.  I speak with foreboding because I do not see the position improving in the immediate future.  In fact, I believe the position will become steadily worse unless decisive and imaginative action by this Government is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the expenditure cuts in the national schools, the vocational schools, the community and comprehensive schools led to staffing reductions.  The staffing reductions were to be achieved by voluntary redundancies.  Those schemes have now been implemented by the Department of Education.  The result has been unacceptably large classes, loss of subjects for students, shortening of the school week, lack of materials for essential subjects such as woodwork and metalwork, lack of remedial and guidance services because these staff are now being forced back into the classrooms and students have been denied their specialist expertise in those areas of remedial education and guidance counselling.  On the capital side there are massive cuts both in last year's and this year's Estimates. There was a 45 per cent reduction last year and a further 21 per cent or £5 million this year.  The outcome of this is that children will continue to have to <Col N="1101" /> go to school in inadequate dilapidated accommodation.</P>
    <P>In times of financial difficulty all reasonable people accept that measures must be taken to put the position right. My question and my concern, and the concern of my party, is that adjustments should not fall on the weak, the defenceless and the disadvantaged.  Who are more defenceless in this situation than our children?  Our children, the very lifeblood of our nation, are facing another year in which the quality of their education will be impaired.  They will be asked to pay more fees for school buses because of an 18 per cent reduction in the transport allocation.  They will be asked to pay more for school books&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I stated in my Estimate and at Question Time yesterday that there is no increase in school transport charges for the next academic year.  I want to be clear on that. It is a matter of record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be asked to pay more for school books because of the introduction of the new junior cycle curriculum.  The children who suffer disadvantage will not get the teachers allocated for the disadvantaged because of <Col N="1102" /> the scandalous decision of the Minister and her Department to allocate, or should I say, misallocate those posts to areas for which they were never intended.  I ask the Minister how it was that approximately 20 or 25 of the posts specifically allocated for disadvantaged students in vocational, community and comprehensive schools came to be allocated to secondary schools.  I ask the Minister how such a decision can be justified when the terms of reference of the motion passed in this House, proposed by the Labour Party and amended by Fine Gael, specifically confined the discussions, under which the proposals were formulated, to vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  I suggest that the Minister is acting outside of and in defiance of that motion.  I believe that she must now justify her actions in this regard to the House.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday night, in the context of a debate on Tallaght, the Minister gave a half hearted commitment to building the proposed new RTC in Tallaght.  The assurance was contingent on European financing and a multiplicity of other conditions. Nevertheless, the commitment is welcome.  Even if the Minister were to build a new RTC in Tallaght, in Castlebar and in Thurles &mdash; and they are all vitally necessary due to increasing demand for places&mdash; I wonder how the institutions could be run.  This year's Estimates saw a cut in the running costs of RTCs by 3 per cent in the moneys allocated for staffing and 5 per cent for non-staffing, for example, materials, equipment and maintenance.  How can these colleges function with less staff when there is a greater student enrolment?  How can these colleges function with less materials when there is an increasing number of students demanding materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, they cannot, particularly if the quality of service is to be maintained. During the week, we saw Professor Clancy, in his excellent report on participation rates in third level institutions, show that children of working class people were not getting their fair share of the places at third level.  I say, and I challenge the Minister to deny, that her <Col N="1103" /> estimates for the regional technical colleges will make that inequality worse. It is clear that fees will increase, thus ensuring that those who go to these colleges will be those who can afford to pay as opposed to those who have the ability to benefit.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the Department of Education and the manner in which they are conducting the business of education in this State.  This is a very important matter.  In County Kerry, the principalship of the vocational school in Killarney became vacant due to a voluntary redundancy.  I am aware of other similar vacancies throughout the country. The Department are now proposing to fill the job by confining the position to the teachers employed in County Kerry. Of course I would like to see a Kerry person get the job.  In fact, I believe that, given the ability of Kerry people, one of them will get the job but I want the job competed for openly by all eligible candidates as is required under an agreement drawn up between the Minister, the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the Irish Vocational Education Association.  I understand that the Minister has issued instructions to advertise the job only within County Kerry.  In the event of that happening, I further understand that the post will be blacked by the TUI.  The Minister is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>She is in breach of an existing agreement and, more important, she is not seeking the best person for the job but rather seeking to cut staff still further by appointing an existing member of the County Kerry VEC and, in the event of that appointment, not replacing the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adult education and second chance education, a relatively new and developing area of our education service, is suffering under the cuts.  There are at present, five adult education organiser positions vacant and, as I understand it, they are not to be filled.  Adult education is an area where people who did not get <Col N="1104" /> an opportunity to continue their education may now have a second chance. If there is one area in education which should not suffer under the financial cuts, it is adult education.  I ask the Minister to authorise the replacement of the adult education organisers as a matter of urgency and in accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which the Government entered into with the social partners.</P>
    <P>Because of the cuts in expenditure, I understand that three months into the academic year the Department of Education are insisting that teachers in VECs throughout the country must be transferred between schools.  I accept that teachers employed by vocational education committees may be transferred but I believe that it is wrong, unjust and inequitable that such transfers take place so late in the school year.  What are students to do after three months with one teacher when they suddenly find a change of teacher, or indeed, no teacher at all? This position has only arisen because of mismanagement on the part of the Department and shows a callous disregard for students and their teachers.</P>
    <P>Last August the Department caused chaos by not informing schools of their teacher allocations until approximately three weeks before reopening.  Schools were not able to plan timetables or allocate manpower to specific areas as a result.  Furthermore, many temporary wholetime teachers were left in a state of limbo as they had no idea if they would be reappointed in September.  This led to grave concern and anguish among this group.  I believe that this showed a scandalous disregard for people who have given Trojan service to education.  I urge that this unprofessional approach should not be repeated in 1989 and that all schools have their teacher allocations before Easter at the latest.</P>
    <P>As a former physical education teacher I have a particular interest in physical education and I believe that physical education should form an integral part of the curriculum of schools at both primary and secondary level.  Because of the education cuts I have noticed that physical <Col N="1105" /> education has been marginalised in many of our schools.  Despite the fact that in many of our schools there is no qualified physical education teacher, I understand that recruitment of physical education teachers is severely restricted.  Indeed, there has been a cut of 150 per cent in the intake of trainees in Limerick this year, from 50 to 20.  Surely this sounds ominous for the future of physical education in this country.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Saturday, 29 October &mdash; and I acknowledge the honesty of the Minister of State &mdash; in which it is reported that he accused his own Department of gross negligence in regard to the teaching of physical education in our schools.  He admitted that physical education was an also ran on the school curriculum and yesterday in reply to a question the Minister said that the Minister of State at her Department did not make the statements attributed to him by Deputies.  Either the reporter is misleading the public or, I hate to say, the Minister is misleading the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> this week in which a leading physical educationist pointed out that on average our students in second level schools receive 35 minutes per week of physical education whereas on the Continent this figure amounts to 150 minutes per week. Let me add that physical education is now almost non-existent at primary level despite the windfall from the national lottery.  We are not spending the money where it would have most effect.  Indeed, we are providing facilities which people will not be able to use as they have not been educated on how to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Physical education is almost non-existent at primary level through no fault of the teachers, as first, in most cases they are not qualified to teach it and, secondly, they are afraid of vast insurance claims being made against them.  Sixty per cent of our students in the senior cycle do not have any physical education classes and pupils at primary level receive only 35 minutes of physical education each week. This is a disgrace and no Minister of State or Minister can come into this House and say physical education needs are being catered for.  I appeal to the Minister and her Minister of State to ensure that physical education is put back on a proper plane.  I also suggest to the Minister that in drawing up the new junior curriculum, physical education should be given its rightful place.  We look mainly at the development of the three Rs but I believe that physical education should be added to them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have tried to indicate that all is not well with our education service by giving specific examples to highlight some of the areas in which the difficulties lie.  I accept that funds are short but I believe that those funds which are available could be used to better effect.  In times of financial difficulty a real effort should be made to assist the disadvantaged to break free from the vicious cycle of the poverty of deprivation. Education is the key to breaking free from that cycle and I ask the Minister to review her policies in the light of this. I look forward to the Minister's response to the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>The amount of money being sought by the Minister today in the Supplementary Estimate is so minimal as hardly to merit mention except, of course, to say that the Minister must be complimented on living within her means &mdash; and I suppose that is no mean virtue. The essential questions we ought to be asking in terms of the vast amount of money voted in the annual budget are: first, does the taxpayer, who is our paymaster, feel he or she gets good value for the money invested in education? <Col N="1107" /> Second, do the consumers &mdash; and the consumers in this case are the pupils or students and their parents &mdash; feel they get good value in all instances?  Third, and more fundamentally, have we in the Ireland of 1988 in place a system of education which gives every child a fair and equal start in life?  If we examine those three questions, I think the answer in each case has to be no.</P>
      <P>There is little time within the scope of this debate to argue all or any of these issues and that brings me to the point where I must say it is high time we had a comprehensive debate on education and the Minister ought to be the instigator of that debate.  The Minister said very graciously a moment ago that she felt the monthly Question Time constituted a very good debate on educational issues but I do not think that is entirely true. We have a one sided debate where a number of questions are asked but few questions are answered.  One way or the other that does not constitute the kind of comprehensive debate education merits at this time in the development of our country.  I appeal to the Minister to be the instigator of an overall comprehensive debate on education because it needs to be debated at this time above all times.</P>
      <P>I would argue here this afternoon that the whole system of education needs to be recast but, since it is not practical to re-invent the wheel, it is imperative to identify priorities.  If I could be so bold I should like to mention a few areas which I regard as being of urgent priority.  The most salient single feature of our system of education as it now stands is that while it works pre-eminently well for our top graduates, many of whom are now outshining their peers on the world stage, it works disastrously badly for others.  The gap between the two extremes is far too great and must be bridged.  A system which tolerates that gap can only be seen to breed injustice, to reinforce poverty and reinforce underprivilege in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect I would argue as my first priority that the problem of the chronic under-achiever must be tackled as a <Col N="1108" /> matter of urgency and at source, right down to primary school level, and in some cases even further back then primary school level to the level of the home.  I know that would be a matter perhaps for the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of Education and that it is not a problem specifically for the Department of Education. That is where the problem of the chronic under-achiever must be tackled. In terms of schooling this can only be done when more specialised resources are put into the primary school system &mdash; resources, for example, like the provision of a proper school psychological service to assist in the early identification of learning disability and also to provide adequate remedial teaching to remedy that disability.</P>
    <P>I read with great interest the most recent report by Dr. Patrick Clancy in which he points to the low level of participation at third level by children of the working classes.  From my experience I have to say there is equally a very low level of effective participation at second level by numbers of children, the kind of children who achieve very badly at primary school level, who do not get the kind of assistance they need at that stage in their lives, who come onto the second level system without adequate preparation for what that system has to offer, who in many cases never make a successful transition from first level to second level, who are side-lined and remain on the slow lane in the classes of second level schools awaiting the time when they are 15 years of age and can slip out of the system unnoticed and unmarked.  They are the children on whose behalf I would argue that resources will have to be put in place because the truth is that participation at third level is very often determined at primary level.  I appeal to the Minister to address herself, her energy and her resources to rooting out the sources of under-achievement and inequality which exist in primary schools as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>With regard to children who have <Col N="1109" /> learning disabilities, I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the Youthreach programme.  It is an initiative which was long overdue.  I believe some good will come from the introduction of this programme but I have to say that a programme such as this tacked on at the tail end of an unsatisfactory school experience is a poor substitute for a solid graded grounding in basic educational skills which should happen during the course of the seven years children spend in primary schools and which is every child's right. If that does not happen at the right time anything which is tacked on later on is merely a palliative and does not really solve the problem.  I say to the Minister that there have to be preventative measures as well as rehabilitative measures at the end of the time when the damage is done and these two measures will have to happen in parallel.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the Articles in the Constitution which deal with education, and specifically Article 42.3.  Article 42 acknowledges the place of parents in education and Article 42.3.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.</P>
    <P>  I have to say to the Minister that I am afraid we have reneged on our constitutional obligations.  The time has come when we must put that right, call a halt and identify what constitutes a certain minimum of education in terms of the actual conditions of the declining years of the 20th century and then we must make provision to enable every child in the country to attain that minimum. That must be a primary objective of any Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale to which I have referred already, a monstrous injustice is being visited upon students because of the gruelling demands of the points system as a mechanism for rationing out scarce third level places.  The pressure which is now being put on students, their teachers and parents as the <Col N="1110" /> race for points intensifies year after year has now reached the stage when all true educational objectives stand to be subverted. The growth of the £1 million grind industry is only one of the many visible manifestations of that phenomenon.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that this madness must be halted.  I know it is a subject which has plagued the minds of many people but it ought to become the subject of a wider educational debate.  We ought to put our heads together to see in what way we can play down and minimise this scourge on second level students.  This needs to be done as a matter of urgency and, when the debate is over and done with, the decision will then lie with the Minister.  I believe the decision to do this will have to be taken sooner rather than later before our whole system cracks with the pressure which is now being put upon it.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to place priority on the manner in which we deal with our teaching bodies, the greatest single resources we have.  The Minister referred to provision for in-service courses, but the amount will not be enough to provide adequately for the degree of in-service training needed.  If the legitimate demands of the times are to be met, a substantial investment will have to be made in the further provision of in-service training.  That would be money very well spent.  In relation to the introduction of new syllabi and additional languages, as well as the whole state of our schools, it is imperative that we have a teaching force which is not allowed to become stale or sour.</P>
    <P>We must admit that principals and teachers have been subject to intense pressure from all sources in recent years. Every social problem which arises in the community has a spokesperson who relates it back to the schools.  If the problem is AIDS, the schools should be providing more education to prevent the spread of AIDS; if it is teenage drinking, the responsibility is very often off-loaded on the teachers.  There has been a great growth in the number of social evils in society in the past few years, but no matter what it is the remedy seems to be <Col N="1111" /> located within the schools.  At a time when resources are being cut back at every level of education, our teachers are being asked to deliver more and more. That is not possible.  It has put inordinate pressure on teachers, numbers of whom are beginning to lose morale and to give up the ghost.  If that were allowed to happen it would be a singular disaster without parallel.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take that into account and make more provision for in-service training and create some kind of mechanism to enable numbers of unemployed young graduates to be brought into the teaching service.  I mentioned this point at Question Time yesterday. Staleness is inevitable unless new blood can be brought into the teaching profession. It is a great waste that our well-qualified young graduates with their expertise, idealism and energy are unemployed or using their talents to benefit other countries.  The Minister will have to think of ways and means of getting young graduates into the teaching force. I suggested yesterday that it might be done by the introduction of job sharing. I think it would work to the benefit of the teachers and to the benefit of the educational system as a whole.  It is not impossible to do it.  This is a time of tough challenges and we have to become tough.</P>
    <P>It is also important to create panels of teachers who would act as replacements for those out of school doing in-service training.  If we are serious about the introduction of new syllabi and modern languages we must release a certain number of teachers and make provision for them to be absent from the classroom. Replacements would have to be provided and it is important that the Minister should assemble a panel of teachers who would replace those doing this very necessary work.  That is one of many ways in which new blood, new ideas and new techniques could be brought into the teaching force.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to allow the teaching body, which is as good, as fine and as well motivated a teaching body as one would find anywhere in the <Col N="1112" /> world, to become disillusioned, soured or stale.  The Minister has it within her remit to take steps to ensure that it does not happen.  That is the single most important thing that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>My fourth priority would be the involvement of parents.  They are a powerful resource which has scarcely been tapped.  This is a great pity.  I appeal to the Minister to make provision to involve parents in a much more formal way at every level of education.  It is time to initiate a much broader and more comprehensive debate on education.</P>

      <P>I want to say how sad I am that we have only 15 minutes to discuss so many issues of interest in education. All I can do in such a brief period is sketch out some of the major issues that have been left with us at the end of this term.  It will appear inevitably more like a check list for action than an extended discussion.</P>
      <P>I will begin by addressing one human problem in education.  The Estimate for the Department of Defence contained an unfortunate line which referred to those who had left the Defence Forces as &ldquo;natural wastage&rdquo;, a terminology which does not recommend itself to me on humanitarian grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a credit to the Minister for Education that such language never appears in her speeches.  A great number of qualified primary teachers are unemployed.  I have discussed their situation with them.  A new syllabus is being introduced at primary level.  Will the unemployed teachers be entitled to attend courses which will enable them to function should they ever get a job?  As I understand it, the in-course training in the new syllabus is reserved for teachers in employment.  This is a very human problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time at primary level other issues arise.  There are schools where the numbers of pupils do not qualify them under the new criteria for additional posts.  When such posts are <Col N="1113" /> being examined by the Department I have detected a trend towards approving the appointments on a temporary rather than a permanent basis.  This seems to be a breach of the agreement entered into in goodwill between the teaching unions, the Department of Education and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want also to endorse a point which was made earlier.  I have become weary of making the case for the implementation of the Benson report in relation to the inclusion of the arts in education.  This is a matter about which the Taoiseach has expressed some sympathy.  Deputy Deenihan spoke about physical education. Visual and aural education, dance, theatre and movement are all being purchased as private commodities of child improvement from the increments which are left from a person's income rather than being part of the core curriculum.  Where is there any progress in this area?</P>
    <P>I turn to the unresolved question in relation to school transport.  In the Book of Estimates the provision for transport services for the year 1989 was reduced by £5.8 million or 18 per cent.  I raised in this House with an inevitable amount of discomfort for some people, the issue of school transport, the suggested privatisation and the pilot schemes.  The Minister reconsidered the position and CIE have been hired again as a principal contractor.  It is rather like the tendency not to do the hanging yourself but to get someone else to act as the hangman. Here are the questions that arise.  Have CIE been told that they are to run the transport scheme for 1989 for £5.8 million less than in 1988?  A very interesting point is that CIE have already been contributing to headings under which the Department of Education might have traditionally contributed.  They have, for example, been involved in a massive number of fleet replacements.  For example, they reduced the cost of the service they executed for the Department of Education in 1989 by almost £3 million. They set about replacing the buses from their own resources.  They replaced 130 of the older Bedford buses with 95 former <Col N="1114" /> service buses and 35 second-hand buses bought and adapted for school transport. By next year they will have provided 182 replacement bus services from their own resources.  The gratitude they are getting is that they are being told to provide the service for £5.89 million less.</P>
    <P>Questions arise in that regard.  Will it not be suggested that CIE will be asked to carry the can?  What is the basis for reducing the funding?  If CIE are to operate at a reduction of £5.89 million will there not be a reduction in the quality of service provided in relation to school transport?  Has there been any consultation with CIE in this regard?  Has there been consultation with that component of the school transport system that includes the private operators?  CIE provide an enormous number of services not only for themselves but also for private contractors.  In terms of the general administration of the scheme they have a very advanced computer system.  It appears that there was confirmation that the pilot projects were suspended and that the privatisation of school transport was not being proceeded with.  It is very clear that CIE are being killed by stealth. These are issues for which clear answers can be given.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to another aspect of primary education which goes beyond the reference in the Minister's speech to the Central Review Committee.  It is worth bearing in mind that in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there was reference specifically to making available additional resources for dealing with the disadvantaged.  It seems, from my computation of the figures, that what we have had is a relocation of what is left after the redundancy scheme has been provided for rather than the provision of net new additional resources.  I fail to see the spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> being implemented in this regard, particularly in relation to the question of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an issue which I have tried to raise in this House.  Tomorrow marks the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, a major document of this century.  My good <Col N="1115" /> friend, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, is attending celebrations in Paris in that connection.  The French hold great ceremonies in regard to human rights.  There is no celebration here of a public kind but that is a matter for another day.  In 1959 a document on the rights of the child was published and adopted by the United Nations, specifying in its objectives that every child has the right to a full education, to know what decisions are taken in his regard and to know and fully understand the world in which he lives.  I have raised again and again the question of when are we to have political and social studies included in the curriculum?  Why did a sub-committee of a curriculum committee work for two years to design a curriculum when two years later it has not been implemented?</P>
    <P>In the University of Ontario, for example, an entire department specialise in producing political education documents. The one I hold in my hand, <i>Politics and You</i> is the one suitable for 11 years olds.  It is published by the Canada Studies Foundation, Bloor Street West, Toronto.  This document deals with politics, taking decisions, working through consensus, how minorities should be treated by majorities and so on.  All that work could have been applied in Ireland. I suspect that the reason it was not done here might be because of some of the traditionalists' attitudes within sections of the Minister's Department in relation to the question of rights and duties.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency at this time &mdash; I am not including in this the Minister who replied to another matter I asked her about yesterday &mdash; in Irish education whereby new reactionary forces would like to see at primary level the child-centred curriculum damaged, would like to see at second and third level education a utilitarian ethos and would like to see us abandon a number of other principles. It is these bodies who have fed their influence into thinking, suggesting that duties are more important than rights. We are unique among the European signatories to the universal declaration on the rights of the child in allowing no <Col N="1116" /> space on our curriculum to discuss human rights at home or abroad.  This problem is not solved by saying that civics can accommodate it; it does not.  Any teacher who has ever examined the civics practice knows this is not the case.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, the Union of Students in Ireland, parents' associations, trade unionists and others have all asked for this subject.  It is time it was included to allow for effective citizen participation.</P>
    <P>I was pleased yesterday by the Minister's assurance to me that applications for future multi-denominational or nondenominational schools would not be sunk by the fact that there might be falling rates of attendance in nearby denominational schools.  There is another anomaly in relation to Irish education. There is no basic education Act that might express what our philosophy in education is.  This has been studied by Dr. Kathleen O'Higgins, among others, who points out that Irish educational philosophy has limped along from a kind of elitism to a meritocratic individualism.</P>
    <P>The one thing you can say about its administrative practice is that it has never been egalitarian.  There is no clear commitment to egalitarianism now.  If there was, would there be such a difference as was seen in the Clancy report from which everyone is quoting and which &mdash; in the first report &mdash; showed that the participation in third level education of the managerial and owning classes was 19.5 per cent whereas it was 1.2 per cent for the sons and daughters of the unskilled? Those people are abused in relation to tax and they have only one-twentieth of the chance of sending their children to third level education.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council document, No. 85, published in June 1988, states on page 100 that spending on primary education is the most progressive educational expenditure in terms of reducing inequality.  I have not the time to go into that now.  That document warns us that second and third level education is so inegalitarian in participation, with the demographic shift from primary to second and third level education, that <Col N="1117" /> all the progressive achievements at primary level will be wiped out by an inegalitarian second and third level.  On page 158 it points out that the proportion of State grants to third level education is declining by comparison with the rising fees.  It points out in three separate references that the support for second and third level education has not been such as to be able to retain any momentum of an increased participation.</P>
    <P>When the second Clancy report was published this week it showed that the only group who had increased their participation in third level education were larger farmers and people in the agricultural areas surrounding the universities. I showed that in the universities the gaps were all wider in 1986 than they were in 1980.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to the frequently expressed desire in this House that people would acquire a greater competence in relation to languages.  Languages should be learned as part of the curricula for their own benefit.  It is quite a scandal that the case for languages in education at first, second and third level is being made within a singularly limited utilitarian ethos.  One should learn a language to participate in the symbolic system of the world, not simply to be able to sell to Germany.  That is why there were not at second level last year, half a dozen people who took Spanish to final level, as if the whole Latin world, as if all the places where Spanish is spoken, did not exist.  I have listened to one speaker after another more or less saying that, as good hucksters, we should learn German. German is a fine language with a fine tradition but there are other languages. The learning and absorption of languages should be acquired for sound pedagogic and cultural reasons.</P>

They are in favour of pluralist education, in favour of access, control and a broader curriculum, an open, critical approach towards education. But I gurantee this House that if any Minister across there stands up and says it is his or her intention to introduce an education Act the reactionary forces will be out of the woodwork again, trying to say: our children and the children who come after them have no right to think in a freer way than we did.  That is why we are today again debating education, knowing that our education is denominationally controlled, that no Minister, since the foundation of this State, has justified on civic grounds such denominational control.</P>

      <P>In my 15 minutes I had hoped to make calm and reasoned comments on the education system. Having heard what the Minister had to say I have got into a state of confusion because there are so many things she said to which I want to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I lose my calm I must say I have a high regard for the Minister.  She is a person of great charm, having a pleasant manner in dealing with people whether they be parents, teachers or whoever. Like her brother, she is well liked. However, she is Minister for Education and, in that capacity, what she is doing is monstrous.  The Minister has been dismantling our system of education &mdash; particularly over the past year &mdash; when everybody has been talking about emigration, and praising our education system, contending how well our young people can look after themselves and so on.  These are people who have come <Col N="1119" /> through our education system in the past four to six years.  Yet, that is the education system which is systematically being dismantled and destroyed by the Minister at primary, secondary and third levels.  Of course she is subject to the Minister for Finance whose position she has defended.  She has operated within the confines of her budgetary allocation from Finance.  However, the fact is that that is what is happening, that the free education system is being eaten up and destroyed.</P>
    <P>A two-tier education system is devolving just as is a two-tier health system. Indeed, we are gradually reaching the stage enunciated by the head of the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick, Professor Walsh, who has appeared on television a lot recently.  He said in 1987 that education is a commodity which should be available to those wishing to purchase it.  Remember, that is the ethos of a public servant, paid by the taxpayer to run that college of education. Yet he makes that monstrous suggestion, that education is only for those who can afford it, a commodity available to those who can purchase it.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to have accepted that view because gradually that is the system of education that is developing.  It had been my intention to draw attention to the sentiments expressed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with regard to education but the Minister beat me to it when she said, in the course of her remarks:</P>
    <P>For allocation purposes the main criteria used by my Department were equity, efficiency and effectiveness and particular attention was given to encouraging greater participation by the disadvantaged in all levels of the education system.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a false and hypocritical statement.  Of course, it is an endeavour to say: we are implementing the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which document contained three of four short paragraphs on education, paragraph 15 of which had this to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> The Government recognise the importance of the educational system in the promotion of equity in society and will ensure, in implementing whatever adjustments are necessary in that sector because of financial considerations, that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 of the same document says:</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to encourage and foster the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education.  A particular area of focus will be to encourage more second-level pupils to complete the senior cycle.  It is considered that this will be a key factor in encouraging more working class children to advance to third-level education.</P>
    <P>Not one whit of that policy is being implemented; in fact, the very reverse has been the case, that the disadvantaged are becoming more disadvantaged in all levels of education beginning at primary level.  Let nobody tell me that the change from 40 pupils per teacher to 39 pupils per teacher will make a significant difference. That was a major victory on the part of the Minister in her battle with the INTO and parents on that famous circular when she finished up gaining acceptance for a pupil-teacher ratio of 39:1 as against 40:1. That has seriously affected all pupils in education but particularly those in disadvantaged areas where more teacher time and attention is required per pupil than is the case in the posh, well-off areas.  This means that the disadvantaged are more disadvantaged at primary level.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in explaining why a Supplementary Estimate was required, had this to say:</P>
    <P>Savings were not as high as anticipated from the introduction of a common second-level pupil/teacher ratio of 20:1, from redeployment and from early retirement/voluntary redundancy.</P>
    <P>That very reference to that second-level pupil/teacher ratio of 20:1 made my blood <Col N="1121" /> boil because, obviously, the Minister accepted the Department's policy in this respect which had the effect of smashing down the VEC schools, the public sector second level schools, giving advantage to the private secondary schools system. The Minister and anybody remotely connected with the VEC system &mdash; and here I speak as a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee &mdash; know that the VEC system is, first, nonselective, accepts all pupils no matter how good or bad, whether they be disabled, mildly mentally handicapped or whatever; they accept them all.  They see it as their job to give every child an education that every child is entitled to such. The other secondary schools are selective and decide whom they will or will not accept.  It will be readily appreciated that, from the outset, the VEC schools need many more remedial teachers than do their ordinary second level counterparts. In addition, 85 per cent of pupils attending VEC schools are given practical training which may amount to 25 per cent only in the other second level schools.  Again, everybody knows that in practical subjects, such as metalwork, woodwork and so on there must be a much lower pupil/teacher ratio than for other subjects; for safety reasons and others that are self-evident.</P>
    <P>The whole policy of increasing the pupil-teacher ratio in VEC schools has hit the disadvantaged again, the very people the Minister and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contend they are helping. They are the people who are supposed to be helped by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the people whom the Minister in her speech said they were carefully watching and helping.  They are not helping them.  The effects are so bad that the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In addition, following discussions between the various parties a significant number of additional teaching posts were allocated in this sector in order to ameliorate the effects of the change in the basic pupil-teacher ratio in vocational...schools.</P>
    <P>The outflow was so great that in certain <Col N="1122" /> places the Minister had to make further allocations.  It should never have happened in any school.  This was one of the causes of a further loss, leading to the Supplementary Estimate.  Because I know what is happening in the city of Dublin in the Vocational Education Committees I really got riled when the Minister also said in her speech:</P>
    <P>Savings of £5 million are now projected on the provision of £66.4 million for the running costs of VEC colleges.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £66 million had already been cut back and now the Minister has discovered that she can make savings of £5 million on that.  One of the reasons the Minister can make a further cut on the VEC colleges in that fee income in the colleges will be greater than expected.  Because of the cuts, fees were increased amid protests from Bolton Street, Kevin Street and many other colleges in the city of Dublin which are the third level colleges in which working class children have a hope of getting a third level education.  Now when there is to be a higher than expected income from fees in the colleges, the Minister claws it back as a saving, rather than reducing the fees and ensuring that more working class children can get third level education.</P>
    <P>Everybody is talking about the Patrick Clancy report &ldquo;Who Goes to College&rdquo;. In that report he makes it very clear that the universities are the worst when it comes to the attendance of children from working class backgrounds.  The best colleges for these children are the RTCs and the third level colleges in Dublin under the Institute of Technology.  These are the colleges in which the Minister is cutting back and increasing the fees.</P>
    <P>The report also makes the point that the presence of an RTC in an area increases the level of third level participation and it made a specific point about Carlow which is the only area of south Leinster which has an RTC and participation in third level education is at a much higher level than elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In cutting back the capital allocation by 29 per cent the Minister has said that RTCs are out.  RTCs were to be built in Dún Laoghaire, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Thurles and Castlebar.  They will not now be built.  I know that the Minister said last night that she would toss these projects into this big stew they are sending over to Europe. The stew will contain roads, schools and next we will throw in a hospital and we will ask Europe to pay for them.  As far as I am concerned that will not build an RTC.  The Minister has abandoned the programme.  Even the second level schools in Tallaght and in other areas are not being built because of this cutback in the capital allocation.  I would ask the Minister to go to the Minister for Finance and at least seek an increase in the capital allocation in this budget.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members of the House who contributed to the debate. Deputy Deenihan made a point about career guidance.  The Fine Gael Government on leaving office left a provision disbanding the career guidance scheme and I had to correct that provision.  The capital allocation at primary and post-primary level has been reduced but, as the Deputy knows, at primary level I have been engaged in a very cost effective building programme.  The Deputy has been on deputations with groups who have gladly accepted that we are building proper bricks and mortar structures.  If I get my next primary schools programme underway, in about two years the vast majority of prefabs will be gone from primary schools.  That is what I am aiming for.  The Deputy also referred to disadvantaged and remedial children. Under the programme, conditions have been maintained there.  I know there is a need for more remedial services.</P>

Whether the money comes from Europe in a stewpot or in a box is irrelevant.  With those funds I hope to be able to build a regional college in Tallaght.  In my knowledge as chairperson of the board of management of an RTC for years I know of the good they do in a region not just in terms of disseminating education but in terms of the active network they build up in a region.</P>

      <P>I have not addressed myself to those yet.  Deputy Deenihan talked about fees.  In Deputy Cooney's time as Minister the fees went up by 30 per cent.  I am rather modest in comparison with that.  I freely admit that where vacancies occurred in the adult <Col N="1125" /> education organisations they have not been filled.  There is a need to look at that.  The Deputy said that the allocations for the VECs were too late.  That was because we did not receive until nearly the end of October the final request for allocations from the VECs who had actively looked for their students for the VPT courses.  The Deputy says that at this point in the month of December teachers are being asked to move within the county committee system.  As the Deputy knows, the county committee system allows for teachers going in in September to be redeployed from one part of their county committee scheme to any other. That is the tenureship on which they take up these jobs.  I agree that it is not educationally sound that a teacher would be asked to move in the middle of the year. If the Deputy brings me any relevant cases, I shall look into them.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy's views on physical education and that they are held with sincerity.  I am arranging for a copy of the speech of the Minister of State to be sent to him.  It struck me that the Deputy had not seen it.  I have been asked why we do not correct misinterpretations in the press.  If I have learned anything in the last two years, it is that if one were to run to the newspapers every time there was a misinterpretation, one would not get much else done.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill talked about the introduction of a psychological system in the primary schools.  I am battling away at that.  The Deputy has a very honest and sincerely held regard for under-achievers. I have often heard her speak about them.  The Youthreach scheme, which the Deputy acknowledges to be a fair one, is only tacked on to what might then be the end of an inequitable system.</P>

      <P>The VECs have oversubscribed to the take-up of the system. The Deputy has often spoken about the points system.  We are looking into this at the moment with regard to easier access. Easier criteria of access could be looked at.  At the same time, the interviewing of such huge numbers of people would be an immense job.  The Deputy talks about the grind industry within education.  That has been put to me.  On the one hand, there is private enterprise which one would be loath to disturb.  On the other hand, students would get a good education under the structured system.  On teaching bodies and in-service courses I dwelt only briefly.  I am putting in place in January a programme which will be much more intensive.  There will be further announcements about that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about job sharing. I said yesterday that I took that point and also the matter of panels of replacement teachers.  The Deputy also spoke about parental involvement and this has become more structured and is very worth while.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, asked if qualified teachers who were not working would be regarded for entry into in-service courses both at primary and post-primary level.  Where a school required a teacher and it was decided that that primary school should get a teacher, the Deputy said that these teachers were being appointed in a temporary capacity. That is a difficulty we are endeavouring to resolve.  The difficulty was caused by the time lag in getting to the schools and checking every matter.  We are looking into that now.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy spoke strongly on the Education Bill.  He said that the Minister for Education would find that when he or she would decide on this, matters would be different. We shall see about that as it progresses. The Clancy report to which we have all referred today entitled <i>Who goes to College?</i> is mandatory reading.  It certainly coloured some of my thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Mac Giolla and all the other participants in the debate for their contributions which were without personal rancour.  Naturally, one must do one's job and that is the spirit in which the contributions were made in the House today.  Deputy Mac Giolla spoke of the education system being dismantled &mdash; the Deputy's words.  I do not accept that. With the moneys that are available the educational system is delivering a very <Col N="1129" /> good service.  The Deputy talked about a two-tiered system of education and I do not accept that.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> made a very distinct contribution, arising out of a consensus in this House, towards ensuring that the particular areas of vocational preparation and training, or remedial, or disadvantaged education would be attended to.  The RTCs and the VECs the Deputy spoke about from his own vast knowledge of that system, having served long years on the City of Dublin VEC.  The role the RTCs can play within the community, as I said earlier in answer to another question, is vast.  I hope that a response to what we have put forward to Europe will include reference to the RTCs.  I will be following that up.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of capital provision for the financial allocation for 1989 and mentioned specific schools.  That is a matter I hope to have examined and reviewed.  I shall be back to the House with further comments in that regard.</P>

      <P>Is é an cuspóir atá leis an Meastachán Forlíontach seo ná caipiteal vótáilte breise a chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá an £5.5 mhilliún atá i Leabhar na Meastachán don bhliain reatha tugtha don Údarás cheana féin.  Ach an £3 mhilliún breise atá i gceist a bheith údaraithe agus tugtha don Údarás, ciallóidh sé sin go mbeidh níos mó caipitil vótáilte faighte ag an eagraíocht i mbliana, i.e., £8.5 mhilliún, ná mar a fuair sé ná Gaeltarra Éireann riamh cheana in aon bhliain amháin, seachas anuraidh nuair a cuireadh £20,000 de bhreis ar £8.5 mhilliún ar fáil. Ba bhliain eisceachtúil í anuraidh, áfach, toisc gur bhain £2.118 mhilliún den soláthar iomlán le togra sonrach amháin.  Is le haghaidh deontas forbartha tionsclaíochta i gcoitinne a íoc (ar a n-áirítear cúnamh le haghaidh tionscal shaothrú na mara a chur chun cinn) atá an £8.5 mhilliún á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas i mbliana. Leis an £3 mhilliún breise, tuigtear ón Údarás nach mbeidh aon éilimh ar dheontais a bheidh tagtha chun aibíochta le haghaidh íocaíochta ar lámha gan a bheith íoctha ag an eagraíocht ag deireadh na bliana.</P>
      <P>Anuas ar an gcaipiteal vótáilte, tá soláthar £4.25 mhilliún údaraithe don Údarás mar chaipiteal neamhvótáilte, nó airleacan mar a ghlaotar air, sa bhliain reatha agus tá £3.75 mhilliún den tsuim sin íoctha leo go dtí seo.  Úsáidtear caipiteal neamhvótáilte chun foirgnimh a thógáil le ligean ar léas le tionsclóirí, chun scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí agus chun maoin a cheannach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag deireadh na bliana seo caite, bhí 4,946 duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás.  Is méadú de 251 dhuine é <Col N="1131" /> sin ar líon daoine a bhí fostaithe ag deireadh na bliana roimhe sin.  Is é 23 faoin gcéad an figiúr anois don ghlanmhéadú carnach i líon na bpost lánaimseartha a cruthaíodh i dtionscail faoi scáth an Údaráis ón mbliain 1982 i leith.  Tá dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh ag an Údarás arís i mbliana agus measann siad go gcruthófar 600 post nua le linn 1988.  Tréaslaím a saothar leo.  Tréaslaím freisin le hAire na Gaeltachta, an Taoiseach, Cathal Ó hEochaidh, agus leis an Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, mo chara dhílis ó Chontae Mhaigh Eo, an Teachta Denis Gallagher, ach ucht na sár-oibre atá á déanamh.</P>
    <P>Mar is léir ó ráiteas an Chathaoirligh i dTuarascáil na heagraíochta do 1987, tá an tÚdarás éirithe níos déine sa roghnú a dhéantar ar iarratais ar dheontais. Cinnte ní foláir deiseanna breise fostaíochta a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus bíonn gá le gríosuithe tionsclaíochta mar spreagadh do lucht tionscail chun poist a chruthú.  Is comhartha é go dtuigeann an Rialtas é sin go maith go bhfuil an £3 mhilliún breise seo á thabhairt don Údarás i mbliana.  Tá teorainn, áfach, leis an soláthar caipitil atá ar chumas an Stát-Chiste a chur ar fáil le haghaidh forbairt eacnamaíochta agus is gnó don Údarás féachaint chuige, trí chritéir roghnaithe a leagan síos agus lánfheidhm a thabhairt dóibh, gur ar na tograí is fearr a chaithfear airgead.  Is deimhin liom nach loicfidh an tÚdarás orainn maidir leis sin.</P>

      <P>Baineann an Meastachán seo go príomha le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, agus ar an ábhar sin tá sé ar intinn agam san méid atá le rá agam cloí le cúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta mar atá i láthair na huaire agus mar a bhí ó cuireadh ar bun an tÚdarás i 1979-80.  Bhí sé mar chúram orthu agus tá sé mar chúram orthu go fóill forbairt thionsclaíochta agus tionscail agus postanna a chur ar fáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fud na tíre, agus <Col N="1132" /> sílim go bhfuil aontú coitianta sa tír, agus go speisialta sna Gaeltachtaí, gur éirigh leis an Udarás an-obair a dhéanamh sna blianta ó shin.  Ó cuireadh ar bun an tÚdarás tá beagnach 5,000 duine fostaithe sna ceantair Ghaeltachta faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam go ndeachaigh an tÚdarás tríd am a raibh géarchéim eacnamaíochta agus airgeadais sa tír, ó 1983 go 1986, agus d'éirigh leo bliain i ndiaidh bliana tuilleadh agus breis agus dlús a chur ar fhostaíocht sna ceantair Ghaeltachta go léir ó Dhún na nGall go Corcaigh agus go Ciarraí, ag an am sin.  Bhí géarghá leis sin a dhéanamh.  Má tá sé ar intinn againn na ceantair Ghaeltachta a choinneáil beo agus an teanga Ghaeilge a choinneáil á labhairt ansin, caithfear fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do na daoine agus go speisialta na daoine óga, agus sílim gur éirigh leis an Údarás é sin a dhéanamh. Tá tionscail sna ceantair Ghaeltachta anois atá in ann iomaíocht agus atá inchurtha le tionscail in aon pháirt eile den tír.  Tá na hoibrithe sár-éifeachtach agus, mar a dúirt mé, tá an-bhuíochas ag dul don Údarás as an méid atá déanta acu.</P>
      <P>Mar sin féin, tá sé le tabhairt faoi deara i láthair na huaire, agus tá aitheanta go forleathan ar fud na tíre agus na nGaeltachtaí, nach bhfuil ag éirí leis an Údarás i láthair na huaire chomh maith agus a d'éirigh leis sna blianta seo a chuaigh thart.  Le bliain nó dhó anuas tá deacrachtaí móra ag an Údarás, agus go speisialta an bhliain seo 1988 sílim go bhfuil na deacrachtaí sin le feiceáil go soiléir. Mar cé go mbíonn cruinnithe rialta ag Bord na Údarás ó bhí an samhradh ann, is beag tionscnamh atá á cheadú i mbliana. Tá a fhios agam go raibh cruinniú ag an Údarás tá mí ó shin, agus bhí cruinniú eile acu inné i ndáilcheantar an Aire Stáit é féin, agus bhí roinnt tograí os a gcomhair.  Ach níl a fhios agam ar éirigh leo aon cheann acusan a cheadú nó nár éirigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá tograí roimh an Údarás i láthair na huaire, 30 nó 40 togra, a chuirfeas 300 nó <Col N="1133" /> 400 post ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht, agus tá deacracht ag an mbord aon chinneadh a dhéanamh nó aon cheann de na tograí seo a ligean ar aghaidh.  An £3 mhilliún a bhfuilimid ag caint inniu air, an £3 mhilliún atá á chur tríd sa Mheastachán seo, an chéad uair a fógraíodh é sin ná an 7ú lá de mhí Mheán Fómhair seo caite. Chualamar an £3 mhilliún sin luaite i ráiteas an Rialtais, go raibh siad chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil ar fud na tíre, agus dúradh go raibh £3 mhilliún ag dul do Údarás na Gaeltachta, ach ní shílim go ndéanann an tsuim sin aon rud faoi choinne an ghéarchéim agus an cruachás a bhfuil an tÚdarás ann faoi láthair a réiteach.  Is é an bharúil atá agam agus is é an t-eolas atá agam go bhfuil an £3 mhilliún seo curtha ar fáil don Údarás faoi choinne tograí a ceadaíodh i 1986 agus 1987 a ligean dul ár aghaidh.  Tá na tograí sin, nó an mhórchuid acu, tosaithe cheana féin.  Tá na daoine ag obair agus cé go bhfuil lúcháir orainn roimh an airgead agus go bhfáiltíonn muid roimh an airgead, ní shílim go bhfuil sé ag déanamh aon rud faoi choinne géarchéim an Údaráis, an ghéarchéim ina bhfuil siad i láthair na huaire, a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Má dhearcann muid siar ar stair an Údaráis, i 1986 cheadaigh siad 330 togra, agus chuirfeadh sé sin fostaíocht ar fáil do bhreis agus 1,500 duine.  Sin 1986.  Is mór an méid tograí í sin.  Is mór an méid fostaíochta a cuireadh ar bun an bhliain sin.  I 1987 cheadaigh an tÚdarás beagnach 250 togra, a chuirfeadh beagnach 550 go leith post ar bun; agus i 1988 tá an uimhir tograí atá á gceadú tite go tubaisteach, agus an méid postanna atá á gcruthú, tá titim thubaisteach ansin fosta. Is é an dearcadh atá forleitheadúil anois, san Údaras féin agus ar fud na Gaeltachta, don chéad uair ó bunaíodh an tÚdarás, go mbeidh titim ar an mhéid daoine atá ag obair sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, i 1988.  Ainneoin an mhéid oibre a rinne siad go dtí seo, go bhfuil an casadh ann agus go bhfuil siad ag dul an treo eile anois.  Sílim go dtaispeánann sé sin go cruinn agus go díreach cad é mar atá <Col N="1134" /> cúrsaí.  Tá a fhios agam agus tuigim, agus phléigh muid anseo sa Teach é ag Tráth na gCeisteanna, go bhfuil treoir tugtha don Údarás ó Aire na Gaeltachta, ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ón Roinn Airgeadais, go gcaithfidh siad a bheith níos cúramaí agus níos faichillí le haon togra a cheadaíonn siad ó seo amach, agus ba mhaith liom go díreach a fháil amach ón Aire Stáit, b'fhéidir, cad é go díreach an chiall atá leis an treoir sin, agus cad é mar a chuirfidh sé isteach ar obair an Údaráis i 1989 agus na blianta romhainn.</P>
    <P>Má dhearcann muid ar Mheastachán 1989, a foilsíodh cúpla seachtain ó shin, sílim go bhfuil sé soiléir.  Tá titim nó tá laghdú 13 faoin gcéad ar airgeadas, ar chaiteachas caipitil an Údaráis do 1989 thar mar a bhí i 1988.  Titim de 13 faoin gcéad, nó, in airgead, ó £5.5 mhilliún go dtí £4.8 milliún.  Anois, tá an titim sin ar an chaiteachas caipitil ag dul a dhéanamh obair an Údaráis níos deacra.  Is é sin an t-airgead a chuireann monarchana agus mar sin ar fáil le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Agus chuala mé an scéal ar Raidió na Gaeltachta inniu go bhfuil seirbhís curtha ar fáil acu do Oileán Thoraí i mbliana arís, gur shocraigh Bord an Údaráis sin inné.  Ach caithfidh mé a rá, ón eolas atá agam, go bhfuil laghdú ar chaighdeán na seirbhisí sin, agus nach bhfuil an oiread céanna turas go Toraí i mbliana agus a bhí anuraidh agus an bhliain roimhe sin.  Sílim gur sin léargas eile ar na deacrachtaí atá ag an Údarás i láthair na huaire.  Caithfimid cuimhneamh go bhfuil jab ar leith le déanamh ag an Údarás, fostaíocht agus mar sin a chur ar fáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus go bhfuil deacrachtaí ar leith acu, mar go bhfuil na ceantair Ghaeltachta imeallach, go bhfuil siad ar imeall na tíre, go bhfuil siad i bhfad ó Bhaile Átha Cliath agus na cathracha in oirthear na tíre, go bhfuil siad i bhfad ó na margaí.  Agus sílim gur chóir dúinn smaoineamh go speisialta ar na deacrachtaí sin.</P>
    <P>Cuir i gcás, i láthair na huaire tá an tÚdarás ag iomaíocht leis na Údarás Forbartha Tionscail.  Orthusan atá sé de <Col N="1135" /> dhualgas fostaíocht agus tionscail a chur ar fáil don chuid eile den tír, agus caithfidh Údarás na Gaeltachta iomaíocht leo sin.  De réir mar a thuigim, níl deacracht ar bith ag an IDA.  Tá airgead acu, tá siad ábalta cinneadh ar thograí lá i ndiaidh lae, agus ag an am céanna ní féidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta é sin a dhéanamh. Sílim i gcónaí, san am a chuaigh thart, bhí buntáiste ag Údaras na Gaeltachta, go raibh siad in ann céatadán de dheontais níos airde a thabhairt ná an IDA. Sílim go raibh an tÚdarás in ann ó 40 faoin gcéad go dtí 45 faoin gcéad a thabhairt, agus i láthair na huaire is beag difear idir é sin agus an IDA.  Nuair a chuimhníonn tú ar na deacrachtaí do na Gaeltachtaí, an áit a bhfuil siad suite, na deacrachtaí le hionfrastruchtúr agus mar sin de, is beag atá ag an Údarás anois chun tionscail a mhealladh go dtí an Ghaeltacht thar mar atá ag an Údarás Forbartha tionscail chun an jab céanna a dhéanamh i bpáirteanna eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Ón bhliain seo caite, nó an bhliain a bhfuilimid ag druidim lena deireadh anois tá beagnach 20 faoin gcéad de fhoireann an Údaráis imithe chun bealaigh.  Ghlac 20 faoin gcéad acu leis an tairiscint a tugadh dóibh agus tá an fhoireann lánaimseartha agus na feidhmeannaigh atá ag obair don Údarás, tá níos lú acu ann ná mar a bhí, agus mar sin déanann sé an obair níos crua agus cuireann sé brú níos mó ar na daoine atá fágtha ansin, agus déanann sé níos deacra dóibh an jab a tugadh dóibh a dhéanamh.  Mar sin de, sílim go bhfuil na deacrachtaí seo ag an Údarás, agus cé go ndearna siad obair mhór agus gur chruthaigh siad iad féin sna blianta a chuaigh thart, sílim go gcaithfimid aire níos mó a thabhairt dóibh san am atá romhainn agus ár n-aire a dhíriú ar an obair atá déanta acu, agus, go deimhin, ar an obair atá le déanamh acu.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na réimsí eile ar gnách leis an Údarás cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh sna blianta seo a chuaigh thart, ná na seirbhísí sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus sna <Col N="1136" /> blianta seo a chuaigh thart rinne an tÚdarás an-chuid oibre, agus chuidigh siad seirbhísí a chur ar fáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta nach raibh siad iontu, agus le trí bliana nó mar sin, níl sé de pholasaí ag an Údarás cuidiú ná deontas ná tacaíocht a thabhairt do sheirbhísí.  Tá seirbhísí áirithe ag teastáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta go fóill, agus ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire agus ar an Aire Stáit a n-aird a dhíriú air seo, agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh an Bord athmhachnamh a dhéanamh ar an pholasaí seo agus cuidiú a thabhairt do na seirbhísí atá in easnamh sna Gaeltachtaí go dtí seo.  Mar a dúirt mé, an £3 mhilliún seo atá á chur inár láthair inniu, tá sé caite, agus ní shílim go réitíonn sé na deacrachtaí atá ag an Údarás do 1989, ar an ábhar go bhfuil ísliú 13 faoin gcéad ar an chaiteachas caipitil a cuíreadh ar fáil dóibh.  Sílim anois, agus an Taoiseach ina Aire Gaeltachta é féin agus an tAire Stáit ó cheantar Gaeltachta, a bhfuil Gaeltacht ina dháilcheantar féin, tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann sé féin na deacrachtaí atá acu ó thionscail atá i dtrioblóid ina cheantar féin.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dúinn uilig anseo ár gcuid guaillí a chur le chéile agus an tacaíocht a thabhairt don Údarás a bhí acu sna blianta go dtí seo, agus é a chur ar a gcumas, leis an airgead a chur ar fáil dóibh, tionscail agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta san am atá romhainn.  Murar féidir linn é sin a dhéanamh tá ag teip orainn chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis an Údarás.  I láthair na huaire tá sruth mór imirce as na ceantair Ghaeltachta, mar atá as ceantair eile sa tír.  Ceann de na rudaí a thugaim féin faoi deara ó na ceantair Ghaeltachta, go bhfuil teaghlaigh iomlána ag fágáil na tíre agus ag dul go dtí an Bhreatain agus tíortha eile, agus is é sin an rud a chuirfidh deireadh leis an Ghaeilge níos mó ná aon pholasaí eile. Nuair a chuireann tú é sin san áireamh, sílim go bhfuil jab le déanamh ag an Údarás, go bhfuil an cumas iontu é a <Col N="1137" /> dhéanamh, agus go bhfuil sé ag brath orainne, san áit seo, an t-airgead agus na hacmhainní a chur ar fáil dóibh a chuirfidh ar a gcumas é sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Faoi mar atá ráite anois díreach, caithimid a admháil anseo go bhfuil géarchéim an-mhór ar an Ghaeltacht faoi láthair, géarchéim ach go háirithe toisc le blianta beaga anuas go bhfuil cuid de na ceantair Ghaeltachta beagnach bánaithe leis an imirce agus má leanann sé sin ar aghaidh, i gceann cúpla bliain eile ní bheidh fágtha sa Ghaeltacht feasta ach seandaoine uaigneacha caite amach ar imeall na tíre seo agus gan le fáil acu ach litreacha ó Mheiriceá, ó Shasana, ón a gclann a bheidh thall sna tíortha sin. Má tharlaíonn sé sin sa bhliain seo nó sna blianta beaga atá romhainn amach, is orainne anseo a bheidh an milleán, agus an t-aon slí amháin chun an cheist sin do leigheas ná breis fostaíochta a chur ar fáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Mura ndéanfar san ní bheidh i ndán do aos óg na Gaeltachta ach an imirce.</P>
      <P>Réitím in iomlán leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta McGinley sa mhéid gur ceart an deontas do Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil agus an 3 faoin gcéad a baineadh den deontas sin i mbliana a sholáthar.  Má táimid lán dáiríre faoi fhostaíocht a chothú sa Ghaeltacht agus daoine óga a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht, caithfear é sin a dhéanamh láithreach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh anois do bhóithre na Gaeltachta. Admhaím go bhfuil bóithre na tíre seo trí chéile imithe chun donais ar fad, ach tá bóithre na Gaeltachta níos measa fós. Aon duine a chaitheann saoire sa Ghaeltacht, an chéad rud a thugann siad faoi deara ná go bhfuil feabhas an-mhór ar thithe timpeall na háite agus ar an nGaeltacht le fiche bliain anuas, ach níl aon fheabhas ar bith taréis teacht ar na bóithre sa Ghaeltacht.  Is sa tslí eile atá siad ag dul agus sa bhliain seo tá siad níos measa ná nar a bhí siad riamh sá mhéid go measfá anois go mbeithfeá i gcontúirt <Col N="1138" /> do ghluaisteán a thabhairt leat don Ghaeltacht.  Má leanann sé mar sin, níl seans dá laghad againn deantús turasóireachta a chothú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Seárd atá á rá agam anois ná go gcaithfear iarracht a dhéanamh go luath feabhas agus deisiú a dhéanamh ar bhóithre na Gaeltachta.  Tá deis againn anois iarratas a chur isteach do Structural Funds ón Eoraip.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfar cás speisialta taobh istigh den chiste sin chun airgead breise a fháil chun bóithre na Gaeltachta a dheisiú.  Má chuirtear chuige sin d'fhéadfaí an-chuid postanna a chur ar fáil go díreach i ndeisiú na mbóithre.  Chomh maith leis sin, bheadh postanna ag teacht go hindíreach mar bheadh seans i bhfad níos fearr ag muintir na Gaeltachta chun cur faoi deantús na turasóireachta agus chun breis turasóirí a mhealladh go dtí na ceantair Ghealtachta. Iarraim go speisialta ar an Aire deimhin a dhéanamh de go ndéanfar é sin agus go ndéanfar é taobh istigh den iarratas a bheidh á dhéanamh sna seacht réigiún speisialta atá leagtha amach.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go bhfuil mé ag caint ar thurasóireacht agus an Ghaeltacht, molaim an tAire Spóirt toisc an t-airgead a chur sé ar fáil do chúrsa gailf Ceann Shibéil. Dúradh an-chuid rud sa Tí seo le déanaí faoi airgead a chur ar fáil do chúrsaí gailf trí chéile, agus réitím leis ar méid atá ráite san iomlán, ach i gcás Ceann Shibéil in iarthar Chiarraí measaim gur deineadh ar rud ceart an t-airgead sin a chur i láthair, mar sin infheistíocht an-mhór i gcúrsaí fostaíochta agus eacnamaíochta sa cheantar sin.  Sa mhéid gur deineadh aon mhaitheas faoin chrannchur náisiúntá &mdash; agus is dócha gur deineadh an-chuid maitheasa anseo is ansiúd &mdash; ba mhaith an rud an saghas sin airgid a sholáthar don áit sin ach go háirithe mar is mór ar fad an feachtas atá idir lámha ag muintir Chíarraí san áit sin agus tá siúl agam go mbeidh toradh fónta ar an obair sin amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Os ag caint ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta atáimid, bhí lucht Teilifís Gaeltachta ag caint linn le déanaí, ag <Col N="1139" /> caint linn atá mar bhaill ar an coiste sa tí seo chun an Ghaeilge a chothú agus do chur ar aghaidh.  Measaim go bhfuil cás an-fónta ar fad ag an dream seo agus ba mhaith liom dá bhféadfadh an tAire an cás sin a infhiúchadh, mar mura gcoimeádfar an Ghaeilge leo sa Ghaeltacht, ní bheidh aon Ghaeltacht ann &mdash; sin rud anbunúsach ar fad.  Tá géarghá chun an saghas sin seirbhís teilifíse don Ghaeltacht a chur ar fáil ag an am seo mar má theánn an Ghaeilge i laige, mar atá bliain i ndiaidh bliana, labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, is beag Gaeltacht a bheidh fágtha i gceann cúpla bliain.  Iarraim ar an Aire a aire a dhíriú ar an cheist sin chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Iarraim chomh maith ar an Aire nó ar an Taoiseach nó ar pé duine atá ina mbun, cathaoirleach a cheapadh do Bhord na Gaeilge.  Níl aon chathaoirleach anois ar an mbord agus ní féidir long do choimeád gan captaen.  Ní fheicim go bhfuil aon chás ar bith chun moill níos faide a chur ar an sceál sin.</P>
    <P>Arís, ó thaobh airgid agus deontas do Údarás na Gaeltachta, impím ar an Aire an t-airgead sin a sholáthar go luath, agus chomh maith leis sin, ó thaobh íocadh na ndeontas, a chinntiú nach mbeadh an mhoill fhada &mdash; nuair a bhímse ag caint le daoine ó Údarás an Gaeltachta, deireann siad liom go bhfuil moill an-fhada &mdash; ar íocadh na ndeontas.  Bheinn buíoch den Aire a chinntiú nach dtarlódh sé sin amach anseo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar dtús, cúpla focal a rá faoin Ghaeilge féin, mar cuireann sé beagáinín mearbhall intinne orm féin a mheas go díreach céard ar a bhfuil an fhreagairt, go háirithe ar usáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo.  Níl an fhianaise ann go bhfuil an Teach, seo ná na daoine atá i gceannas anseo níos baúla ná mar a bhí siad don Ghaeilge.  Tá mé féin mar bhall den Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge &mdash; an dara comhchoiste.  Tá cúig tuarascáil curtha i gcló acu, agus an chéad <Col N="1140" /> chomhchoiste, chuir siad trí thuarascáil amach.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don dara tuarascáil den chéad chomhchoiste. D'fhoilsigh an comhchoiste an tuarascáil sin i 1986.  Ar leathanach a 28 rinneadh a lán moltaí.  Dáiríre, séard a bhí ann ná rinne siad 25 mholtaí faoi úsáid ná Gaeilge sa Teach seo.  An chéad cheann, seomra agus téipthaifeadáin a chur ar fáil chun a chur ar chumas Comhaltaí a gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh le téipeanna teagaisc ón leabharlann, agus mar sin de; gach poiblíocht is féidir a thabhairt do imeachtaí Ghaeleagras na Seirbhísí Poiblí i measc na foirne feasta agus gach deis a thabhairt dóibh chun páirt a ghlacadh sna himeachtaí, agus leanann sé ar aghaidh.  An chéad thuarascáil den chéad chomhchoiste, bhain sí go ginearálta leis na fadhbanna seo.  An dara ceann den chéad chomhchoiste, go beacht, go mion: 28 moladh.  Arís, tá an dara comhchoiste agus tá tuarascáil eile curtha i gcló againne faoi úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach.  Cá bhfuil na háiseanna atá molta anseo?  Tá &ldquo;meditation room&rdquo; againn, ach níl aon seomra chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim is a úsáid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois, tá mé féin ag seasamh anseo gach seachtain agus tá gach cosúlacht ar an scéal go bhfuil a lán daoine iontach mífhoighdeach as an gcaoi ina labhraíonn muidne Gaeilge sa Teach seo.  Mar shampla, inné cuireadh dhá cheist déag le chéile, agus bhíomar ag iarraidh focheisteanna nó &ldquo;supplementaries&rdquo; faoi na ceisteanna sin.  Bhí daoine ag rá, ar an taobh seo den Teach: &ldquo;Cén fáth nach bhfuilimid ag imeacht ar aghaidh?&rdquo;, agus mar sin de.  Anois caithfidh tú a bheith ionraic. Cá bhfuil aon fhianaise, nó an bhfuil sí ann, gur cuireadh aon cheann de na moltaí seo faoi úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo i gcrích?  Cúrsaí iriseoireachta, cúrsaí aistriúcháin, áiseanna a chur ar fáil, agus mar sin de.  An bhfuilimid ag caint linn féin?  Ar ndóigh, táimid.  Agus níl mé ag caint faoi chúpla focal maslach, is é sin go mbeidh cúpla míle duine fágtha ar an oileán seo san aois atá le teacht agus <Col N="1141" /> beidh siad in ann cúpla focal den &ldquo;sean-language&rdquo; a labhairt.  Más rud maslach mar sin atá i gceist, ba mhaith an rud a bheith ionraic faoi.</P>
    <P>Anois tá ocht dtuarascáil ann, an ceann is deireanaí faoi chúrsaí ríomhaireachta. Céard atá chun tarlú?  Anois ba mhaith liom, agus tá mé &ldquo;frustrated&rdquo;, beagán, an pointe seo a dhéanamh go láidir.  Is é sin, tá an ceart againne, muidne a bhfuil a lán daoine ina gcónaí taobh istigh dár ndáilcheantar a labhraíonn Gaeilge: ní hamháin nach bhfuil siadsan ag fáil a gcearta faoi láthair &mdash; agus níl siad &mdash; ach níl siad, mar shampla, in ann a ngnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge leis na hinstitiúidí Stáit láir ná na hinstitiúidí Stáit áitiúla.  Sa chúigiú tuarascáil, a tháinig amach an choicís seo caite, rinne muidne tagairt do Chomhairle Chontae an Chláir, an t-aon Chomhairle Chontae sa tír seo in ar féidir le daoine foirmeacha a fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge.  I mo chontae féin, Contae na Gaillimhe, tá daoine i gConamara nach bhfuil sé ar a gcumas foirmeacha a fháil i nGaeilge.  I gCathair na Gaillimhe ní ligeann siad orthu, go minic, go bhfuil siad báúil don Ghaeilge. Tá daoine ag fáil páipéir fíneála trí leaganacha Béarla.  Níl le déanamh ag aon státseirbhíseach atá ionraic faoin nGaeilge, nó aon Aire nó Aire Stáit, ach deashampla Chontae an Chláir a leathnú go dtí na comhairlí contae eile.</P>
    <P>Ní aon mhaith a bheith ag caint faoi chomhchoistí oibre agus mar sin, ná bainisteoirí contae a thabhairt le chéile, scannáin a thaispeáint, agus mar sin de. Tá siad dáiríre nó níl siad dáiríre faoi. Mar shampla, ceapaim féin go bhfuil a lán daoine sa Teach seo, sula gcuirfidh mé deireadh leis an bpointe seo, drochbhéasach le daoine, fiú amháin, atá tofa ag na daoine sna Gaeltachtaí le teacht anseo agus arb é a gceart an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Níl mé féin sásta glacadh leis an mífhoighne sin.  Tá an ceart agamsa Gaeilge a labhairt anseo agus labhróidh mé í, agus cuirfidh mé an méid ceisteanna atá ag teastáil, focheisteanna, &ldquo;supplementaries&rdquo;, aon uair.  Is <Col N="1142" /> trua an rud é nach bhfuil aon iarracht á déanamh faoi láthair ag an Taoiseach chomh maith Gaeilge a úsáid sa Teach seo.  Agus tá an moladh sin sa dara tuarascáil den dara comhchoiste (Second Report from the Joint Committee: Recommendations regarding the position of the Irish Language in the Houses, of the Oireachtas and within the political parties.</P>
    <P>Aguisín A:</P>
    <P>The president of each party should use the Irish language as much as possible in his normal activities.</P>
    <P>Nach iontach an deashampla atá á thabhairt faoi láthair?  Agus tá mé ag labhairt faoi na cinnirí ar fad.  Cén mhaith a bheith ag cur tuarascáil mar sin i gcló mura bhfuil iarracht ar bith á déanamh?  Tá an dearcadh bunúsach léirithe.  An bhfuil aon suim ann?  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos fearr, mar a cheapann na &ldquo;utilitarians&rdquo; nua, Gearmáinis a fhoghlaim, chun nithe a cheannach ó mhuintir na Gearmáine &mdash; an &ldquo;huckster's theory of linguistics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom aistriú anois do chúpla pointí tábhachtacha eile, fad is tá seans ann.  Is é sin, faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta féin.  Ceapaim go bhfuil laige bhunúsach taobh istigh den Acht.  Mar shampla, tá baill den Údarás ag rá gach lá ar Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhfuil moltaí curtha acu go dtí an Roinn ag iarraidh athruithe san Acht bunúsach, 1979.  Chuala an Teachta McGinley sin go minic.  Chuala mé féin é.  Arís agus arís eile seasann an tAire Stáit suas agus deir sé &ldquo;Níl aon iarratais faighte ag mo oifig nó ag mo Roinn chun aon athrú a dhéanamh san Acht 1979.&rdquo; Cé aige a bhfuil an fhírinne?  Ceapaim féin go bhfuil an fhírinne, b'fhéidir, ag an Aire, nó ní labhródh sé de ghnáth. Tugann sé eolas dúinn anseo.  Mar sin, má tá seisean ceart, cén fáth go bhfuil muintir Údarás na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil tofa ach ag a bpáirtí féin ag rá go poiblí ar Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhfuil leasuithe san Acht iarrtha acu?  Anois, tháinig an ASTMS, ceann do na ceardchumainn atá <Col N="1143" /> taobh istigh den Údarás, na daoine atá ag obair san Údarás, os comhair an Choiste um Chomhlachtaí Stáit, cúpla bliain ó shin &mdash; ceapaim go raibh sé i 1982 &mdash; agus ba mhaith liom an sliocht seo a léamh amach, mar tá sé an-suimiúil ar fad:</P>
    <P>3.1  Difficulties are being created for the Údarás because of the lack of definition in the Act and its wording and the lack of logic in the way the subparagraphs were put together.</P>
    <P>3.2  There is no aim specified for the Údarás anywhere in the Act.  Why is the Údarás there?  What is its basic responsibility?</P>
    <P>3.3  One would expect that the Act would start with the basic aim e.g. &ldquo;The Údarás is being established to develop the Gaeltacht linguistically, economically...&rdquo; and after that the functions of the Údarás towards the achievement of that aim would then be specified e.g. to create new employment in the Gaeltacht, etc.</P>
    <P>3.4  Because of the lack of logical sequence:</P>
    <P>(a)  there are obligations on the Údarás (to preserve and promote Irish) without its having been given functions or powers to undertake the same and</P>
    <P>(b)  there are functions given to it e.g. &ldquo;The Údarás shall control industries&rdquo; without its being said why they are to be so controlled and similarily there are powers given to the Údarás e.g. &ldquo;The Údarás may expand &ldquo;industry&rdquo; ... without any previous aim being stated.</P>
    <P>Céard atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair faoin Acht bunúsach 1979?  Agus, ceist bheag faoi sin, an bhfuil leasú ar bith in aigne éinne faoi 1992 agus an Ghaeltacht?  An mbeidh aon leasú san Acht bunúsach chun a chur ar chumas oifigigh an Údaráis pleananna a chur le chéile agus a chur <Col N="1144" /> go dtí an Eoraip?  Mar shampla, faoin aighneacht atá á cur isteach, &ldquo;Within Europe&rdquo; faoi láthair, faoi chúrsaí réigiúnacha, ón Stát láir, tá sé ráite go mbeidh &ldquo;sub-national submissions&rdquo;.  Níl aon aitheantas dearfa do chuid de na Gaeltachtaí. Níl siadsan, mar shampla, ag cur moladh ar aghaidh a bhainfeadh go díreach le riachtanais na Gaeltachta.  I 1986, sa bhliain sin amháin, d'fhág trí chéad duine Leitir Mealláin, áit bheag.  Agus na himpleachtaí don sórt ráta imirce sin?</P>
    <P>Tá an ráta imirce sna Gaeltachtaí faoi láthair i bhfad níos déine ná mar atá sé sa chuid eile den tír.  Ní hé amháin go bhfuil daoine ag fágáil na háite.  Mar shampla, Magh Chuilinn, trí mhí ó shin d'fhág cúigear déag gasúr i ndeireadh seachtaine amháin.  Tá clanna ag fágáil na Gaeltachta arís, daoine a tháinig ar ais i 1971.  Tá an ráta dífhostaíochta i bhfad níos measa.  Tá an ráta bochtanais i bhfad níos measa.  Anois, aon uair fáiltím roimh airgead breise a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta, ach tá sé níos soiléire domsa nach bhfuil an tAcht bunúsach in oiriúint do na riachtanais atá ann faoi láthair. Tá sé soiléir domsa chomh maith, mar shampla, faoin rud a dúirt an Teachta Quill faoi chúrsaí teilifíse, gur chóir an t-airgead atá geallta don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht faoi chúrsaí cumarsáide a thabhairt do dhream ar nós an Údaráis, dream atá freagrach don Teach seo, do choiste an Tí seo, agus é a chaitheamh ar an scéim atá curtha os comhair na ndaoine tofa ag meitheal Gaeltachta atá ag iarraidh Teilifís Ghaeltachta a bhúnú, in áit teilifís Ghaeilge.  Agus ba chóir sin a dhéanamh, agus tá freagracht ag baint leis an gcaiteachas.  Ach i ngach gné den saol ceapaim féin nach bhfuil, ar lámh amháin, a dhóthain iúil ar chumhachtaí breise ag an Údarás, agus tá cumhachtaí breise ag teastáil ón Údarás.  Mar shampla, fad is atáimid ag caint anseo, tá muintir Árann gan aon chóras taistil don mhórthír.  Tá an <i>Naomh Éanna</i> imithe, agus deichniúr caite as obair.  Bhí mé ag cruinniú i gCill Rónáin cúpla seachtain ó <Col N="1145" /> shin, agus bhí fear ag rá liom go gcosnaíonn sé £80 chun cailín beag a thabhairt go dtí ortafhiaclóir i nGaillimh.  Deir an tAire, an Teachta Wilson, go bhfuil sé ag cur an cás ar aghaidh go dtí an Eoraip &mdash; an &ldquo;European bucket&rdquo;, mar a thug duine éigin air.  Gach moladh don Eoraip anois. Tá dualgaisí leagtha síos sna hAchtanna lompair go gcaithfidh go mbeidh córas taistil ag muintir na n-oileán go dtí an mórthír agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Anois déanfaidh mé tagairt do chúpla rud an-bheag, mar is beag am atá fagtha agam.  Mar shampla, na cumhachtaí breise atá i gceist agam faoi Acht 1979, mhol Risteard Ó Maolchatha agus an coiste rudaí áirithe i 1926 i dtuarascáil a chosain £622 agus a rinne cur síos iomlán ar an nGaeltacht.  Tháinig an t-uafás tuarascála eile amach ina dhiaidh sin.  Chosain siad i bhfad níos mó agus bhí siad i bhfad níos tanaí, ach tá na moltaí bunúsacha i dtuarascáil 1926 ann.  Ba chóir plean cuimsitheach a thabharfadh le chéile cúrsaí sóisialta, eacnamaíochta, sláinte, tithíochta agus leasa shóisialaigh agus sraith ama a leagan amach chun na moltaí a chur i gcrích.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an misneach ag Aire na Gaeltachta, má tá sin ann, cumhachtaí a bhaint fiú amháin, ó na comhairlí contae agus iad a thabhairt don Údarás.  Ach deirim arís é, an locht bunúsach ná an tAcht atá i bhfeidhm ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Ní chuireann sé ar a gcumas, agus níl a ndóthain airgid acu, freastal ar riachtanais mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar atá siad faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, go raibh maith agat as ucht an fhoighid a thaispeáin tú dom, ach ba mhaith liom críochnú ar an gcaoi inar thosaigh mé.  An cur i gcéill faoi úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo, caithfimid deireadh a chur leis, mar níl éinne dáiríre a sheasann suas agus a chaitheann cúpla focal do na &ldquo;sicíní&rdquo; ón nGaeltacht.  Ag an am céanna caithfidh muidne atá ag smaoineamh ar an rud le fada, leanúint ar aghaidh san áit bhréagach seo, i leith na Gaeilge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na daoine a tháinig anseo agus a labhair faoin Meastachán seo.  Táimid ag plé Meastachán Fhorlíontaigh do Roinn na Gaeltachta atá ag cur £3 mhilliún breise ar fáil do Udarás na Gaeltachta le leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair atá ar siúl acu le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.  Mar atá ráite sa ráiteas, seo an méid airgid is mó a fuair an tÚdarás riamh le postanna a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tá a fhios againn uilig go bhfuil géarchéim airgeadais ann agus go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann airgead a chur ar fáil ón Stát.  Ach san am céanna tá moladh mór ag dul don Údarás i ngeall ar an méid postanna atá curtha ar fáil acu ó bunaíodh iad.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta McGinley, agus mar atá sa ráiteas, tá beagnach 5,000 postanna breise curtha ar fáil acu ó bunaíodh iad.  Sin obair atá curtha ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí agus nach mbeadh ann ach ab é na hiarrachtaí a rinne an tÚdarás agus an t-airgead atá á chur ar fáil ag an Stát.</P>
      <P>Ó tharla gur ag caint faoi na Meastacháin anseo atáimid, tá srian, is dócha, ar an méid a thiocfadh le daoine a rá maidir leis an nGaeilge agus le ceist na Gaeltachta uilig go léir.  Ach d'aontóinn leis an chuid is mó a chuala mé anseo inniu. Tá gá le dearcadh níos géire ar chuid de na cúrsaí sin, agus tiocfaidh mé arís don méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Higgins. Maidir leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta McGinley faoi na deacrachtaí atá ag an Údarás, ní thiocfainn leis go bhfuil an scéal chomh dona agus atá á rá aige.  Tá a fhios ag gach uile dhuine, ón am a dtagann an togra os comhair an Údaráis go dtí go bhfeiceann muid é sin réitithe agus ceadaithe agus an obair curtha ar fáil, go dtógann sé tréimhse mhaith.  Tárlaíonn an méid céanna leis an IDA agus na heagrais eile atá ag plé leis na cúrsaí seo.  Dá bhrí sin ní bhíonn an íocaíocht ar an deontais ag teacht chomh luath agus ba mhaith le daoine, agus luaigh an Teachta Quill é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá daoine ann agus síleann siad go mba <Col N="1147" /> cheart dóibh, nuair atá togra acu, nuair atá sé curtha os comhair an Údaráis, go mba cheart dóibh cuid den airgead a fháil lom láithreach.  Ach ní sin an chaoi a dtarlaíonn sé.  I láthair na huaire, maidir le caiteachas airgid i gcoitinne, tá rialacha leagtha síos ag an Roinn Airgeadais maidir leis an gcaoi a gcaitear an t-airgead sin.  Teastaíonn uathu, agus an ceart ar fad acu, go mbeadh buntáiste ag teacht don Stát ar cibé airgead atá á chaitheamh. Sílim go bhféadfaí a rá, san am atá caite, go raibh deontais á dtabhairt do dhaoine áirithe agus nár caitheadh an t-airgead mar ba chóir.  Ach níl sé sin ag tarlú níos mó.  Agus fiú amháin leis an Údarás, nuair a chuaigh siad i gcumhacht bhí go leor leor rudaí a mb'éigean dóibh a ghlanadh suas maidir le cuid de na rudaí a bhí ag tarlú.  Agus tá ár mbuíochas ag dul dóibh i ngeall air sin.  Feasta beidh srian níos géire ar chaiteachas airgid, cibé áit a mbeidh sé, agus sílim go bhfuil sé de cheart ag an Stát a chinntiú nach gcuirfí an t-airgead a bheas á chaitheamh acu amú, mar tá lucht oibre na tíre seo ag cur an t-airgead sin ar fáil.  Is é airgead lucht oibre na tíre atá á chaitheamh againn ar na cúrsaí seo, agus caithfimid a bheith cinnte go bhfuil an tairbhe cheart á fáil as an airgead sin atá á chaitheamh.</P>
    <P>An rud a luaigh an Teachta McGinley, tá fógra tugtha faoi sin le cúpla bliain.  Tá sé á chur i bhfeidhm anois, agus sin an fáth a bhfuil súil níos géire á coinneáil ar na cúrsaí seo.  Anois, luaigh sé an tseirbhís go hOileán Toraí.  Tá athrú ar an tseirbhís a bhí á cur ar fáil, agus is é an cinneadh a rinne an tÚdarás go mbeidh héileacaptar níos mó á chur ar fáil a bheas in ann ceithre dhuine is fiche a thabhairt leis.  Beidh, ar a laghad, ocht dturas á ndéanamh ag an héileacaptar seo in aghaidh an gheimhridh.  Bíonn na seirbhísí seo curtha ar fáil i gcaitheamh an gheimhridh nuair nach mbíonn siad in ann na báid a thabhairt isteach, agus beidh costas breise £18,000 ar an tseirbhís seo.  £9,500 a chosain sé go dtí seo, agus tá an t-airgead breise sin á chur ar fáil i mbliana <Col N="1148" /> le seirbhís níos fearr a chur ar fáil do mhuintir Thoraí.  Is maith liom go mbeidh an tÚdarás in ann an rud sin a chinneadh, agus sílim go mbeidh muintir Thoraí sásta leis sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Dá mbeadh an t-am agam, tá deacrachtaí eile a bhaineann leis sin.  Tá rialacha anois a bhaineann leis an gcineál héileacaptair a bheas á úsáid. Sílim nach mbeidh cead feasta an cineál a bhí ann go dtí seo a úsáid.  Rinne sé an turas níos minice, ach ní bheadh cead acu paisinéirí a thógáil mar a bhí ar siúl cheana.  Caithfear héileacaptar den chineál atá in úsáid anois a chur ar fáil, agus sin an fáth nach mbeidh oiread turais á ndéanamh.  Ach san am céanna, má tá gá leis in am ar bith is féidir dul thar na hocht n-uaire atá luaite má tá géarghá leis.  Tá an cinneadh sin déanta ag an Údarás chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an rud a luaigh an Teachta Quill faoi cheist na Gaeilge, tá gá, cinnte, leis na Gaeltachtaí a chosaint agus a chaomhnú. Más rud é go n-imíonn na Gaeltachtaí, imeoidh an Ghaeilge, tá a fhios againn uilig sin.  Anois, luaigh sí bóithre Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil go leor daoine ag caint faoi bhóithre gach uile áit ar fud na tíre, agus, arís, má táimid ag caint faoi bhóithre caithfimid airgead a chaitheamh.  Sílim, má chluinim na rudaí atá á rá ag an pháirtí lena mbaineann an Teachta Quill, bíonn siad ag rá go bhfuilimid ag caitheamh na múrthaí airgid.  Mar sin, cén chaoi sa diabhal a dtig linn bóithre níos fearr a chur ar fáil mura dtig linn an t-airgead a chur ar fáil do na bóithre sin agus a chaitheamh?</P>

      <P>Beidh gach uile iarracht á déanamh oiread airgid agus is féidir a fháil ón Eoraip, agus tá sé sin á dhéanamh cheana maidir le cúrsaí eile, agus tá mé cinnte, nuair a bheas na rudaí seo á bplé, go mbeidh gach iarracht á dhéanamh leis an bhuntáiste is fearr a dtig linn a fháil ar an airgead sin.  Anois, luaigh an Teachta Quill agus an Teachta Higgins ceist theilifís Ghaeltachta.  Arís, sílim go mba cheart níos mó ama a bheith againn leis na moltaí sin a phlé.  Níl sé faoi chaibidil inniu againn.  Táimid ag caint faoin Meastachán Forlíontach seo.  Ach déarfaidh mé an méid seo, agus tá sé ráite agam i bhfreagraí a thug mé anseo, tá mé á dtabhairt le bliain: nuair a chuirfimid tús leis an tseirbhís seo caithfimid a bheith cinnte go mbeidh rud éigin curtha ar fáil againn a mbeidh glacadh air, a mbeidh daoine sásta leis, a mbeidh an t-aos óg sásta leis.  Beimid i gcoimhlint le cláracha eile i mBéarla, agus más rud é nach bhfuilimid in ann rud éigin a chur ar fáil a bheas taitneamhach don aos óg, agus go mórmhór aos óg na Gaeltachta, níl maith ar bith a bheith ag plé leis.  Sin an rud atá ar siúl againn.  Táimid ag iarraidh réiteach a dhéanamh i gcaoi, nuair a chuirfear tús leis an tseirbhís seo, go mbeidh seirbhís againn a mbeidh glacadh uirthi ag an bpobal i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le Gaeilge sa Teach seo, bhí mé féin i mo chathaoirleach ar an gcéad chomhchoiste, agus rinneadh moltaí maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo, maidir le fearaistí a chur ar fáil, go mbeadh seomra feistithe, agus rudaí mar sin.  Níl sé déanta, agus is mór an náire nach bhfuil sé déanta.  Ba cheart go mbeadh sé ar fáil.  Ba cheart go mbeadh áiseanna ag Teachtaí Dála; nuair a thiocfas siad isteach anseo agus iad ag iarraidh ceisteanna a chur síos i nGaeilge agus má theastaíonn uathu an cuidiú sin a fháil, níl sé le fáil.  Is cuimhin liom féin Teachta agaibh agus bhí sé ag cur ceist Dála ar Thaoiseach ár bpáirtí féin, agus d'iarr sé orm cuidiú leis an cheist a chur.  Bhí bród orm é a dhéanamh, agus sílim go mba mhór an rud don Ghaeilge go dtáinig <Col N="1150" /> Teachta chugam ag iarraidh an cuidiú sin a thabhairt dó.  Ach caithfear é sin a dhéanamh, agus níl mé ag séanadh an rud atá ráite ag an Teachta.  Ná sé ach ag insint na fírinne ghlan, agus aontaím le gach uile fhocal atá ráite aige.  Caithfimid na seirbhísí seo a chur ar fáil anseo sa Dáil do na Teachtaí agus do na Seanadóirí, agus níl maith ar bith dúinn a bheith ag teacht le chéile i bhfo-choistí agus a bheith ag cur amach tuarascála, mura bhféachann muid le cuid den méid atá sna tuarascála sin a chur i ngníomh.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil an Teachta ag díriú ár n-aire uilig ar na cúrsaí sin, agus caithfimid féacháil leis na rudaí sin a dhéanamh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí ar fad agus an imirce, ní maith le duine ar bith an chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí.  Ach tá rud amháin ar cheart a rá, agus ní maith liomsa an t-aos óg a fheiceáil ag fágáil na Gaeltachta. Tá sé ag tarlú i mo pharóiste féin, tá mac liom féin i Londain le dhá bhliain agus ní thaitníonn sin liom.  Ach tá an mhéid sin ann nach mbeadh na postanna le fáil acu sna Gaeltachtaí ar aon nós, mar atá cúrsaí i láthair na huaire.  Níl postanna eagraithe sna Gaeltachtaí, agus ní raibh.  Bhí orthu na Gaeltachtaí a fhágáil, ach bhí na postanna le fáil i mBaile Átha Cliath, i gCorcaigh nó i Luimneach, agus ar a laghad bhí siad in ann teacht abhaile ag deireadh na seachtaine agus a bheith lena muintir sa bhaile. Is é an trua gur i Sasana nó in Albain nó i Meiriceá nó in áit éigin eile atá an t-aos óg i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Sílim, agus tá mé ag labhairt go ginearálta, nuair a deirim é seo, a Chathaoirligh, go bhfuil b'fhéidir feabhas ag teacht ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na tíre a chuideoidh le daoine le hinfheistíocht a dhéanamh agus go mbeidh postanna á gcur ar fáil.  Tá a fhios agam nach dtarlóidh sé go luath, ach tá an chosúlacht ann go bhfuil na cúrsaí sin ag feabhsú, agus beimid ag súil go mbeimid in ann a theacht i gcabhair ar an Údarás agus breis airgid a chur ar fáil dóibh leis an obair mhaith atá á déanamh acu a dhéanamh <Col N="1151" /> agus a choinneáil ar siúl.  Tá rud maith amháin atá ar siúl acu i láthar na huaire, agus sin go bhfuil siad ag díriú a n-aghaidh ar fhorbairt ár n-achmhainní nádúrtha, rud nach ndearna siad go dtí seo.  Cúrsaí feirmeoireacht éisc agus rudaí mar sin, agus de réir a chéile tiocfaidh postanna ón obair sin.  Beidh monarchana ag teastáil le leasú a dhéanamh ar an iasc atá á cheapadh, agus mar sin de, agus sílim, i gceann chúpla bliain eile, go mbeidh feabhas mór ag teacht ar na cúrsaí sin.  A Cheann Comhairle, tá mé buíoch arís do na Teachtaí.</P>

Tá siad ag cur amach ráitis den chineál sin, ach fad agus is eol domsa níor cuireadh os ár gcomhair i gceart é le hathbhreithniú a <Col N="1152" /> dhéanamh ar an scéal.

Arís molaim gach duine a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo.
