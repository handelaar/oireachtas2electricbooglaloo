      <P>I regret that the Taoiseach is indisposed this morning and in the circumstances arrangements have been made for the Minister for the Environment to read the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed that the Votes shall be taken together for the purposes of debate; that a general debate may arise thereon; that the proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put from the Chair and the following arrangements shall apply:</P>
      <P>(1)  The first Government speaker shall not exceed 1 hour.</P>
      <P>(2)  The speech of the main spokesperson nominated by each of the Groups (as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) (a) in Opposition shall not exceed 40 minutes.</P>
      <P>(3)  The speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>(4)  A Member of the Government shall be called on not later than 4.45 p.m. to conclude the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is further proposed that at the conclusion of business today, the Dáil shall <Col N="2394" /> adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October 1988.</P>
    <P>May I add that the Taoiseach has asked the Government Chief Whip to request a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with a view to the Dáil Chamber being made available for committee meetings during the Summer recess.</P>

      <P>On the first proposals, to deal with the allocation of time.  An bhfuil sé intuigthe go mbeidh díospóireacht do Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta mar chuid den díospóireacht nó an mbeidh, mar shampla, an tAire Stáit ag Roinn an Taoisigh, an Teachta Denis Gallagher, taobh istigh den teorainn 15 nóiméad.  Dar ndóigh beidh díospóireacht faoi Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta ag tosnú taréis órádí na bpríomh chainteoirí.  An cheist atá agam ná cé mhéid ama a bheidh ar fáil don urlabhraí ar chúrsaí Ghaeltachta?  Tá brón orm nach bhfuil an Taoiseach i láthair, ach an mbeidh 15 nóiméad nó níos mó ag an Aire Stáit agus cé mhéid ama a bheidh ag na hurlabhraíthe eile faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. Item No. (2) is worded specifically to exclude The Workers' Party from having <Col N="2396" /> a speaker for 40 minutes.  It is a petty manoeuvre.  I shall leave it at that and deal with the matter in my speech of 15 minutes which I have been allocated through the generosity, not only of the Fianna Fáil party, but of the Fine Gael, Progressive Democrats and Labour Party Whips.</P>

      <P>We were still not informed at 10 o'clock this morning of what the adjournment date was.  My Whip wrote to you at that time to say that we would propose to delete the date, on the assumption that it would be some date in October, and substitute the date of 13 September.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point in relation to the Dáil adjourning until 19 October.  I tried a number of times yesterday to find out the proposed date for the resumption of the Dáil and I was told, at 8.15 p.m. last night, that the date would be known when we received the Order of Business today. However, I did not receive the Order of Business until 10.25 a.m. today just as the bell began to ring for the House to assemble.  I had proposed to put down an amendment but, in the time available, it was not possible to do that.  I had proposed to amend the date to 6 September because three months is far too long, given the amount of legislation which the House has to deal with and the way Deputies have had to sit late into the night during the last three or four weeks to pass legislation on the basis of no debates and guillotine.  It is an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the business of this House to have it going into recess for three months when there is so much legislation to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>During my 20 years in the House, comments have been made <Col N="2397" /> about when the Dáil should resume after the summer recess.  However, anybody who has been watching the performance of this House over the past number of months will recognise that a record number of Bills has been passed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important to state that on numerous occasions, by agreement of the Government, the main Opposition and other Whips, all this legislation was put through.  On numerous occasions, the time laid out was not required because of the absence of contributions from the Progressive Democrats and The Workers' Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach is indisposed today he has asked me to read his speech on the Adjournment of Dáil Éireann and to report on the European Council held in Hanover on the 27 and 28 June 1988.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,592,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, including certain cultural and archival activities and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is on course.  We are making steady and satisfactory progress.  There is, however, substantial ground still to be recovered. Final success in this battle for recovery depends on our continuing to exercise discipline and responsibility for some time yet.  We cannot allow ourselves to be diverted from the main objective of <Col N="2403" /> giving our people a growing economy firmly based on sound finances.  But there is no doubt that a return to growth and employment is coming clearly into view.</P>
    <P>I would like everyone to understand the point we have reached and exactly where we now stand.  Great progress has been made in overcoming our economic difficulties.  Our financial problems have been brought under control but not resolved.  We are still spending and borrowing too much in relation to what we produce and our capacity to pay.  We must continue with the difficult and detailed work of controlling every aspect of Government and local authority spending until they are brought into line with the resources available.</P>
    <P>The vital element in our present situation is confidence.  The nation is recovering confidence in itself and its future.  Throughout the economy confidence is returning; there is optimism, people everywhere are thinking of investing, undertaking new projects, or expanding existing ones.  I want to say also that the Government are becoming increasingly confident that recovery is under way and will continue.  One of the things that is helping to general this generate feeling of confidence is the endorsement of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> by the social partners.  That provides a sound encouraging basis for all our economic effort.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the problems of the nation is practical and realistic and never departs from our caring social philosophy. We face a unique situation, in terms of our financial position, our natural resources and our demographic structure, which has no obvious parellel in neighbouring countries, and we have to tackle it in our own way.  We keep to certain basic principles of social solidarity, and deplore any attempts to create a divided society.</P>
    <P>The Irish people understand perfectly well at this stage that there is no simple formula which will make all our economic problems vanish &mdash; no magic wand.  It is false to suggest that massive income tax cuts, the feasibility and financing of which <Col N="2404" /> are entirely unexplained, are the key to recovery.  I am frankly surprised after all the experiences of the last 15 years that anyone should be unrealistic enough to suggest that we award ourselves massive tax cuts before we have earned them, and that we can do in one year what it has taken others ten years to achieve.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> represents a strategy to achieve balanced progress in relation to key objectives, the restoration of financial stability, full exploitation of development and employment opportunities and equity in both the tax system and the social services. Substantial progress has already been achieved.  Restoring financial stability as a basis for satisfactory economic growth is the key objective, as we will not be able to increase employment, reduce taxation or improve living standards and social conditions without it.</P>
    <P>We are over half way to stabilising the ratio of debt to national output.  In 1985 and 1986 the State was borrowing in excess of £2 billion pounds a year, at a time when national output was growing by less than half that amount.  That borrowing has now been reduced by a third to under £1,500 million.  But that level of borrowing is not sustainable either.  We cannot accept the situation as satisfactory until the borrowing level has been reduced to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>We might well, however, do better than that.  Steady economic growth bringing a return to revenue buoyancy could allow a further desirable fall in the borrowing level and the gradual elimination of the current budget deficit, which remains a valid medium term objective. Other countries that had severe debt problems in the past have succeeded after a period of years in moving towards budget surplus.  There is no inherent reason, if we manage our affairs properly, why Ireland should not be able to achieve the same.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose of stabilising the debt is to reduce progressively in real terms the amount of our resources now going to pay interest and repayments and <Col N="2405" /> release them for more productive and employment-generating purposes.</P>
    <P>Considerable initial progress was made last year.  The debt-GNP ratio did not rise significantly, and the foreign debt we believe, has probably been permanently stabilised <i>vis-à-vis</i> the level reached in 1986, barring major currency upheavals. However, we need to remind ourselves that the foreign debt at around 60 per cent of GNP is higher than in virtually any other developed country and needs to be substantially reduced.  With the balance of payments now in surplus we must now examine the possibility of repaying part of our foreign debt by substituting domestic borrowing, provided that could be achieved without disrupting the domestic credit market.</P>
    <P>If proof were needed of the growing confidence that international investors abroad have in Ireland, it can be found in investment by non-residents of hundreds of millions of pounds in domestic Government securities at the present time.  When account is taken also of the top credit ratings that have been assigned to Ireland as a sovereign borrower abroad and the fine terms of our foreign borrowings that have been subsequently achieved, we can reasonably say that international confidence in Ireland's economic management has never been higher.</P>
    <P>As far as 1988 is concerned, as the half-year Exchequer returns will show, the budget is fully on course to achieve its targets.  For the second year running there is no slippage of any kind.  Indeed, I am cautiously optimistic that it will be possible to make slightly faster progress in reducing Exchequer borrowing than could be anticipated at budget time, but this would not significantly reduce the continuing effort that will be required in 1989.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that the comprehensive public expenditure reviews first introduced last summer have radically altered the budget preparation process and in particular the scrutiny of public expenditure.  Prior to the new procedures introduced last summer, the <Col N="2406" /> annual exercise of pruning the departmental Estimates was very much a matter of taking each Estimate in turn by itself and simply imposing an arbitrary reduction.  Now, however, all spending programmes are fully considered, examined in detail and submitted to the test of whether they can be fully justified.</P>
    <P>The fundamental and questioning reviews of departmental spending have shown that there is much greater scope for economies than might previously have been thought possible.  Many of the economies implemented contribute to increased efficiency in the use of tax revenues and borrowed money.  From every point of view, therefore, there is much to be said for retaining these procedures in the future, even after our immediate financial difficulties are overcome.  The preparation of the Estimates in good time before the year commences contributes greatly to an orderly and much more sensible conduct of our financial affairs. Under previous procedures, the year was too often already under way before the Estimates were settled so that forward planning, in good time, of expenditure was greatly inhibited with the consequent result that budget expenditure targets were not met.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a major reduction in public expenditure would be too deflationary was completely debunked last year when we achieved the highest economic growth for a decade of up to 5 per cent.  While it is too early to make firm predictions about 1988, I am reasonably confident that we will have positive economic growth this year as well, and that many of the forecasts have been unduly cautious.  Already industrial production is up 19 per cent in the first quarter.</P>
    <P>Significant reductions in taxation can accompany but should not precede improvements in the public finances, resulting in the main from reductions in expenditure.  I would like to add that this is not just the position of the present Government.  It was also the position of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Minister for Finance.  In the 1984 Budget he stated: &ldquo;However desirable it might be to reduce taxation, this cannot <Col N="2407" /> be done on a significant scale, if at all, until current expenditure is reduced and the current budget deficit eliminated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our success last year in achieving our financial targets with some margin to spare enabled us to introduce some measure of tax relief this year, and allowed us to fulfil in one year most of the commitments made for a three-year period in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Further improvement will create scope for further relief, the first objective being to complete the task of putting two thirds of taxpayers back onto the standard rate which has not been the case since 1982.</P>
    <P>The introduction of self-assessment, the extension of PRSI, the taxation of farmers on the same basis as other self-employed, the more determined collection methods now being employed and the changes in corporation tax show full commitment on the part of this Government to their undertaking in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for tax reform in the proper sense of the term. The improvements in tax equity introduced by this Government will also help to improve the morale of all taxpayers, when they see that, increasingly, all are obliged to pay their fair share.  Significant additional tax has been collected this year, by means of the package of measures including a temporary tax incentive scheme designed to speed up the collection of arrears and the establishment of a special task force of officials specialising in the collection of tax arrears.  We will continue our work steadily toward a fair system in which all pay their taxes on the basis of actual income and personal circumstances and, as far as possible, on a current year basis.</P>
    <P>We are determined to create a situation in which we will actually be able to reduce tax levels.  We are convinced that the taxpayers of this country will benefit infinitely more from a real reduction in the tax they pay on the basis of general economic and financial progress, than from mere manoeuvring of the figures within the restricted confines of the same heavy and unsustainable total burden.  The attempt to effect major <Col N="2408" /> upheavals in the tax system which are not sustained by economic growth and which maintain the present proportionately excessive total tax burden can have disastrous economic consequences.</P>
    <P>The fall in interest rates of up to 6½ per cent in the last 15 months is in the main due to the firm action taken by the Government in the financial area.  It has considerably increased the room for manoeuvre of commercial borrowers, as well as greatly easing the position of householders with mortgages.  Our remarkably low level of inflation can also to a significant degree be attributed to the Government's policies of not trying to reduce Exchequer borrowing by increasing taxation but by expenditure reductions which in turn have lowered interest rates.  This satisfactory rate of inflation which at less than 2 per cent is half the British rate, our significant balance of payments surplus and a stable exchange rate for the Irish pound within the EMS all contribute to the establishment for the first time in years of a favourable climate for investment.</P>
    <P>This has led to an upturn in industrial investment and in commercial construction. Any sort of significant growth in domestic consumption has been slow to develop but there are some initial signs emerging of a pick-up in consumption this year, especially in the returns of indirect taxes, and in the increase in car registrations of 14 per cent in the first quarter. The fall in unemployment over the last six months is another indication of increased economic activity.</P>
    <P>Suggestions of a downturn in the international economy have proved unfounded, and it looks as if growth in our principal markets will be at least fully maintained in 1988.  Irish exports have continued to expand strongly after growth of 14½ per cent in 1987, and have increased by 18 per cent in the first four months of this year.  Export growth was reflected in very strong growth in manufacturing output of 19 per cent in the first three months of the year.  The growing trade surplus which trebled from just under £500 million to well over £1,500 million in 1987 contributed to the first <Col N="2409" /> balance of payments surplus in 20 years, and is a key indicator of economic health as far as the international community is concerned.  The appreciation of sterling in recent months has created exceptional opportunities for us in the British market, and for the first time we have reached a position of virtual trade balance in our trade with Britain.</P>
    <P>Despite the success of our exports to date, we must intensify our efforts.  All available ways of increasing exports are being explored and exploited, not just in traditional or wider EC markets but in countries much further afield, from the Soviet Union, to China and Japan and to Australia.  The licensing of export trading houses, joint ventures by State companies, the Overseas Consultancy Group, and combined marketing by companies under the auspices of CTT are all being pursued with a new vigour and determination.</P>
    <P>The advent of the completely free market in Europe is the most important development we face internationally.  By 1992 the European Community will be a single market.  This is now irreversible and we must in every sector seize the vast opportunities now opening up, with complete confidence in our ability to compete successfully in this new, competitive single market.</P>
    <P>Two main opportunities are afforded by the single market.  Studies have shown that the growth of trade between members of the Community leads on the one hand to the growth of larger firms with bigger market shares and, on the other, to product differentiation and specialisation.  Our strategy must be to seek opportunities under both headings. In food, for example, we should be capable of building on our already successful marketing abroad to achieve a greater share of the single market by making the right choices in structural adaptation, technological change and coherent market-led production.</P>
    <P>In product specialisation, we are already well advanced in such sectors as electronics and data-processing equipment, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. <Col N="2410" /> Provided we keep abreast of technological change and market developments and continue to improve our cost environment we should be able to win an ever-increasing share of the single market.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where our natural resources endow us with the ability to win new markets.  We could become a main supplier of timber to the Community if we accelerate &mdash; as the Government intend by means of a new commercial approach to the industry &mdash; in both planting and processing.  The expansion of aquaculture could give us a dominant position in that market, but we must end river and sea pollution which is a primary environmental objective of this Government.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must recognise that our more traditional industries such as clothing, textiles, footwear and engineering will face more severe competition, but these industries also face more opportunities with the falling of trade barriers. The needs of these industries are clear &mdash; better management, higher productivity through technological change, better product design and specialisation and, above all, better marketing.  The sectoral industrial strategies being developed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will concentrate on these issues and we hope to use the increased funding under the EC Structural Funds to assist in the adaptation and development required.</P>
    <P>In international services, we have in recent years built up our expertise and knowledge in many sectors particularly in the financial and banking sector where we are now expanding rapidly outside Ireland.  The single market cannot but provide us with extensive opportunities for further expansion and growth as we extend our highly sophisticated skills to a market of 320 million.</P>
    <P>Progress towards the single market will, of course, present difficult decisions and problems as in the case of indirect tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>I have briefly outlined the opportunities and challenges the single market presents.  We must recognise that the <Col N="2411" /> steady irreversible progress to a single market is one of the most remarkable developments in the history of a long divided Europe.  It has grown slowly but tenaciously to building a Europe of peaceful co-operation and common economic and social purpose among the member states.</P>
    <P>I would like to demolish any suggestion that the Government are remiss in taking all necessary measures to adapt to the emerging single market.  Carefully considered, effective arrangements have been put in place which are succeeding very well in establishing and maintaining the necessary impetus.</P>
    <P>As soon as we came into office, we recognised the crucial importance of managing our affairs and our negotiations in the EC in a coherent structured way and, accordingly, we appointed a wholetime Minister for Co-ordination of European Affairs so that there would be a clear focus at political level &mdash; as in most other member states &mdash; for the preparation and development of our EC policies.</P>
    <P>Specifically to oversee and mastermind our preparations for the single market, there is a Committee of Ministers and Secretaries under my Chairmanship.  This committee carefully prepares our negotiating position on all relevant issues and gives directions as to the measures to be taken to ensure rapid and full adaptation to the single market.</P>
    <P>The Framework Regulation which contains the principles which will govern the allocation of the greatly-increased Structural Funds was of crucial importance and we have secured a commitment by the Commission to the doubling by 1992, as a general rule, of the Structural Funds going to the least prosperous regions in which Ireland by definition is included, provided the necessary programmes and plans are submitted.</P>
    <P>An essential part of our preparation strategy is to have the closest possible level of co-operation and co-ordination of efforts between the Commission and our Committee of Ministers and Secretaries. Both the Government and the <Col N="2412" /> Commission agree that an arrangement that will ensure that we can proceed with the greatest possible amount of agreement on plans and projects would be very beneficial from both our points of view. It is essential that our respective decisions and actions be taken in a timely and strategic framework which advances the overall Community objective of cohesion and our national objectives of faster growth, greater employment and improved social conditions.  Arrangements for this are in train.</P>
    <P>We are already preparing our national development plan, which must be submitted to the Commission by the end of the year, to provide the framework for the individual programmes qualifying for the structural funds.  This plan will also be broken down into sub-regional plans and this is underway.</P>
    <P>We envisage a vigorous and active programme of measures to ensure that each sector will take the necessary steps to adapt to the new market conditions.  Sectoral strategies which identify the specific problems and opportunities of each sector will be applied through regional programmes at sectoral and firm level involving Government Ministers, employers, employees and professional and vocational bodies.</P>
    <P>On Monday next, 4 July, we shall be launching a campaign in Ireland to promote in general terms greater awareness of the programme to compete the single market by 31 December 1992.  The launch will take the form of a conference in the National Conference Hall, Dublin, which I will be opening and which will be addressed by prominent international and national figures.  Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have been invited and I hope many will find it possible to attend.  The conference is being co-sponsored by the Government and by the major national representative organisations associated with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>While a general awareness campaign is important, the real task is to ensure our adaptation to the new market conditions and opportunities by all concerned.  Our campaign will not be primarily a general <Col N="2413" /> public relations type of exercise.  It will be directly aimed at those immediately concerned, sector by sector, even firm by firm, through seminars, group meetings, lectures and demonstrations.  The creation of the single market is about removing the obstacles to growth.  Many of these are external consisting mainly of barriers to our penetration of markets in other member states.  But we have our own obstacles to internal growth.  As was recognised recently in a joint Government-ICTU statement, there is a frequent and regrettable tendency in this country as soon as development projects are proposed which could increase employment and national wealth, for some group or other to start up some form of opposition or protest without regard to our urgent need to provide economic development and employment. Of course, we must protect and preserve our amenities, our heritage and the environment, but we must keep a sense of proportion and always have regard to the fact that there are far too many unemployed and far too many emigrating and that it is only by economic progress that we can remedy that appalling situation.</P>
    <P>Disappointment has been expressed that export growth has not so far been translated into increased employment in Ireland.  This is disappointing but to some extent it was inevitable that initially industry would be taking up the slack in capacity left by a long period of recession. Nevertheless, sectoral reports do indicate that a significant number of new jobs are being created.</P>
    <P>The fall in the unemployment figures over the last six months compared with the same months in 1987 so that they are now 10,000 below the corresponding figure in May 1987, is an encouraging development, especially in view of the reduction in the numbers employed in the public service.  We must, however, to our disappointment acknowledge that emigration affects the overall number of unemployed on the live register as do other factors.  But there is undoubtedly some real improvement in the figures. There is also some evidence that the <Col N="2414" /> number of people at work has begun to increase in some sectors of the economy, but it will be the autumn before the figures can be firmly established.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 months there has been a strong revival in industrial investment, reflecting the better overall atmosphere. As the joint Government-ICTU statement on job creation of 18 May stated, the industrial promotion agencies are satisfied that a total of 4,000 new first time jobs were created in the first quarter of 1988, and that they are on target to create approximately 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry in the course of the year.  This is the target set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The joint Government-ICTU statement also made it clear that satisfactory progress is being made in achieving the other sectoral job targets of the programme.  The streamlining of incentives so as to induce a more effective and economical use of State resources has been more than compensated for by more general improvements in the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for investment.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in reducing industrial costs.  Irish electricity prices, as a result of price cuts to the industrial user, are now much more competitive, and are no longer significantly out of line with the European norm. There will be a reduction of 25 per cent to 30 per cent from 1 October in international telephone charges.  Both the quality and cost of access transport has been improved.  Reforms in court procedures should help to reduce insurance costs.  Together with reductions in interest rates, wage moderation and low inflation, there have been major improvements in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The construction of the International Financial Services Centre on the Custom House Quay is now well underway.  Five companies have already commenced trading, and 25 additional projects have been approved.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has been going through a very difficult period for some years but there is now evidence of recovery in the private sector as the economy returns to a growth path based <Col N="2415" /> on sound public finances.  Construction has commenced on the Custom House Dock centre and interest is growing in the inner city designated areas with projects like the Arthur's Quay-Patrick Street development in Limerick.  The re-introduction of the section 23 initiative in this year's budget should also lead to an increase in activity in the rented apartment sector, and the decentralisation programme is well underway in ten provincial centres.  The fall in interest rates will have a beneficial effect on all sectors, including the private house market.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that our arterial roads system is a severe trading impediment to our economy in comparison with those of our competitors.  It has been estimated that our economy suffers an annual cost penalty of £300 million by reason of our inadequate arterial road system.  This Government will shortly establish a national roads authority to give a central administrative and technical impetus to creating a modern arterial road system capable of carrying efficiently not only our existing road traffic but the substantial growth that will occur as our economy expands into the future.</P>
    <P>We are confident that, in general, we can sustain the level of expenditure necessary with the restructuring we are carrying out in the Exchequer finances, with the involvement of private funding in appropriate toll schemes and with the greatly-increased assistance which will be available from the European structural funds.  Under the new arrangements, the total receipts from the funds will not only be doubled but the rate of assistance for projects, particularly infrastructural projects, will be increased.  Already the Government have identified all the improvements needed and the function of the new national roads authority will be to implement our programme quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>A number of State companies have had very successful results in the last year.  I do not think that there has been sufficient public recognition of the major success achieved by Aer Rianta in winning the <Col N="2416" /> contract for the duty-free shop at Moscow Airport which opens up a wide range of possible further developments in the new climate of economic <i>perestroika.</i> Aer Lingus have also had excellent results and are expanding their fleet. Bord Telecom have just announced a profit for the first time.  I have already referred to price cuts by the ESB and Telecom Éireann.  The wisdom of the decision to retain the B &amp; I line on stringent financial conditions was demonstrated both from a strategic point of view during the recent British seamen's strike, and in terms of improved performance. Legislation has been passed to set up a new commercial semi-State body to manage our forests.  Sustained improvement in the financial performance of the semi-State sector, which should give an adequate return to the Exchequer, where possible, is essential. State companies are urged to use their resources of finance, management and technology to initiate new viable enterprises in conjunction, if necessary, with private interests.</P>
    <P>In general Government policy and in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there is a major emphasis on the tourist industry.  We are looking to it for a major contribution to growth and employment. A further round of measures recommended by the specially constituted Tourism Task Force have been implemented in 1988.  The number of overseas visitors and foreign earnings from tourism increased by 12 per cent in 1987.  In the first four months of 1988 visitor numbers through the airports are up by a quarter.  The air liberalisation package agreed in the EC Council last December which was strongly supported by Ireland, bilaterally agreed air fare reductions between here and Germany, and removal of the cost penalty of flying on to Ireland for visitors from Australia will all contribute to increased numbers. A number of outstanding successes by our sports stars will help to focus the attention of intending travellers on Ireland.  In the joint Government/ICTU statement it was estimated that about 7,500 additional jobs equivalents had <Col N="2417" /> been created by the increase in tourism last year.</P>
    <P>There is a growing preoccupation in Europe, especially in the countries bordering on the North Sea, about pollution. Our own stituation, while not as bad, cannot however give us any room for complacency.  We are giving priority to dealing with the problem areas that we have, so that we can make a pollution-free environment a strong source of appeal to potential visitors and indeed for many other products, especially food.</P>
    <P>Our farmers should have another good year in 1988.  Last year the latest figures suggest that farm incomes rose by almost a third after the two bad years 1985 and 1986.  The price negotiations in Brussels have been reasonably satisfactory in all the circumstances, and the decline in the beef cow herd has been reversed.  The total number of sheep increased by over 11 per cent in 1987.  The sharp fall in interest rates, together with high prices, has given farmers a new incentive to increase stock.  A revised western package, pilot integrated programmes for rural areas and a new more effective TB eradication drive have been introduced.</P>
    <P>We have placed a new concentration on food production and a major programme of modernising meat factories with State support is underway.  Last year food exports increased by 30 per cent and there is an encouraging growth of new quality Irish products for both the home and export markets.  The horticultural industry is also progressing with the new impetus given by An Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>There is significant expansion and investment in the sea-fishing industry. Last year fish exports increased by over 30 per cent.  The new Department of the Marine has begun to tackle many outstanding issues, such as legislative controls on marine pollution, the development of aquaculture and the upgrading of harbour facilities.</P>
    <P>While there is much happening in many different sectors, I do not wish to suggest that our problems are by any means overcome. Sustained effort for expansion, of which we have only seen the beginning, is needed on a number of different fronts, <Col N="2418" /> if we are to achieve a decisive reduction in unemployment and emigration.  But I have no doubt that improvements based on sound public finances in the different sectors will be mutually supportive in generating an accelerating momentum.</P>
    <P>The Government brought about a major change in the formulation and administration of policy by inaugurating a system of participation in Government planning by the major economic and social interests in our community.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was prepared in consultation with these interests and a central review committee, combining representatives of the Government and the social partners, continues to oversee and monitor the progress of the programme.  This committee by their unique combination of interests united for the common purpose of improving economic and social conditions have already made important recommendations which the Government have been able to accept.  The committee are in fact developing their own dynamic.</P>
    <P>This method of working together between Government and social partners represents one of the surest guarantees for a small developing country of achieving its economic and social ambitions and as speedily as possible.  Last year we had the smallest number of days lost through industrial disputes for 14 years.</P>
    <P>We have also introduced the practice of bringing private expertise into the formulation of Government policy in selected areas.  The International Financial Services Committee have done an outstanding job in formulating the proposals on which the international financial services centre is so successfully based.  That committee continue to be involved actively in monitoring the progress of the centre and in providing their expertise to advance its marketing worldwide.</P>
    <P>The tourism task force is another striking example of how a combination of public and private expertise succeeded in putting together a new package of measures to accelerate the growth of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2419" /> Similarly in trade and marketing we have been able to draw upon private sector marketing expertise to develop a national programme for marketing.</P>
    <P>We think that our public administration in its size and structure must be kept continuously under review to make sure that we try new forms and methods to improve its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In little over a year we have made some profound changes and we will continue to search out new and better ways to enable our talented and committed public servants to have at their disposal a more efficient administrative machine through which they can achieve their objectives.</P>
    <P>For this purpose we have initiated an efficiency audit in the public service under which a group containing expertise from inside and outside the public service will examine the working methods and practices of the public service to ensure that they are the most cost-effective and cost-efficient possible.  Experience in other countries, notably in Australia and the United Kingdom, has shown that substantial savings are possible by such audits, without affecting the amount and quality of service provided.  I believe it will also be possible, through the work of the group, to achieve improvements in the amount and quality of particular public services and of the morale of those providing them, at no extra cost in public expenditure terms.</P>
    <P>In addition to our work in the economic area, the Government have put through a major programme of legislation.  By this summer, the Oireachtas will have enacted 29 Bills since the beginning of 1988, making a total of 64 Bills enacted since we came into office in March 1987. The Bills include very important pieces of legislation; the Courts Bill which will have an impact on insurance costs; the Data Protection Bill, necessary both for the privacy of the citizen but also for financial services; the two radio and television Bills, which enable commercial radio and an independent television channel to be set up, ending a long period <Col N="2420" /> of decision-making paralysis; an electricity Bill that enables the ESB to operate subsidiaries and import coal on a wholesale basis through Moneypoint; Bills to extend worker participation to certain State companies; a Bill to create a commercial forestry company; a tobacco health protection Bill; and the Adoption Bill to extend the category of children who may be legally adopted.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there are, of course, a number of other important pieces of legislation still going through the Dáil such as the Child Care Bill and the Video Recordings Bill, and we anticipate continued activity in the legislative programme in the autumn session.  The legislative programme could not have been achieved without the co-operation of the other parties and in particular the main Opposition party.  I believe it reflects credit on both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, tá cúramaí orm freisin mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus beidh cur síos á dhéanamh ar Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta ag an Aire Stáit sa Roinn sin, an Teachta Denis Gallagher.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásaimh don Rialtas gur éirigh le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta cur leis an líon daoine a bhí fostaithe i dtionscail faoina scáth anuraidh.  Ag deireadh na bliana 1987 bhí beagnach cúig mhíle duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra Éireann nó ón Údarás.  Is méadú cúig go leith faoin gcéad é ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe sna tionscail sin ag deireadh na bliana 1986.  Tuigim ón Udarás go meastar go gcruthófar timpeall sé céad post nua i rith na bliana 1988.  Mar sin, tá an tÚdarás agus an Ghaeltacht ag déanamh a gcuid maidir le comhlíonadh na spriocanna fostaíochta a leagadh amach sa Chlár um Théarnamh Náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Léirigh an Rialtas a thacaíocht athuair don Ghaeilge nuair a socraíodh i mí na Samhna seo caite ar £4 milliún ó fháltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta a chur ar fáil do thograí speisialta Gaeilge.  Táim cinnte go rachaidh an cúnamh speisialta atá curtha ar fáil go mór chun leas na Gaeilge.  Cheana féin tá rian an chúnaimh <Col N="2421" /> sin le feiceáil in imeachtaí Ghlór na nGael agus Chumann na bhFiann.</P>
    <P>Athbhunaíodh an Comhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge anuraidh agus is breá liom go bhfuil na comhaltaí ag saothrú go dian ó shin faoin gCathaoirleach, An Seanadóir Tomás Mac Gearailt.</P>
    <P>Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go dtabharfadh Comhaltaí an Tí seo agus an tSeanaid dea-shampla i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus tá moltaí fiúntacha chuige sin sa dara tuarascáil ón gComhchoiste.</P>

    <P>The Government have recently approved the establishment of a National Heritage Council.  In broad terms, the council will have responsibility for archaeology, architecture, wildlife, landscape, heritage gardens and certain inland waterways.  The council will formulate specific policy for the preservation and enhancement of this country's heritage.  It will have power to act on its own initiative and through other Government agencies as appropriate. The council will be established initially on a non-statutory basis and will help to draft the legislation needed to establish it, at what I hope will be a relatively early date, as a statutory National Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>The council will report to the Taoiseach and to facilitate this, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works has been appointed also to my Department as Minister of State for Heritage Affairs.  The Government have appointed Lord Killanin as chairman of the council and I am sure the House will recognise in the appointment of so distinguished a person and one with such experience of administration how seriously we regard the work of the new council.  We will shortly announce the full membership of the council.</P>
    <P>More active and more positive policy initiatives are now urgently needed if we are to pass on intact to future generations the physical heritage entrusted to us.  I <Col N="2422" /> am confident that these new arrangements will result in a more positive, integrated approach to national heritage matters.  The work of the council will complement the work of State agencies, concerned individuals, voluntary organisations and local authorities.  I know that the creation of the council will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to report on the European Council which I attended in Hanover on 27 and 28 June.</P>
    <P>The Council dealt, essentially, with the internal market and its social dimension, economic and monetary questions and the protection of the environment.  We also discussed political co-operation items.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Hanover I had a very useful meeting with the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, on matters of mutual interest to Ireland and the Community.  I would like to take the opportunity here to convey to him our congratulations on his reappointment as President of the Commission, which was agreed to unanimously, and our best wishes for his new term of office.  I also met the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at the end of the Council.</P>
    <P>There was a definable sense of optimism and confidence among all the members of the Council.  A momentum has developed in the affairs of the Community which is unique in my experience. As the first paragraph of the Presidency Conclusions, which I have arranged to lay before the House, indicates, the Council takes the view that the process of the completion of the internal market where goods, services, persons and capital can move freely in a market, without frontiers, has now reached the point where it is irreversible.</P>
    <P>In 1986, the total domestic product of the European Community was, according to Commission sources, the equivalent of approximately 3.5 trillion dollars.  In the same year the domestic product of the United States was approximately 4.2 trillion dollars and that of Japan just over 2 trillion dollars.  The Community is among the largest economic entities in the world but within its <Col N="2423" /> boundaries there are serious obstacles to trade and business of a type from which its competitors do not suffer, which prevent Europe from reaching its full potential either as a market or as a source of technological innovation.</P>
    <P>The cost of these obstacles &mdash; or alternatively the benefit of a complete internal market &mdash; is calculated at between 4.25 per cent and 6.5 per cent of the Community's gross national product.  In other words, when we speak of the completion of the internal market, we are speaking of a benefit to its member states and to the people of Europe estimated to be the equivalent of between 175 and 255 billion ECUs or eight to 11 times the total gross national product of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The obstacles cover such things as customs formalities, standards for products, exchange rates, the movement of citizens, professional qualifications and a multitude of regulations and limitations on individual freedom or on competition. The Commission proposals to cut through this regulatory tangle are contained in nearly 300 different drafts or directives.  Of these, 101 are completed or agreed in principle.  The rest remain to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Hanover Council took note that by the end of 1988 the Commission will have submitted the bulk of its proposals with the objective of completing the market by 1992.  The Council also noted with satisfaction that decisions have been taken in such strategic areas as the full liberalisation of capital movements, the mutual recognition of diplomas, the opening up of public contracts, insurance matters and road and air transport.  They agreed that decisions should be taken as soon as possible in relation to public contracts, banks and other financial services, the approximation of standards and intellectual property.</P>
    <P>At the Council, I raised the two aspects of the proposals for the completion of the market which are of particular concern to us.  The first is the proposal for the harmonisation of taxes within the Community. As these are framed at present, there could, in relation to the indirect <Col N="2424" /> taxes alone, be a loss to the Irish Exchequer running into hundreds of millions. With the public finances in their present state this is not a situation we could contemplate with equanimity.</P>
    <P>Next, there is a danger that the completion of the market could set in motion irresistible centripetal forces, concentrating people and wealth to an even greater extent than at present, in the central areas of the Community, to the detriment of the peripheral regions.  The need for support of these regions is recognised in the Single European Act and I was involved with other members in ensuring that the Conclusions of the Council took note of the need for the successful implementation of the provisions of the Single European Act on cohesion.</P>
    <P>The Council taking up the question of progressive realisation of economic and monetary union decided to establish a committee to propose concrete stages leading towards this union.  The committee is to be chaired by Mr. Delors, President of the Commission, and to have as members the Governors of the Central Banks of the Community who will act on the committee in their personal capacities. The committee will also include Commission member Andriessen and three experts, Mr. Thygesen, Professor of Economics, Copenhagen, Mr. Lamfalussy, Director-General of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, and Mr. Miguel Boyer, President of the Banco Exterior de Espana.  The committee is to report to the Ministers for Finance and Economic Affairs, in time to enable the European Council, at its Madrid meeting in June 1989, to consider its results.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the unacceptably high level of unemployment in the Community, the Council emphasised the importance of sustained economic growth of the internal market in increasing employment and living standards of all Community citizens.  The Council also laid particular stress on the need for the improvement of working conditions and the standard of living of wage earners. Of importance to this country is the fact <Col N="2425" /> that improved access to vocational training mentioned in the Conclusions includes work experience programmes.</P>
    <P>Indicative of the high degree of social concern expressed in Hanover, is the Conclusion relating to the protection of the environment.  There is an invitation to the Commission and the Council to intensify efforts to improve the means to combat and prevent air and water pollution. The Hanover Council welcomed the Conclusions of the Toronto Summit &mdash; dealing also with the ozone layer and acid rain &mdash; and emphasised that environmental considerations must be integrated into all areas of economic policy-making.</P>
    <P>The President, Chancellor Kohl, and other members expressed concern that technology developments in communications and especially in the audio-visual media are, increasingly, exerting pressures on regional languages, customs and cultures.  I stressed the need to cultivate and encourage access to the richness and diversity of European culture. This intervention was followed by a particularly powerful and moving address by President Mitterrand who spoke eloquently on Europe's cultural needs and particularly the need to preserve all aspects of that culture as part of the cultural heritage of mankind.  He singled out for special mention the Irish and Flemish languages.</P>
    <P>On political co-operation items, the Council welcomed the new dynamic in East-West relations.  I personally am more than glad to place on record here the conclusions recorded after the recent Reagan-Gorbachev Summit that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought &mdash; and the disavowal of the Superpowers of any intention to achieve military superiority.  The inference from this conclusion is particularly important in the area of disarmament.</P>
    <P>On the Middle East, the Council expressed the view that the <i>status quo</i> in the occupied territories cannot be sustained. It reaffirmed the support of the Twelve for an international peace conference and repeated its support for UNIFIL in appealing for the immediate release of the hostages in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2426" /> In expressing its concern for the Sharpeville Six, the Council urged that all possibilities should be availed of to prevent the death penalty from being carried out.  In view of Nelson Mandela's impending 70th birthday, the Council called for his release and that of other political prisoners.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Council, I had a serious and thorough meeting, which lasted slightly more than an hour, with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher. We discussed a broad range of current issues in Anglo-Irish relations and reviewed the operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We also noted that a great deal of useful work had been done at recent meetings of the Inter-governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>We reaffirmed our total commitment to the agreement and our intention to continue to work closely together in accordance with its terms.  We placed on record our full determination to defeat those who seek to advance political aims by violent means; and our intention to maintain, and further strengthen wherever possible, our wholehearted co-operation against terrorism, which has done and is doing so much damage and causing so much suffering to the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>The success of the Hanover Council is a tribute to the energy and dedication of the German Presidency in the person of Chancellor Kohl, Foreign Minister Genscher and their officials who used every opportunity to engender a new spirit in the Community and give it a new impetus.  The Council had the great advantage that it did not have before it controversial issues like quotas, prices, acreages and subsidies, which occupied so much time in previous Councils.  The Council was thus able to devote time to discussing social, cultural and related matters like the environment.  These discussions were interesting, valuable and stimulating and there was a surprising degree of unanimity in regard to them and on the kind of Europe we would all like to see emerging.  I joined with every other participant in congratulating the German Presidency on the outstanding <Col N="2427" /> success of their work and the way in which they had carried through the onerous responsibilities at this and at every other Council during their period of office.</P>
    <P>As we adjourn for the Summer recess, I am in a position to report to the House that progress is being made.  The difficulties and challenges are being faced. Our programme is on course.  But a lot of steady, unremitting work is still needed, until we can put our difficulties safely behind us.  We must sustain what we are doing, not allow ourselves to be distracted from our goal.  The result should be a wider and improved level of prosperity and security, and a wide range and an adequate level of opportunities at home for young people coming out of school and college in a few year's time. That is our objective for the nineties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard the Minister for the Environment, a long shadow for the Taoiseach, claiming credit on behalf of the Government for getting the country's finances into order.  The Government have been saying that they have got firm control of public spending, that they have reduced the current budget deficit and that they have significantly reduced the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  It is true that we have seen improvements in all of those areas and that the trends are all in the right direction.  These factors together with changes in prices, exchange rates and interest rates in the world around us have allowed interest rates and inflation here to continue on a downward path. We must all hope that those trends continue and not alone must we hope that but we must also ensure that our actions here reinforce that process rather than hinder it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ask ourselves whether the Government are entitled to much credit for having brought about this situation and the answer, quite plainly, is no.  This Government have been following a path which was clearly set out for them and from which this House would quite <Col N="2428" /> simply not allow them to deviate.  Listening to the speech read by the Minister for the Environment, which sounded just as incongruous from the Minister for the Environment as it would from the Taoiseach, I was struck by a number of the claims made and the number of resounding statements made about economic policy.  For example, the Minister for the Environment said:</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a major reduction in public expenditure would be too deflationary was completely debunked last year when we achieved the highest economic growth for a decade of up to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is a statement which would take a good deal of analysis and which would lose much of its shine as the analysis is gone through but I wonder would we ever have heard the Minister for the Environment making a statement of that kind in the period between December 1982 and February 1987.  I do not think so. Certainly all that I heard from the Minister for the Environment and the Taoiseach during that period would indicate that they could never come to make a statement like that.  Indeed, during that period any reduction in expenditure or any measure to improve the efficiency of expenditure, which the Government are now taking credit for here, was regarded as another evil step, another turn of the screw and another dose of deflation which was to be resisted at all costs.  Now it seems that sensible policies are at last getting some kind of a welcome on the part of the Government and being brought out in this House as being things that would indicate how well the Government are doing but, as I have said, they do not deserve credit for any of that because there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that if the present Government did not find themselves as a minority Government they would not be taking the view of economic policy they are now taking.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal which was well prepared for the Government when they took office.  When they came into office <Col N="2429" /> in 1987, for example, the Exchequer borrowing requirement had been brought down from the 23 per cent of GNP which Fianna Fáil policies in 1982 threatened to bring about to 10 per cent, in other words three quarters of the adjustment down to the level of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, which the Minister has said is required, was already done at that stage. As I have said, it is very hard to believe that the Government were they free from the constraints which now surround them as a minority Government would follow the line they have taken during the past 15 months with any conviction or determination.</P>
    <P>On the indications that are available up to now, tomorrow the Government will be claiming credit for doing even better than forecast on the financial side. Rumours, emanating from I do not know where, have it that revenue has exceeded expectation by about £100 million, or perhaps even more at this stage of the year and expenditure is said to be on target.  I should like to warn the Government about the dangers of complacency on these issues.  We are half-way through the year.  Substantial changes could still come about and in spite of the very optimistic gloss put on the economic situation by the Minister, I am not at all convinced that we are going to see in the second half of the year any boom in the level of consumer expenditure or any continuing source of revenue buoyancy, one of the all-time favourite boltholes of Fianna Fáil Governments when they find themselves in difficulty.  I would counsel the Government to approach all of that with a certain amount of caution.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it seems that a good deal of the improvement on the revenue side comes from once-off factors which will not bring about the same improvement in 1989.  Much of the improvement on the revenue side, for example, can be traced back to measures which we took in Government in the budget and in the Finance Act, 1986, in relation to the process of tax collection.  Indeed, whatever improvement on the expenditure side is being claimed as a result of actions going <Col N="2430" /> on to reduce the level of fraud in social welfare again can be traced back to actions which were initiated in 1986.  I suppose, not to be too carping about it and to be generous about it, I would have to say that the Government at least deserve credit for having the good sense to follow on the tracks which were laid out for them there but I am not at all convinced that they deserve much credit for inventiveness or new thinking in their stewardship of economic policy up to now.</P>
    <P>The signs are all there in the speech which the Minister has just read out that there is not any real preparedness on the Government's part to think creatively and constructively about economic policy.  When we look at the real economy outside of the figures, we see how little credit the Government really deserve, with 250,000 people out of work we have the highest unemployment rate in the European Community, emigration continues and so far as we can see it is continuing at an accelerating pace.</P>
    <P>Surely we would have been entitled to expect that a party who in Opposition said so much, so often and so loudly about lower levels of unemployment and lower levels of emigration would have applied themselves with some energy and imagination to tackling these problems.  There is no evidence of this.  On the contrary there has been absolute immobility and a total unwillingness to look at any of the creative and constructive ways in which these problems could be addressed within the framework of our current financial constraints.</P>
    <P>The Government have not showed the slightest understanding of the need for tax reform.  They have shown not the slightest understanding of the role which a well thought-out process of tax reform could play in increasing employment and expanding economic activity.  Indeed, only today it has been reported that the Government &mdash; and it must be for the third or fourth time during the past 12 months &mdash; have decided against the idea of a property tax and delivered another rebuff to the unfortunate Minister who is sitting on the other side of the House. <Col N="2431" /> That is one potential component of a real tax reform package but so far the Government have failed to make any decisions on the adaptation of our tax system to favour employment and expansion.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech showed just how bare the Fianna Fáil cupboard is and how little they understand about tax reform when he said:</P>
    <P>It is false to suggest that massive income tax cuts, the feasibility and financing of which are entirely unexplained, are the key to recovery.  I am frankly surprised after all the experiences of the last fifteen years that anyone should be unrealistic enough to suggest that we award ourselves massive tax cuts before we have earned them, and that we can do in one year what it has taken others ten years to achieve.</P>
    <P>What he said is actually passing sensible but it has nothing to do with the tax reform that is now being proposed by my party, nor has it anything to do with proposals which have been made by the Labour Party nor, I understand, has it anything to do with proposals that might be about to be made by the Progressive Democrats, if they ever get around to publishing them.  That is not what tax reform is about.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say in his speech &mdash; and it was either he or a colleague of his who quoted me on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; one night in this regard &mdash; that all the things he had set out &ldquo;...was also the position of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Minister for Finance&rdquo; and he went on to quote me:</P>
    <P>In the 1984 Budget he stated: &ldquo;However desirable it might be to reduce taxation, this cannot be done on a significant scale, if at all, until current expenditure is reduced and the current budget deficit eliminated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very well chosen quotation if one is talking about proposals to reduce overall taxation but, with the greatest possible respect to the original author of <Col N="2432" /> the quotation, it is totally irrelevant when we are talking about tax reform of the kind that my party are promoting and which other parties in the House seem to be looking at.  What we are talking about is not a reduction in the overall burden of taxation but a sensible rearrangement of that burden so that that tax burden does not create unnecessary obstacles to employment and does not unnecessarily demotivate people from working.  The Government have completely failed to understand that is what we are talking about and that is the kind of process that is going to lead in the short term to the kind of improvements in employment that we want to bring about.</P>
    <P>Further on in his speech the Minister gave another view on taxation when he said:</P>
    <P>We are determined to create a situation in which we will actually be able to reduce tax levels.  We are convinced that the taxpayers of this country will benefit infinitely more from a real reduction in the tax they pay on the basis of general economic and financial progress, than from mere manoeuvring of the figures within the restricted confines of the same heavy and unsustainable total burden.</P>
    <P>That shows an appalling inability to understand that there are choices in tax policy, ways in which we can collect the same total of tax revenue without the stultifying effect on employment that we see and without the demotivating effects of high marginal tax rates on the work of the ordinary individual and on the readiness of employers to hire more people to do their work.  The Government will have to change their minds about this and start thinking creatively about changing the way we run our taxation system.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of tax reform I find very worrying.  It is within the last few days only that the Taoiseach has shown any readiness to address the issue of indirect tax harmonisation within the EC, a process which, if properly carried through, could produce substantial benefits for this country in the medium <Col N="2433" /> term.  Towards the end of the script there is what is, so far, the longest statement that the Taoiseach has made about this issue, one paragraph consisting of eight lines in which he says:</P>
    <P>At the Council I raised the two aspects of the proposals for the completion of the market which are of particular concern to us.  The first is the proposal for the harmonisation of taxes within the Community....</P>
    <P>Mind you, the Taoiseach has not seen fit to tell us what happened as a result of his having raised this issue at the Council. Was there any debate on the issue?  Was there any understanding of the issue? Was there any attempt on the part of the Taoiseach to draw the attention of the Council to the provisions of the Single European Act which quite deliberately make decisions on indirect tax harmonisation, decisions that require unanimity in the Council, so that member states &mdash; and we are not the only member state &mdash; that would experience difficulties in the short term with reducing levels of indirect taxes, could be assisted in the short term to cope with that problem and help themselves and the remainder of the Community to reap the benefits of tax harmonisation.  It is a pity that the Taoiseach, in preparing this text, did not tell us a bit more about the reaction of the Heads of other Governments at the Council to his raising this problem.</P>
    <P>Mind you, it is not the only area about which there is absolutely no information or follow-through in the Taoiseach's comments about what passed at the European Council.  I shall revert to that topic in a moment because it is one about which I believe the Government have simply not got the message or are not even thinking about what it is possible to do even in the short term.</P>
    <P>In other areas the Government have acted in ways which have militated directly against the welfare of a great many people in our community.  They have adopted very much a stop/go approach to education and the whole issue of teacher numbers.  That has <Col N="2434" /> caused unnecessary alarm, confusion and worry in primary and second level education. I find it alarming &mdash; not too strong a word to use &mdash; to discover that the principals of vocational schools all around the country are even today unable to plan for the running of their schools in the autumn.</P>
    <P>We can see the same kind of stop/go approach in agriculture, where there is a particularly bad example of it.  In 1987 this Government abolished a perfectly sensible and useful scheme we had introduced to assist young farmers to take over family farms, set themselves up in business, improve the style of farming and the age profile of our active farming population.  The reintroduction of that scheme was announced in this year's budget.  Now we find that the scheme means nothing at all because no funds have been allocated to this programme. We have now large numbers of young farmers all around the country who applied under the provisions of the scheme in 1986; were told it was abolished in 1987; were told in 1988 that the scheme is back in operation.  Now they are told: yes, the scheme is in operation all right but you cannot get the grant because we did not allocate any money for it.  In God's name is that any way to run any kind of policy?</P>
    <P>This kind of stop/go approach shows an utter lack of planning of expenditure in spite of some very sophisticated and honeyed words here about the way the whole process of shaping the Estimates is being undertaken by this Government. I shall revert to that in a moment.  We see no evidence of it in the actual running of public expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>All of those difficulties result from the fact, as far as I can see, that this Government are still mesmerised by their conversion to financial responsibility.  It seems the shock of that conversion is preventing them from thinking creatively, from seeking ways within the present financial constraints &mdash;<Col N="2435" /> about which there is no disagreement &mdash; to alter our tax, support and expenditure systems in various sectors so as to produce real and lasting extra employment.</P>
      <P>Towards the beginning of the script we were treated to a description of comprehensive public expenditure reviews.  It is being suggested here that a properly focused and directed effort to review public expenditure leads to better results, a proposition with which I would agree, but I do not believe a word of what is said here.  We are not getting those results because we are not seeing, in the balance of public expenditure, the kind of deliberate tailoring of expenditure to bring about the results we want.</P>
      <P>We see the same stop/go approach in relation to roads policy.  I suppose the Minister was speaking with some particular knowledge of this when he dealt with the importance of recognising the fact that our arterial roads system is a severe trading impediment to our economy. Again, everything said here is actually very sensible but what have they been doing about it?  The record of the Fianna Fáil Party is really remarkable in relation to roads policy.  For example, a previous Fianna Fáil Government abandoned their own road policy put together in 1980.  The present Fianna Fáil Government abandoned our roads policy in 1987 and 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now this Government, having abandoned one of their own roads policies and the one that was in place when they assumed office &mdash; having reduced expenditure on roads in 1987 and 1988 &mdash; are making a virtue of setting up a national roads authority.  The Minister for the Environment, no less, is telling us how important it is that we direct our expenditure on roads.  I would have to say that the Minister is welcome to the club; it is nice to note that he has come on board after all this time but it is criminal that he should have spent the best part of 18 months doing exactly the opposite of what is recommended in this speech.  It is a shame that we have had to go through two budgets that have completely derouted <Col N="2436" /> roads policy before the Government would get to the point of taking and kind of a sensible decision in this matter.</P>

      <P>We come along then and look at the position of the semi-State companies.  There is a long paragraph in the script dealing with the very successful results a number of semi-State companies have had in the last year.  I am very glad to note that there has been a sustained improvement in the performance of semi-State companies.  We are now seeing the benefit of reforms which we introduced in Government in the whole management structure of semi-State companies, in the financial targets they are given, reforms which we introduced which were opposed every step of the way by the Fianna Fáil Party at the time, opposed they said, as constituting interference with the way semi-State companies are run; opposed, they claimed, because they represented an attempt by the Government to run them directly whereas, in fact, what we were doing was to make it clear that, as long as semi-State companies adopted a more commercial approach to their tasks, they would have the freedom to respond to the market opportunities open to them.  I am very glad to note that the measures we put in place are having the effect intended.  I hope the Government have the wit to leave them alone and let them get on with the job in the way we set it up for them.</P>
      <P>There is a certain lack of reality about what the Minister said about agriculture and fisheries.  For example, the Minister had this to say in the course of his remarks:</P>
      <P>There is significant expansion and investment in the sea-fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I must ask where the Minister sees that.</P>

      <P>In fact the difficulty we have with our fishing industry at present is that it is gradually being strangled by a series of restrictions and regulations that take no account whatsoever of the fact that just off our shores there lie substantial stocks of non-quota fish which our fishing industry is now being prevented from exploiting by the operation of Community regulations.  We have the Minister saying there is significant expansion in investment in the sea fishing industry. A good deal more thought should be given to the preparation of such texts as these, so that we do not see that kind of howler being perpetrated on this House.</P>

      <P>We also find some very rosy things being said about agriculture. In his comments on the European Council, the Taoiseach, speaking through the mellifluous voice of the Minister for the Environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;attributed some of the success of the Hanover Council as follows:</P>
      <P>The Council had the great advantage that it did not have before it controversial issues like quotas, prices, acreages and subsidies, which occupied so much time in previous Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be grand if all those problems <Col N="2438" /> had been solved, but while the European Council was enjoying itself not having all these issues before it, what was happening? Agreements that everybody thought had been concluded in relation to agricultural prices were being reopened. The Council apparently thought that this was not a matter that it should concern itself with, whereas it should have been giving very clear directions as to how to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>From our point of view, I find it very sad to look at the spectacle of a country other than ours trying to get the whole monetary compensatory amount issue sorted out without any apparent backing from our Minister for Agriculture.  Let me make this very clear and let it not be clouded over by any kind of smokescreen run either by the Commission or by other member states.  If we are really serious about unifying the internal market in the Community, that must apply in agriculture as much as anywhere else.  I would like to see, somewhere in the Government's activities, the simple proposal being made that the 1992 enterprise must apply to agriculture and that we want to see the end of all positive and negative MCAs by 1992, at the latest.  There have been enough occasions in the past &mdash; the Minister for Finance will agree with me on that &mdash; when we have arrived at informal agreements or gentlemen's agreements that promised to take all these things out of the system in the space of two or three years.  I want to see that being included in this Government's approach now to 1992.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the awareness programme that the Government are going to launch.  I am glad to see that there is a little more in what the Taoiseach has said, through the mouth of the Minister for the Environment, about this programme. However, I am far from being happy that the Government have really realised the full extent of what is required there.  I am bound to say, without any disrespect to any of the people who will be in the National Concert Hall on 4 July to address that assembled gathering of <Col N="2439" /> 500 people, or any of those who will be there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I say very plainly that high profile cosmetic events such as that are not going to help.  Again, without the slightest disrespect to people who will be present there, what is going to happen? We will find that the managing directors of substantial companies will spend their day in the National Concert Hall listening to the various speakers and on the following morning will say to their secreatries &ldquo;Send that down to the marketing department; send that down to the transport department&rdquo;.  The people in the marketing and the transport departments will say: &ldquo;More paperwork coming down from headquarters.  I wish he would stay at home or in the office and not go to these conferences&rdquo; and nothing will be done about it.  What is required is the development of an appreciation at the level of every individual enterprise of how things will change in the marketplace between now and 1992.  Each enterprise would thus have the opportunity, and indeed the information, to change itself in order to take advantage of the benefits and to gear itself to meet the extra competition we will meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a great many changes. We will see a very substantial, radical simplification in the amount of documentation required to move goods. Exporters will find that they will have access to a wider range of cheaper transport services.  Transport operators will find they have access to a wider market but that they will have to deal with more competition.  Manufacturers will find, as that process goes through, that where their manufacturing products have to meet quality or safety standards of any kind there is only one set of standards that they will have to meet, one Community set of standards instead of a whole series of different national standards. Financial services will change very substantially. That market, too, should widen and the users of financial services <Col N="2440" /> will have access to a much greater variety of services.</P>
    <P>There are many more changes.  In some cases firms that are not now involved in exporting will find that exporting now becomes a real prospect for them as public markets are opened up in other countries.  Companies that are limited to national markets by the segmentation of access to public purchases will find that markets in other countries will open up to which they can have access in a way that they do not now have.  We will find a great deal of extra competition in our market.  All those things must be examined in detail at the level of every individual firm.  We will not prepare that process and carry it through successfully by having a committee of Ministers and Secretaries of Departments.  No matter how hard they work, no matter how well motivated they are, or how expert at their jobs &mdash; I am not criticising them at all &mdash; they simply do not have access to the practical knowledge of all these effects on firms which is needed in order to ensure that we carry through the process successfully.  I would urge the Government &mdash; and the Taoiseach has made something of a virtue of private sector involvement in his speech today in the tourism and in some other areas &mdash; to follow the logic of that through to this enterprise in relation to 1992.  It is only in that way that real, practical experience and knowledge will be brought to bear on the process that we must go through between now and 1992.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to start thinking more positively, more constructively, about the process of indirect tax harmonisation in the country.  The Taoiseach has made three references to this that I can remember in the past couple of months, two in the past few days.  He made one very gloomy reference to it as was reported in the newspapers after the European Council; he made another statement on it here.  He is still peddling the idea that the only way this process will come about is in one lump.  He should now be taking a much more realistic view than that.  He should be saying that the process will take place over a period of <Col N="2441" /> years and he should be beginning to plan here for the kind of result that we want to get out of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of objectives will be set in relation to the levels of excise duties.  It is a very complex area and there are wide variations between member states in relation to excise duties on tobacco, petrol and other relevant areas.  There is obviously a great body of information on what the levels are in the other member states of the Community. We should be looking at the kind of targets that we would take to be realistic in a Community market that is properly unified.  We know what the Commission's proposals are in relation to value added tax.  They are proposing a low rate of from 4 to 9 per cent and a high rate of from 12 to 18 per cent.  It has been estimated that a single rate of around 13 per cent would produce the same revenue as we get out of our system here.</P>
    <P>I have not seen any estimation of the kind of revenue that would be produced by a system based on the two rates in the bands which the Commission has proposed but there is ample room in that system to produce the kind of overall revenue that we now get from VAT and which we will continue to need. However, the Government must form their own idea of reasonable targets at which we should aim and then put themselves in a position where they can talk to the other member states in a concrete way about how we will bring that about over a period.  It will not be done by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance saying that it will cost £470 million in the first year and £300 million or so every year after that.  That is cop-out politics and not the way to plan the future development of a tax system or how to plan our involvement in this major enterprise in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach has given us some credit in relation to the legislative programme during this session.  I am very satisfied and happy that my party helped to bring to fruition a number of important Bills.  The Status of Children Act is now law, the Adoption Act has been referred to the Supreme Court &mdash; a decision with <Col N="2442" /> which I thoroughly agree &mdash; and the Intoxicating Liquor Act is also law.  All these measures were initiated by my party and we have brought about a major improvement in the legislation relating to radio and television compared with the original proposal which the Minister for Communications made.  That has been extremely useful and I am happy that my party played a solid and constructive role in bringing legislation forward and having it examined in this House and the Seanad with the kind of changes that make it directly relevant to the concerns of our people.</P>
    <P>I could comment on the Minister's statement about Údarás na Gaeltachta but my colleague, Deputy Kenny, will deal with that later on.  I was appalled yesterday that the Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht said that Údarás na Gaeltachta knew at the beginning of the year how much money they had to spend and that it was too bad if they had now run out of money.  He suggested that they should have slowed down their operations as if Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; and the IDA &mdash; can press a switch and produce a new industry.  It is unacceptable and no way to approach industrial development in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>There is no indication of the contents of the Taoiseach's discussion with Mrs. Thatcher on the last occasion but, as the Taoiseach said, the value of meetings like that is that they are confidential and not reported outside.  However, I should like the Government to make a statement that they are not satisfied with the most extraordinary statement issued yesterday by the Police Authority in Northern Ireland concerning the Stalker-Sampson affair.  My colleague, Deputy Barry, will deal with this in more detail later on. That statement seems to have been issued by a group of people who did not really want to get involved in the issues and handled it with the tips of their fingers or it is a signal that the Police Authority are not all that happy with what they found. Otherwise, why would a body of that kind go out of their way to say that a decision had been taken by a majority of <Col N="2443" /> one?  The Government should indicate very clearly today that they will follow this matter up and if we are to believe the statement in the Taoiseach's speech that he and the Government are fully committed to the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; I hope that is the case &mdash; the mechanisms and the structures of that Agreement should be used properly to indicate very clearly that we continue to be very worried by the Stalker-Sampson affair.</P>
    <P>It is reported that during the course of the European Council meeting, the new reappointed President of the Commission, Jacques Delors &mdash; I congratulate him on his reappointment &mdash; interviewed the Taoiseach at some length about the appointment of an Irish Commissioner.  I have not spoken on that subject in public &mdash; deliberately &mdash; although I have spoken to many people in private and there is no doubt about my views.  I strongly make the point to the Taoiseach that whoever the next Irish Commissioner will be, it is essential that that person be designated immediately.  The process of allocating portfolios &mdash; the Minister need not smile &mdash; is already under way and anybody who has seen that process, even from the sidelines, will know that the earlier you get involved the greater the chances are that you will come out at the end of the process with a satisfactory result.  I urge &mdash; even demand &mdash; that the Taoiseach should do the sensible thing and make the nomination immediately.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for the Environment to convey my personal good wishes for a speedy recovery to physical health to the Taoiseach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adjournment debate provides a timely opportunity for the House to ask itself a number of fundamental questions about how it orders our business, discusses various issues of the day and deals with legislation and other issues which come before us.  It is hardly surprising that so many members of the public and <Col N="2444" /> commentators question the relevance of this House and its procedures.  The controversy in recent months over the rod licence dispute is a case in point. Throughout recent weeks and months, when public debate was raging on this issue between angling and tourist interests, the Government and various honest brokers who were trying to act in the general public interest, Dáil Deputies were virtually gagged by an arbitrary <i>sub judice</i> rule which applies when it suits the Government but is ignored in other cases when the Government so wish.</P>
    <P>It does the standing of this House no good in the eyes of the public to find that matters of significant public interest can be widely discussed outside its confines while, inside, those whose function it is within our democracy to represent the people and to make law, find themselves shut off from so many issues of vital national concern.  Nor are these observations confined to the rod licence problem alone or to such a specific area as the <i>sub judice</i> rule, it is becoming endemic throughout the parliamentary system. Yesterday we discovered that Deputies can no longer speak on a motion which proposes to prevent debate and the question is likely to arise, before too long, of whether this House is needed in respect of certain matters other than to read out an Order of Business of agreed motions and other measures.</P>
    <P>Not long after its establishment in the early seventies the ESRI commissioned and published a detailed series of reports on public expenditure in the Republic. These reports identified key deficiencies in how we approached the task of managing public affairs especially as it related to public spending.  It is interesting to note that as far back as 15 years ago one of the key deficiencies then identified, and equally self-evident now, was the failure of Dáil Éireann to approach the annual task in relation to departmental estimates in any kind of strategic or meaningful way.  The estimates debates each year, as they have been in recent weeks, are packed into a very short period where at one level, literally millions of pounds per minute are nodded <Col N="2445" /> through with the consent of the House. There is no real examination of whether the expenditure is wise or is likely to provide value for money.  Indeed, before it is debated most of the money is already spent.  Most divisions against estimates are held because too little is being spent rather than too much.  There is a crying need for a parliamentary reform.  It should begin in this House with the establishment of a proper committee system where the Government can continue to govern but where a review of their decisions particularly in areas as vital as public expenditure, can be undertaken, and their proposals probed in detail and in an expert way at a committee table, and where lessons can be learned and applied so that the worst mistakes of the past can be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>All of the institutional conditions which allowed us to engage in run-away public spending for virtually two decades still exist.  It is one of the great tragedies, as we now try to come to grips with the economic crisis that has crept up on us by increments over the years, that within our institutions we have not yet learned the most fundamental and basic lesson, that the Dáil has ultimate responsibility. Governments are allowed treat the Dáil as a mere rubber stamp when in constitutional theory it is supreme.  In order to fulfil our function properly and in order to fulfil the mandate the people gave us, it is necessary that major reform takes place within the Dáil in terms of attitudes, procedures and perspectives.</P>
    <P>It must appear a great farce to members of the public, as it does to many of us in this House, that we find ourselves in a position where Governments apparently feel entitled to constantly force measures through the Dáil on the basis of guillotine debates or even of no debate at all.  Often the net result of this guillotine process is a totally inadequate consideration of serious and fundamental changes in the law which eventually end up in a public outcry such as that about the rod licence debate, where the House never had the opportunity to adequately consider the measure when it was raised. Still, we are in recess for over five months <Col N="2446" /> of the year, and even when we are sitting we normally sit for only three days each week.  The irony and the paradox of this is that other debates are held in this House, such as that after the budget each year where days and weeks are wasted to no purpose.</P>
    <P>There are many interesting parliamentary models from which we could learn.  It might be useful to look at one other parliament in which we fully participate and where several former Members of this House now serve, and that is the European Parliament.  The European Parliament operates on the basis of a powerful and substantial committee system.  Members of the European Parliament in terms of plenary session in the parliament find themselves confined to extraordinarily short speaking times.  The combination of the ability to make lengthy and reasoned contributions in committee, and the need for shorter and more incisive comments in plenary sessions is a model that we could look to. That will be blocked here however, as long as Government is allowed to take precedence over parliament.  We have an ineffective division of powers here. Indeed, looking to the European Parliament for a model of greater parliamentary effectiveness in terms of procedure, is not the only thing that this House should look to Europe for.</P>
    <P>The importance and relevance of the European Community has taken on a whole new emphasis for this country with the approach of the European internal market in 1992.  It is a measure of the failure of this Government to inform and prepare the country for the changes which will take place in 1992, that that date has now become synonomous in the public mind with virtually nothing except the negative aspects of tax harmonisation. The harmonisation is an issue of great importance to this country. It would be foolish to ignore its seriousness or wish away the potential detrimental aspects of it.  It is equally wrong to focus on nothing but these aspects and that is what the Government seem to be doing.  One of the problems with which we are faced in the debate on 1992 is the <Col N="2447" /> lack of a detailed White Paper from the Government on the specific benefits and costs which the internal market will bring for this country.  One result of this is that there are differing opinions about the likely costs which tax harmonisation will entail.  The Government have put forward a figure of about £470 million.  Even if the figure is as high as the Government claim, they have neglected to establish just how much of this would flow back to the Exchequer from taxes on higher consumer spending.  They have also distanced this cost from the extra £300 million which the country will receive now from the increased structural funds, and they have ignored the fiscal benefits which an increasingly competitive economy would bring.</P>
    <P>The spectacle of the Government talking about preparing the country for the internal market in 1992, when they are not even bothered to objectively specify the Exchequer results of this move is a complete and utter farce.  If the Government do not know in detail the net implications for the public purse, how can they genuinely seek to give a lead to private and public industry and commerce in what is on the most trade dependent economies in Europe?  The sad truth is that the Government have not yet worked out where they are going and have ignored the call which the Progressive Democrats have consistently made for a White Paper which not only covers this neglected area but which also extends into a detailed sector by sector analysis of the possibilities and the threats posed by the 1992 agenda.  This is a most glaring failure, the unfortunate consequences of which will come home to roost in time.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a sound and coherent approach to the issue.  The approach by the Government is paradoxical.  On the one hand the Government have tried to sell the internal market to industrialists and business people as a great challenge and a great opportunity.  For themselves they have covered it in negative rhetoric about the losses to their finances and of how difficult it will make things for them. <Col N="2448" /> For business people they have emphasised the need to be prepared but for the politicians they have only dealt with it on a hastily prepared and badly serviced one day debate in this House.</P>
    <P>The high profile public relations launch proposed for next Monday is not an adequate substitute for the rigorous analysis this party have called for and which is so obviously necessary.  There still remains the unfortunate echo of the last and similar great bout of public relations activity some years ago, when leaders of industry and commerce, of farming and of trade unions were summoned to attend a press conference where a Government who were then reeling back from reality, sought to suggest that they were building on it.</P>
    <P>Good public relations is a poor substitute for good analysis.  The danger with the amount of attention which the Government are placing on the downside of the exercise is that it will become a self-fulfilling prophesy.  If we manage to convince ourselves that the internal market is about nothing but negatives, then inevitably that is all it will be for us. We will miss out on enormous opportunities. Given that Ireland's development needs are so much more pressing than many of the continental European members of the European Community, our urgency in tackling these issues should be all the greater.  Yet, the evidence stubbornly shows that we are lagging well behind many of our partners.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Community, company mergers aimed at broadening geographical spread, reducing inefficiencies and creating larger more competitive companies are well under way.  This country must not be left behind in this area and the Government should be playing their part.  Government agencies should be helping Irish companies to improve their positions through mergers, joint ventures or other arrangements with business partners both in this country and in Europe.</P>
    <P>The benefits of privatisation should also be looked at in this light and in this context.  Most State companies would surely benefit from being given the <Col N="2449" /> opportunity to raise private capital to finance their costly strategies over the coming years.  I heartily welcome the views of Mr. Michael Smurfit in regard to the future of Telecom Éireann.  He is right and everyone knows he is, whether or not they agree in public.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not want to ignore the implications of tax harmonisation. The correct strategy is to back harmonisation with some key features. For example, I believe we have a strong case against the proposed reductions in VAT rates on items such as tobacco and alcohol on the basis of health arguments.  The most sensitive aspect of this issue is the question of VAT on food. It is ridiculous to suggest that if VAT is imposed on food it need be anywhere near the rate of 14 per cent which has been mentioned.  The harmonisation proposals suggest two bands of VAT.  If it has to be introduced on food there would be no reason to impose it at a higher rate than 4 per cent.  Social welfare recipients should be fully compensated.  The measure does not have to be introduced all at once but could be done gradually over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Indeed, gradual movement on several fronts should be part of our planned path towards 1992.  None of us in this House is a stranger to the appalling trade distortions which have occurred throughout our Border counties as a result of tax differentials and exchange rate changes. Uniquely, Northern Ireland is the only part of the European Community with which we share a land border.  For the sake of removing trade distortions and to encourage business and commercial life from Dundalk right across to Donegal, we owe it to our Border traders to dismantle the fiscal borders between North and South in terms of indirect taxation through progressively approximating our tax rates in the first instance with those prevailing in the United Kingdom and then follow by approximating towards the target European Community levels.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in this context the decision of the Hanover Summit to set up a committee of experts to examine possible moves towards greater monetary <Col N="2450" /> integration in the Community.  Since exchange rate fluctuations can be no less a factor than tax differentials in distorting trade, from an Irish point of view no effort should be spared in encouraging these tentative moves.  It now seems most unlikely that Britain will join the European Monetary System in the foreseeable future as a result of the fairly implacable opposition to that notion of the British Prime Minister.  I presume we will have to operate now in that knowledge.  It may not be all that damaging from the point of view of the European Monetary System not to have within it a currency which is particularly volatile and the European currency which is most used by non-European countries and traders.</P>
    <P>There is surely no richer symbol of forging unity of purpose, despite immense obstacles, than the European Communities.  After the war Europe, after decades and even centuries of appalling carnage and strife, put all that behind it by dedicating itself to moving towards a United States of Europe.  On this sadly divided island, where in the pursuit of an arid territorial claim there are, incredibly, some people mad enough and evil enough to plant bombs on a school bus, there is surely no more inspiring example than the enduring peace which the complex institutions of the European Communities have helped to forge.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement of three years ago, now due for review, represented the first step in a complex process of unlocking the decades and even centuries of the Unionists &ldquo;no surrender, not an inch,&rdquo; mentality, that had frozen over so hard as to constitute what up to that time seemed like a permanent veto on any political process or any political movement.  The winds of change, however tentative, are now blowing through the Unionist community of Northern Ireland.  It is the duty and the responsibility of every politician in this House to seek to grasp those opportunities now presented, to extend the hand of friendship to those whose instinct would normally have been to reject such overtures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2451" /> We must also ask ourselves why are these changes happening.  They are no accident.  They have resulted from the fundamental shift in relations between this country and Britain which has stemmed from the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The key contribution of this historic agreement has been its ability to create a dynamic climate for change.  It is hardly surprising that the agreement deeply annoyed Unionists, particularly since they were not consulted about it.  They were not consulted then because they would not have agreed to change but things have changed now.</P>
    <P>They would change more if the Government here put a position paper to the Unionists rather than just vague verbal invitations over the airwaves.  It must be confusing also for Unionists and, indeed for others, to see the ambivalence that is still, as recently as the last day or two, exhibited towards the IRA and its activities in some quarters in this part of the country.  Yesterday's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> reports a member of the National Executive of Fianna Fáil as holding a meeting with Mr. Gerry Adams who is well known as a spokesman for the Provisional IRA.  I quote part of the report as follows:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil councillor Michael Martin and Mr. Adams, in an exchange of views after the meeting, agreed that members of both Parties should meet together to consult on issues where they &ldquo;share basic views&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the IRA, Mr. Adams declared: &ldquo;In the IRA there are no careerists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish that things like that did not happen. I find it particularly difficult to understand that it could or should happen on the evening of the very day in which a bomb was placed in a school bus in County Tyrone by the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>For many months now the Progressive Democrats have called on the Taoiseach to set a date for the work towards a full summit meeting with the British Prime Minister in order to prepare the way for the full review of the operation of the <Col N="2452" /> agreement scheduled to take place by next November.  The agreement owed much in the first place to the interest and goodwill of the leaders of both Governments. It is vitally important that that goodwill and interest are preserved and strengthened and I believe a full summit meeting between the two leaders will play an important part in ensuring that.  Apart from this, the absence of such a summit has diminished the prospect of grasping fully the opportunities which the review of the agreement presents.  However, I must say to the Taoiseach and the Government that the very process which has led to signals of change must not be set to one side in advance of something more substantial being put in its place. The danger that a move such as this could take place exists because North and South on this island there are parties whose distaste for the agreement more than adequately rivals their historic antagonisms towards each other in the past.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the economy. As the party who spearheaded the political campaign for the need to cut our run-away public expenditure and tackle our debt crisis, the Progressive Democrats welcome the obvious progress which has been made on that front.  In fact, we urge the Government to continue down this road which will ultimately lead to a sustainable standard of living of a nation as a whole.  We welcome the Government's enormous change of mind in the last 18 months which has enabled the progress that has now commenced to take place.  However, our economic problems are so complex and exist on so many fronts that even the zeal of a convert in tackling one set of problems on one front is an inadequate policy response in the light of our current circumstances. Looking back over the last 12 months we can acknowledge the will that has been shown to slow down the headlong rush towards economic disaster which the last Coalition Government seemed powerless to avert.</P>
    <P>We have, however, to be critical of <Col N="2453" /> what appeared to be the lack of consideration and even the lack of cost effectiveness of some of the measures in cost cutting that have been put into effect.  We have to beware of the inbuilt tendency towards resorting to the easy option in reducing expenditure which has been to concentrate on curtailing spending on the capital side.  The coming months will be the real test.  It is easy enough to recognise the need to achieve a broad percentage reduction in the level of current expenditure.  The test of the Government's efficiency will be shown by the way they set about reducing the level of recurring annual expenditure without causing irreparable damage to the delicate fabric of the economy while at the same time helping to create an environment in which real economic growth can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the need for real economic growth because for too long we have fooled ourselves by accepting that official statistics for sensitive national indicators are relevant to the growth in the nation's economy.  I regret to say that there are such significant distorting factors inherent in our balance of trade figures and our volume and value of production figures as to cause me great unease about relying on them to give a true picture of the condition of the economy.  These statistics are particularly distorted by the policy of the transfer pricing of goods and services within the sectors owned and controlled by multinational concerns.  On paper and according to our official statistics Cola essence is supposed to be more important in our economy than milk.  This, of course, is obvious and arrant nonsense.  Official statistics continue to show a theoretical growth in the economy while the levels of demand and employment continue to decrease.</P>
    <P>This country needs a growth in the numbers at work who produce real goods at real costs and which are sold at real prices.  Statistical growth does not necessarily produce real jobs.  There is a real need to recognise the inherent danger to the fabric of the economy if by accepting statistical growth as a measure of the health of the economy we permit and <Col N="2454" /> justify actions which cause real disemployment. It is the cost of the overheads that has to be reduced so that a larger proportion of availalbe revenue is directed towards efficient and increasing amounts of work in progress with more and more people engaged in the boiler-house of production and marketing.</P>
    <P>I would welcome policies that show recognition of the need to shift resources from administration into production and marketing.  The cut that will be welcomed by all is the cut that eliminates waste. The elimination of waste and inefficiency in our State apparatus can go a significant way towards achieving the level of reduction of State expenditure necessary for restoring order to the area of public finances.  The elimination of waste can free resources and reduce costs in the private sector, aiding competitiveness and contributing to growth.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments in recent times have used fuel and vehicles as a medium for tax gathering.  This has caused great distortion in the costs of every household and business in the country.  The element of tax levied on private and commercial vehicles and on the fuel to run them is nothing short of a disgrace.  It is hard to believe that the IR£ landed cost of petrol and oil at the refinery in Cork or at the port of arrival here in this country has gone down by nearly two thirds from the peak cost of 1981-82.  Every time the price of petrol goes down the tax is increased <i>pro rata.</i> Distanced as we are from the major markets of Europe, how can our industries hope to be competitive when the trucks we use cost up to 50 per cent more than our competitors' and the cars our managers and salesmen use cost 50 per cent more than their competitors?</P>
    <P>The real truth about our industrial performance, which reveals a much harsher set of realities, is the employment performance in Irish industry.  Last year 14,000 new industrial jobs came onstream but at the same time 20,000 jobs were lost in industry alone, resulting in an overall decline of 6,000 at work in Irish industry last year.  To this must be added the 7,000 net loss of jobs in the <Col N="2455" /> other sectors last year, resulting in a total of 13,000 fewer people at work than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The grim truth of statistics like this reveals the real picture about the Irish economy as ordinary men and women perceive it up and down this country. Talk by Government spokespersons of lower interest rates, lower inflation rates and booming exports cannot mask the truth that the Irish economy is one of the most stagnant in Europe.  The inflow of people registering as unemployed for the first time was 30 per cent greater this year than five years ago.  In plain English that says that people are finding it harder to get jobs now than then.  Emigration, the single most potent measure of the failure of our economic management at home, is the key factor.  With the declining number of people at work in Ireland, the apparent fall in unemployment can be explained only by people leaving in the hope of getting a job abroad rather than staying at home in despair.  The emigration we see today is in many respects the most serious we have known this century. It is less painful than previously. People can and do come home fairly frequently, but in economic terms emigration is disastrous.  The official figure of approximately 30,000 per year emigration is the net figure for emigration. Every year, even in the worst of times, between 10,000 and 20,000 people come back to Ireland on retirement or for other reasons.  Therefore, the number leaving annually at the moment, which is the figure that really counts, is between 40,000 and 50,000.  For a tiny country like this to suffer such an avoidable constant loss of population is tragic.  For a fertile country and temperate climate we have an extraordinarily low density of population. Uniquely in the world, our population today is 60 per cent of what it was 150 years ago.  We need numbers as never before.  Our consumer demand is 10 per cent lower in real terms than it was at the beginning of this decade but we are forcing out the consumers.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have consistently been worried about the alarming <Col N="2456" /> high level of long-term unemployment especially among those aged over 25.  This problem is now so deep rooted and endemic that it requires an urgent refocusing of all State resources.  There are well over 100,000 people whose enforced idleness through unemployment has now been suffered for a minimum of 12 months and more.  When you allow that many of these people are married and have dependants, I estimate that more than 300,000 people are condemned to suffer intolerably low standards of living with consequent problems in terms of health and morale.  As we have seen from the Combat Poverty Agency report this week, it is the children who, in circumstances like this, stand to lose the most.  Their grinding material poverty is surpassed only by the poverty of opportunity which blights their young lives.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will give every assistance and encouragement to the Government in any genuine and serious attempt they make to attack the problem of long term unemployment. The unemployment crisis which has bedevilled this country throughout the eighties has not been visited on us by some inevitable external fate.  The responsibility for much of what has been done, and in this decade much of what has been undone, in terms of economic performance inescapably belongs in this House.  What country in the world faced with rising unemployment in the early eighties would have, as we did, piled consistently more and more taxes on enterprise and on work?  How could you expect to find more people at work in an economy whose sorry boast is to have brought surtax to the masses where the average worker pays on income marginal rates of tax in excess of 65 per cent?  It is little wonder that demand has collapsed, that the economy is stagnant and that the climate for investment is so poor in an economy such as this.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the matter is compounded by news which came out today in the form of one of these interminable leaks.  In a country which has increased its total tax take from work in the last 20 years from 23 per cent to 46 per cent and <Col N="2457" /> reduced its tax take in the same period on capital, property and wealth from 16 per cent to 4 per cent, a decision has now been made that we should not have any form of property tax.  Therefore those at work will have to continue to bear a totally disproportionate amount of the tax burden, with its necessary consequences for enterprise and the emigration that stems from it.</P>
    <P>From the foundation of this party, I called for the radical reform of our taxation system with the aim of reducing income tax to a standard rate of 25 per cent, a top rate of 40 per cent, and eliminating employees' PRSI, which is just income tax anyway, irrespective of what they pay Mick Lally to say about it.  Radical tax reform cannot be postponed not only for these reasons but also because of the massive black economy which current tax rates have spawned.  It cannot wait because of the appalling social and economic damage being done to close on 250,000 unemployed and their families and the tens of thousands more who are emigrating in the hope of finding employment in other lands.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that you cannot create high levels of employment or a positive environment for investment in an economy where you cripple work and the work ethic through excessive taxation. It is the failure of the Government to grasp this nettle which represents their greatest failure in terms of policy and courage to date.  For a Government who have proved so adept at stealing and wearing other parties' policy clothes, the tax reform suit is one they should urgently add to their policy wardrobe.  We, in the Progressive Democrats, have a particular standing in calling on the Government to introduce a programme of radical tax reform.  Uniquely in this House, we are the party whose mandate from the electorate extends into this area.  From the foundation of the Progressive Democrats the need for radical tax reform as a means of tackling our unemployment crisis has been a fundamental tenet of our policy. Our credentials on this matter extend from our mandate, unlike so many other Johnny-come-latelys who have only <Col N="2458" /> recently converted to the tax reform course.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to an area which is of particular concern to the Progressive Democrats, namely, the environment. During this session of the Dáil we introduced a Private Members' Bill seeking to tackle the long standing scandal of unfinished housing estates and aiming to prevent unscrupulous developers from making hugely inflated gains at the public expense.  These reforms, which had been long overdue, were opposed by the Government with the usual promise that they had similar legislation in the course of preparation.  We have not seen that legislation and I do not know when we will, but the Progressive Democrats will hold the Government to that promise and expect to see that legislation very soon.</P>
    <P>It was extremely disturbing to read in recent days and weeks of continuous serious fish kills on our rivers reminiscent of last summer's appalling environmental calamity.  There is no excuse for any repeat performance this year.  Based on last year's unfortunate experience, the Government had been forewarned. Unfortunately, due to what is tantamount to Government neglect, this summer we are not yet forearmed. The existing Local Government (Water Pollution) Act was supposed to have been amended this session to incorporate major increases in the penalties for people convicted of causing pollution. This promised reform has not yet taken place.  By the time the House resumes, if early indications are anything to go by, enormous damage to our waterways will yet again have taken place.  Those responsible will yet again get away with little or no serious cost to themselves.</P>
    <P>By no means are farmers the only people involved.  We had the scandalous spectacle in the past week of Kildare County Council pumping raw sewage into the River Liffey at Leixlip, a few miles above Dublin.  The extraordinary thing about our water pollution laws is that it is the local authorities who are supposed to enforce the laws when in some cases they are themselves the chief culprits and the greatest polluters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2459" /> The level of public concern and awareness to all aspects of the environment has improved immeasurably over the past decade.  That concern is now being reflected by the leaders in agriculture and industry.  The time has come for politicians to respond to that concern and awareness by sustaining and underpinning it with appropriate legislation and with action rather than with words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We come now to the mid-term report of the Government, and in many ways this is the mid-term of this Government's term of office.  My assessment, and the assessment of many objective commentators, is that slowly but surely history will record that we have a Government of missed opportunities, a Government given <i>carte blanche</i> from the Opposition parties to bring about major radical innovative changes in the structure of government, in the structure of taxation and industrial incentives, but they have not done so.  We have massive emigration; one in every five of the labour force is out of work; we have low income and poverty affecting tens of thousands of families, yet, in this morning's contribution, read by the Minister for the Environment on behalf of the Taoiseach, there is no real facing up to the crisis &mdash; and there is a crisis.</P>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach a speedy recovery and a quick return to work.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done and the problems which face the country will not be solved by the Minister for the Environment coming in here and saying that this Government are building on confidence.  That has no impact on the reality of trying to bring this country out of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the prospect of 1992 integration which should be a huge spur to the introduction of radical policies.  We have relative stability in the rate of inflation, which is at its lowest for many years.  That stability should encourage the introduction of innovative policies. General interest rates are historically low and that, too, should stimulate major new Government programmes.  This is <Col N="2460" /> not happening.  We have the prospect of substantial increases in the Structural Funds of the EC which could be of very considerable benefit, yet we do not seem to be poised to avail of these resources, other than to absorb them into the general Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is in place but it has been eroded by the lack of confidence in the agreement on the part of the Government and the lack of determination to work the agreement day in, day out in the national interest, North and South, and to the betterment of Anglo-Irish relations.  I will deal with that matter later in my speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley's analysis of the economic position was impressive and I agree with his anlaysis of the crisis which exists.  Despite the changes which the Minister for Finance has brought about in terms of self-assessment, and the bringing of some self-employed people into the tax net, there have not been major changes in terms of revenue resources for the Exchequer.  They amount to no more than a regularisation of an aspect of our taxation system, which is still very regressive, extremely narrow, very non-distributive and open to substantial evasion.  We still have a very substantial cash black economy which is endemic and is running at the rate of at least 10 per cent of GNP.  In the Border area it is certainly around 15 per cent of GNP.  Recently I spoke to a person going on holidays who wanted to buy a Superser heater.  The shopkeeper asked whether he would pay by cash or by cheque, saying that the price in the former case would be £85 but £110 in the latter.  That is the kind of thing that goes on and it pinpoints the need to control the black economy. At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts the Central Statistics Office indicated that there were close on two million sheep in the country, but the Department of Agriculture were of the view that there were about 2.4 million sheep, on the basis of claims made.  No wonder there is an 11 per cent increase in sheep numbers according to the speech we heard this morning.  These are just <Col N="2461" /> some indications of the need for major change.</P>
    <P>The burden of lowering the current budget deficit and servicing our foreign debt is still being placed on the backs of those of relatively low income who are dependent on essential social and public services.  We see developing a two-tier health care system.  A health worker told me in Cork last Friday that on an annual basis there are more patients going through the private Bon Secours hospital in Cork than through the Regional hospital.  That is an indication of what is happening in just one city.  There has been a total transformation to a two-tier system which has been created by the manner in which the Government have implemented cuts in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's belief that the vital element in our present situation is confidence.  That is a meaningless phrase.  He went on to say that there is optimism everywhere.  I see no example of it.  I was at Dublin Airport last Monday morning seeing off some relatives on the Dublin-Boston flight.  I could not detect that optimism among the couple of hundred young people queuing up behind me on their way out of the country.  There has been a restoration of the old Irish wake as people are leaving at the rate of about 35,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the statement made by Deputy O'Malley that the labour force dropped last year by 14,000.  The statements made repeatedly by Fianna Fáil spokespersons in relation to employment and the creation of jobs do not reflect the reality on the ground.  In the first quarter of this year 7,400 redundancies were notified to the Department of Labour, which represents an annual rate of almost 30,000 redundancies.  Last year the total number of redundancies notified was 24,000.  Therefore, the projected figure for the end of 1988 will show an increase of 6,000 over 1987.  The statement by Fianna Fáil in relation to employment makes no reference to the fact that 9,000 jobs in the public sector will be discarded during the remainder of this year.  Three thousand have gone and 6,000 more are <Col N="2462" /> to go to the end of 1988.  These figures are frightening.</P>
    <P>I was totally unreceptive to the statement this morning by the Minister for the Environment when he spoke about the Public Capital Programme, the prospect of a road authority and further investment in general infrastructure.  The reality is that £200 million was taken out of the Public Capital Programme this year, creating no fewer than 2,000 further redundancies in the community at large. There is no reference at all to this entirely regressive policy in the statement on behalf of the Taoiseach here this morning.</P>
    <P>There must be an alternative to a policy that relies on the word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;, that tells PAYE workers they must wait until all the essential social welfare services have been dismantled to get a fair deal. The old attitude is that the Labour Party are a party who, somehow or another, are a purely defensive party, reacting against reductions in public expenditure.  We are preoccupied particularly about free enterprise, not just public enterprise but private sector enterprise also, which we want to promote and see developing.  We are in favour of increased industrial production on a fully competitive basis.  We have been singularly successful in improving Irish marketing expertise, particularly in regard to food production. We are totally committed to the growth of that expertise within our community.</P>
    <P>Our proposals, constructively put forward in recent weeks by the party Leader, Deputy Spring, bring forward the prospect of economic growth for the working people of this country, and we will work constructively in Dáil Éireann to bring this about.  We have major reservations about the approach of Fianna Fáil in this regard.  We consider the policy of public service redundancies to be ill-conceived and enormously costly in implementation; no less than £80 million is being spent this year which could have been more profitably spent within the framework of the Public Capital Programme. I would have hoped that the trade unions, rather than simply holding out their hands for lump sum payments, <Col N="2463" /> accelerated pensions and accelerated pay-offs, would have prevailed upon the Government to use the money more effectively, rather than opting for the soft option of voluntary redundancies at age 50 or 55.  The implementation of public service policies at the moment is a matter of profound regret to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment spoke about the growth in private sector housing activity.  This has not masked the unprecedented slump in the construction industry with tens of thousands of Irish construction workers working in the south of England because the Public Capital Programme in this country has been cut by £228 million, the single largest reduction in over 30 years.  Ten thousand construction jobs were lost because of that reduction.  It is a cynical exercise then for the Minister for the Environment to come in here and say he is going to have a national roads authority. There are no roads being built and none projected for 1988, and it looks as though that situation will continue into 1989. Some of the smaller developments, such as the Customs House Docks site, cannot produce more than a couple of hundred construction jobs.  I would therefore strongly urge the Government that in the setting up of a national roads authority at least £80 million or £90 million from the capital programme should be allocated because unquestionably the roads here are a major impediment to industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>I want to question the media hype from the Government that they are going about their work in a very decisive and determined way.  I do not accept that for one minute.  We have had a succession of monumental U-turns in and outside the Government since they came into office 18 months ago.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement will stand as the U-turn of all time. Fianna Fáil are going down in history and let us hope they do not take the Anglo-Irish Agreement down with them in the process.  There was a U-turn on extradition, and we know the monumental myth that arose by virtue of the indecision and the serious conflicts within the <Col N="2464" /> Cabinet on the implementation of the extradition conditions.  There have been a huge number of U-turns on the education front.  I do not know how the education Vote stands at the moment.  It is certainly out of kilter in many ways.  The U-turn on the famous Circular 20/87, the U-turn on the redundancies in the various teaching sectors, the U-turn in the capital programme on education with the Minister deciding to put £3.2 million back into some education political capital project, and the U-turn in regard to the six year education cycle, taken together indicate that education policy here has suffered seriously as a result of that series of turns and twists in Dáil Éireann and in the course of various confrontations.  It is appalling that hardly any parent, regional technical college or vocational education committee knows what the position will be from September onwards.  There is hardly a part-time teacher in any regional technical college or VEC who has the slightest idea of what their employment prospects are for the term 1988-89.  Quite frankly, the U-turns on the education side have been monumental.</P>
    <P>Turning to deal with the budget, very substantial changes have been made despite the impression being given that the Government have a great capacity to manage the various departmental Votes. It was intended to cut £500,000 from the disabled drivers scheme but there was a complete change of policy and the Government rightly decided, which shows how the decision should never have been taken in the first instance, to reverse their position on that issue.  The Government also changed their minds on a pension fund investment tax and decided to use an alternative method instead.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to bring in a statutory sick pay scheme whereby employers would pay disability benefit for the first 13 weeks but then they decided to change their minds because the FUE would not wear it and the trade unions were unimpressed.  The Government decided to introduce a charge on automated teller machine cards in the process bringing in £6 million but they <Col N="2465" /> also changed their minds on that issue. The Government decided to abolish the National Rehabilitation Board but then changed their minds.  The Government wanted to get rid of the National Social Service Board and only reinstated that board following a major row in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to cut £11 million from the community drugs refund scheme and to abolish the long-term illness scheme but then they did a U-turn on those issues.  The Government also changed their minds in regard to the proposal to impose a £10 charge on hospital services cards and in regard to the EC F-11 form.  This Government are not as decisive or as clear-cut in their management of departmental Votes as they would like us to believe.  Certainly they are not a Government who are creating employment or introducing fundamental tax reform.</P>
    <P>Let me deal briefly with taxation before going on to deal with Northern Ireland.  In particular I want to deal with the proposal which has been floated that child benefit, following the next budget, should be subject to income tax.  I deplore the raising in public of such a prospect because I would point out to this House that it was the previous Government who abolished the £100 child allowance on the basis that the money which would be saved would be used to increase child benefit from £12 a month to £15 a month. It is deplorable and utterly regressive to suggest that the new level of child benefit should be subject to income tax.  The child benefit scheme was brought in 1986 and there was no increase in payments in 1987 or in 1988.  It was intended that an extra £3 million would have been devoted to this scheme in 1988 and to suggest now that there should be a clawback of between £15 million and £20 million, which would affect women most of all, is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Minister for Social Welfare in flying this kite is endeavouring to provoke the kind of reaction which I am giving now but one must point out that there would be tremendous opposition to any efforts made to tax child benefit in <Col N="2466" /> the budget of 1989 and the document produced by the Leader of the Labour Party strongly urged that there should be an increase in child benefit rates, up to £40 a month.  We should also bring in tax credits, thus reforming our tax system in a fundamental way.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude my comments on taxation by strongly pointing out that there has been no fundamental change in our taxation system in recent years other than the introduction of DIRT which was largely a Labour Party creation and which resulted in bringing in over £300 million in revenue to the Exchequer which was badly needed to run the country.  The bringing of the farming community and self-employed into the PRSI net has not yielded any more than £3 million or £4 million in taxation to date and I doubt if the Government are making any serious efforts to bring in any moneys during the current tax year from either the farming community or the self-employed.</P>
    <P>It appears that no efforts are going to be made to change the capital taxation system and that is to be deplored.  It now appears that the health contribution ceiling and the PRSI are going to crawl upwards on an annual basis and no fundamental changes will be made to ensure that there will be an increase in yield for the Exchequer.  It now appears that between £50 million and £60 million will be brought into the Exchequer as a result of the amnesty but this is a once-off exercise and it appears no further efforts are going to be made to tackle the black economy which I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>Finally, it appears that no efforts have been made to bring about a complete change in the corporation profits tax system given the fact that over £1,400 million in profits and dividends are leaving the country each year and no efforts are being made to cope with this seepage from the country.  These are fundamental issues which are not being addressed and I do not think the Government have any intention of addressing them in the months leading up to the next budget.</P>
    <P>In relation to the property tax all the indications are that the Government have <Col N="2467" /> run away again from the prospect of bringing in a fundamental change on property taxation in the community.  It appears that the Government have abandoned any prospect of introducing a property tax in 1988-89.  It is for those reasons that I am extremely critical of a Government who have had tremendous open-ended support from some of the Opposition parties but who have failed completely to grasp the opportunity to bring about major and fundamental reforms in those areas.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Northern Ireland.  I and my party have been very critical of the apparent heel-dragging on the part of the Government &mdash; not just by the Taoiseach but also by individual members of the Government and many Fianna Fáil back benchers &mdash; in respect of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I suppose one can in some ways understand that reluctance because of the original opportunistic hostility of the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party towards the agreement. Even though they were eventually hauled screaming on board in support of the agreement one can appreciate and understand that they never had any great enthusiasm for the agreement.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that matters now stand at a far more serious level, not least because there devolves on the Government a fundamental responsibility in respect of the autumn review of the agreement.  I want the Government to stand by the agreement in the autumn review, I do not want the agreement to be undermined in any way and I want the agreement to be worked by the Government right through the summer and during 1988-89.  That means that the Government will have to ensure that the Maryfield secretariat is staffed at a competent, experienced and integrated level.  That means also that ministerial meetings convened under the auspices of the Conference and of the agreement will have to be fully planned and fully prepared so that the Ministers concerned will be productive in their negotiations in the interests of the communities both North and South and in the <Col N="2468" /> interests of ensuring that the agreement is effectively maintained.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Government in their response to the agreement should endeavour, so to speak, to steady-up their relationships with the Unionists and the SDLP in Northern Ireland and that no mirages, false promises or false hopes will be held out with regard to the respective role of those parties.  A great deal of work has to be done and a very grave security situation has to be coped with. Between now and the onset of winter 1988-89, we must recover the tonnes of explosives and high velocity weaponry which still exists covertly within the Republic and within a ten to 15 mile radius over the Border.  That lethal arsenal is still there and even though some of it has been recovered it is imperative that it should all be recovered before further horror is unleashed on the people of Northern Ireland by the Provisional IRA during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>I and my party &mdash; and we were the only party in Dáil Éireann to do so &mdash; opposed the meetings between the Leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, and the sub-commander of the army council of the IRA, Mr. Gerry Adams.</P>

We have had the most productive of fraternal relationships, discussions and co-operation with John Hume at socialist group level, at European Parliament level and at Labour Party level down through the years but I thought at the time that the meetings were a singularly ill-advised development.  I still hold that view and all I can see coming from those meetings is the prospect of giving the IRA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are an organisation who were wilting in many respects in the hail of the unanimous condemnation of them by this House arising from the murders at Enniskillen but the talks which were initiated shortly afterwards gave them a lifeline which this House should never have endorsed and which should be terminated. I hold those views very strongly and I am well aware that a substantial number of the Members in this House equally share those views, although their parties did not comment at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I mbliana tá breis is £19 milliún á chur ar fáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta, d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus do Bhord na Gaeilge lena chaitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge.  Anuas ar an £15,023,000 atá i Leabhar na Meastachán tá soláthar £4,370,000 á chur ar fáil ó fhoinsí eile mar seo a leanas: airleacan a íoctar díreach as an Státchiste leis an Údarás; £4.25 milliún atá i gceist i mbliana; agus iasachtaí as Ciste na nIasachtaí Áitiúla a cheadaíonn mo Roinnse do thithe sa Ghaeltacht; £120,000 atá i gceist i mbliana.</P>
      <P>Is iad na príomhshuimeanna atá i Leabhar na Meastachán ná: £1,480,000 do dheontais tithíochta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht); £1,260,000 do Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht: áirítear £940,000 den tsuim sin mar chaiteachas caipitil d'fhonn bunstruchtúr na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt; £1,625,000 do Scéimeanna Cultúrtha agus Sóisialacha ar a n-áirítear Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, nuachtáin agus irisí Gaeilge; £2,273,000 do Chiste na Gaeilge as a dtugtar deontais do Bhord na Gaeilge, do Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge agus d'eagrais dheonacha Gaeilge; agus £7,195,000 d'Údarás na Gaeltachta idir chaiteachas reatha agus chaiteachas caipitil ar dheontais: chomh maith leis an airleacan a luaigh mé, tugann sé sin iomlán an chúnaimh ón Stát don Údarás go £11,445,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi dheireadh na bliana 1987 bhí 4,954 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha <Col N="2470" /> i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra Éireann nó ón Údarás. Cruthaíodh 911 phost nua i rith na bliana sin ach cailleadh 652 phost i dtionscail éagsúla, rud a d'fhág go raibh glanmhéadú de 259 nduine i líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe ag deireadh 1987 i gcomparáid le deireadh na bliana roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Beidh £9.75 mhilliún ar fáil ón Stát don Údarás i 1988 le haghaidh chaiteachas caipitil i gcomparáid leis an tsuim £12.77 milliún a tugadh dó i 1987.  Nuair a chuirtear san áireamh gur ceadaíodh os cionn £2 mhilliún go heisceachtúil mar dheontais i 1987 do thogra sonrach amháin, is laghdú de £0.9 milliún le fírinne atá ann. Ba bhreá liom féin, ar ndóigh, agus leis an Rialtas, dá bhféadfaí soláthar níos mó a chur ar fáil ach níorbh fhéidir é sin a dhéanamh de bharr ghéarchéim airgeadais an Stát-Chiste.</P>
    <P>Suim £1.754 mhilliún a bheidh ar fáil don Údarás i 1988 le haghaidh caiteachas reatha, ar a n-áirítear tuarastail na foirne. Tiocfaidh £1.695 mhilliún den tsuim sin mar dheontas-i-gcabhair ó Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an fúilleach de £59,000 as an Vóta le haghaidh Méaduithe Pá agus Pinsean.  Ar ndóigh, bíonn teacht isteach ag an Údarás ó fhoinsí eile chun cur leis an soláthar ón Stát.  I ngeall ar ghéarchéim airgeadais an Stát-Chiste b'éigean don Údarás a chinntiú go gcaithfeadh siad cloí leis an tsuim atá curtha ar fáil do chaiteachas reatha don bhliain seo agus ní raibh dul as acu &mdash; cosúil le heagraíochtaí eile Stáit &mdash; ach céimeanna a ghlacadh chun an fhoireann a laghdú ar bhonn deonach.  Beidh thart ar 20 comhalta den fhoireann ag glacadh leis an bpacáiste iomarcaíochta, rud a shábhálfaidh timpeall £176,000 ar phárolla an Údaráis i mbliain iomlán.</P>
    <P>Tá an fheirmeoireacht éisc ar an tionscal úr-nua is mó a bhfuil fás agus forbairt ag teacht air sa Ghaeltacht le cúpla bliain anuas.  Tá infheistíocht an Stáit sa tionscal seo sa Ghaeltacht thar a bheith rathúil agus táirgiúil dar le tuarascáil chuimsitheach a d'fhoilsigh an Institiúid um Thaighde Eacnamaíochta agus Sóisialta (ESRI) le déanaí.  Thug an tuarascáil sin le fios gur bhain infheistíocht chaipitil de <Col N="2471" /> £11.8 milliún leis an tionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc sa Ghaeltacht i 1987.  Den tsuim sin bhain £11.5 mhilliún le bradáin agus £300,000 le sliogéisc.</P>
    <P>Léirigh an tuarascáil freisin: gurbh ionann an t-olltáirge náisúnta ón tionscal seo i 1987 agus £8.4 mhilliún agus, den mhéid sin, gur bhain £5.6 mhilliún leis an nGaeltacht féin; go bhfuil 149 nduine fostaithe go lánaimseartha agus 229 nduine go páirtaimseartha faoi láthair ar fheirmeacha éisc sa Ghaeltacht; agus go meastar go méadóidh an fhostaíocht go dtí thart ar 2,000 duine, idir daoine lánaimseartha agus daoine páirtaimseartha, faoin mbliain 1993 agus go n-ardóidh luach an táirgthe go dtí go maith os cionn £40 milliún faoin mbliain chéanna.</P>
    <P>Tá tús curtha ag an Údarás le scéim fheirmeacha saitilíte bradáin trína dtabharfar tacaíocht do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin dul i mbun gnó ar a bhfeirmeacha éisc féin mar fho-tháirgeoirí do na feirmeacha móra.  Tá an-ghealladh sa scéim seo agus an-suim á léiriú inti.  Go dtí deireadh 1987 bhí timpeall £7.2 mhilliún ceadaithe ag an Údarás i leith forbairt an tionscail nua seo agus de réir thuarascáil an ESRI is infheistíocht thairbheach, bhrabúsach don eacnamaíocht áitiúil agus náisiúnta í sin.</P>
    <P>Tá páirt ghníomhach cheannródaíochta glactha ag an Údarás maidir le cur chun cinn thionscal shaothrú na mara sa tír seo agus tá aitheantas tugtha ag an Rialtas don ról a bheidh ag an eagraíocht i ndáil le clár forbartha an Rialtais i leith an tionscail sin a chur i gcrích sa Ghaeltacht. Is deimhin liom gur chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na tíre i gcoitinne a rachaidh obair fhorbartha an Údaráis san earnáil thionsclaíochta sin a bhaineann úsáid as acmhainní nádúrtha agus scileanna traidisiúnta mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Cé gur cuireadh deireadh leis na deontais fheabhsúcháin tithíochta a bhí le fáil ón Roinn Comhshaoil ó 1 Márta 1987, lean mo Roinnse leis na deontais fheabhsúcháin tithíochta a bhí ar fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  De bharr na géarchéime airgeadais, áfach, agus cosúil lena lán scéimeanna eile Stáit, socraíodh <Col N="2472" /> ar ghearradh siar a dhéanamh ar na deontais sin le héifeacht ó 1 Lúnasa 1987.  Is amhlaidh a cuireadh deireadh le deontais áirithe a bhí le fáil ach tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil na gnáthdheontais fheabhsúcháin agus shláintíochta, mar aon le deontais do thithe nua, le fáil ó mo Roinnse i gcónaí.  Suim £1,480,000 atá ar fáil i mbliana do dheontais tithíochta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) agus, sna cúinsí atá luaite agam, táim sásta gur leor an soláthar sin.</P>
    <P>Tógadh 224 theach nua agus cuireadh oibreacha feabhsúcháin i gcrích ar 1,040 cás le cabhair dheontais ó mo Roinnse i 1987.  Léiríonn na figiúirí sin go ndearnadh dul chun cinn fiúntach i ndáil le soláthar agus le feabhsú tithe sa Ghaeltacht anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Aithníonn an Rialtas go mbíonn tionchar an-mhór ar fhorbairt na Gaeltachta ag na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse agus, in ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí móra airgeadais atá ag cur isteach orainn i láthair na huaire, tá áthas orm nach bhfuil ach laghdú £100,000 ar an soláthar do na scéimeanna sin atá á reachtáil ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i 1988 i gcomparáid leis an soláthar do na scéimeanna céanna i 1987.  Ar ndóigh léiríonn Leabhar na Meastachán don bhliain seo agus don bhliain seo caite gur laghdú £580,000 atá déanta ach baineann £480,000 de sin le deontais i leith muirir iasachta a bhain le scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais agus a bhí iníoctha go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite ag mo Roinnse. Tá socrú eile déanta ag an Rialtas faoi na hiasachtaí sin anois agus dá bhrí sin níl aon chuid de na muirir iasachta iníoctha ag mo Roinnse ó thús na bliana reatha.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin is tábhachtaí is ea an scéim faoina dtugtar cúnamh do na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta a bhíonn ag plé le forbairt iomlán a gceantair fheidhme &mdash; forbairt eacnamaíoch agus shóisialach chomh maith le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an chultúir dhúchais.  Chomh maith le cúnamh caipitil i ndáil le tograí fiúntacha a bhíonn idir lámha acu, íoctar deontais shuntasacha leis na comharchumainn cháilithe mar chabhair dóibh chun costais riaracháin a íoc.  Tá se inmhianaithe go mbeadh ar <Col N="2473" /> chumas gach comharchumann bainisteoir oilte, cumasach a fhostú agus, murach cúnamh na Roinne, is beag díobh a bheadh ábalta é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Sé Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Ghaeilge ceann de na scéimeanna is fiúntaí atá ag mo Roinnse ó thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge de.  De bhrí go mbaineann sí le foghlaimeoirí a thagann go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge, tá i bhfad níos mó eolais faoi lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ná mar atá faoi aon scéim eile atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse.  Bhí áthas orm a fheiceáil anuraidh go raibh ardú ar líon na bhfoghlaimeoirí a chaith seal sa Ghaeltacht ag foghlaim na teanga.  Íocadh deontais faoin scéim i leith thart ar 17,500 foghlaimeoir i 1987 agus ní raibh an figiúr chomh hard leis sin ó 1982 i leith.  Táim dóchasach gur féidir freastal ar an éileamh a bheidh ar an scéim i mbliana le soláthar den mhéid céanna a cuireadh ar fáil di i Leabhar na Meastachán don bhliain 1987 agus tá áthas orm nach bhfuil laghdú déanta ar an soláthar áirithe seo.</P>
    <P>Ní miste tagairt a dhéanamh don imní atá léirithe ag mná tí a chaithfidh socruithe áirithe maidir le cúrsaí cánach a dhéanamh ar nós formhór na n-iarratasóir a bheidh ag iarraidh deontais Stáit feasta.  Tá sé ráite go soiléir ag an Aire Airgeadais nach dtitfidh dliteanas breise cánach ar dhuine ar bith de thoradh na n-athruithe atá déanta i ndáil le huimhreacha cánacha a sholáthar.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm a rá nach laghdófar i mbliana an tsuim airgid £75,000 a cuireadh ar fáil chun scéim tábhachtach, Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, a reachtáil le cúpla bliain anuas.  Tá bunáite na ndeontas faoin scéim i leith na scoilbhliana 1986-87 íoctha anois ag mo Roinnse agus tá áthas orm a rá nach bhfeictear faoi láthair don Roinn go bhfuil aon mhórchúlú ar líon na ndaltaí a thuillfidh an deontas.</P>
    <P>Caithfear a admháil go bhfuil na figiúirí díolacháin don nuachtán <i>Anois</i> ina n-údar díomá dom fós.  Tá an deontas in aghaidh an eagráin méadaithe agam ó Mheán Fómhair seo caite &mdash; méadú atá fial, i mo thuairim, nuair a chuirtear an ghéarchéim airgeadais san áireamh.  Tá sé <Col N="2474" /> riachtanach, áfach, go gcuirfear le teacht isteach eile an nuachtáin trí dhíolaíocht a mhéadú go suntasach, rud a chabhródh le teacht isteach ó fhógraíocht freisin. Molaim, mar sin, go dtabharfadh gach duine ar spéis leis an Ghaeilge tacaíocht leanúnach do <i>Anois</i> trína cheannach gach seachtain.</P>
    <P>Leanfar den chúnamh a chuirtear ar fáil do na tréimhseacháin Ghaeilge &mdash;<i>Comhar, Feasta, An tUltach, Agus, An Sagart, An Ghael Óg, Tír na nÓg agus An Timire.</i>  Leanfar, chomh maith, leis an scéim atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse d'fhonn iriseoireacht áitiúil a spreagadh i gceantair Ghaeltachta ina labhartar an Ghaeilge go coitianta trí phobail áitiúla a spreagadh chun irisí a fhoilsiú ina mbeidh nuacht áitiúil, trácht ar chúrsaí reatha, filíocht nua-cheaptha, etc.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Ghaeilge ar an teilifís, mar is eol don Teach bunaíodh Grúpa Oibre cúpla bliain ó shin chun staidéar a dhéanamh ar cheist na Gaeilge ar an teilifís.  Bhí ionadaithe ar an ngrúpa sin ó mo Roinnse, ón Roinn Cumarsáide, ó Bhord na Gaeilge agus ó Radio Telefís Éireann.  Tá an tuarascáil a fuarthas ón ngrúpa foilsithe le tamall anuas agus tá tátail na tuarascála á mbreithniú i bhfianaise tuairimí atá faighte ó pháirtithe leasmhara éagsúla.  Faoi mar is eol don Teach, tá suim £500,000 á chur ar fáil as fáltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta ar mhaithe le cláracha teilifíse trí Ghaeilge agus tá súil agam nach fada go ndéanfar socruithe faoin mbealach is fearr chun an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh chun an tairbhe is fiúntaí don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht a fháil as.</P>
    <P>Tá clú agus cáil bainte amach ag Raidió na Gaeltachta ó bunaíodh é breis agus sé bliana déag ó shin.  Bhí an-áthas orm le déanaí gur thug an Rialtas aitheantas breise do Raidió na Gaeltachta nuair a cheadaigh an tAire Chumarsáide líon 1,092 d'uaireanta craolacháin breise don stáisiún.  Mar thoradh ar an socrú nua seo, beidh Raidió na Gaeltachta ag craoladh as seo amach ó 8 a.m. go 8 p.m. ón Luan go dtí an Aoine agus ó 11 a.m. go 8 p.m. ar an Satharn agus ar an Domhnach.  Faoi mar atá ráite agam go minic, tá obair shuntasach ar mhaithe leis <Col N="2475" /> an nGaeilge déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta ó bunaíodh é agus táim cinnte go mbeidh níos mó fós á dhéanamh ag an stáisiún ar son na teanga de bharr na n-uaireanta craolacháin breise atá ceadaithe anois.</P>
    <P>Cuirtear cúnamh Stáit ar fáil as Ciste na Gaeilge do Bhord na Gaeilge, do Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge agus do na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge &mdash; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge, An tOireachtas, Cumann na bhFiann, An Comhlachas Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, agus do Thaibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair, An Gael-Acadamh agus Oidhreacht Thír Chonaill.  Tá obair fhiúntach déanta ag Bord na Gaeilge ó bunaíodh é.  D'éirigh go maith lena gcéad Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge agus tá an Dara Plean a chlúdóidh an tréimhse go 1991 á scrúdú agam faoi láthair.  Nuair a cuireadh an bord ar bhonn reachtúil sa bhliain 1978, aithníodh nach ar an mbord amháin a bheifí ag brath chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Léiríodh go soiléir go raibh dualgas ar gach Roinn agus eagraíocht Stáit cabhrú leis an obair thábhachtach sin.  Is dóigh liom go gcaithfear a adhmháil nach bufuil an tuiscint ar an ndualgas sin chomh forleathan agus ba mhaith linn.  Ba cheart go dtuigfeadh gach duine atá ag obair laistigh den Státchóras ach go háirithe nach mór dóibh aitheantas a thabhairt don stádas atá tugtha don Ghaeilge i mBunreacht na tíre &mdash; Bunreacht a sheas go maith linn le breis agus caoga bliain.</P>
    <P>Tá ról lárnach ag na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa phobal.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh comhordú ceart idir na hiarrachtaí a bhíonn ar siúl ag na heagrais sin chun an Ghaeilge a leathadh i measc an phobail.  Is ar Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge atá an fhreagracht sin agus, cé go bhfuil daoine ann a deireann nach mbíonn an comhordú sin le haireachtáil i gcónaí, táim sásta go bhfuil an chomhdháil ag déanamh gach díchill chun go mbeidh comhórdú éifeachtach i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2476" /> Bhí sé luaite in óráid an Taoisigh maidir leis an gcrannchur náisiúnta gur cuireadh breis airgid ar fáil, £4 mhilliún atá i gceist, agus tá me cinnte go nglacfaidh gach duine leis gur ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeilge a bheas an t-airgead sin caite.</P>
    <P>Is breá liom go bhfuil an Comhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge anghníomhach ó athbhunaíodh é agus ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh an dá thuarascáil ata leagtha faoi bhráid an Oireachtais ag an gcomhchoiste le roinnt míonna anuas.  Bhí sé de phríbhléid agam féin bheith mar Chathaoirleach ar an gcéad chomhchoiste agus ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh gach duine sa Teach seo aird ar na moltaí atá acu maidir leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Níl sé de am agam an ráiteas ar fad a léamh, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ach tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann gach duine an tábhacht atá leis na Meastacháin seo agus go bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh a ndíchill le airgead a chur ar fail don Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The restriction on the time provided for the spokesperson for the Workers' Party in this debate does not speak well for the generosity of the other parties in this House.  To allocate 40 minutes for the main spokespersons from the other parties on Opposition and 15 minutes to The Workers' Party is a petty, mean-minded approach.  However, I am not going to waste my time complaining about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2477" /> The focus is sharpening on the conflict of philosophical, political and economic ideas in this House and outside it between those who stand for the untrammelled primacy of the rights of capital and capitalists at any social price and those who believe in the sharing of wealth for the advancement of all, who believe that a socialist economy and a socialist outlook alone can provide the dignity and security which should be the birthright of everybody. It should be a fundamental human right.  The importation of the repugnant creed of Thatcherism by this Fianna Fáil Government, the clasping of that creed to their bosom in advance by the Progressive Democrats before Fianna Fáil's coming to power and, indeed, the alliance that has developed between the conservative parties and the Government in defence of this heartless approach is an indication of the way in which this focus is coming about.</P>
    <P>People are becoming tired at the shenanigans of the conservative parties, shouting their protestations of &ldquo;fundamental differences&rdquo;, &ldquo;different approaches&rdquo; and &ldquo;basic disagreements&rdquo;. It is like the sham fight at Scarva.  The outcome never changes; the rich always ride away on the white charger and the rest are left for dead in the dirt.  The total immersion of Fianna Fáil in Thatcherism is full of grim ironies.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, in referendum and election campaigns over the years has never been shy about climbing on a soapbox in Castlebar and sharing with us his fears about &ldquo;alien ideologies&rdquo; taking root in Ireland.  Yet, he now talks quite freely and unashamedly about introducing Margaret Thatcher's poll tax, or Margaret Thatcher's privatisation, or Margaret Thatcher's dual society, the very rich and the very poor.</P>
    <P>But how alien is Thatcherite monetarism to Fianna Fáil and the other parties of the right, both old and new?  Could it be that the existing and well-established gombeenism in our society has bought a filofax and decided that it is time to go public?  We must always bear in mind that this aggressive idelogy of social survivalism is primarily that, an ideology, a <Col N="2478" /> considered, thought-out strategy to maintain and strengthen the social dominance of the rich and the right.  This new Toryism, now rampant, has lost some of the knee-jerk aspects of its antecedents. It is more conscious, more calculating, better at attempting to disguise what it is about in society.  The perversion of language it employs is Orwellian.  To anyone with a spark of decency, adopting a responsible attitude in economic matters would mean, at the very least, caring for and protecting people who are sick, the elderly, the disabled and the growing number of people who have been pushed out of society and live a half life on the fringes, homeless and hungry.  That, to people with the most basic of human values, would represent a responsible attitude, an acceptance of collective responsibility in the community.</P>
    <P>But to the conservative ideologues, a responsible attitude in the ordering of the economy means a policy of sterile cutbacks aimed at the weakest and least organised.  For the sick who rely on what remains of the public health service, it means waiting in pain, in some cases until you die.  If you do get treatment it is criminally inadequate.  For the old, alone and helpless, there is now almost nowhere to go.  Every agency set up by the State to care for those who simply cannot care for themselves has been financially subverted.  Dismissed teachers and packed classrooms have subverted the future of our children &mdash; the brightest might get by, but what about the rest? This sounds like gutting the poor and the weak.  It is perverse to equate responsibility with social butchery.  It is perverse to describe the subversion of the future as some sort of prudence.</P>
    <P>Superficially, some economic indicators give the impression that this is a booming economy, but the reality for hundreds of thousands of men, women and children is very different.  Exports are at a record level, inflation and interest rates are down, but these have done nothing for the majority of people in this country.  For years now we have been told that if wages were kept low, inflation would fall and that we would have a <Col N="2479" /> boom.  We were told that if Government borrowing was cut to reduce interest rates, employment would boom.</P>
    <P>The sacrifices made by workers in accepting lower wages and cuts in services have not brought any benefits to them.  Certainly the Smurfits and the Goodmans of this world are doing well, but the situation for working people is very different.  We still have unemployment of a quarter of a million, with unemployment levels of 70 per cent and more in some working class areas of Dublin and young people leaving the country at the rate of 600 per week, Haughey deportees.</P>
    <P>The reality of life, 66 years after the foundation of the State, and 16 months into the life of this Fianna Fáil administration, is not the rosy picture depicted by Fianna Fáil, by the Minister for the Environment standing in for the Taoiseach and some media commentators, but the starkly different picture painted in the report of the Combat Poverty Agency, which was published earlier this week.  This portrayed a dismal picture of our failure to reach anything approaching social equality.  It spoke of an Ireland with a quarter of the population &mdash; more than three quarters of a million people &mdash; living in some degree of poverty.  It particularly drew attention to the fact that children now make up a higher proportion of the poor than they did 15 years ago.  According to the report, children account for more than half of the total number living in poverty, with one child in four dependent on welfare payments. The problem was essentially one of equity, the report said with, the top 20 per cent of families enjoying 43.8 per cent of gross income, while the bottom 20 per cent must make do with just 4.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of poverty that the Commission on Social Welfare sought to address.  It is almost three years since the commission reported and recommended a basic income for those on welfare of between £50 and £60 per week, in 1985 terms.  The failure of both the Coalition and Fianna Fáil Governments to implement the main recommendations of <Col N="2480" /> the report is a measure of the low political priority attached to tackling poverty.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people are so cynical about the political system in Ireland when they see the Government and the four biggest parties in the Dáil, who have consistently failed to act to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, awarding themselves a salary increase of 15 per cent?</P>
    <P>I know of people who have to exist on a weekly level of income, which is less than the weekly increase we have awarded ourselves.  Can anyone seriously argue that the financial difficulties facing TDs are as great as the financial difficulties facing those on welfare?  By implementating our own award, but not those of the Commission on Social Welfare, the inevitable impression created among the general public is of TDs defending their own interests with far greater vigilance and determination than they devote to protecting the poorest. Politics and the democratic system will suffer from this cynical abdication of leadership.  I expected more from at least some of our colleagues on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>The main pillar of this Government's economic strategy has been the so-called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which was agreed by the social partners last year.  More and more, however, it is being revealed as a sham.  Workers and trade unionists are realising the programme is simply a device to win time for Fianna Fáil and that the Government's commitment to the promises contained in it are about as reliable as their election commitments to the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>It is now more than nine months since the programme was approved by the Dáil.  The Dáil should now debate and review what progress has been made in implementing its objectives and should give the Government notice that they must deliver or get out.  What is evident, even from a cursory examination, is that employers, financial institutions, and the Fianna Fáil Party have benefited from the programme, but the benefits for workers <Col N="2481" /> and the unemployed, those on social welfare and young people forced to emigrate, are non-existent.  Profits in the private sector, particularly the transnational and financial services sectors are now at an unprecedented high level.  Job losses in both the public and private sectors are also at an unprecedented high level.</P>
    <P>Possibly the single most important item in the programme is the commitment to create an extra 20,000 jobs in manufacturing each year.  The specific quotation from the programme is as follows: &ldquo;The objective of policy in manufacturing industry involves creating approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years.&rdquo; The fact is that these jobs are elusive as ever.  The reality is that manufacturing employment is continuing to decline &mdash; 40,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the past five years &mdash; and will continue to decline as long as we adhere to a blind reliance on market forces to resolve our economic problems in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>Statements made by the Government that the job creation figures set by the programme have been met are simply untrue and disguise the disastrously inadequate level of job creation.  The statement issued by the Government at the end of May was particularly misleading. First of all, while the programme specifically talks about extra manufacturing jobs &mdash; clearly meaning additional jobs over and above those already in existence &mdash; the Government have continued to refer to new jobs generally, irrespective of the number of job losses and irrespective of the sections in which new jobs are created.  If 20,000 new jobs are created, but 20,000 existing jobs lost, it clearly does not meet the requirements of the programme.  The Government claim that 4,000 new jobs were created in the first quarter of the year and on that basis assert that the job creation targets of the programme are being met.  However, in the same first quarter of 1988 there was a total of 7,401 redundancies &mdash; more than 3,000 of them in the manufacturing sector &mdash; notified to the Department of <Col N="2482" /> Labour.  This is a sort of three card trick approach to statistics.</P>
    <P>Under every heading of the programme, there are blatant examples of a two-tier approach to a so called recovery. This was evident this week when those on reasonable salaries got more than the terms of the programme, while unfortunate workers on social employment schemes did not even get the terms of the programme.  Their miserable rate of £70 per week was reduced to £60 per week.</P>
    <P>The same two-tier approach is evident in the health services, where public services are butchered while private services are subsidised, grant-aided and expanded in the profitable growth industry of human misfortune.  Cuts in housing construction, the destruction of local authority services with redundancies of 2,500 in the vital services area have all taken place in a period of eight months.  The programme has also been used to disguise major cuts in social welfare, education and in most semi-State agencies and companies.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with Northern Ireland in the minute or two left.  The Workers' Party commitment to peace, unity and reason in Northern Ireland is ongoing and we have never expected it to be an easy road to follow as a party with membership in the North and in the Republic. The present moves of the Irish Government to try to force Unionists into a round of discussions based on a context wider than Northern Ireland is a mistake. If the Government believe they can force the Unionists, through fear, as a result of the meetings taking place between the SDLP and the Provos to deal with them on the basis that dealing with Mr. Haughey is better than dealing with the Provos, they are seriously misreading the situation and playing a very dangerous. game of brinkmanship with the lives of tens of thousands of men and women, Catholic and Protestant, North and South.  I am convinced that the present talks between the SDLP and the Provos are part of an attempt to create a pan-Nationalist front and to frighten the Unionists even more than they are present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 4 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Craig Gardner Management Consultants were commissioned to examine the major payment systems in my Department in order to establish where the systems are most at risk and to advise on the best cost-effective measures to keep these risks to a minimum.  Following <Col N="2487" /> a detailed examination of the Department, the consultants submitted three reports containing a large number of recommendations, ranging from organisational arrangements to changes in particular controls and procedures.  The total moneys paid to the consultants in respect of the project was £224,710 exclusive of VAT.</P>
    <P>As far as publication of the reports is concerned, I have on previous occasions explained to the House that in view of the confidential nature of many of the consultants' findings I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate to publish them.  The reports deal with much of the day-to-day control measures of the Department in relation to schemes and it would be counter-productive to publish these.  I have, however, made available a summary of the reports in booklet form and this has been circulated to Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The summary booklet outlines the consultants' main findings and recommendations. Broadly, they reported on organisational and procedural weaknesses, on the inadequacy of certain control procedures and on the difficulties which reliance on outside agencies can cause.  In a separate study, the consultants assisted my Department in developing statistical sampling methods to estimate the level of social welfare abuse.  The results of a survey of disability benefit and unemployment payments abuse levels in the Dublin area are contained in the summary booklet.</P>
    <P>I am committed to tackling the issues raised in the reports and to introducing operational changes which will reduce exposure to abuse in the system.  At the same time, I am determined to ensure that the position of genuine claimants is protected.  However, we must prevent unscrupulous claimants from abusing the system.  Since coming into office 15 months ago, I myself have undertaken a major review of my Department's activities to stamp out fraud and abuse.  As a result of the decisions I have taken, a total of some £30 million was saved in 1987 from measures aimed at curbing <Col N="2488" /> fraud and abuse.  The Estimates for the current year include provision for saving a further £20 million from measures to prevent fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming.  I am confident that this target will now be exceeded.  As Deputies can see, I have already taken very significant steps to eliminate the scope for fraud and abuse.  I intend to take whatever other measures are necessary to tackle this problem.  In so far as the consultant's reports are concerned, many of their recommendations have already been put into place.</P>
    <P>Further recommendations are under active consideration by my Department. These include the localisation of services; client identification measures including, for instance, the possibility of each person in the State having a unique Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number; my Department's co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and other agencies; the position of employers in the social insurance payments system; methods of payment and issues concerning accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Members of the House are in some difficulty because of the confidential nature of the report.  It is not possible to find out, first, what the exact recommendations were and, secondly, whether these recommendations will ever be implemented.  Given that £250,000 was spent on this consultancy report I think it is unsatisfactory that such limited knowledge of the findings is available to Deputies.  Can the Minister tell me to what extent the findings of these consultants will be implemented? Does he intend implementing all of the findings, 50 per cent of the findings or whatever?  In relation to the level of abuse identified by the consultants what will be the net saving to the Exchequer this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultants dealt with abuse in the Dublin area in a particular study.  The figures which are given in the report which was circulated are approximately 2 per cent in unemployment assistance and in unemployment benefit and just under 1 per cent in disability <Col N="2489" /> benefit.  There was also a 7 per cent which was questionable but when this was investigated more fully, in a special study afterwards, it was discovered that two-thirds of that figure did not constitute abuse.  That meant that there was a possible 2 per cent on top of the 2 per cent which was identified which would bring it to 4 per cent as the basic figure.  The extension throughout the country, if the Deputy is extrapolating from what happened in Dublin, indicates that there is a definite percentage and in terms of the total expenditure &mdash; because the total expenditure is so large &mdash; even a small percentage amounts to a large sum of money.  The measures being taken are wide-ranging.  There is a number of different actions in place which we have discussed in the House on a number of occasions ranging from the external control unit &mdash; which we have extended greatly &mdash; to the work of the inspectors and the social welfare officers to the joint investigation unit.  These different activities have been very helpful.  In addition we are tightening up on the security of the computer systems and that is adding to the savings which have taken place generally.  The systems are more controlled now and within a relatively short time that work will be completed.  While most previous Ministers have put effort into tackling this problem the activities going on at present are unprecedented and are widespread.  That is tied in also with the development and the urgency in the computerisation, cross-checking and so on.  A lot of work is being done in that area.  That relates to the recommendations generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has taken the view that it is not appropriate to publish the report we must try to get whatever information we can through questions.  May I ask the Minister who were the population that were surveyed and how were they selected?  Was the survey confined entirely to Dublin or was it countrywide?  What size was the sample used from which to draw conclusions? What kind of questions were asked? <Col N="2490" /> When surveys of this kind are being carried out &mdash; as we know from political surveys &mdash; the way in which questions are formulated has a large bearing on the response.  In relation to the statistical sampling methods which were provided for his Department by the group, did they also provide a methodology and criteria for deciding what was fraud and what was not fraud?  Apart from deciding where you would select cases what criteria were used to decide this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the information is given in the summary.  That survey was confined to the Dublin area and it was used as a means of building up a technique which could be used more widely for detecting fraud.  Obviously, much information was gained from that.  If I remember correctly, the number of people involved was about 2,000.  Much time and attention was give to this statistical sample to sort out that problem. One can see from the results that clearly there was fraud and a certain suspect area and subsequently that was pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are concerned about is how accurate this information is.  What kind of inquiries were made?  What criteria have been established to define what is abuse and what is fraud?  Clearly there is a very fine distinction between a person in receipt of benefit or assistance, to which they may not be entitled, but who may be in receipt of it quite innocently.  How clearly identified were the criteria for identifying fraud and abuse?  I am making a distinction between the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of that survey would be very small.  The total cost, to which the Deputy referred, refers to the <Col N="2491" /> overall purpose of the work which was spread over three years.  The work started in 1986 and finished just before Christmas.  Its purpose was to examine the major payment systems in the Department with a view to establishing where they were most at risk and to advise on the best and most cost effective measures to keep these risks to a minimum. That was a much broader study. The survey was relatively small to develop the sampling techniques.  Basically, it was to identify cases of fraud and clear abuse.  There could still be unwarranted claiming for a variety of reasons but that would not have been identified.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the light of savings already announced by him, in relation to fraud and abuse, the report by Craig Gardner erred extremely on the side of caution to the extent that it could almost be considered a dud report?  In the light of that would he not consider seeking back from the consultants a repayment of the fee which they received in view of the fact that it totally underestimated the problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Fraud that can be identified specifically as fraud in the social welfare area is very small.  The money saving is much wider that the fraud.  That is the lesson to be learned from it.  When people leave voluntarily there is no opportunity to find out why they left but so far as the budget is concerned the money is actually saved.  Fraud is something you can prove and bring to court. You can bring forward a case.  Fraud is a very small thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there is a substantial increase in the numbers coming before the courts in relation to misuse and fraud.  Will the Minister agree that when the investigating officers are carrying out their investigations basically the applicant is being prosecuted but employers who are giving statements in support of these prosecutions who are aware that the frauds are taking place are getting off scot-free?  Does the Minister intend to deal with that subject in accordance with the Craig Gardner report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Collusion is an important element in fraud and abuse.  The expansion of the joint investigation unit is specifically for the purpose of tackling the employer side of fraud.  There is a separate question here relating to 26 employers who are before the courts at present.  In fairness, a balanced approach is being taken to that problem.  Again we are back to the question of evidence and information.  The legislation passed before Easter by the House strengthens the hands of the officers in dealing with the employers side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how you go from the statistical formula to finding the people.  Maybe the Minister could help me there.  Did the consultants engage a research company to interview or carry out research of social welfare recipients?  If so, did they identify themselves as people carrying out a survey <Col N="2493" /> on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare?  Sometimes recipients might be reluctant to tell what they regard as an objective consultancy firm that they are welfare recipients or they might be reluctant to be honest with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The cases were selected as ones that might be suspect from within the sample taken.  Those cases were investigated and cross-checked within the system with other benefits.  A person could be claiming two benefits, for instance, claiming for extra people, working and claiming or whatever else. They were pursued individually.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about how you go from the percentage to the people.  That is a very relevant question.  You do not go through the consultants; you go through the administration and that is where the different measures being taken are tackling the people involved.  The measures range from the external control unit to the joint investigation unit to the improved computer correlation which is throwing up people whose position would be suspect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the arrangements which are in place in his Department for the collection of the flat rate of PRSI from small farmers; whether this money is payable through the post office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 3, 21 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for collecting pay-related social insurance contributions from the self-employed are well advanced. The estimate of £15 million for receipts from the new contribution this year is based on the amounts expected to be collected from the 180,000 people already registered by the Revenue Commissioners in the Schedule D tax category and the 40,000 directors who are already paying tax through the PAYE system (Schedule E).  Commencement of the collection is not, therefore, dependent on them being registered in advance in my Department.  The new contribution will be collected in the same transactions as the tax.  Collection has already commenced in respect of the PAYE taxpayers and payment by the Schedule D taxpayers is due, with their tax payments, during the last quarter of the year.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the figure of £15 million is a reasonable estimate.</P>
      <P>Of the 180,000 people registered for Schedule D tax, 60,000 are already on my Department's files and registration forms have been issued to the other 120,000.  The Collector-General of the Revenue Commissioners will shortly be issuing tax and social insurance assessments to all the people registered for Schedule D tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-employed people, including small farmers, who are liable to pay a flat rate contribution of £104, will be able to pay their contribution by instalments through <Col N="2495" /> post offices.  Officers of my Department have met with officials from An Post to work out the arrangements for accepting these payments.  Persons who are not registered with either my Department or the Revenue Commissioners will be asked through a further phase of the advertising campaign, later in the year, to apply for registration.</P>
    <P>The overall budget for publicity in connection with the extension of social insurance to the self-employed for 1988 is £150,000.  The present advertising campaign during June and July is aimed at advising people of the benefits and requirements of the new social insurance scheme and is costing £90,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister about the debate on the subject and the fear we expressed at that time that this would grow into substantial arrears. What will the position be where people do not respond?  Will they be liable for the payment of the contribution from the commencement date or will they be allowed to establish substantial arrears of payment and then go into the same arrangements as we had with service charges by local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they will be liable from commencement date.  As I explained in the reply, the vast majority of the people, 180,000, are within the system and are clearly identifiable.  The measure is being taken to ensure that the balance come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister intend to pursue people who are not registered with the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The first approach is to make the measure available to them and invite them to participate.  That is the phase we are in at this stage.  We will go beyond that when we have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with Miley giving us all the virtues of the scheme, I do not think those who have evaded paying their taxes are now going to start paying their <Col N="2496" /> PRSI.  Perhaps some of the publicity money could be directed towards pursuing those who default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to give them a chance to default first because we have plenty of defaulters without pursuing the ones who may be going to default.  I am glad the Deputy showed her appreciation of Miley's piece on radio.  I thought it very good.  We have taken a number of steps to meet this.  Very often it is a question with people in those groups of making it easier to do rather than saying they have to write to somebody, get a form, send the form back and whatever. There was a great deal of interest at the Spring Show and we intend to bring the matter out to people to try to ensure that the maximum number are registered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of applications his Department received for funding under their allocation of the national lottery; the criteria applied in making the allocation to particular groups; the number, names and addresses of organisations which have been allocated national lottery grants by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This year a total of £850,000 is being provided from the national lottery for the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies administered by my Department.  This includes a special provision of £100,000 for the St. Vincent de Paul Society for personal development and home management courses and £750,000 for once-off grants to voluntary organisations in the social services area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five hundred and sixty-five applications have been received for funding out of the £750,000 available.  Grants are made, in consultation with the health boards, to voluntary organisations providing social services to deprived groups and people in need.  The projects for which assistance is sought must be of a once-off nature and the maximum grant <Col N="2497" /> payable is 90 per cent of the overall cost of the project.</P>
    <P>This year to date, in addition to the £100,000 for personal development and home management courses, grants <Col N="2498" /> amounting to £671,000 have been approved in respect of 91 organisations. The details of the projects involved are set out in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a number of questions because I am very concerned about the way lottery funds are being allocated.  The Minister said there were 565 applications to his Department for the money available, that 91 approvals to date have been granted, and that the bulk of the money has now been approved.  On what basis was the decision made to give the money to these 91 organisations?  Who made the decision? Are there application forms in the Department that groups can see in order to make their applications?  Are there criteria laid down in documentary form that groups can examine before making their applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2501" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme was in operation before we had the lottery funds. The criteria are reasonably well known and established.  Our area is that of social services, with the main emphasis on poverty. The groups involved deal with the elderly, the handicapped, single parents and so on.  The Deputy will see from the long list the kind of organisations involved.  There are also a number of family resource centres, food centres and other clearly identifiable organisations operating in the social services area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few, and very little money either.  It also depends on who applies.  There was an advertisement placed in the newspapers and people were invited to apply up to 31 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>The general criteria, yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister provided money for 91 groups and there were 565 applications.  I presume they all come into the categories&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not all come into the categories laid down.  For instance, we get quite a few applications from people who want to take others on holidays. These are once-off grants. It would be very rare to give a grant for a holiday, although it would be very nice if we could do it, but if we did that the money would go very quickly and we would have nothing to show for it.  We have a very small section in the Department which process the applications, have discussions with the health boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very well organised and provides a very good public service. I am very glad the Deputy is bringing out how well the section is run because I <Col N="2502" /> am a little concerned about some of the statements I read recently in the newspapers which do not relate to the way I see the scheme operating.  Ultimately, the Minister makes the decisions.  There is no great difficulty and there has never been any serious objection to these grants, as the Deputy will see from the list.  What we try to do is spread the money around the country.  In relation to the number of applications, one health board area may do better than another but we try to ensure a spread throughout the health board regions.  Do not look at the grants in terms of constituencies or counties, look at health board regions because we are talking about social services and that is the basis on which we operate.  That also relates to the applications we get and to the projects in hand. We tend to favour once-off projects run by voluntary groups which would have a major input into the community.  Consequently organisations like family resource centres and unemployed groups get priority.</P>

      <P>The reply to this question is mainly by way of a long tabular statement.  I suggest the Deputy wait until she sees that tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister object to the appointment of an independent board to allocate the funds? How are the groups informed of the approval of their applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the cheques are sent in the post.  On a rare occasion, for instance, when we gave £100,000 to the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, they asked me to deliver the cheque personally, which I did.  I thought it appropriate because this was a major development. This money was to be used to provide courses for more than 5,000 families and the organisation wanted to signify how <Col N="2503" /> important this was and we had an official hand-over.</P>
      <P>Normally the cheques are sent through the post once all the criteria are met. Approval is given when our criteria are met and then there are certain requirements which come under the Department of Finance which have to be approved. Normally it will take two or three weeks after the approval of a project for a cheque to be sent out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the categories of social welfare recipients who received payment by way of cash; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 30 together.  My Department operate a wide range of payment systems the majority of which do not involve direct cash payments.  Disability benefit is paid by cheque while longer-term payments such as pensions and child benefit are paid mainly by means of pension and allowance books containing orders cashable at nominated post offices.  About one third of the unemployed are also paid at nominated post offices and the balance are paid in cash through the Department's network of local offices.</P>
      <P>My Department are actively considering ways of reducing the amount of cash used at employment exchanges. Cheques, postal drafts and electronic fund transfer are being considered but these cannot be introduced until the work of employment exchanges has been computerised. This is at present taking place and will be completed on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with my policy of developing more modern facilities using the most <Col N="2504" /> up-to-date computer systems, discussions are taking place with the banks and An Post with a view to substituting as far as possible more efficient and secure electronic payment methods for existing paper transactions.  It is envisaged that social welfare clients would be offered a degree of choice in the method of payment but the Department's own market research and experience elsewhere suggests, however, that the take-up of new payment methods such as electronic funds transfer may be relatively low initially.  One of the constraining factors is that many of the persons receiving social welfare payments do not have active bank accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable for security reasons, and for management reasons, to switch from payment of benefits by cash. I accept that people are reluctant to move in the direction of getting their welfare payments other than in cash, but would the Minister consider the introduction of some kind of publicity or education programme spelling out the advantages for the State and for the people involved? Can he estimate the amount of money, per week or per year, paid by his Department in cash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>About £6 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but unemployment payments would amount to just over £700 million a year, disability benefit about £230 million &mdash; cheques &mdash; and there would be other small amounts in cash.  We have carried out surveys and the percentage of the elderly who would like to change to payment into the bank or otherwise is extremely small &mdash; about 7 per cent. Among the unemployed the number who would be interested in that sort of transfer represents about 40 per cent.  There are other problems relating to it and this is why discussions are going on with An Post and the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to payments made through the post, what is the average number of letters which go astray <Col N="2505" /> each week?  What is the postage cost of the Department each year?  Does the Minister consider that savings could be made in this area?  Does he agree that a move towards electronic funding would not only be convenient for many people but would also avoid their being without funds at weekends, which sometimes happens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These are separate questions. In general I would agree with making payments directly to people. Young people want to deal by plastic card.  The percentage of pensioners who would be interested in having their funds transferred is 8 per cent, not 7 per cent as I mentioned earlier.  That illustrates the kind of difficulty in terms of attitude. I accept the general point that as far as possible we should be moving in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give an assurance that in moving towards any new system of payment the primary consideration would be to ensure that a person entitled to a payment would get it on time and would not be left without income, in view of the fact that such people are on a very tight budget and a delay of even a day can cause severe stress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the benefits of direct transfer is that the money would be there on the day or the day before. There would be much less difficulty in that respect.  We are very conscious of the factor the Deputy mentions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if any further consideration has been given to the idea of appointing social welfare attachés at Irish embassies or consulates abroad where there is a high incidence of Irish emigrants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2506" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on social welfare entitlements can be obtained from all Irish embassies abroad and most embassies carry stocks of the Department's main information guide.  Where the information sought cannot be answered immediately the relevant embassy will contact my Department, through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am satisfied that this arrangement is adequate and is working satisfactorily and that the incidence of social welfare queries would not justify the appointment of a full-time officer in any of our embassies or consulates.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, there is already a labour attaché in the United Kingdom to maintain contact with Irish workers there.  In addition a special attaché was apointed in the United States of America last September to look after matters relating to the legal status, welfare and health concerns of Irish emigrants there.</P>
      <P>I am of course concerned from a social welfare point of view about the situation of Irish emigrants who have to go abroad and also from the broader perspective of other problems which they may have. However, rather than tackle this issue on a piecemeal basis the Government have decided to establish a special interdepartmental committee under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs which will co-ordinate Government activities in relation to emigrants and in particular the provision of advisory and information services for intending emigrants and those already abroad.  My Department will be represented on this committee and through the efforts of the committee I hope to receive regular reports on any social welfare matters which are giving rise to problems for Irish emigrants.  Appropriate measures to deal with problems which are identified will be decided on the basis of these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a largely unreported aspect of our emigration problem is the number of young Irish people who are sleeping under arches or in very seedy conditions in great social distress in places like <Col N="2507" /> London, Amsterdam, New York and Boston?  Rather than a global payment to help Irish emigrants, would he not agree that there is a strong case for having social welfare attachés in these centres to which there is high Irish emigration in order to alleviate the worst aspects of this social adversity, about which we hear so little in the media?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are social welfare problems among some of the emigrants.  For this reason I went to London to acquaint myself directly with what was happening.  We would be anxious through the Department of Foreign Affairs and through the labour attaché in London to give any assistance we could.  The authorities there have a responsibility in regard to the social security and social assistance systems and we must ensure that they carry out their responsibilities in relation to anybody who may be short.  We can provide a back-up support.  Funds are provided through the DÍON Committee for short-term assistance while people are becoming established in London.  The amount of that fund has been increased from £150,000 to £250,000.  The adequacy of that support will be considered by the committee under the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be extremely complacent about this very serious problem.  I spent four days in London last week looking at this problem. It is a problem of grave proportions, not only in London but in other cities. We also have the problem of emigrant families leaving Ireland who are returned home by the authorities in Britain. Because they have no fixed abode in Britain they do not qualify for what used to be called supplementary benefit.  They are in dire straits and do not even have their fare home.  Would the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need for people from his Department to be sent to these sensitive posts abroad?</P>

      <P>A committee has been established to co-ordinate the activities of the different Departments.  An important aspect is the provision of adequate advice to people before they go abroad.  We in the Department of Social Welfare have done a certain amount to provide this advice through some of our grants to emigrant advice centres.  In addition, FÁS have produced a booklet giving information and advice.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will, of course, make arrangements for people who have to come back home.  The Government are taking this matter very seriously and are co-ordinating the activities of the various Departments through this committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the steps which he has taken to liberalise the position regarding unemployed people who wish to pursue educational courses, apart from the educational opportunities scheme introduced by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit schemes are statutory schemes and entitlement is subject to the condition that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Full-time attendance by day at a course of education is generally not regarded as consistent with the requirement of being available for employment during the academic year.  In the normal way income support for full-time students is not a function of the social security system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I see a role for my Department in assisting unemployed people who have left the normal educational system and who would like to make constructive use of their time while looking for work by going back to complete a certificate-type course.  It is for this reason that I <Col N="2509" /> have been considering an extension of the educational opportunities scheme.  This scheme, which has been operating on a pilot basis in Limerick and Tallaght, enables certain categories of the long-term unemployed to engage in a full-time course of education while continuing to receive a payment equivalent to their unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>As regards part-time educational courses, there is a considerable degree of flexibility within the legislation to allow unemployed claimants to participate in such courses while retaining their entitlement to their unemployment payment. Persons engaged in part-time courses would generally be able to fulfil the availability for work condition.  Examples of such courses include literacy classes, mature students attending intermediate or leaving certificate classes for a few days a week, language or other courses pursued as a hobby and night classes.</P>
    <P>The question of whether a person is available for work while participating in an education course, either on a full-time or part-time basis, is a matter to be decided by a deciding officer and each claim is considered on its merits.  Once the deciding officer is satisfied that the education course being pursued does not place a restriction on the claimant's availability to take up employment, payment of assistance or benefit can continue to be made.</P>
    <P>I had the whole matter examined last year with a view to introducing the greatest degree of flexibility possible within the terms of the benefit schemes.  Comprehensive guidelines have been drawn up to assist deciding officers on the determination of claims by unemployed claimants who participate in education courses.</P>
    <P>These guidelines make it clear that unemployed persons who have left the educational system &mdash; in particular the cycle for young persons &mdash; and who are trying to make constructive use of their time by part-time education while looking for work should have no difficulty in continuing to be eligible for benefit. Claimants over 25 years or so, for instance, would normally fall into this <Col N="2510" /> category.  I am satisfied that Deputies will find that the guidelines provide sufficient flexibility to allow a liberal approach to be taken in the matter of education courses and unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for a copy of the guidelines to be placed in the Dáil library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>My Department engage outside consultancy assistance principally to assist in the development of computer systems aimed at modernising service delivery and to provide analysis of specific organisational issues.  The costs, terms and conditions of each consultancy appointment relate to the specific requirements for each project or each distinct phase of a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal Government competitive tendering procedures are followed in <Col N="2512" /> most cases.  However, circumstances can arise where a limited form of tendering might be applied.  This might arise, for example, where only a limited number of consultancy firms are in a position to provide the necessary skills within tight project deadlines.  All tenders issued and all contracts placed are subject to the approval of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>With regard to future consultancy work, my Department are planning several projects but no definitive requirements for consultancy assistance have yet been established.  The need for consultancy assistance on any particular project depends on the availability of technical and other staff in my Department, the skill levels required, and the lead development time for the proposed project.</P>
    <P>My Department have engaged outside consultants in the last three years details of whom and of their activities are set out in the statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The Revenue and Social Insurance Number, known as the RSI Number, is used by both my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of identifying people within the social insurance and tax systems.  At present, the issuing of RSI numbers is done by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Up to now, the integrity of the number system has depended to a large extent on the compliance of the individual with the requirement that he or she only apply for registration to the Revenue Commissioners once in a lifetime; and that he or she then faithfully quotes this number in all relevant transactions.  Over the years, a significant number of instances have arisen where individuals have re-registered and succeeded in getting one or more additional numbers.  This has caused problems for the Revenue Commissioners in associating separate incomes from different occupations and for the Department of Social Welfare in compiling fully comprehensive records of social insurance contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing drive to <Col N="2517" /> combat fraud and in order to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in administration, my Department are at present taking steps to improve the arrangements for controlling the issuing of RSI numbers.  I am examining this issue at present and expect to be in a position to announce to my new plans shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, new procedures are being devised within my Department in order to improve the quality of the existing records, mainly the identification of existing duplicate records and the linking of separate records belonging to the same person.</P>
    <P>The extension of social insurance to the self-employed is also affording an opportunity to improve the situation in so far as my Department are handling the registration of new entrants to the system and are linking the current registrations, where appropriate, with people's previous records of social insurance as employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree with me that in the absence of a national identity card the RSI number is probably the only way we will be able to police the revenue and social welfare systems? Would he agree also that it is desirable that his Department, as the Craig Gardner consultants recommended, should be the issuing authority for these numbers and would he further agree that everybody from the age of 16 onwards should be issued with an RSI number even if they are at school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 42 and Question No. 34 together.</P>
      <P>Medical referee examinations provide additional medical opinions on those claiming benefit in respect of incapacity for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed guidelines are issued by the Department to all doctors who participate in the medical certification <Col N="2519" /> scheme.  The guidelines include full information on assessing and deciding incapacity for work as well as details of the medical referee system.  The guidelines also govern medical referees in carrying out examination of claimants and review of their claims.</P>
    <P>Medical referees are qualified medical practitioners.  They are recruited by the Civil Service Commission and a condition of their appointment is that they must have at least six years experience in general medical practice.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests to persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded. Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  In addition, it is open to a certifier to attend a medical referee examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
    <P>In carrying out medical examinations, medical referees conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Medical Council.  All examinations are carried out in the presence of the official nurse and all reports of examinations are submitted to the Department's Medical Adviser.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the medical referee system is operating in a fair and reasonable manner and that the relevant guidelines are being fully complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be my intention in any way to challenge the competence of the GPs who carry out these examinations but it seems that many women are being called in for medical examination at regular intervals; some have even been called to two or three medical examinations within a very short space of time.  What worries me and what I ask the Minister to examine is that many people who are called for medical examination suffer from very serious complaints, a fact which can only be established through the attendance of a specialist or on the production of X-ray evidence and so forth.  Is the Minister <Col N="2520" /> aware that his Department pay something like £33 towards the cost of bringing a consultant to an examination by a medical referee?  I understand, and I have checked this out, that consultants are charging a fee of £133 to attend at a medical examination.  Therefore, if a woman wishes to bring a consultant with her to a medical examination she would have to pay approximately £100 of her own money to do so.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If one looks at the figures one will see that a higher percentage of women are called.  People are not called at random but rather they are called on the type of illness they are suffering from. As the system is now computerised it is possible to call people suffering from a particular illness at particular times.  They will be first called in for examination at the time when it would be expected that they would have recovered from that illness. In that sense the system is somewhat more efficient but when we come to those who are suffering from, say, back problems and so on for years you happen to have a Minister who is very sympathetic towards those suffering from back problems &mdash; because I know a good deal about them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large the system works quite well.  There are some cases where I know I would not have agreed with the decisions made but in that respect there is the appeals system, and there is a second medical referee.  As regards the question on the fees charged by a specialist, it is not necessary for a specialist to attend.  The submission of a report would be adequate.  A person's own doctor should be able to provide all that is required but I agree that in some <Col N="2521" /> cases it is necessary to bring along a specialist.  This is a question which I will take another look at to see if there is another way in which we can deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will abolish the present signing on practice required of unemployed persons before they are entitled to receive either unemployment benefit or assistance given that this condition does not eliminate abuse of the welfare system and that it is a degrading way to treat unemployed persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The current signing arrangements for unemployed persons are governed by statutory regulations which provide that claimants for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance must sign the unemployed register to indicate that they are available for and genuinely seeking work.  Claimants who reside within six miles of a local office of my Department are required to present themselves there to sign the register at least once weekly to prove unemployment.  In the majority of cases, persons attending at local offices now do so once weekly.</P>
      <P>Claimants who reside over six miles from the local office are required to attend at their local Garda station or other approved signing centre once a week to have their unemployment declarations certified by a member of the Garda Síochána.  These claimants are paid at their local post office.</P>
      <P>The signing arrangements, therefore, are designed primarily as a control mechanism and to enable claimants to indicate in person and in the presence of a witness the days on which they were unemployed each week so that their payments can be computed correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that with the passage of time there is need to look again at signing arrangements and consider whether it might be appropriate to introduce a more <Col N="2522" /> selective approach to the method of signing. However, payment to persons who attend at the local office for signing purposes is made there and then in cash in the vast majority of cases.  As long as this system continues to operate, attendance at the local office on a weekly basis is necessary in any event to enable weekly payments to be made to this category of claimant.  The introduction of alternative paying methods requires the computerisation of local office procedures. This process is proceeding but in view of the number of offices involved it will take some time to complete.  As this progresses it will open up the possibility of providing more flexible payment methods and, consequently, more flexible signing arrangements.  There will still be a need to exercise proper control over the schemes, however, so the likelihood is that the present signing arrangements could be modified in certain cases and be replaced by more systematic and selective reviews of claims.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that requiring unemployed people to sign is in itself degrading. There will always be a need for unemployed people generally to prove their unemployment.  Among the ways that this can be done is by presenting themselves at a local office or signing centre periodically for the purpose of making declarations in person in respect of their unemployment and I believe this is generally acceptable.  I am anxious, however, to bring about a situation whereby those who attend at a local office can have the option of being paid by means other than by cash and this is being pursued as part of the programme for computerisation of the employment exchanges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is degrading for one sector of the community to be treated differently to another?  I am not objecting to the fact that somebody has to sign their name but rather at the public way in which they have do do so.  Would the Minister not agree that the facilities provided in some parts of the country are so appalling, that having to queue for <Col N="2523" /> long periods of time on a street is an awful way to treat unemployed people? Would he agree that a short-term measure to alleviate this problem would be to allow persons who select an alternative payment structure such as payment by electronic fund transfer to have the option of signing something and returning it in the post and not having to appear at an employment exchange?  Would the Minister not agree that the amount of resources used, by way of manpower in the Department of Social Welfare and the Garda Síochána, is wasted by using the present procedure?  Would the Minister also not agree that it does not act as a barrier against fraud and that a much more effective way to eliminate fraud would be selective, on-the-spot checks of employers in particular and some of the unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the system is developed and the controls improve, as is happening very rapidly at this stage, it will be possible to have more selective signing on.  I think that will meet most of what the Deputy has in mind.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to have cases reviewed and to have some mechanism for dealing with that.  I agree with her to that extent.  As the Deputy knows I am introducing a special arrangement for those over 60 which means that they will not have to sign.  I know that the previous Government &mdash; and I supported them in this &mdash; wanted to have more flexible arrangements for those over 55. This is the approach we are taking.  It is tied into the control and extent of the review and the organisation of the system but I believe a good deal of development can take place in that direction.</P>
      <P>Naturally I would be very anxious to improve the facilities and I will do what I can in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will define the original purpose for which the unmarried mother's allowance was introduced; <Col N="2524" /> whether the original criteria are still valid and in effect being observed; if he has any plans to change the criteria or scope of unmarried mother's allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women in their report published in 1972 recommended that an unmarried mother who keeps her child should be entitled to a social welfare allowance at the same rate and on the same conditions as then applied to deserted wives under the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  This recommendation was given effect in the Social Welfare Act, 1973, in which provision was made for the introduction of the scheme from July of that year.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides financial support to unmarried mothers with children under age 18 or, if in full time education, 21.  Entitlement is subject to a means test and to the unmarried mother remaining a lone parent.  The allowance enables mothers, who would not otherwise be able to do so, to look after their children on a full time basis.  The reasons underlying the introduction of the scheme are still valid today.</P>
      <P>There are currently some 14,300 mothers in receipt of this allowance in respect of some 18,200 children.  While the vast majority of recipients of unmarried mother's allowance are genuine, I am anxious to ensure that any abuse of this scheme is dealt with.  A review section has been set up in my Department with the aim of identifying and eliminating fraud within this and other social assistance allowance schemes.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to change the criteria or scope of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The review group are looking at all aspects of the claims, including claims for more than one child.  Over 80 per cent of the unmarried mothers who receive the allowance have one child, an additional 15 per cent have two children and only 5 per cent have three or more children.  In looking at the figures it is important to bear in mind that a certain proportion of the unmarried mothers with a high number of child dependants are what are called &ldquo;common law wives&rdquo; who qualified for unmarried mother's allowance when their relationships broke up.  There would also be cases of foreign divorces and the Kenny decision, which was taken on 15 December 1986, insisted that those people would be entitled to be covered.  About half of those who have more than two children are estimated to be either divorced or whose common law marriages have broken up.</P>

With regard to the reasons for disclaiming, of the 1,255 who ceased claiming to date this year approximately 800 were disqualified from claiming because they had married, started work or whatever and approximately 455 left voluntarily.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a remarkable turnabout in Irish agriculture in 1987, the slide in farm incomes was not only halted but was well and truly reversed.  The most recent review of farm income for 1987 &mdash; the AFT National Farm Survey &mdash; suggests that the increase in incomes in 1987 over 1986 was 31 per cent.  This is an unprecedented achievement by any standards and establishes the agriculture and food industry as a driving force in the economic development of the country. The boost in farm incomes was responsible in no small measure for the revised GNP growth for 1987 now estimated to be in excess of 5 per cent and I am glad to say that the trends in 1988 are showing further significant increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2580" /> A major element in the 1987 income increase was the reversal of the price-cost squeeze, which referred to the situation whereby farm input prices were rising more quickly than farm gate prices for the products sold by the farmers. Between 1980 and 1985, agricultural output prices rose by 35.6 per cent while input prices rose by 47.5 per cent.  Farm output prices were particularly strong in 1987 and increased in real terms for the first time since 1978.  I am glad that this trend towards higher output prices is continuing in 1988.  A further encouraging sign is that while the latest data available on input prices indicate that they have increased, they have done so only marginally to date in 1988.</P>
    <P>A further element in the substantial increase in farm incomes has been the steady decline in interest rates.  Today farmers are being offered term loans at rates as low as 10 per cent and in fact on average rates to farmers have fallen by over 5 percentage points since the Government came into office.  In addition, inflation at 1.8 per cent is now at its lowest level in two decades and is among the lowest in Europe.  In 1988 the general economic climate is more positive than it has been for many years and this will undoubtedly continue to bring considerable benefits to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>While it is a bit early yet to be predicting the outturn for 1988 I believe that there is still further scope for increases in farm incomes.  The further implementation of the EC quota system will probably result in some reduction in the volume of milk output.  However, market buoyancy in the dairy sector is likely to lead to further significant increases in milk prices this year.  It is also likely that the reductions in the volume of output in the dairy sector will be offset somewhat by improvements in other sectors such as sheep, poultry, pigs, horticulture and so on.  On the inputs side, there should be a further reduction in volume, particularly feedingstuffs and fertilisers as farmers effect more economies in the usage of farm materials and services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in recent <Col N="2581" /> years in relation to agriculture, the Council and the Commission have adopted a restrictive prices policy, made increased use of co-responsibility levies, imposed restrictions on intervention availability and introduced quotas and other quantitative restrictions for various sectors. Following the February European Council meeting stabilisation mechanisms of varying types are now in place for all the major sectors.  The central theme in all those measures is that full market support is now limited to specified quantities of production and support prices will be reduced, or the intervention facility will be withdrawn, when thresholds are exceeded.  The European Council also decided on measures to provide the necessary impetus to advance European unity following the entry into force of Single European Act.</P>
    <P>These decisions effectively meant the completion of the major reform of the CAP.  They, along with the earlier reforms, mean that strict budget ceilings have been imposed both on sectoral spending and on the overall guarantee support expenditure.  Whilst guarantee expenditure increased by an average of 8 per cent a year between 1975 and 1987, a ceiling of 74 per cent of Community GNP, growth rate will henceforth be legally binding.  At the same time, a reasonable guideline figure has been agreed and the Community will for the first time for many years have a real financial basis to develop other policies many of which will impinge on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>While the reforms mean that the Community support structures have been weakened, that supports are no longer available for unrestricted quantities and that the growth of agriculture expenditure will be limited to less than 2 per cent a year, the fundamental principles of the CAP have been maintained relatively intact.  Many of the reform measures were unpalatable but we always accepted that reforms were necessary in order to ensure continuation of the essential features of the CAP.  In the reform negotiations our primary objective has been to safeguard producer incomes and to ensure that modifications introduced <Col N="2582" /> were moderated and gradual.  Moreover, we also proposed that alterations should be modulated in favour of the less-developed regions of the Community and that measures taken by the Community should be matched by comparable efforts by our trading partners who are also contributing to the problems.</P>
    <P>It is reassuring that in the reforms undertaken to date the Council generally has had regard to the principles I have mentioned.  For example, Ireland, Greece, Italy and Spain received special treatment in fixing the level of milk quotas or in laying down the rules by which the super-levy has been applied. Ireland also obtained special consideration under the beef premium arrangements.  Smaller-scale farmers generally obtain relief under the cereals co-responsibility levies.  Some further adaptations of market regimes will be considered in the coming months.  I have in mind in particular the reform of the regime for sheepmeat in which product the Community is about 80 per cent self-sufficient. Much sheepmeat production is concentrated in the less-advantaged areas of the Community and imports into the Community contribute to the increasing cost of the regime by depressing prices.  In our view, the Community's approach to the reform of this sector should be guided by the principles of Community preference and the commitment to cohesion both of which are enshrined in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Of course, the CAP cannot be viewed in isolation from the Community's other policies particularly the structural policy and the move towards the further integration of the single market by 1992. Very recently, the Council agreed Community assisted schemes for the cessation of farming and to encourage set-aside, non-intensive farming and reconversion. The Council is at present considering a proposal for payment of income aids for producers to help them adapt to the new situation.  The Commission will also shortly submit proposals for rural development.  The decision of the European Council to double the Structural Funds, to concentrate an increasing <Col N="2583" /> volume of expenditure in the less developed areas and to provide for higher Community intervention rates is of fundamental interest to farmers and rural areas generally.  All of the foregoing will contribute to the restoration of balance in the market and to the development and modernisation of production units. The increased Community contribution rates will also permit member states such as Ireland to devote more resources to the development of rural areas generally.</P>
    <P>The completion of the single market will also impact to some extent on agriculture. Notwithstanding the progress made since 1960, several barriers to trade of varying types continue to exist. Common prices in national currency terms do not apply throughout the Community. The Government will be launching its awareness campaign on 4 July. While my Department and associated bodies will supply information and advice on developments in relation to the completion of the single market it is essentially a matter for each industry to prepare its strategy for the internal market.</P>
    <P>Looking back at developments in recent months, the introduction of the new arrangement for the bovine TB scheme was perhaps the issue that gave me most satisfaction.  I was particularly pleased to be in a position to get the necessary guarantees to secure the funding of the scheme over the new four year plan and to set up the necessary structures that would allow all the parties concerned, farmers, vets and officials, to play an important part in the running of the schemes.  Looking at the result of the bovine TB programme in 1989 I did feel that we were perhaps on the verge of achieving a breakthrough against the disease. I am very pleased to say that the progress discerned in 1987 has so far been maintained in this year's programme with upwards of one-third of the round completed. While it would be unwise to draw any firm conclusions about what might be achieved this year it does seem to me that all the essential ingredients for success have come together at the right time and <Col N="2584" /> that we can look forward to further progress under the guidance of a very active management board that have set about their task with conviction.  The brucellosis situation remains good also though at the present very low levels of disease any significant outbreak constitutes an important set-back.  Any complacency in the face of the disease is bound to bring about severe losses.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the fall in beef cow numbers has been reversed and cow slaughterings over the last 18 months have shown a significant decline. They reduced by 13 per cent in 1987 and were down 18 per cent in the first four months of 1988 as compared with the same period last year.  The very good cattle and, in particular, calf prices so far this year should give further encouragement to farmers to increase the breeding herd.  I have recently taken positive action in this regard as well, by extending headage payments at the higher rates of £70 and £66 to suckling cows kept by dairy farmers throughout the disadvantaged areas.  I estimate that up to 12,000 farmers, as a result, will get higher grants in 1988.  This improvement will make a vital contribution to increasing beef cow numbers.  The increased grants being made available under the western package for the storage of slurry and silage effluent will come into operation on 1 July.</P>
    <P>The highest level of grant permitted under the EC rules relating to the package, namely 55 per cent, will apply.  In addition, young farmers who meet certain criteria in regard to the ownership of their land and who possess the necessary vocational training and skills can qualify for 25 per cent higher aid, bringing the grant in their case to almost 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>Farmers benefiting under this scheme will not have to follow a farm plan nor keep accounts.  This was something I insisted upon in my negotiations with the EC.  I was determined that the red tape should be kept to the absolute minimum and that the administration of the scheme should be kept as light as possible.</P>
    <P>A further point I insisted upon was that this aid should be available to dairy <Col N="2585" /> farmers regardless of their position on milk quotas.</P>
    <P>As well as those farmers getting the aid under the western package for slurry and effluent storage, new entrants to the farm improvement scheme in the less-favoured areas will also be able to avail of this high rate of grant.</P>
    <P>In addition to these grants for pollution control, I am also introducing on 1 July, as part of the western package, a scheme of grants at the rate of 45 per cent for animal housing and fodder storage.  A farm plan and the keeping of accounts will not be required for this scheme, either.  Again, however, new entrants to the farm improvement scheme in the less-favoured areas will be able to avail of the new high rates and, of course, grants for young farmers will be 25 per cent higher &mdash; in excess of 56 per cent.  This scheme of aid for animal housing will meet an essential need in the less-favoured areas, where cattle are in most cases still out-wintered, but in addition it will be of great assistance in helping to preserve the environment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should emphasise that the western package will now apply in all the less-favoured areas, almost two-thirds of the country.  My reason for bringing the pollution control element into operation immediately, indeed in advance of other provisions, is that I am well aware that farmers in those areas are anxious to make proper provision for avoiding any risk of pollution from farm waste or effluent, and to demonstrate the importance the Government attach to pollution control.</P>
    <P>The food industry in Ireland is one of the most important sectors in the economy accounting for 25 per cent of our total exports with a value of £3 billion per annum.  The development and expansion of the sector is vital to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Government intend to exploit fully the potential in the food industry for increased employment and wealth.</P>
    <P>Abroad, Ireland is justifiably perceived as a country producing quality foods in a relatively pollution-free environment. <Col N="2586" /> There is no reason we should not capitalise on this image and use it to gain access to the very lucrative export outlets that exist in Britain and on the Continent. A recent seminar organised by CTT was informed that the grocery market in Britain is worth over £30 billion and that, in many instances, Irish food processors were conspicuous by their absence in seeking a share of that market.  With the advent of 1992 the vast European market will become more accessible for our food manufacturers.  The market opportunities exist for progressive, efficient and export-orientated companies which can produce high quality foodstuffs and can be relied upon to deliver.</P>
    <P>Quality and hygiene are key factors which must be rigidly adhered to throughout the food chain from farm gate to consumer table.  Quality pays for itself and industry must realise that money spent on quality is an investment and the feedback we are getting from our marketing agencies tells us that consumers are only too willing to pay that little extra for quality products.  Hence the high prices that Irish farmers are getting for their milk and dairy products. However, there is no need for complacency on the issue of quality and hygiene and the Government are determined to maintain and enhance quality and hygiene standards throughout the food chain.</P>
    <P>Already a number of important regulatory measures have been undertaken. For instance, the Abattorirs Act, which has now been enacted, will ensure that only meat of the highest standards will be allowed for sale on the home market. We are also in the process of updating our dairy legislation which will enhance the quality image of milk and all our dairy products.  Steps have also been taken in the pigmeat area and to this end the introduction in January, 1989 of compulsory grading of pigs will greatly help to meet consumer demands for leaner meat.</P>
    <P>The development of a modern and efficient agri-food sector is essential if we are to capitalise on our image as a clean, <Col N="2587" /> healthy and disease-free environment. Government strategy for the agriculture and food industry is to encourage a market-led approach to the production of value-added products with export potential and every encouragement is given to suitable firms which are prepared to undertake necessary investment.  Since the Government took office, over £30 million has been awarded by the European Community FEOGA Fund to marketing and processing projects across the full range of the food industry.  Indeed, in the recent June tranche of FEOGA grants, the total investments in new manufacturing projects and in the upgrading and expansion of existing plants exceed £28 million.  Many more projects will be eligible for grant assistance in the December tranche and this reflects the growing confidence with which the industry views the future as a result of the successful implementation of the Government's economic policy.  I am determined that we will continue to maximise the drawdown of these funds which enable the industry to provide new and modern facilities and so meet the challenge of intenational competition, especially on export markets.  I am confident that Ireland has now reached a stage when not only can we compete with the best but we can beat the best on the international market.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam anseo labhairt ar na Meastacháin don Ghaeltacht taobh istigh de Roinn an Taoisigh.  Ba mhaith liom ar dtús a rá go bhfuil súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas an Taoisigh a bheith ar ais ag obair go luath.  Ní bheidh am agam gach uile fhadhb agus gach uile dheacracht atá ag baint leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge a lua anseo taobh istigh de chúig nóiméad déag.  Mar sin, ba mhaith liom díriú isteach ar na fadhbanna is tábhachtaí agus is práinní ó thaobh chúrsaí Gaeltachta de ar an láimh amháin agus ó thaobh chur chun cinn na teanga de ar an taobh eile.  Tá a fhios ag gach uile dhuine go bhfuil deacrachtaí faoi leith ag baint le gach uile áit, ach sílim mura <Col N="2588" /> leagtar béim ar na deacrachtaí is tábhachtaí nach dtiocfaidh feabhas ar bith ar an scéal.</P>
      <P>Go deimhin, sílim gurb éard atá ag teastáil ón nGaeltacht faoi láthair ná beagan níos mó <i>glasnost</i> agus tuilleadh <i>perestroika</i> agus i bhfad níos mo cothrom na Féinne.  Sílim go mba cheart go mbeadh am speisialta agus am faoi leith ag an Teach anseo le cúrsaí Gaeltachta a phlé, in áit na Meastacháin seo a bheith measctha taobh istigh de Mheastacháin Roinn an Taoisigh.  Ní féidir linn fadhbanna na nGaeltachtaí a réiteach i gcúig nóiméad déag, agus taispeánfaidh sé seo cé chomh hard is atá cúrsaí Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge ar chlár an Rialtais.  Tá brón orm faoin méid Gaeilge agus ceisteanna as Gaeilge a d'fhreagair an Taoiseach féin anseo mar Thaoiseach le bliain anuas.  Cé gur as mo chontae féin an tAire Stáit agus go labhraíonn sé an t-am ar fad as Gaeilge, beagnach, anseo, tá a fhios ag gach uile dhuine go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos tábhachtaí dá mbeadh an Taoiseach féin ag caint as Gaeilge agus ag freagairt na gceisteanna as Gaeilge.  Sílim go bhfuil géarghá le cinnireacht sna rudaí seo go léir, agus mar a dúirt mé, ba cheart go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó aird tugtha ar an nGaeilge agus ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta ag Airí Stáit, ag Teachtaí agus ag Seanadóirí agus gach uile dhuine.</P>
      <P>Cén cruth atá ar an nGaeltacht faoi láthair?  Céard iad na fadhbanna is mó atá iontu, agus cén freagra atá ag an Rialtas chun iad a réiteach nó an bhfuil freagra ar bith acu chun déileáil leo?  Ar leathanach a 12 de ráiteas an Taoisigh a chualamar ar maidin dúirt sé &ldquo;Is méadú cúig go leith faoin gcéad é ar lion na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe sna tionscail sin ag deireadh na bliana 1986.  Mar sin tá an tUdarás agus an Ghaeltacht ag déanamh a gcuid maidir le comhlíonadh na spriocanna fostaíochta a leagadh amach sa Chlár um Théarnamh Náisiúnta.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sílim nach bhfuil a fhios ag an Taoiseach go pearsanta céard go díreach atá ag tarlú sna Gaeltachtaí faoi láthair.  Is iad fostaíocht agus forbairt eacnamaíochta na deacrachtaí is mó atá ann faoi láthair.  Freisin, tá na deacrachtaí ginearálta ó thaobh fhorbairt náisiúnta na <Col N="2589" /> teanga de ann.  Thart ar fud gach ceantar Gaeltachta freisin tá cúrsaí bóithre agus eile go huafásach ar fad.  I ráiteas an Aire Stáit bhí ar a laghad a cúig nó a sé de thagairtí do ghéarchéim airgid ag baint leis na Meastacháin seo.  Is dócha nach féidir leis an Rialtas fadhbanna eacnamaíochta na nGaeltachtaí a shárú gan infheistíocht sách ard a chur isteach iontu. Agus ar leathanach a 8 de ráiteas an Taoisigh ar maidin dúirt sé go bhfuil an iomarca dífhostaíochta ann, go bhfuil an iomarca ag dul ar imirce agus gur trí fheabhsú eacnamaíochta amháin gur féidir leis an staid uafásach seo a réiteach. Sin as ráiteas an Taoisigh féin ar maidin.</P>
    <P>Is é Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhfuil an dualgas air postanna a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí, agus le cúpla bliain anuas tá a fhios ag gach uile dhuine go raibh sé ag éirí níos deacra tionsclóirí a mhealladh isteach sna háiteanna iargúlta atá i bhfad ó na bailte móra agus eile.  Cuireann drochstaid na mbóithre agus drochchumarsáid go ginearálta isteach go mór ar an obair seo.  Caithfear, mar sin, díriú isteach ar fhorbairt ár n-acmhainní nádúrtha ó thaobh na farraige, ó thaobh chúrsaí talmhaíochta, cúrsaí turasóir-eachta agus eile.  Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh sé dochreidte go raibh ar an Aire Stáit teacht isteach anseo inné agus a rá linn nach mbeadh an tÚdarás in ann aon togra eile a mheas nó a cheadú i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom go maith go raibh raic ar siúl ar fud na tíre cúpla bliain ó shin nuair a thug an Comhrialtas a bhí in oifig ag an am an méid céanna airgid don Údarás dhá bhliain i ndiaidh a chéile. Ach níor tharla a leithéid seo riamh.  Tá sé thar a bheith dochreidte go bhfuil an Rialtas féin ag caint i gcónaí faoi postanna a chur ar fáil agus an mhuintir a choimeád sa bhaile agus ag an am céanna nach mbeidh sé ar a gcumas ag an Údarás, a bhfuil sé mar dhualgas orthu postanna a chur ar fáil, oiread agus togra amháin eile a cheadú i mbliana.  Tá an Rialtas ag rá leo siúd a bheas ag dul ar imirce i mbliana nach mbeidh ach fíorbheagán postanna le fáil ag éirí as na tograí a ceadaíodh anuraidh, agus go bhfuil brón orthu, mar adéarfá, faoi.  Sílim nach dtarlódh sé seo leis an gCaidreamh Forbairt Tionsclaíochta. <Col N="2590" /> An bhfuil an Rialtas ag rá linne dá mbeadh tionsclóir ón Tuirc toilteanach tionscal a chur ar fáil agus a bhunú áit ar bith in Eirinn go dtabharfaí cabhair agus deontais dó in áit amháin agus nach dtabharfaí cabhair nó deontas ar bith dó i gceantar Gaeltachta toisc nach mbeadh sé ar a gcumas ag an Údarás a thogra a mheas i mbliana?  Dúirt an tAire Stáit freisin inné go raibh trí dhuine is fiche ag glacadh leis an scéim iomarcaíochta taobh istigh den Údarás.  Cuirfidh sé seo níos mó ar oifigigh an Údaráis na tograí a mheas agus a phlé agus, ar deireadh, iad a cheadú.  Mar sin, tá sé thar a bheith míshásúil agus an méid atá ag dul ar imirce faoi láthair.  Deirtear linne go mbeidh ar a laghad easnamh thrí mhilliún punt ag an Údarás ag deireadh na bliana seo má leantar ar aghaidh leis an gcaiteachas mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Is drochscéal é sin, mura dtabharfaí breis airgid dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ag caint ó thaobh fhorbairt na n-acmhainní náisiúnta de tá sé fíor, mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, go raibh agus go bhfuil an tÚdarás ina gceannródaithe ó thaobh na feirmeoireachta éisc de, agus tá togha oibre déanta ag an Údarás sa mhuir-obair seo le cúpla bliain anuas.  Ach de réir tuarascáil a tháinig amach ón ESRI cúpla mí ó shin deirtear linn go mbeidh luach an tionscail seo níos mó ná £100 milliún ag deireadh 1993.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach, mar sin, go mbeadh airgead breise tugtha don Údarás ó thaobh fhorbairt na hoibre seo.  Tá níos mó ná seacht milliún punt ceadaithe do fheirmeoireacht éisc ag an Údarás go dtí seo.  Is é sin, tá 80 faoin gcéad den airgead sin ceadaithe le dhá bhlain anuas.  Ag éirí as na tograí atá ceadaithe le dhá bhliain anuas beidh idir £4 mhilliún agus £5 mhilliún ag teastáil ag deireadh 1990, ag éirí as tograí a ceadaíodh cheana, agus ní bheish sé ar a gcumas ag an Údarás a ndualgas a chomhlíonadh ó thaobh fheirmeoireacht éisc de, mura dtabharfaí airgead breise don Údarás, gan bacaint leis na tograí atá ag teacht isteach ag an bpointe seo agus nach féidir iad a mheas.  I gcomhthéacs na gceithre mhilliún punt de ghearradh siar a bhfuil an tAire Airgeadais ag caint faoi, sílim go mbeidh trioblóid ag an <Col N="2591" /> Údarás as seo amach mura dtabharfar an t-airgead breise sin dóibh i mbliana agus sa chéad bhliain eile i dtreo is go mbeidh siad in ann a ndualgais a chomhlíonadh ag éirí as na tograí atá ceadaithe acu go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé soiléir, mar sin, go bhfuil agus go mbeidh airgead breise ag teastáil ón Údarás, agus os rud é go bhfuil an Meastachán seo taobh istigh de Roinn an Taoisigh iarraim air cinneadh dearfa a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo le go mbeidh sé ar a gcumas ag an Údarás postanna a chur ar fáil, ag éirí as tograí atá ceadaithe. Ar leathanach a 6 de ráiteas an Taoisigh, freisin, tá, sé ag caint ansin faoin fhorbairt is féidir a dhéanamh faoin obair seo ach go gcaithfear deireadh a chur le truailliú uisce ó thaobh lochanna agus aibhneacha de.  Sílim go mba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mo de chomhordú idir na Ranna Stáit atá ag déileáil leis na nithe seo.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit féin gur ceadaíodh togra le déanaí i Loch na Fuaithe do scéim fheirmeoireacht éisc agus diúltaíodh an ceann seo cúpla bliain ó shin agus tá sé faoi láthair roimh an Bhord Pleanála.  Tá a fhios at an Aire Stáit freisin go bhfuil an méid sin daoine ag baint úsáid as an uisce atá ag teacht as Loch Measc, agus tá sé sin ceangailte le Loch na Fuaithe. Tá mé an-imníoch faoi sin, agus sílim go mba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó de chomhordú idir na Ranna Stáit atá ag déileáil leis seo.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh Bhord na Gaeilge de, tá anobair déanta ag an mBord.  Sílim go mba chóir don Taoiseach agus don Aire Stáit cinneadh a dhéanamh faoin bPlean Gníomhaíochta atá curtha os a gcomhair ag an mbord.  Tá an t-am ag dul thart, agus más fíor é go bhfuil an dualgas ar an mBord an teanga a fhorbairt agus obair a dhéanamh sa chomhthéacs sin, sílim go mba chóir don Rialtas cinneadh dearfa a dhéanamh go luath faoin bPlean Gníomhaíochta ata luaite agam.  Freisin, ba mhaith liom go mbeadh ráiteas iomlán curtha ar fáil ón Rialtas faoin bpolasaí atá ag an Rialtas seo faoin nGaeilge i gcoitinne.  An bhfuil polasaí ar bith acu faoi dhátheangachas, nó céard atá ag tarlú sa chomhthéacs sin?  Deirtear linn <Col N="2592" /> gur caitheadh níos mó ná £160 milliún anuraidh ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge.  I rith na bliana bhí imní ar na mná faoi chúrsaí cánach.</P>
    <P>Ag deireadh, ba maith liom trí phointe eile a lua.  Ó thaobh Theilifís na Gaeltachta de, tá súil agam go ndéanfar cinneadh faoi seo go luath, agus tá súil agam freisin go mbeidh an scéim phiolóta seo oiriúnach don tír ar fad agus gan é a bheith oiriúnach do áit amháin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil plean curtha os comhair an Taoisigh agus os comhair na Roinne, agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire Stáit cinneadh dearfa faoi seo go luath freisin.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh seans ag an Teach seo tuairimí agus Tuarascáil an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge a phlé. Tá Teachtaí thart anseo a bhfuil sé ar a gcumas acu an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus ba mhaith leo seans a bheith acu é sin a fhorbairt.  Agus an pointe deireanach, an scéim fógraíochta atá curtha ar siúl, níl maitheas ar bith leis an Rialtas an t-airgead sin a chur ar fáil bliain amháin gan é a chur ar fáil an chéad bhliain eile.  Ní bheidh sé ar a gcumas ag an gcomhchoiste a luach a mheas mura mbíonn an t-airgead ann an chéad bhliain eile.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom ar dtus cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an óráid a thug an Teachta Kenny uaidh anois díreach.  Tá sé soiléir ó óráid an Taoisigh agus ó óráid an Aire Stáit sa Teach seo inné go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht an-tábhachtach i súile an Rialtais, agus go bhfuil an Rialtas ag forbairt na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.  Mar a dúirt an Taoiseach in a óráid faoin fhostaíocht, is méadú 5.5 faoin gcéad a bhí ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe sa tionscal ansin ag deireadh na bliana 1986.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil na Teachtaí tugtha do na staitisticí agus go mbeadh riméad orainn go léir dá mba rud é go raibh sé sin fíor i ngach cearn den tír.  Dúirt an Teachta gur chóir go mbeadh an Roinn faoi Aire éigin eile, ach dar liomsa ní fhéadfadh sé a bheith faoi Roinn níos tábhachtaí ná Roinn an Taoisigh: taispeánann sé sin go bhfuil tábhacht <Col N="2593" /> faoi leith ag baint leis an Ghaeltacht agus leis an Ghaeilge Ó thaobh an Rialtais de.</P>
      <P>Tá Comhaltaíag caint faoi imirce.  Mise agus an Teachta Jim Kemmy, is dóigh liom, an bheirt sa Teach seo a raibh orainn dul ar imirce uair amháin, agus tá eolas faoi leith againn faoi.  Tá polasaí ag an Rialtas seo fostaíocht a chur ar fáil agus deireadh a chur leis an imirce sin a luaithe agus is féidir.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Kenny, ceannródaithe a bhí in Údarás na Gaeltachta mar gheall ar fheirmeoireacht éisc.  Tá sé fíor gur ceannródaithe i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta Rialtais éagsúla Fhianna Fáil leis na blianta.</P>
      <P>Since the Government assumed office last year, the two areas of economic activity covered by my portfolio &mdash; tourism and transport &mdash; have witnessed major initiatives and key policy reorientations aimed at achieving the ambitious targets for growth set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Government's commitment to the development of the tourist industry has been placed on record on frequent occasions in this House since they assumed office in March 1987.  We have selected the development of tourism as an area of top national priority, with the straightforward objective of recovering the ground lost in recent years and ensuring that this employment intensive industry realises its vast employment-generating potential.  In the transport area, the emphasis has been on the development of policy and regulatory frameworks which will allow the various modes to meet the challenges and opportunities of the move towards increased liberalisation and in particular, to improve the quality and effectiveness of their contribution to the rest of the economy and to national development in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1987, as we know, represented a milestone for the tourist industry. For the first time, total tourism revenue topped the £1 billion mark.  Over 2.1 million visitors came to Ireland and total out-of-State revenue amounted to over £720 million.  This represented an increase of 12 per cent and 11 per cent <Col N="2594" /> respectively, on the 1986 performance. The domestic market where performance in recent years had been disappointing, improved dramatically in 1987 with revenue reaching £290 million &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent on 1986.  We are trying to follow that up in 1988 because it is an area that has been neglected.</P>
    <P>Arising from this improved performance, it is estimated that 7,500 additional job equivalents have been created by the increase in tourism last year. The Government's May 1987 crash programme contributed in no small way to this growth.  This is but the first step towards the realisation of the Government's objective, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, of doubling the number of foreign visitors, generating an additional £500 million in tourism revenue and creating an additional 25,000 jobs in tourism over the next five years.</P>
    <P>To consolidate 1987's positive results, this year the Government set aside an additional £4 million in the budget for the implementation by Bord Fáilte of a further programme of special measures for this year's tourist season.  As Deputies are aware a special tourism task force was established by Government to recommend how this additional money might best be spent.  Based on the recommendations of the task force, the Government, at the beginning of March, approved a major and innovative series of measures aimed at significantly boosting tourist numbers and revenue this year. This £4 million expenditure programme is now being implemented by Bord Fáilte and will complement the Board's ongoing promotional and marketing activities. Overall, it is estimated that the 1988 campaign will result in an increase in visitor numbers of 300,000 and of tourism revenue by up to £75 million, and the creation of 4,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the 1988 campaign is in our principal markets in the UK, continental Europe and the US.  The campaign is more inclusive and targeted than heretofore.  The tourist industry has responded positively to the 1988 promotion campaign and has pledged an extra £2 million to supplement the <Col N="2595" /> Government's efforts.  This top-up from the industry demonstrates their full support for the Government's measures and their total willingness to be actively involved.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the intensive campaign to attract more tourists to our shores is matched by a complementary tourist product development programme by the various operators in the industry. Since I announced details of the business expansion scheme as it applies to tourism, last December, Bord Fáilte have received over 2,500 inquiries and 38 applications involving potential investment of over £16 million.  The interest shown in the business expansion scheme undoubtedly reflects the confidence which investors and enterpreneurs have in the future prospects of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>Given the encouraging signs for the first quarter of the year and the implementation of the programme of special tourism measures which I referred to earlier, we can confidently expect that the targeted increases of 300,000 in overseas visitor numbers will be achieved along with the corresponding spin-off benefits for revenue generation and employment creation.  Confidence now abounds in tourism and it is our intention that this confidence should be translated into further and significant growth this year and for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In the field of air transport, events have been moving rapidly in the related areas of deregulation and improved access services. On 14 December 1987 the EC Council of Ministers adopted a package of liberalisation measures as a first step towards the completion of the internal market in air transport.  Our strategy in these negotiations was heavily influenced by the importance of access transport fares in a tourism context.  Opportunities for lower air fares and market access were seen to be of vital importance to Ireland and the measures adopted went a long way towards meeting our needs in this regard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, earlier this year I signed a memorandum of understanding on revised arrangements for air services <Col N="2596" /> between Ireland and the UK.  These new arrangements in the areas of access fares and capacity sharing go far beyond the terms of the EC transport package.  I pointed this out at the Council of Ministers, and pointed out that this could be a good exemplar for them for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the development of Irish tourism and the liberalisation of European air transport with new opportunities for Irish air carriers necessitated a fundamental reappraisal of the objectives for Irish air transport regulatory policy earlier this year.  Following this appraisal I announced new objectives for Irish aviation policy, emphasising the need to serve tourism, trade and industry interests at the lowest economic cost, the promotion of competition and the development of a soundly-based Irish air transport industry.</P>
    <P>Consistent with these policy objectives, I have given approval to Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Club Air for the inauguration of new scheduled services on a wide range of international routes to both the UK and the Continent. Developments on the domestic front have also been significant, with new services to and from Connaught, Sligo and Galway airports being introduced.  These developments reflect the importance of the region in developing the economy and particularly the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Following my discussions earlier this year with our air carriers, all our main markets have fares and capacity in place for the summer season and indications are that traffic in line with, and in many cases ahead of, the Government's targets for growth from the various tourist markets should be achieved this year.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, I am happy to say, have responded particularly well to challenges of tourism targets and increased competition. I am expecting that further record profits of around £30 million will be earned this year, the third year in succession that record profits have been achieved.  Aer Lingus management and employees are to be congratulated on this performance, which is enabling the airline to finance the initial phases of their fleet replacement plans from their own <Col N="2597" /> resources and without recourse to the Exchequer and without Government guarantees.  The company's fleet replacement programme is on target.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated on State airports, but the potential of our regional airports, too, must be developed.  My Department are currently undertaking a detailed examination of the overall position of regional airports from a tourism point of view and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on this issue shortly.  Arising from Government's policies in the aviation area, a number of the regional airports, particularly those at Galway and Connaught, are booming and passenger traffic has achieved levels considerably in excess of original expectations.</P>
    <P>In the overall access transport sector, ferry services continue to play a significant role.  As recently as Tuesday of this week, I informed the House about the encouraging performance of B &amp; I, to the effect that for the first four months of the year, the company's performance was £800,000 better than forecast under their plan of action.  That plan forecasts an operating loss of £1.7 million for 1988 and a net loss, after interest charges, of £6.2 million.  As the House will be aware, the Government are providing B &amp; I with limited Exchequer support of up to £11 million for 1988 and will be reviewing the position of the company later this year.  I have exhorted the board of B &amp; I to make every effort to improve, if at all possible, on their current level of performance.</P>
    <P>In the road transport area attention has inevitably been directed to the realisation of the single European market in 1992. The removal of all barriers to trade is the cornerstone of this concept and the transport sector has a fundamental and vital role to play in achieving this aim. We cannot have a situation whereby our goods may move freely within the Community but the means of transporting those goods are restricted by virtue of quotas or prohibitions of one type or another.  Exporters are dependent on an effective and efficient road transport industry to get their goods to market.  We have been working at EC level to achieve <Col N="2598" /> a liberalised system of road transport which would allow such free access.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that in fact we have reached agreement in the EC Transport Council this month for guaranteed increases in the Community quota of authorisations for multilateral haulage licences for 1988 and 1989.  This should enable us to meet in full the needs of Irish hauliers who wish to exploit the European market and I hope that they will make full use of these opportunities, including the opportunities for increased employment in Ireland, now being made available to them.  More significantly, from 1 January 1993 all such restrictive quotas will be abolished.  Our hauliers will now be able to plan their future in this industry in terms of new market potential, fleet requirements, etc., in the knowledge that access to the market will be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation has also a high priority in the domestic field.  In this regard by the end of next September access to the national market will be fully opened up and potential new hauliers will only have to comply with the three EC requirements of good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence.  These new arrangements, when finalised, will have the effect of bringing about a new professionalism and so ensure the continued development of a strong and healthy road haulage industry.</P>
    <P>Another development which will aid our international haulage sector is the recent signature of a bilateral agreement with Yugoslavia which will facilitate access to markets in eastern Europe and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I dealt in some detail with CIE in my Estimates speech last week and do not propose to deal with the matter further at this stage.</P>
    <P>The bus passenger transport sector, both national and international, is another area where there has been significant activity over the past 12 months or so.  With regard to the domestic bus passenger market, a review of the operation of the Road Transport Act, 1932, which regulates the licensing of bus services, is now completed.  I am satisfied <Col N="2599" /> that the restrictive provisions of this Act are no longer fully relevant to today's transport market.  In considering policy for the future, I have had to weigh up the need to cater for the basic transport needs of the people, particularly in rural and less densely populated areas, the demands of commercial bus operators in the private sector for greater access to the market and its implications for CIE and the consequences of the EC's initiatives aimed at completion of the internal market by 1992.  It is my intention to introduce new legislation in the Oireachtas later this year to provide the necessary statutory basis for a more upto-date policy for the bus passenger sector.</P>
    <P>As regards international passenger transport, there are currently two very significant proposals for Council regulations before the Council of Transport Ministers but not very much progress has been made on that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the real achievements in both the tourism and transport sectors which I have outlined today and in the course of introducing my Department's Estimates last week gave grounds for real optimism for the future.  On a personal level, I have been particularly gratified by the enthusiasm and energy with which the industries as a whole, both the State-sponsored bodies and the private sector, have responded to the Government's initiatives, and I look forward to building on these achievements in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the Taoiseach's statement this morning and I join with other Deputies in the House in hoping that his recovery will be complete and speedy.  It was extraordinary that the Taoiseach in an Adjournment debate devoted two paragraphs only to the North of Ireland &mdash;<Col N="2600" /> which really constituted a report of his meeting with the British Prime Minister in Hanover earlier this week whereas I should have thought it was one of the major concerns of any Government of this country.  I am glad to see that one of those paragraphs reaffirmed our total commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and that our intention is to work closely together in accordance with its terms.  That is something I am very pleased about but I question whether the practice matches up to the preaching in this case.  Nearly three months have elapsed between the last two meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Frankly, I think this is a dismal performance from the Government especially given the fact that the Taoiseach has commented so frequently and so publicly in recent times about his willingness to engage in talks with all parties involved in the pursuit of peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Continuing and consistent meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference are essential to maintain the confidence of all groups in the mechanism of the Anglo-Irish process and to build up familiarity and trust between individuals and communities whose future is safeguarded by the agreement.  Unless the Government are prepared to adopt a more robust and positive approach, unless they are willing to push for more regular meetings, then the Irish Government cannot expect to be fully cognisant of developments in each sphere of the agreement's competence, nor can they expect to be in any reasonable position to achieve real results through the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the change of Government last year I have consistently called for more regular meetings of the conference.  I have said, and I still believe, that many of the problems earlier this year, for example, Stalker-Sampson &mdash; I will refer to that again later &mdash; the Birmingham Six, extradition, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the McAnespie shooting, the release of Private Tain and Gibraltar could have been handled differently and certainly their impact on Anglo-Irish relations could have been less damaging had the <Col N="2601" /> conference been meeting.  I thought the Government had learned this lesson when the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced at the conclusion of the March meeting that the next meeting would be held shortly.  That &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; turned out to be nearly three months.  I again counsel the Government and the Taoiseach against allowing lethargy and indifference to creep into this process during the summer months.  In just over 12 weeks time the first complete review of the work of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will take place.  It is the task of the Government to ensure the momentum for progress and achievement increases as the review date draws nearer.  There can be no slackening now as we approach what will be a major hurdle for the agreement in November.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has indicated on a number of occasions, most recently in Hanover earlier this week, his desire to engage in talks with the different parties in Northern Ireland.  I do not believe I am alone in questioning the strength of intention behind those indications.  The kind of dialogue to which the Taoiseach has referred requires all parties involved to be actively committed and to engage in the process.  Public statements do not constitute dialogue.  I do not believe I am alone in wanting confirmation of the substance which underlies these public statements.  Has the Taoiseach formally invited either or both the Unionist leaders to meet him?  If the Taoiseach sincerely wishes to achieve some real progress, he might usefully pursue a substantial dialogue with the Unionist community within the framework which recognises the timetable that is embodied in the review.  Such a move would inspire some confidence in the kind of statements which the Taoiseach has been making in the past few months.</P>
    <P>The potential for success in any of the talks which the Taoiseach may undertake over the coming months will depend on his ability to convince all parties that he has a clear, unambiguous and constructive vision of the future for all communities <Col N="2602" /> on this island.  It is disturbing for many of us in this House that the further the Taoiseach travels from Ireland and the Irish people the more romantic is the transformation and explanation of his vision of our collective future here at home.  He should know full well that consistency is essential to confidence building.  Playing to knee-jerk republicanism in New York may be a useful exercise for Fianna Fáil fund-raising purposes but the stability and safety of the Anglo-Irish process should not be made to serve such partisan economic ends.  Does he seriously think that the Unionist parties do not compare the soft voice here at home issuing an invitation to talks with the harsh voice used to address the party faithful in New York, laying claim as they see it to their heritage? Let the Taoiseach concentrate his efforts in convincing those of us at home, North and South, Unionists and Nationalists, that he and his party are prepared to work for a constructive future for all communities on this island.</P>
    <P>Such a programme of action must focus on basic issues and areas where there has been little or no progress even during the past three years of the agreement's existence.  The achievement of the agreement to date cannot be used as an excuse for not pursuing settlements of more complex questions.  The fundamental issues which cannot be added to or deleted from the agenda, depending entirely on the political climate, must include (1) the administration of justice, (2) improving the relationship between the Nationalist community and the security forces and (3) the whole area of improving economic development in Northern Ireland and the Border areas.  Those three items must be on the agenda of every meeting of the Conference.</P>
    <P>The decision announced yesterday by the Northern Ireland Police Authority not to discipline the three senior officers of the force is another example of the need to tackle urgently the problems of confidence in the security forces as laid down in Article 7 of the agreement.  A majority of one on a 16 person council could hardly be described as a vote of <Col N="2603" /> confidence in the three men concerned. As the Kelly report finds against officers at lower levels, does this mean that in the RUC the buck stops below the highest level?  In my view the three people involved should resign.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the agreement provides that the conference &ldquo;shall provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events.&rdquo;  Did the last meeting of the conference discuss the then forthcoming police authority report or the still to be published Kelly report?  Did the Irish Government point out to the British Government the serious erosion of confidence in the security forces these incidents were causing?  The implications of yesterday's decision are so serious that the Government should now hold a special meeting of the conference to point this out to the UK Government.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to the Anglo-Irish Agreement is the question of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and creating a social climate where there is unquestioned assurance that both communities can and will receive equal treatment before the courts.  It is essential that there be an awareness of competent and close scrutiny of the operation of the courts in the framework of the agreement. For that reason the Government must ensure that the agenda continues to focus on aspects of the court system operation which can be improved.</P>
    <P>I want again to refer to the Diplock courts.  Both Governments agreed when signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement that a fundamental part of the work to be done was building confidence in the administration of justice.  The Irish side felt that substituting three judges for one judge will go some of the way to achieving this aim.  I do not want to go back over the whole history of this suggestion; suffice it to say it was unacceptable at that time to the British Government.  However, the UK have still, after nearly three years, failed to bring forward any suggestions of their own.  The Irish Government should now formally say to the UK Government that they wish to see the present one <Col N="2604" /> judge Diplock courts replaced by three judge courts.</P>
    <P>On the relationship between the Nationalist community and the security forces, the Government must make strenuous efforts to redeem the Government's failure through lack of vigilance to secure a satisfactory outcome to the Stalker-Sampson affair by ensuring that the response of the RUC to the Kelly report allows not only that justice is done but is unquestionably seen to be done. This is so important for confidence in the security forces in the North that a separate meeting of the conference should now be called for by the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe a new perspective is involved in Anglo-Irish affairs.  The question of devolved Government in Northern Ireland has received consideration from all parties, not all of it unfavourable. However, openness at the notion of a devolved structure is only the beginning and must be used as a stepping up point for discussion as to what kind of structure would be acceptable to all parties who would have to participate in the working of a devolved Government.  If the Taoiseach is sincere in his stated desire to engage in dialogue with the Unionist community in the North, this would seem to be the most practical base on which to commence.  Many matters will have to be dealt with before the conditions for devolved power are in place and the workload would provide incontrovertible evidence of the real substance of the Taoiseach's commitment to the dialogue, to progress and to peace in Northern Ireland, a peace that should be shared equally between all the citizens of the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment in opening the debate this morning described in some detail the substantial progress which we have made since last year's budget in putting the economy <Col N="2605" /> back on the path to growth.  I do not propose to go over the ground again. However, I would like to underscore some key points in the light of the issues raised in the subsequent debate.  At the outset I would like to place all the comments, suggestions and criticisms we have heard in this debate in their proper context.</P>
      <P>The Government's economic and social policy in the 15 months or so in which we have been in office has had one central objective: to create a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth over the years ahead.  Experience in recent years has shown that real economic progress depends vitally on a restoration of confidence both at home and abroad in Ireland's determination to resolve its problems and to move forward. That determination was shown throughout 1987.  A firm grip was imposed on the budget.  Difficult decisions were taken and implemented. We faced a situation where the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement at over 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 was clearly unsustainable.  We took firm and decisive action to reduce Exchequer borrowing by 3 percentage points of GNP in 1987.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for the Environment pointed out, last year was, in many important respects, the best year for the economy in many years.  This year we are building on the progress achieved in 1987. The January budget set equally ambitious targets for 1988.  These envisage a further reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement by 2 percentage points of GNP.  These targets, I am confident, will be met once again.  Exchequer returns to date indicate that we are well on the way to meeting our objectives for this year.</P>
      <P>Our actions over the last 15 months are already meeting with some success.  I am confident that, despite the continued tight budgetary policy, 1988 will see a continuation of growth.  The early indicators of economic developments in 1988 support this view:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Exports have continued to perform well; volumes in the year to date are <Col N="2606" /> 12 per cent up on 1987 and, encouragingly, the growth is again broadly based.</P>
    <P>&mdash;On the domestic front, the limited evidence available supports our view of prospects at the time of the budget.  We expressed the view then that the potential could exist for some modest rise in consumer expenditure in 1988.  The volume of retail sales in the first four months is up slightly on the corresponsing period of 1987.  Car registrations to April show a rise of 8 per cent on the first four months of last year. The signs for business investment too are pointing in the right direction.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Manufacturing production in the first quarter of 1988 showed growth of 19 per cent compared with the same period last year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Inflation has continued to moderate. In the year to May last the rise in consumer prices was only 1.8 per cent, the lowest rate for a quarter of a century.  Indeed, there is a good prospect that inflation could be lower than the 2 per cent we expected at budget time.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Registered unemployment has declined by just over 10,000 in the year to the end of May.</P>
    <P>The early, but necessarily limited, evidence on the economy's performance this year is, therefore, fairly encouraging. While there is a long way to go yet, I remain hopeful that real GNP will show positive growth in 1988.  Taken together with the advance in 1987, this would mean that growth over the two years will have been significantly stronger than in any two successive years of the decade so far.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to a subject which has attracted much comment in recent weeks &mdash; the possible future trend of interest rates.  I want to say, first of all, that the dramatic fall in interest rates since the last year's budget is a clear indication of market confidence in the Government's realistic fiscal stance. <Col N="2607" /> Since March last year, the prime overdraft rate of the Associated Banks has fallen by up to 6 percentage points to 8 per cent, its lowest level in over a decade and is now 2½ percentage points below the equivalent UK rate.  The recent upward pressure on interest rates internationally is of concern because interest rates in Ireland are influenced by the international trend of interest rates as well as by domestic economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that international interest rates will now settle before eventually moving lower.  In such circumstances I would be confident that a continuation of our present economic policy, particularly our fiscal policy, will be sufficient to at least keep Irish interest rates at their existing levels.</P>
    <P>I have kept in close touch with the debate in the House and I want now to reply to some points raised by Deputies throughout the day.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how Deputy Dukes could claim that most of the credit for the improvement in the EBR is due to the last Government.  Everybody knows that when that Government left office there was a crisis in the public finances. At the end of 1986 the EBR, as a percentage of GNP of 13.2 was higher than at the end of 1983 when it was 13 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 10 per cent down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>What the present Government have achieved, mainly as a result of resolute action in reducing public expenditure, is a dramatic turnaround in the situation.  The 1987 and 1988 budgets taken together provide for a reduction in Exchequer borrowing of no less than five percentage points of GNP.  Nobody can deny the fact that the progress made has had a profound impact in restoring confidence and helping to create the right conditions for investment and growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer returns for the first six months of the year will be available tomorrow.  They will show clearly that <Col N="2608" /> the 1988 budget is being implemented satisfactorily.  There are encouraging trends in both revenue and expenditure. While final figures are not yet available, they are likely to show that Exchequer borrowing, as a percentage of the annual budget target, will this year be significantly down on figures in recent years. This is a reflection of the extent to which the public finances have been brought under control.  As regards the year as a whole the indications are that, if these trends continue, the outturn for Exchequer borrowing will not only be achieved but will be inside the budget target for the second year in succession. This is a welcome change from the problems of large overruns and missed targets of earlier years.</P>
    <P>Part of the higher than expected revenue yield this year derives from the measures taken in the budget to improve collection and assessment of taxes.  The incentive scheme to settle arrears of tax appears to be playing a significant role in bringing in revenue.  It is gratifying that this scheme is achieving its objective.  By its nature, of course, the scheme is available only up to end September and we cannot look to a similar boost to our revenue in 1989.  Some of the other measures will have continuing effect in future years and, as well as bringing in some welcome additional revenue, will help to ensure a fairer and more efficient taxation system.</P>
    <P>The excellent results from the budgetary adjustments already made should encourage everybody to stick to the task. Despite the encouraging trends to which I referred, there is no escaping the fact that sizeable adjustments will continue to be needed in 1989.  The Government are determined to complete the process on which we have embarked, so as to free resources for job creation and generally to give more room for manoeuvre in tackling the underlying problems of the economy.</P>
    <P>One of these problems is the excessive burden of taxation &mdash; especially income tax.  The income tax burden continues despite the reductions we were able to make this year &mdash; reductions which <Col N="2609" /> Opposition Deputies have sought to play down but which we must all agree, if we are being honest with ourselves, would have been way out of reach 12 months ago.  We are determined to secure further relief for income tax payers as soon as possible.  The way to do this is to continue to reduce excessive public expenditure, which is the mirror image of excessive taxation.  Only in this way can we secure a lasting reduction in the tax burden. We must also use every opportunity to streamline the tax system, make it more equitable and make it more encouraging of job creation, on the lines of the major changes we have made this year in company taxation.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Dukes Fine Gael tax policy is revenue neutral &mdash; I am glad to hear this.  The fact remains, however, that his party have failed to spell out clearly how they would raise the money needed to finance the tax reductions they have advanced.  In relation to taxation, what the Opposition are talking about amounts to a redistribution of taxation. This Government, on the other hand, want to be in a position where, in line with the improvement in the public finances, we can actually lower taxation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that the Government have not been doing enough in relation to 1992 and the completion of the EC internal market.  I cannot accept this.  The steps the Government have taken since coming into office were fully set out by the Minister for the Environment in opening this debate this morning.  There is no need for one to repeat them.  The awareness campaign which the Taoiseach will launch next week will see our preparations move on to a new level.  I do not agree with Deputy Dukes that this launch will be a cosmetic exercise.  It will be the start of a comprehensive and co-ordinated campaign in both the public and the private sectors to ensure that all who will be affected by the internal market will know what the implications are and be prepared to meet them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley called for a White Paper on the cost and benefits of the completion of the internal market and <Col N="2610" /> said that the budgetary implications should be made clear.  The Government have not ruled out the possibility of publishing a White Paper.  It is difficult to determine when it would be most appropriate to publish one.  There is an ongoing stream of new proposals emerging from the Commission as well as earlier proposals being adapted in discussions. There is not just one settled range of measures to be implemented.  The general principles may be clear but the detailed measures are evolving over time.</P>
    <P>The overall budgetary implications of the internal market are very difficult to predict.  They will depend on how well Ireland responds to the challenges and opportunities which it presents.  The most immediate budgetary implication is, of course, that arising from the indirect tax harmonisation proposals.  If accepted in their present form, these would involve a minimum revenue loss of £470 million in the first year and £350 million a year thereafter.  This assumes the application of the higher end of the range of VAT rates allowed under the Commission proposal, including applying them to the items currently zero rated.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Deputy Dukes' comments this morning in relation to the decision of the police authority for Northern Ireland, which was announced yesterday.  The Government's disappointment was expressed in our statement yesterday evening.  We have consistently expressed our deep concern about what is now referred to as the Stalker-Sampson affair.  This concern was confirmed by yesterday's statement by the police authority, and, in particular, by its conclusion by a majority of one that it was not necessary to appoint an investigating officer to inquire further into Mr. Sampson's observations.  The Government have instructed that our concern in this matter be conveyed to the British authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to employment, if I have a few minutes because it is not easy to reply to all the points that have been made but several Deputies raised the issue of unemployment and emigration. The Government are deeply <Col N="2611" /> concerned about those problems and their alleviation is one of the main aims of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The sharp fall in unemployment of 10,000 in the year to end May is not simply the result of emigration.</P>
    <P>Prospects for employment in the private sector of the economy are improving. This is the view of the OECD as expressed in its most recent assessment of the Irish economy.  The latest indications are that the capacity of the economy to create jobs in private sector services, which account for over one third of total non-agricultural employment, is greater than had previously been estimated.  This year we expect continued strong employment growth in this sector, particularly in tourism.</P>
    <P>As regards manufacturing employment, the output figures for the manufacturing sector for the first quarter of this year show an increase of just over 19 per cent on the comparable period of 1987.  The increases are widely spread. This points to an improved outlook for employment in the more labour intensive industries.  At the end of May, in the joint Government-ICTU statement on job creation developments under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> it was announced that the three job creation agencies were satisfied that approximately 20,000 extra jobs would be created this year and over 4,000 first time jobs had already been created in the first quarter of 1988.  The statement also gave details of the progress made in the various sectors of the economy since the Government came into office and of what was expected for 1988.  Of special note among these was the achievement of additional employment equivalent to almost 7,500 work years in tourism in 1987 with a similar level of job creation expected from this sector in 1988.</P>
    <P>I can, therefore, say that, not only are the policies pursued by this Government since they came into office creating an environment for sustainable growth, but also that there has been a quickening of actual job creation in the private sector. These developments should result in <Col N="2612" /> overall positive employment growth in 1988.</P>
    <P>As to the trend in net emigration, the latest figures relate to mid-April 1987 and show a net emigration figure of 27,000. There is no firm information so far on trends since that date.</P>
    <P>We all hope the continuing progress being made and the results of the policies being pursued by the Government will slow down emigration and lower the unemployment figure.  I was listening to the debate and heard almost all speakers criticise the Government for lost opportunities, for not doing this, that or the other, and in the next breath saying their parties were responsible for the progress that has been made over the last 18 months, contradictions we have become used to.</P>

      <P>One of the things I found very amusing was mentioned by Deputy Desmond.  He spoke about the fact that we had placed so much emphasis on the word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;.  I want to tell the Deputy and all concerned that we are proud, as a party and as a Government, to have restored confidence among the Irish people in their ability to overcome their problems.</P>
      <P>Let us realise what confidence does. Confidence creates investment, investment means jobs, means a reduction in unemployment, a reduction in emigration, means that progress and prosperity will return once again and, above all, means that there will be savings on Government expenditure, which will lead to a reduction in the huge national debt we inherited when we returned to office 15 months ago, on which we are making massive progress in the area of stabilisation and eventually of reducing the figure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael Keating gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of cutbacks in services in the Office of Consumer Affairs.  Deputy Keating has approximately eight minutes and the balance to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  In the few minutes that are available to us I hope to convey to the Minister of State and the Government the very serious issue that has arisen in relation to the obvious inadequacy of consumer protection.  Most of us were startled to be informed, through the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, that the situation was so bad in terms of being able to cope with inquiries from the public that the unfortunate gentleman had to say to the nation at large that henceforth it would be simply impossible to adequately cope with public inquiries.</P>
      <P>It was not simply that there was to be a downscaling, or 50 per cent reduction in effect, in his capacity to answer telephone inquiries.  His press release made it very clear that he also has very severe difficulties at present in handling any form of personal caller, in dealing with written inquiries and, in essence therefore, in coping competently and comprehensively with inquiries at any level in relation to consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This must be taken in context with a number of other developments that had occurred in the last year or two, and I include in that the winding up of certain areas of consumer protection, a clear signalling by the Consumers' Association of Ireland that they themselves might have to wind up in view of the fact that the Government found themselves unable to provide a certain element of seed funding which would have allowed matching European funding.  Now the statutory body in place to protect the interest of consumers have to declare themselves no longer able to cope with that level of <Col N="2617" /> inquiry, clearly signalling very serious assault on the rights of consumers here.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to seriously consider this.  There is nobody here asking for some simplistic solution, for additional large sums of money to be provided to any office.  What I am asking for is a personal and urgent investigation by the Minister and a meeting between him and the Director of Consumer Affairs, so that adequate redeployment of staff from areas of less need and importance will take place if it is discovered, as I am sure it will be on the basis of what Mr. Murray said, that such a need exists.</P>
    <P>The amount of work that we have asked the director to handle over the last number of years has continuously increased.  He himself indicated that there were now over 50 different areas of legislation, statutes, orders, regulations which he has to cope with and in respect of which there is not one extra head of staff.  I am aware that many of his staff are on secondment from the Department of Industry and Commerce where the number of staff has been depleted.  At present there is a staff of 27 people to enforce all 50 statutory instruments. These people are deployed around the country as adequately as the director can ensure but still this is very unsatisfactory. It is clear from his press statement that we have to face up to the prospect that no adequate protections for consumers will be in place during the next few months.  The present arrangements hardly amount to a fig leaf of cover in providing the scant services available at present and I am very saddened that this should be the case.</P>
    <P>The last report of the director indicated that the number of complaints is increasing and that the amount of work we are asking him to handle is increasing.  Unfortunately, he now finds himself having to say that members of the public may expect to find difficulty in getting through to the office and are likely to experience long delays before being connected to the section of his office with which they seek contact, if indeed they can be connected at all.  In other words, this is a clear <Col N="2618" /> indication that those who contact his office may get no satisfaction at all.  He also asks somewhat plaintively that rather than ringing his office people should write.  While I can sympathise with the director I have to say that that is not an adequate standard of service to be provided to the public.  I do not accept such a standard and I do not believe that this House should accept such a standard. It is the Minister who has to deal with this problem and he should respond adequately.</P>
    <P>The director went on to say and I quote:</P>
    <P>We will not be able to give specific answers or advice to all written complaints or inquiries but we can at least send out some publications which may be helpful in many cases.</P>
    <P>None of us could be happy with that and if we were to express satisfaction we would simply be burying our heads in the sand and opening the door to further abuses.  We know in our hearts and souls that that is not just a problem now but that it is likely to get worse during the next few years with the elimination of tariff barriers and the open market in 1992.  The director has asked for people not to call to his office in person as he has much difficulty in dealing with personal callers.  Indeed, he says that present investigations are not being carried out as satisfactorily as he would like.  He says that they do investigate complaints of alleged breaches of any of these laws although not always as promptly as they would wish.  As the Minister and the House will be aware, if there is to be any effective action, a specific time limit within which such action has to be taken should be laid down because many of the areas in which complaints have been received are covered by various areas of law.  Accordingly, it is not simply a matter of putting the complaint to the bottom of the list and getting to it in one or two year's time, even if this were to be deemed a satisfactory service, but rather a matter of dealing with them more quickly because some of the areas in which complaints have been received <Col N="2619" /> would be covered by statute and no action could be taken unless complaints were dealt with rapidly.</P>
    <P>I am very perturbed at the evident frustration and dissatisfaction of the director which has obliged him to issue this statement today.  I want to remind the House that very few of us would be happy with an arrangement where there were only seven inspectors to cover the entire country, one based in Cork, one in Galway and five in Dublin.  To put it frankly, that amounts to a very thin service and there is no doubt that there are areas of the country which are policed very thinly, if at all.  It is obvious that a serious investigation of false claims, food descriptions, share pushing, below cost selling and all of the other anomolies and abuses which the Minister of State is well aware of cannot take place under the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>I could point to semi-State bodies and certain Government Departments where at present there is an under-utilisation of the scarce personnel resources available and I ask that an immediate investigation take place to see whether one or two individuals can be redeployed and I ask the Minister of State to meet immediately with Mr. Murray in an effort to sort this problem out so as to ensure that there will not be a total breakdown of the service being provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it absolutely clear that there has been no reduction in staff numbers in the office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  What has happened is that the director has exercised his managerial role and reallocated staff resources.  Up until now, the director assigned two officers to deal full time with telephone inquiries but apparently he has now decided, with effect from 4 July, to assign only one such officer to deal with these inquiries.  I understand that these new arrangements are to operate on a trial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reassignment of officers is surely a common feature in all businesses and <Col N="2620" /> organisations today where managers are constantly required to deploy and redeploy staff resources to the optimum benefit.  I want to quash any notion which Deputy Keating might be attempting to create that the Government are not committed to giving the public access to their consumer rights.  That is not so and the Deputy should take careful note of the fact that staff resources in the director's office have been substantially increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>So has the workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at a time when resources within the Department have been significantly reduced.  In April 1986 there was a total staff in the combined offices of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Director of Consumer Affairs of 16 people.  To meet the new challenges and the extra work facing this area staff numbers were increased to 25, a jump of 56 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the increase in workload?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>More recently these numbers have been further increased by two or another 8 per cent giving a total complement of 27 staff.  Surely, this can reflect nothing other than the Government's wish to ensure that the public have access to their rights in the area of consumer affairs.  I would like to add that this increase was granted against the background where, since January 1987, overall staff numbers in the Department have been reduced by some 12 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the family income supplement scheme was introduced in 1984 it was estimated that there could be up to between 30,000 and 35,000 beneficiaries under the scheme.  The current number <Col N="2527" /> of recipients is some 5,400, of which some 73 per cent are in the private sector and some 27 per cent are in the public sector. The number of children benefiting as dependents is 19,500 (March 1988).</P>
    <P>The commitment to review the workings of this scheme, which was given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, has been met.  The review of the scheme is being carried out by Mr. John Blackwell of the Resource and Environmental Policy Centre at University College, Dublin.  A draft report is currently being examined in my Department and will be discussed with the consultant shortly.</P>
    <P>As the report is in draft, I do not think it appropriate to comment on the findings in detail at this stage.  However, the review does suggest that the potential number of family income supplement recipients is of the order of 15,000 and not 30,000 to 35,000 as originally estimated.</P>
    <P>The findings of the review, when finalised, will be taken into account in determining future policy in relation to the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1987 the Government decided to rationalise the fuel scheme &mdash; urban and national &mdash; and to extend entitlement to fuel allowances to include 30,000 long term unemployment assistance recipients with effect from October 1987.  This process has been ongoing over the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A single national fuel scheme, with uniform criteria for entitlement, will operate throughout the country from October next.  From October 1988 the Department of Social Welfare will process and pay fuel allowances for all social welfare recipients.  The health boards will <Col N="2528" /> continue to deal with the fuel entitlements of their own regular clients, that is supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and infectious diseases maintenance allowance.  The local authorities will no longer have any involvement.</P>
    <P>An estimated 52,000 unemployment assistance recipients will receive their fuel allowance at employment exchanges; 160,000 pensioners will receive their fuel allowances by pension order book and some 5,000 or so recipients of supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and infectious diseases maintenance allowance will receive their fuel allowance from the health boards.  Pensioners who previously received fuel allowances will not have to apply for the allowance since the Department will automatically issue a book for them in October 1988. New pensioners will have their claims for fuel allowances processed alongside their pension claim while the health board clients mentioned above will be dealt with locally by the CWOs.  The appropriate administrative and other arrangements for these changes are well advanced and will be fully publicised nearer the start of the next heating season.</P>

      <P>My Department make considerable efforts to increase public awareness of entitlements by providing a wide range of information on their schemes and services.  There are currently 34 public offices and information centres of the Department around the country providing an information service to the public.  In addition a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets <Col N="2529" /> on all aspects of the Department's services are widely distributed and are available at all the Department's offices.  New leaflets are added as new services and schemes are introduced and the information needs and requirements of the public are subject to continual review. The methods of disseminating information are also looked at on a regular basis and developed as resources permit.</P>
      <P>In addition, officers of my Department participate regularly in seminars, talks and lectures throughout the country to a variety of different groups and many of these officers were recently provided with special training packages for such talks.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department are taking satisfactory measures to ensure that the public generally are aware of their social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure that those entitled to benefit are catered for. In this connection a study which is being carried out under my aegis by the ESRI, in association with the Combat Poverty Agency, will provide useful information on the extent to which people avail of State services.  I will further consider what actions are necessary in this regard in the light of the conclusions of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which covers the period up to the end of 1990 includes a commitment that the overall value of social welfare benefits will be maintained and that, within the resources available, special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, all social welfare recipients will receive a general increase of 3 per cent from July this year and this will more than protect the value <Col N="2530" /> of payments.  Those on the lowest payments, namely unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, will receive special additional increases including an increase of 11 per cent in personal rates and additional increases for child dependants.  In addition, the rates of payments in respect of dependent children of social welfare recipients generally are being streamlined and improved.  The effect of these charges in the year 1989 will be an additional £101 million in expenditure on social welfare services.</P>
    <P>The question of increases in rates of social welfare payments in 1989 will be a matter to be considered in the context of the 1989 budget.  I can assure the House that any measures which are required to fulfil the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and any further measures which can be taken in reforming and developing the social welfare system within the financial constraints which exist will be provided for.</P>

      <P>Assistance towards the cost of rent or mortgage interest payments can be made by way of an additional payment of supplementary welfare allowance under section 209 of the 1981 Act and regulations made under that section.  The guidelines are designed to assist health boards in determining whether a supplement should be paid and the amount to be paid, having regard to the level of the rent, the reasonable accommodation <Col N="2532" /> needs of the applicant and his family, the income of the household and other circumstances.</P>
      <P>The guidelines have now been revised in the light of the experience of operating the scheme.  The issues dealt with in the previous guidelines are covered in more detail and a number of additional issues are addressed.  In relation to mortgage supplementation in particular the guidelines cover the determination of the amount to be reckoned as interest payments, the question of arrangements with the building society or other institution involved and other circumstances to be taken into account in determining whether, and for how long, a supplement should be paid.</P>
      <P>Discussions are at present being held with the health boards on the content and operation of the revised guidelines.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the position for applicants who are minding elderly relatives and are refused unemployment assistance on the grounds that they are not available for work, who then decide not to take care of their relatives and present themselves as available for work as they are told by the officials of his Department that they have to mind the relatives and are still refused unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for unemployment assistance must satisfy a deciding officer that they are available for and genuinely seeking work in order to qualify for payment.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that family responsibilities, such as caring for elderly relatives, sometimes prevent a person who is unemployed from being in a position to go to work and consequently make that person unavailable for work as required for the award of unemployment assistance.  Each case is decided on its merits and the deciding officer has to decide whether the applicant is free, or not, to go to work. The deciding officer will have to take into account the proposed alternative arrangements for the care of the elderly relative in arriving at a decision.  This would be of particular importance where an applicant states that he or she is no longer looking after the relative.  In addition the deciding officer must take account of the efforts made by the person in seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assuming from inquiries already made by the Deputy that he has a particular case in mind which involves an applicant who was last in insurable employment in 1978.  She has stated that she has to look after her widowed mother who is invalided and in need of constant care and attention.  The household consists of the applicant and her mother.  The applicant was unable to show that she had any alternative arrangements made for the care of her mother in the event of her obtaining work.  She also failed to <Col N="2534" /> satisfy the deciding officer that she is genuinely seeking work.  She has had the benefit of two oral hearings of her appeals against the decision to refuse her payment of unemployment assistance and both appeals officers upheld the decisions to refuse the payment.  A deciding officer decided on 27 June 1988 that she still was not available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>The applicant has, however, been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the maximum rate of £34 per week since January last and this will be increased to £37.80 per week from 25 July 1988.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in relation to the 26 cases involving employers and social welfare fraud sent to the Chief State Solicitor in the five months to the end of May, 1988, he will give the number of employees involved; and the total amount of benefit and/or revenue involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-six cases have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor to have legal proceedings instituted against employers for breaches of provisions of the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations. The offences involved are: failure by the employer to furnish information requested by an inspector; failure to maintain prescribed records relating to employees; failure to produce records relating to employees, on request from an inspector; recording and furnishing information relating to employees which was false; concealing information concerning an employee's employment; delaying and obstructing inspectors in the performance of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the attitudes of the employers concerned and their failure to furnish correct or any information in relation to their employees, in respect of whom information was sought by the inspectors, it is not possible at this stage <Col N="2535" /> to furnish the information sought by the Deputy, before the cases are finalised.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the prosecutions is to enforce compliance by the employers and to enable the number of employees and their social insurance records to be properly established.  It is known at this stage that at least 47 employees are involved and that at a minimum there are some £36,000 arrears of PRSI and that benefit amounting to some £2,000 may have been overpaid.  It is likely that the totals to be eventually established will be greatly in excess of these figures.</P>
    <P>A programme of survey and inspection of employers is an ongoing feature of the work of the Inspection Branch of my Department.  In the period January to May 1988 inspections were carried out in the premises of 1,436 employers and arrears of PRSI amounting to £2.14m have been reported to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The joint investigation unit, consisting of three social welfare and two revenue inspectors, which is in operation within the Dublin General Tax District, are carrying out inspections on specific sectors and enterprises.  A review of the timber industry in the Wicklow area which covered 19 main contractors and 129 sub-contractors has been completed. A total of 45 cases of persons working and claiming social welfare payments were detected and 52 of the sub-contractors have been referred for further investigation of their tax liability.  Only two of the sub-contractors were found to be registered with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Sixty-nine security firms in Dublin have also been investigated and, of these, 31 have shown some deficiency in relation to tax and social welfare matters.  To date this year, £127,000.00 in tax and PRSI was collected.</P>
    <P>An investigation into the hotel industry in Dublin commenced in May 1988 and is continuing.  To date 26 establishments have been investigated and £73,000.00 in unpaid tax and PRSI collected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason the new system of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for people with broken insurance records is confined to those who became compulsorily insured in 1974 as a result of the abolition of the earnings limit at that time; and the reason it is not extended to those who had a substantial number of contributions prior to 1974 but none thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements made in the Social Welfare Act, 1988 for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions were designed to address an anomaly which affected certain people who were brought back into compulsory insurance in 1974, when the upper earnings limit was abolished. These were people who had a record of insurance after 1974 but failed to qualify <Col N="2540" /> for contributory pension because of the intermittent nature of their insurance record prior to 1974.  Persons in similar circumstances, however, who came into insurance for the first time in 1974 could qualify for pension.  The <i>pro rata</i> arrangement is intended to cater for persons affected by this anomaly.</P>
      <P>The extension of <i>pro rata</i> pensions to other persons who fail to qualify for contributory pension would have considerable financial implications.

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a person can receive assistance in the form of a weekly supplement to help meet the cost of rent or mortgage commitments.  Under these arrangements a payment towards mortgage interest can be granted where the interest exceeds £3 per week.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to supplements is determined by the health boards and in general, they are calculated so as to leave the client with a disposable income, after payment of his rent or mortgage interest, which is equivalent to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to his family circumstances, less £3.</P>
      <P>Other factors, such as possible over-accommodation, whether there were other non-dependent adults living in the household who could reasonably be expected to contribute towards the repayments etc., would also be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>The prescribed relative allowance is an increase in pension payable to incapacitated pensioners who have living with them a prescribed relative who is providing them with full-time care and attention.  The allowance is intended to assist the pensioner in meeting household costs.  It is not intended as a payment of the services provided by the relative.  The level of the allowance is £26.40 at present, increasing to £27.20 from July.</P>
      <P>The scope for further increasing the value of the allowance is limited because of the financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget.  Payment of the allowance direct to the relative rather than to the pensioner would alter the nature of the scheme and there are no plans for such a change in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>At this time I do not consider that a publicity campaign on fraud and abuse in the social welfare system would serve any useful purpose.  This could be quite an expensive undertaking and rather than embark on such a campaign my priority task is to put in place various structures, controls, procedures and working methods including those recommended by Craig Gardner in the Review of Payment Systems in my Department. This is well under way.</P>
      <P>The publicity surrounding the anti-fraud contained in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1987 and our successes in tackling abuse of the social welfare system in the past year have done much to enrol the support of the general public in curbing fraud and abuse in the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to continue a balanced public relations policy on abuse by supplying information on the level of abuse and our progress in tackling it.  At the same time I will be highlighting the <Col N="2545" /> fact that the vast majority of social welfare claimants are genuine and that the measures we will be taking to curb abuse will also improve the quality of service to genuine claimants.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the new control measures will be kept under review and if the results of the reviews indicate that the controls need to be supplemented by more active co-operation from the public, the question of a public relations campaign will then be considered.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy in his question.  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the constraints imposed on staffing levels in the public service by the necessity to deal with the imbalance in the public finances. Until this imbalance has been rectified there will be a continuing need for restraint.</P>
      <P>My Department, like all other Government Departments, must operate within the overall constraints of Government policy.  This said, however, the need to maintain staffing levels at employment exchanges is recognised and redundant staff from other Departments have been redeployed to those offices.</P>
      <P>The work of employment exchanges has heretofore been a mainly clerically based operation.  For some time now, however, the computerisation of the work of those offices has been proceeding and when completed, will alter radically the functioning of the offices.  The use of modern technology will not only enable a better service to be provided for applicants but will also allow for a greater input from staff in the development of those services.</P>

      <P>The health boards are responsible for collecting health contributions from full-time farmers for the years up to and including the year ended 5 April 1984. The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collecting them from part-time farmers and other self-employed persons for those years and from all farmers and self-employed for subsequent years.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Health that no estimate is as yet available of the amount received by the health boards in the period 1 January 1988 to 31 May 1988.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount received by them in the period 1 January 1988 to 31 May 1988 in respect of health contributions was £0.6 million in the case of farmers and £2.1 million in the case of other self-employed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No social insurance contributions had been received at 31 May 1988 from farmers or other self-employed persons apart from some proprietary company directors. Self-employed persons are being brought into the social insurance system for the first time for the tax year 1988-89. Payment is due on or before 1 October <Col N="2548" /> 1988 and payments are not expected in any appreciable number of cases before September 1988.  The social insurance liability of some proprietary company directors, who are regarded as self-employed persons, is being collected under the PAYE-PRSI system.  Thus, social insurance payments in respect of these persons are being made on a monthly basis as from 6 April 1988.  The commissioners cannot give the total of such payments to date as they are not distinguished from social insurance payments made in respect of other persons in the PAYE-PRSI system.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that some self-employed persons will be liable to pay social insurance contributions at a flat rate, amounting to £104 per contribution year, under collection arrangements separate from the income tax system.  As these arrangements have not yet come into operation, no amount has been collected to date under flat rate contributions.</P>

      <P>Section 72 of the Finance Act, 1988, provides for the incentive for taxpayers to bring their tax affairs up to date as announced in the budget.  This measure, together with a number of other changes in the tax collection procedure, was estimated to yield £30 million in 1988.</P>
      <P>The indications to date are that tax revenue is running ahead of expectations. It would appear that a substantial part of the increase in receipts is due to the incentive scheme and the other measures designed to clear arrears of tax.  It is not possible, at this stage, however, to say how much of the increase is due specifically to the tax incentive scheme.</P>

    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have installed a system to monitor the effects of the changes in the tax collection procedure.

    <P>The intervention arrangements for both beef and dairy products were substantially modified in April 1987 arising from decisions taken by the Council of Ministers in December 1986.  These revised arrangements, the accelerated disposal measures and reduced output have contributed to substantially reduced intervention stocks of butter and the virtual elimination of intervention stocks of skimmed milk powder in the Community.</P>
    <P>The revised intervention arrangements for beef have not proved as successful in regard to stocks level partly due to pressure in the market because of slaughterings of cows and heifers resulting from the milk quota restrictions and the marked slow-down in intervention sales in 1987 and 1988.  The higher stock level led to the Commission proposing modifications to the beef intervention regime in its proposal for prices and related measures for 1988-89.  My reply of 29 June outlined the outcome of the negotiations on this issue.  In addition, the Commission has signalled its intention to propose further modifications to the beef regime when the present arrangements expire at the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Agriculture and Food I have encouraged a more market oriented approach and I am pleased to note that our reliance on intervention outlets is declining.  Nevertheless, the availability of market intervention plays an important role in underpinning market prices and in maintaining confidence.  It will, therefore, be my objective to ensure that <Col N="2557" /> this outlet will continue to be available in such a way as not to undermine confidence.</P>

      <P>The area of barley sown in 1987 was 276,800 hectares (684,000 acres).  The level of barley requirements for the distilling industry is dependent on the demand which varies from year to year.  It is understood that distillers have a capacity to use about 42,000 tonnes per year and adequate supplies are normally available to meet the industry's requirements in this regard.</P>
      <P>Barley production is governed by the EC Common Agricultural Policy for cereals and producers must operate within this framework.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm of Craig Gardner was commissioned to carry out a security review of the Department's payment systems to establish where the schemes were most at risk to abuse and to recommend cost-effective remedies.  As part of the exercise, the consultants assisted the Department in developing statistical sampling methods to estimate the level of social welfare abuse.</P>
      <P>A review of a sample of disability benefit and unemployment payment claims in the Dublin area indicated that the most prevalent types of fraud in terms of monetary impact were concurrent working and claiming, failure to disclose self-employment and personation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sample was submitted to a special team of inspectors and investigators of the Department who reviewed every aspect of each claim.  This review included interviews with the claimants, <Col N="2559" /> and with employers.  In drawing their conclusions as to the validity of each claim, the team used a uniform definition of fraud or abuse.  The criteria were that the claim had to contain a false statement knowingly made by the claimant for the purpose of obtaining benefit; the statement must have been deliberate and there must have been a material gain.</P>
    <P>Following the application of these criteria, each claim was classified as being &ldquo;clearly genuine&rdquo;, suspicious for a stated reason or &ldquo;clearly fraudulent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>(a)  The survey was undertaken on the basis of personal face-to-face interviews carried out in the interviewees' homes.</P>
      <P>(b), (c), (d)  The survey covered a nationally representative sample of 1,398 men and women aged 16 and over.

      <P>The issue of the adequacy of social welfare payments has been referred to on a number of occasions by the Combat Poverty Agency and several other bodies, including the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The improvement of the position of the less well off in our society is central to the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> under which the Government is committed to &ldquo;maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and within the resources available, to consider special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments', The increases in social welfare payments announced in this year's budget. which will come into effect next month, are a major step in this direction.</P>
      <P>In line with this comment all social welfare recipients will receive a general increase of 3 per cent in July this year and this will more than protect the real value of payments given that the annual rate of inflation is currently less than 2 per cent.  Those on the lowest social welfare payments, namely unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, will receive special increases consisting of an 11 per cent increase in the personal rate of payments and a 6 per cent increase in the child dependant payments.</P>
      <P>These changes, which will cost an additional £101 million in a full year, will considerably improve the incomes of two of the categories of persons most at risk, namely, large families and the long term unemployed.  This represents a concrete example of the Government's concern for the less well off members of the community and is a major step forward in the implementation of one of the principal recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>It was necessary to revise the legislative provisions relating to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance in the context of the implementation of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  The necessary provisions were made in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the implementation of the <Col N="2566" /> equal treatment provisions allowance was made for rent or mortgage payments where the wife of an unemployment assistance claimant was employed under a contract of service.  The allowance, which was deducted from the net earnings of the claimant's wife, was given as a household expense when assessing the value to the husband as &ldquo;head of the household&rdquo; of his wife's income from employment.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements contained in the 1985 Act, the head of household concept no longer applies and the income of both spouses must be taken fully into account.  Allowance is made, however, in respect of employment related expenses incurred by the working spouse.</P>
    <P>Assistance to persons on unemployment assistance who have difficulty in meeting mortgage repayments can be provided in certain circumstances under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to people who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are regarded as permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned was examined on 11 March 1988 by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. A deciding officer decided that he was, therefore, not entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision.  He was examined on 15 June 1988 by a different medical referee who was also of the opinion that he was capable of work.  The person concerned has been invited to have his case referred to an appeals officer for determination.  His entitlement to the pension will be further considered in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>Bond Bridge is located on a regional road.  Primary responsibility for improvement works on such roads rests with the local authority, with the funding normally being met from local resources supplemented by the block grant for roads.</P>
      <P>In 1988, a special road grant of £40,000 has been allocated to Kildare County Council as a contribution towards the costs of site investigations and the preparation of preliminary reports for schemes to improve Bond Bridge and Shaw Bridge which is also on a regional road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 21 April 1988 my Department issued approval to the local authority's proposals for the appointment of a consulting engineer to prepare a preliminary report for the Bond Bridge scheme.  Following completion of the preliminary <Col N="2575" /> report and cost estimates, the local authority may submit detailed proposals for the scheme to the Department for consideration.</P>

To date the Mid-Western Health Board has not identified the posts referred to by the Deputy as being of a high priority within the limited resources currently available.  I am advised by the board that while these posts are considered desirable they do not, in the board's view, warrant a high priority in light of pressing demands in other service areas.  I am further advised by the board that appropriate medical and nursing services are available to multiple sclerosis sufferers in the areas cited.  The Deputy can be assured that the board's staffing priorities will continue to receive sympathetic consideration within the resources available to my Department.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.  The figures given in certain cases are based on arithmetic progressions of the current position and are subject to variation.</P>
      <P>(a)  Based on the present estimated receipts from health contributions an increase in the contribution rate to 1.75 per cent would yield an additional £44 million in income in a full year.</P>
      <P>(b)  It is estimated that an increase of £2.50 on the existing £10 out-patient charge would generate additional full year income of £1.25 million.</P>
      <P>(c)  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 148 section (a) of 8 March 1988.</P>
      <P>(d)  The full year additional income resulting from an increase of £2.50 per night in public ward changes would be in the region of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>(e)  An increase in the income ceiling for health contributions to £17,500 would bring in an extra £1.4 million approximately in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(f)  I would again refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. <Col N="2577" /> 148, sections (b) and (c) of the 8 March 1988.</P>
    <P>(g)  The abolition of local health committees would generate savings of approximately £400,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>(h)  The Deputy will be aware that discussions on the introduction of a new contract for doctors participating in the GMS scheme are continuing under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this matter.</P>
    <P>(i)  The question of charges for the use of public facilities by consultants for treating private patients will be considered as part of the ongoing discussions on the review of the common contract.</P>
    <P>(j)  An increase of 20 per cent in charges for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals would yield an additional £7.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I could not at this point give any estimate of what could be collected.  The repercussions of the attempt to collect such charges in the past are still being dealt with in the ongoing negotiations of the common contract.</P>

He subsequently <Col N="2578" /> repeated his year one examinations in December, 1987 but failed two of the subjects again.  Until such time as the student passes all of his year one examinations the vocational education committee in question are not prepared to renew his scholarship in respect of year two of the course.</P>
