    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many young people who are unemployed are denied unemployment assistance because of their parents' means; that some others are in receipt of as little as 70p per week; if, in view of the fact that this could be encouraging young people to emigrate, he will consider introducing a minimum payment for all those who are unemployed, which would be paid regardless of household means; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is assessed according to a person's means and family circumstances. The rate of assistance payable in any particular case depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.  Where the weekly means exceed the maximum level <Col N="1150" /> of unemployment assistance, no assistance is payable.  Even where the payments are small the recipients are entitled to priority for other benefits including FÁS schemes and programmes.</P>
      <P>In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes account is taken of the value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed, such as board and lodging.  The purpose of this assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants in different household circumstances.  This is a long-standing method of assessing entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The operation of the means test ensures that assistance is targeted at those who are most in need and is an equitable way of directing limited resources.  Introducing a minimum payment for all those who are unemployed regardless of household means would have major financial implications, particularly if such payments were to be set at a level which would have a significant bearing on the decision of young people to emigrate. Provision for such payments would, in effect, be at the expense of those in greatest need and would be difficult to justify at a time when the priority is to improve the position of those on the lowest payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this is a long-standing method of assessment.  Is it not time the Minister looked at it again?  The Minister said that in assessing means the value of a benefit or privilege is taken into account.  Is it not a fact that if a young person leaves his home and goes to live in private rented accommodation, not alone is he able to draw the full amount of unemployment assistance but he is also given a rent allowance to pay to the landlord?  Why is the Minister prepared to give a rent allowance to the landlord but gives no allowance to the parents for keeping the child?  That is the area of assessment of means that I want to direct the Minister's attention to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This system is in operation since 1933, with modifications from time to time.  I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  It is true that a person in a flat is entitled to full benefits.  Unfortunately the cost of removing this benefit in kind would be, at the minimum, £14 million per year.  The equity of doing it would also be questionable.  If we had £14 million, would it be better to spend it on people in the lowest circumstances generally or to spend it on raising everybody up a little?  All I can say is that the method of assessment is under review at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the system as it operates at the moment is driving young people out of their homes into private rented accommodation? Does the Minister also recognise that it is driving them out of the country because many young people get as little as 70p, maybe £5, and must therefore emigrate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is basically a system which provides greater equity.  Somebody living in very fine circumstances, well provided for, will not get as much as somebody in lesser circumstances.  That is the basic equity of the situation operating since 1933.  It is being reviewed at present but there is the basic question of where one best spends the £14 million.  Within those circumstances it is being reviewed.</P>

What would be the cost of implementing the recommendation of the Commission on <Col N="1152" /> Social Welfare to remove the requirement for over 25s?  What has the Minister done in relation to removing the discrimination in the method of assessment as between wage earning families and farm families?  Is the Minister aware that there is a continuing discrimination against the offspring of farming families?  Has that discrimination been removed and, if not, why not?

      <P>The question of introducing a statutory sick pay scheme under which employers would be responsible for payment of benefit to their employees for an initial period of illness has been under examination.  An inter-departmental committee who examined the implications of such a scheme identified a number of crucial policy issues to be resolved before such a scheme could be introduced.  A scheme on these lines has major implications for the administration of the disability benefit scheme and the timing of its introduction has to be considered in the context of the other major <Col N="1155" /> developments taking place in the administration of the social welfare system.  The examination of this issue is ongoing and I will be putting forward detailed proposals in this area in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The change involved is a very extensive operation.  The Deputy may be aware that it took several years to find a workable scheme and introduce it in Great Britain because of factors within the payments systems.  Various elements had to be teased out.  It is largely an administrative question and will involve discussions with employers' organisations.  We will have to find a system of phasing that would be workable both from the point of view of the employers, the Department of Social Welfare and the recipient so that he or she will have a service that is as effective as the existing one.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to another problem that arises for recipients of disability benefit, that of delays in the postal service? As a result some people have to live from hand to mouth over weekends. Has the Minister given any thought to changing that method and substituting payments through post offices or by some other method so that people would not have to wait for the post?  In many <Col N="1156" /> instances such people are disappointed and find that they, and their families, go hungry over weekends.</P>

      <P>Last September I introduced a new system in Cork which involved direct entry into the computers. That overcame many of the delays and other problems.  Up to then people who lived a distance from central records were at a disadvantage.  If a person put down a wrong RSI number or gave some incorrect information on a form there would be a delay.  That occurs in a percentage of cases and the number increases from week to week.  Under the direct certificate entry system certificates can be delivered to the local office, for example, in Cork, entered into the computer and cleared straight away so that further problems will not arise.  The payment will be sent out within a couple of days.  That extremely rapid and efficient service has spread to other parts of the country and, eventually, will operate everywhere. Most people are happy with the new arrangement.  It is hard to see how any other arrangement would be quicker but I appreciate that on occasions cheques do not arrive on the date expected thereby causing problems for people, particularly if it is close to a weekend.  There must be an authorisation for payment from somewhere and that must be sought from the office.  The only way to get over that problem would be to permit payment at local offices.  That is a possibility in the long term but computerisation represents a huge step forward.</P>

I am not sure about the position in Cork city but the improvements he mentioned have not reached west Cork as yet and I have received complaints from people who have been left over weekends, and sometimes <Col N="1157" /> longer, without their cheques.

      <P>Payment of a fuel allowance was refused in the case of the person concerned because his son, who resides with him, is no longer a qualified dependant for retirement pension purposes and does not, therefore, come within the excepted categories for the purpose of the &ldquo;living-alone&rdquo; condition.</P>

In fact, it is a much wider element but unless it is a widow, a deserted wife or an unmarried mother it does not continue up to the age of 21. That is a matter to be considered in the context of the budget.  It was considered by budgets while the Coalition were in office but nothing was done at that stage.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The social security system in this country is based on the twin pillars of social insurance and social assistance. Under the social insurance system, entitlements are determined by reference to the individual's record of contributions and payments are made from the social insurance fund which is a separate fund for this purpose financed by employer and employee contributions with the Exchequer making up any deficit.  The social assistance system caters for those who do not qualify for a social insurance payment and entitlements under that system are subject to means test.  The cost of social assistance is borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social insurance provides comprehensive occupational protection for workers and their families.  It meets employer and employee obligations as required by internationally accepted standards of social security.  Our social insurance scheme has been an integral feature of the social security system and its benefits in terms of providing payments as of right and without means test are widely accepted.  Measures taken over the years, such as the abolition of the remuneration limit for social insurance in 1974 and the introduction of fully pay-related (PRSI) contributions in 1979 have made the system more comprehensive in its coverage and more progressive in its financing.  More recently, the extension of social insurance coverage for pensions to the self-employed, including farmers, has been a major development in widening the scope of the system and providing the security of a social insurance pension <Col N="1163" /> for a large segment of the workforce who were previously excluded from the system.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to alter the basic structure of the social insurance system.  The question of extending the social insurance coverage of those categories whose coverage at present is limited to certain benefits is under consideration.  Furthermore the National Pensions Board is currently examining the question of the provision of a national pensions scheme and its final report is expected in 1989.  This report will have implications for the social insurance system, and the question of changes in the system arising from the recommendations in the report will have to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the provision, if any, he intends to make for a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who is in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, who is unable to provide a telephone from his own resources, who does not qualify for a free telephone rental allowance as he does not satisfy the living alone conditions, who received a heart transplant in March 1988 and whose wife works part time and is absent from the home for several hours each day leaving him at risk by reason of not having a telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme operated by my Department is designed to cover beneficiaries for whom a telephone is their sole means of summoning aid in an emergency.  The scheme is confined to persons in receipt of a qualifying payment who are either living alone or only with children under 15 years of age or with other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon assistance in the event of an emergency. The person concerned lives with his wife, who is not incapacitated, and two children aged 17 and 13.  Therefore he does not meet the qualifying conditions of the scheme.  I understand he has had a telephone since 1986 and the question of risk does not arise on this account.</P>
      <P>Extension of the scheme in the manner envisaged by the Deputy would have considerable cost implications.  There are no proposals for such a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister implying that there are very many people here who have had heart transplants?  Is he aware that the applicant in question had a heart transplant in March 1988?  Is he aware that his only source of income amounts to approximately £30 per week DPMA because the couple have two children aged 17 and 13 at school and a mortgage of £177 per month and his wife <Col N="1167" /> is forced to take part-time work?  Furthermore, would he not agree that somebody who has had a heart transplant would fall into the category of a person in need of constant care and attention, particularly as it took place eight months ago only?  The reality is that the applicant, while having a telephone, has not got the money to pay the rental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The DPMA basic rate for a couple amounts to £71.90 and in a case where there are two children there would be an additional £15 approximately allowable for each child.  I should say that the DPMA allowance in respect of the case cited here would be £100 so the fact that only £30 is paid means there must be independent income involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy is raising is extension of the scheme to cover other categories of people.  This is a scheme whose provisions apply to very limited categories of people; that is true. An extension of the provisions of the scheme along the lines obtaining in relation to other schemes in existence &mdash; such as the other living alone conditions &mdash; would cost approximately £15 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot be serious that there are such numbers of people in this country who have had heart transplants and where the provisions of the scheme if they were to be extended to cover them would cost £15 million per annum. Would the Minister agree that what he is putting to that applicant's wife is that she gives up her part-time work and lets the State pay over £100 DPMA so that her husband can claim the free telephone rental allowance?  Are we really serious about reforming our social welfare system?  Surely in cases such as these discretion can be used?  Surely the Minister, in exceptional circumstances &mdash; which obtain in this case &mdash; can afford to <Col N="1168" /> grant this free telephone rental allowance because that is all that is being asked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very warmhearted and would be happy to help the Deputy but the provisions of the scheme are based on certain criteria being met. There are many other groups, people who would seek similar extensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy cites the example of a heart transplant.  There are also many other people who will have had heart attacks, with somebody else in the dwelling who can get a telephone or call somebody.  The provisions of this scheme were meant to provide a means of obtaining assistance in an emergency for persons who would otherwise be unable to get such assistance.  That was its whole purpose and is why the living alone condition is so defined in the provisions of the scheme.  It is not merely a question of changing that definition in the case of an individual applicant but right across the board, and that is where the wider financial implications enter in.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the report entitled <i>Poverty and the Social Welfare System in Ireland</i> prepared by the ESRI on behalf of the Combat Poverty Agency; is so, the action he intends to take to deal with the high level of poverty in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial results of a major survey on poverty, income distribution and the usage of State services <Col N="1169" /> which is being carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute at the request of the Department of Social Welfare are contained in the report <i>Poverty and the Social Welfare System in Ireland</i> which was presented to me recently by the Combat Poverty Agency.  The main value of this very comprehensive report is that it highlights those people who are most at risk of poverty and indicates what the major concerns of social policy should be, and where particular attention should be focused.</P>
      <P>The report also indicates that a lot of progress has been made in recent years in certain areas.  For example, the elderly generally are now in what is called a &ldquo;low risk category&rdquo;.  The report also refers to the improvements which have been made in the delivery of the social welfare services. This is an area in which I hope to make further significant progress in the future.</P>
      <P>The improvement of the position of the less well-off in our society is central to our <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> under which the Government are committed to &ldquo;maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and within the resources available, to consider special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments&rdquo;.  All social welfare recipients received a general increase of 3 per cent from last July and this has more than protected the real value of payments given that the increase in the cost of living this year is expected to be just over 2 per cent.  The report is based on incomes in 1986 and early 1987. Since then, and before publication of the report, the Government had already transferred extra resources to those in greatest need from mid-July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special problems of persons on the lower rates of social welfare payments were recognised by the Government this year when special increases of 11 per cent in the personal rate of payments and 6 per cent in the child dependant payments were granted to recipients of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  These special increases costing an extra £30 million in a full year have significantly improved the <Col N="1170" /> position of those at greatest risk, namely families headed by an unemployed person, particularly large families.  Further assistance had been provided to the long term unemployed through the extension of the free fuel scheme and this has benefited some 30,000 people.</P>
    <P>Another group identified in the report as being at risk are those in employment but with a low level of earnings.  The family income supplement scheme is specifically aimed at families with low income from employment.  Since taking office the Government have made major improvements in this scheme.  I have also arranged for a comprehensive and independent review of the scheme to be carried out.  The results of this review, which are currently being examined, will form an integral part of future policy developments.</P>
    <P>We have made very significant progress in raising the lowest levels of social welfare payments.  The 11 per cent increase we gave this year means that a family on unemployment assistance with three children now receive a payment of £98.80 per week representing an increase of £6.20.  A family with six children receive £124 representing an increase of £11.70.  I am hopeful that we will be able to make further progress in this regard. In doing so it will be necessary to keep in mind the relationship between social welfare payments and earnings and this is where the review of the family income supplement scheme is so important.  It is interesting to note, for example, that at present the unemployment assistance payment of £124 to which I referred compares with take-home pay of £166 for a man on the average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>Low income farming households have also been identified as being at risk of poverty.  In line with other social welfare recipients on the lower levels of payment, smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance also benefited from the special increase of 11 per cent in the personal rate and 6 per cent in the child dependant rates brought into effect from July last. The problems of farming families are also being tackled through the Government's <Col N="1171" /> integrated rural development programme which is designed to improve the employment, earning capacity and social situation of 11 pilot rural areas in different parts of the country.  The pilot phase of this programme will provide essential experience for its wider application at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report clearly shows that the policies which have been adopted by this Government are properly directed at those in greatest need.  The significant progress made in tackling the problems of poverty in the short period of just over 19 months since this Government took office illustrate the Government's determination to improve the position of the less well off members of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept as accurate the report's finding that one-third of the population are living in dire poverty and that 41 per cent of the poor are children?  Secondly, would the Minister speak to his colleagues in Government to ensure that all public moneys available to the Government, particularly national lottery moneys, for allocation to different projects, instead of going to golf clubs and private hotels for the provision of tennis courts, would be targeted at those living in dire poverty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a review of the national lottery is to take place in the near future and I am sure that the Deputy, through her party, will have an opportunity to suggest where the money should go.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I would of course be very happy if a larger proportion of the money was allocated to the Department of Social Welfare as, needless to say, we could make great use of that money.  In regard to the report itself, its principal value is that it indicates the trends in relation to poverty, and those who lost out between 1973 and 1980 and between 1980 and early 1987.  Households at greatest risk include single adult households with children and two adult households with three or more children, a much larger group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> The report clearly indicates that it is children who are at particular risk, especially in households with three or more children. This applies equally in the case of a person on low earnings as well as to those in receipt of social welfare payments. The position of children was highlighted very prominently in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the work is accurate.  The report has to be considered in conjunction with the NESC report which also covered the non-cash benefits. This report only covers direct cash benefits. The two reports taken together provide a comprehensive picture.  As I said, the main value of the report is that it indicates the trends which are very clear.</P>

Would the Minister accept that the key finding of that report is that there is an incontrovertible link between unemployment and poverty and that its first recommendation is that changes in the tax structure to include RSI are absolutely essential in providing incentives for the creation of employment?</P>

      <P>There will be 17,000 fewer on the unemployment register next year, due to a number of factors &mdash; greater employment being one and more defaulters leaving the register being a second reason.  Incidentally, as a matter of interest to those who are seriously considering the question of emigration, the present prediction is that the rate of emigration is expected to be lower next year.

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give details of the basis of his computation based on which he has estimated the increased intake from employers' payroll taxes for 1989; and whether he accepts that such an increased burden is a disincentive to job creation prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary to increase the earnings ceiling for PRSI contributions in line with increases in wage levels.  From April 1989 the current PRSI ceiling of £16,200 will be increased. Employees, employers and the self-employed will pay PRSI contributions in respect of earnings up to £16,700.  In addition, employers will continue to pay contributions up to a ceiling of £20,000 <Col N="1176" /> in respect of the 15 per cent of employees who have these higher earnings.  The 1989 Estimate includes £5 million in respect of the higher ceiling for employers.</P>
      <P>The estimated social insurance yields are based on the available pay distribution data, allowing for certain macro-economic projections for pay increases and employment changes. When the increases in the PRSI ceiling are compared with the projected gross earnings bill for a full year they represent estimated increases in payroll costs of 0.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent in 1989 and 1989/90 respectively.  I do not consider that the size of this increase will be a significant burden on employers, which would act as a disincentive to job creation.</P>
      <P>Increasing the ceiling for the employer's contribution also in effect shifts the burden of financing social insurance from labour intensive enterprises where the earnings of the vast majority of employees would be below the existing ceiling to the more protected and financially sound sectors of the economy where there is a much bigger proportion of employees on higher earnings. Raising the extra revenue needed for social insurance in this way is much more in line with maintaining incentives for job creation than the alternative of increasing the percentage rate of contribution which would mainly affect labour intensive enterprises.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted in this regard that Irish employers pay one of the lowest rates of PRSI in the European Community and that in the United Kingdom there is no ceiling for employers on the amount of earnings in respect of which contributions are payable.</P>

      <P>The figures issued by the Department of Social Welfare are the best figures the Deputy will get because they are the people who have dealt with this business for generations.  They know what they are talking about and people <Col N="1177" /> from the outside have discovered what the reality is.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the employer organisations have calculated that these extra payroll taxes on employment will cost employers a sum far greater than the figure mentioned by him?  A recent estimate given to me was £40 million.

      <P>First, I want to reject utterly and absolutely the suggestion, or little sly proposal, that somebody is trying to do something with the figures.  This suggestion is not worthy of the Deputy in the first instance and it is not true in the second instance.  The CII came out with a figure of £70 million, which is what they thought the figure might be.  That was based on a very hasty calculation which was entirely incorrect.  The next day I was on the radio with the director of the CII and he accepted that they had got their figures wrong, had made some assumptions which were incorrect, had included the self-employed, done a variety of other things and had then realised that it was only the 15 per cent of the top paid employees and the companies who employed them that would be affected and that, in effect, the figure of £5 million in the 1988-89 Estimates is the correct one.  I have given the percentage figures in relation to increases in payroll costs as 0.1 per cent in 1989 and 0.4 per cent in the subsequent year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare in view of the embargo by certain dentists on the extension to the dependent spouses of the dental benefit scheme operated by his Department and the consequent delays being experienced by the public, if he will outline the action he proposes to take to ensure that essential dental care is available to those who are entitled to it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the social insurance treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons commenced on 19 October 1987, so it is now just over a year in operation.  In that period my Department have received 68,000 claims for benefits by dependent spouses under the extension.  This figure includes claims for dental and optical benefits and for benefit towards the cost of hearing aids.  The total number of dental claims submitted under the extension was 29,000.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the numbers of claims that the extension has been successful. Unfortunately, the Irish Dental Association continues to oppose the extension. Notwithstanding the embargo, however, 178 dentists signed the new agreement covering the extended scheme.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,080,000 insured persons and approximately 314,000 dependent spouses eligible for treatment under the treatment benefits scheme.  The increasing number of dentists now active within the scheme has ensured the continuance of a good level of service in the situation of the expanded number of eligible persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> The continuing embargo by the association against the treatment of dependent spouses under the dental benefit scheme is undoubtedly causing inconvenience to some dependent spouses who are living a distance from participating dentists.  In order to minimise this inconvenience, I arranged from the outset for my Department to supply the names of their nearest participating dentists to dependent spouses who wish to claim dental benefit. Dependent spouses can obtain these names by contacting their local social welfare office or by telephoning the Department.  These arrangements have been in effect from the start and are operating well.</P>
    <P>In an effort to resolve the present difficulties, I agreed to set up a joint working group consisting of representatives of my Department and of the Irish Dental Association.  The working group which examined all aspects of the social insurance dental benefit scheme concluded its study in July last.  The working group made a number of detailed recommendations which I am considering but there was no agreement in fundamental issues on the basis of which the Irish Dental Association would recommend participation in the extended scheme by all their members.  Unfortunately, the central barriers against reaching agreement have turned out to be the level of fees paid to the dentists under the whole scheme and the apparent position on the part of the Irish Dental Association on the existence at all of such a broadly-based scheme for workers and their dependent spouses under the PRSI system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly, a Cheann Comhairle.  I have a number of questions which I would like to ask the Minister arising from his reply.  Is the figure of 29,000 for dental care in respect of treatment or in respect of claims for approval <Col N="1181" /> for treatment?  Second, would the Minister agree that it would be more appropriate if the scheme were operated by the Department of Health, since it is essentially a health-related matter?  Finally, would the Minister agree that it is unsatisfactory that so much treatment is excluded from the scheme, such as preventive dental care, root treatment and so on and would he consider making treatments of this kind available under the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping for brief questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the final part of the question first.  The extension of the scheme would have financial implications and that is the basic problem.  The figure of 29,000 refers to the number of claims being processed and treatment is ongoing. The number of treatments completed would be approximately 26,000.  I might add, of course, that the numbers were smaller in the early stages but have become much greater as the scheme has progressed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the desirability of transferring the scheme from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health.  The main argument made by the Irish Dental Association is that the whole scheme should be means tested, but I am against that.  I believe this is a very good scheme for workers, one which workers value.  The scheme should continue.  The Irish Dental Association contend that all treatments be means tested, but this is in their interests.  However, I want to keep the scheme as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he accepts that there are 11 different means tests for different schemes within his Department in addition to eight other means tests in other Departments; if he will give an estimate of the number of officials and the cost involved in administering the various means tests; and whether any <Col N="1182" /> progress has been made towards rationalisation leading to a single means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that different means-tested schemes exist is to enable conditions for entitlement to be adapted to the specific circumstances of persons claiming under different schemes.  Thus, for example, in the case of social welfare schemes the rules of means assessment in the case of widows, lone parents and the old who, because of family responsibilities or age and infirmity are particularly vulnerable, are generally more favourable than the rules which apply in the case of the able-bodied unemployed. Similarly, the rules which apply in the case of, say, medical cards or educational grants are necessarily different from those which apply in the case of weekly payments.</P>
      <P>Means tests under schemes administered by my Department are carried out by 242 social welfare officers stationed throughout the country.  It is not possible to say what is the total cost of means-testing for the Department's schemes. In 1987 the total number of such cases referred to social welfare officers was 213,433 of which 70 per cent were in respect of unemployment assistance, 15 per cent in respect of the old age pension, 10 per cent in respect of the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives, 3.6 per cent in respect of the widow's pension and the remainder just over 1 per cent in respect of single women's allowance, rent allowance and the family income supplement.  There is no duplication of means-testing between these schemes as they all involve separate categories of claimants.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. There are 414 community welfare officers directly involved in the administration of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons with insufficient income have a legal entitlement, subject to the conditions of the scheme, to immediate payments while entitlement to a regular and more permanent payment under a social <Col N="1183" /> assistance scheme is being investigated. This can occur, for example, in the case of deserted wives, who do not qualify for payment for at least three months after the date of desertion.  It can arise also in the case of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Various measures are being taken by my Department to reduce the extent to which people have recourse to supplementary welfare allowance on an interim basis and thus eliminate the need for a separate means test.  Interim desktop means assessments and the one-stop shop where means for different purposes can be assessed at the same time are two important initiatives in this area.  The standardisation of the various schemes, including the fuel and footwear schemes, has improved the position.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a single means test for all schemes would have major financial implications.  It would not eliminate the need for separate means assessment to be carried out when people claim under different schemes at different times.  The extent to which, while retaining the different schemes which now exist, further progress can be made in using information supplied for the purposes of one scheme to determine entitlement under other schemes is under examination by an inter-departmental committee.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  Would the Minister not accept that it is an utter waste of money to have such a plethora of officialdom involved in the many different means tests within his own Department and outside?  The Minister has not referred to the means tests for education grants, differential rents, medical cards, DPMA and all the other health board schemes, and civil legal aid. Is it not an awful waste of money to spend such a huge amount of time on the different means tests, which number almost 20 in all?  Is not the answer to have one single means test and one could <Col N="1184" /> follow up by having the allowances based on Government policy decisions of the day?  We could know the basic means of a person by one means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of men and women who have had disability benefit refused to them since February 1987 to date; the numbers who have transferred to unemployment benefit for both males and females; the financial saving which has been effected by the substantial numbers which have had benefit discontinued to them following medical examinations; if he has satisfied himself that evidence presented from consultants-specialists is taken into consideration by medical referees at medical examinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical referee system is a major procedure in a range of controls exercised in the administration of disability benefit.  From 1 February 1987 to 14 October 1988, 38,109 claimants were found to be capable of work following medical referee examination and thus no longer entitled to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the various control measures, the number of disability benefit claims in payment each week has fallen from 81,619 at the beginning of February 1987 to 63,551 at the beginning of November 1988 and we are on target to achieve savings of some £11 million on the original published estimate for disability benefit expenditure figures in <Col N="1185" /> 1988.  The corresponding saving for 1987 was of the order of £14 million.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded. Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  All such reports are taken into account by the examining medical referee.  In addition, it is open to a certifier to attend the examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of figures for men and women and information in relation to persons who claim unemployment benefit following disallowance of disability benefit, the position is that statistics are not kept in a manner which would show the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed the point.  People who attend a medical referee take with them evidence from consultants they have attended but it is not taken into consideration.  For example, I have documentation which indicates that a certain person was considered to be unfit for work yet a general practitioner overruled that by simply testing the person's pulse.  Secondly, a person cannot afford to have the consultant attend at the medical referee examination because it costs £130 to have a consultant attend, while the Department only allow a payment of £30.  I am concerned that people are being deprived of benefit wrongly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main priorities as Minister for Social Welfare is to improve the standards of administration and delivery of all social welfare schemes and services. This includes the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards.  My objective is to provide a comprehensive service to social welfare clients through the concept of the one-stop shop so as to meet all the needs of the client quickly and in a more co-ordinated manner, thus avoiding the necessity for people to be referred from <Col N="1187" /> one location to another in order to pursue their claims or obtain information.  We have already made considerable progress in reducing the extent to which persons claiming other benefits have recourse to supplementary welfare allowance on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>The development of such an integrated service to the client is crucially dependent on the continuing development of technology within my Department.  The installation of a countrywide telecommunications network, which is in the process of implementation, will facilitate the introduction of computer services to all social welfare offices around the country and enable the speedy transfer of information which is essential to a fully integrated and localised service.</P>
    <P>As far as the supplementary welfare allowance scheme itself is concerned, there would clearly be considerable advantages in having the scheme administered directly by my Department as recommended in many reports.  Such a major change would have considerable implications for my Department and for the health boards.  The particular features of the scheme and its position in the general context of community care, which is a health board responsibility, would have to be taken into account in any consideration of the issue.  It would also be necessary to ensure that we continue to have a flexible, speedy and effective service available to clients at a location convenient to them.</P>
    <P>The future administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is being considered in this general context. The question of the take-up of the scheme is also being addressed as part of the examination of the findings of the ESRI report on poverty.  As part of the second phase of this study the ESRI will be carrying out further research on the extent of and the reasons for non-take up of social welfare entitlements and this will include supplementary welfare allowance.  Further action will be considered in the light of the findings which emerge.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could help.  The Minister's first amendment is a key point <Col N="1312" /> but there is a series of amendments concerned with changing &ldquo;party to a marriage&rdquo; or &ldquo;parties to a marriage&rdquo; to &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; or &ldquo;spouses&rdquo;.  Some of them will have to be accepted even if the Minister's amendment is accepted and some of them will be irrelevant if the Minister's amendment is accepted.  To facilitate the House may I suggest, to use legal parlance, on a completely without prejudice basis, that the Minister agree to the terminological changes which are designed to keep the Bill in order, so that we will refer to couples who are married in an identical way throughout the Bill.  May I ask if the Minister would agree to accept the amendments where we replace &ldquo;parties to a marriage&rdquo; with &ldquo;spouses&rdquo;.  That would ease everybody's position.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could briefly explain.  In the original draft there are various references to &ldquo;parties to a marriage&rdquo; or &ldquo;a party to a marriage&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage, some amendments tabled by Members and others tabled by the Minister referred to &ldquo;party to a marriage&rdquo; or &ldquo;parties to a marriage&rdquo; instead of to &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; or &ldquo;spouses&rdquo;.  In reality, it makes no difference to the substance of the Bill whether we refer to &ldquo;parties to a marriage&rdquo; or &ldquo;spouses&rdquo; but in the context of the Bill having a uniformity of approach and of legislatively producing a tidy measure, I tabled this series of amendments.  Many of the amendments listed &mdash; from amendments Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and so on &mdash; are changing that terminology.  Perhaps Members could <Col N="1313" /> agree to my suggestion, or, if there is any confusion we could take them individually, but I do not think that will be necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 21 to 25, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P> 2.  &mdash;(1)  An application by a spouse for a decree of judicial separation from the other spouse may be made to the court having jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under Part III of this Act on one or more of the following grounds:</P>
      <P> (a)  that the respondent has committed adultery;</P>
      <P>(b)  that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent;</P>
      <P>(c)  subject to subsection (2) of this section, that there has been desertion by the respondent of the applicant for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of the application;</P>
      <P>(d)  subject to subsection (2) of this section, that the spouses have lived apart from one another for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of the application and the respondent consents to a decree being granted;</P>
      <P>(e)  subject to subsection (2) of this section, that the spouses have lived apart from one another for a continuous period of at least three years immediately preceding the date of the application. </P>

    <P>(2)  In considering for the purposes <Col N="1314" /> of subsection (1) of this section, whether&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  in the case of paragraph (c) of that subsection, the period for which the respondent has deserted the applicant, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of paragraph (d) or (e) of that subsection, the period for which the spouses have lived apart,</P>
    <P>has been continuous, no account shall be taken of any one period (not exceeding 6 months) or of any two or more periods (not exceeding 6 months in all) during which the spouses resumed living with each other, but no such period or periods during which the spouses lived with each other shall count as part of the period of desertion or the period for which the spouses have lived apart, as the case may be:</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall only apply where the spouses are not living with each other at the time the application is made.</P>
    <P> (3)  (a)  In this section spouses shall be treated as living apart from each other unless they are living with each other in the same household, and references to spouses living with each other shall be construed as references to their living with each other in the same household.</P>
    <P>(b)  In this section &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; includes conduct on the part of one spouse that results in the other spouse, with just cause, leaving and living apart from that other spouse. </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P> 3.  &mdash;(1)  Where, on an application under section 2 of this Act, the court is satisfied that any of the grounds referred to in subsection (1) of that section which have been relied on by the applicant have been proved on the balance of probabilities, the court shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section and section 6 of this Act, grant a decree of judicial separation in respect of the spouses concerned.</P>
    <P> (2)  (a)  Where there are, in respect <Col N="1315" /> of the spouses concerned, any dependent children of the family, the court shall not grant a decree of judicial separation unless the court&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  is satisfied that such provision has been made, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  intends by order upon the granting of the decree to make such provision,</P>
    <P>for the welfare of those children as is proper in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>(b)  In this subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;dependent children of the family&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of Part II of this Act;</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(3)  Upon the granting of a decree of judicial separation by the court, the court may, where appropriate, by order give such directions under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as it thinks proper regarding the welfare or custody of, or right of access to, an infant (being an infant within the meaning of that Act) as if an application had been made under that section.  </P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 1 would substitute new sections for sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Under these amendments a court would grant a decree of <Col N="1316" /> judicial separation on proof of one or more of the facts of adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion, separation for one year where there is consent or separation for three years where there is no consent.  In addition, my amendments would make it clear that separation would include the case where spouses living under the one roof are, in effect, living separate lives.  My amendments would also make it incumbent on the court before granting a decree, whether or not the spouses so wish, to consider the position of the children of the marriage so as to ensure that provision would be made for them as was proper in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to say about my amendment No. 1 is that it follows the Fianna Fáil proposal contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and also the proposals of the previous Governments on judicial separation as set out in the statement of intentions of 1986 and is in line with the position in other common law jurisdictions.  My proposals are also closer in certain respects to the proposals of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and those of the Law Reform Commission than are the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>My main objection to the provisions of sections 2 and 3 of the Bill relate to the following.  First, the Bill purports to provide that the one overall ground for the granting of a decree of judicial separation shall be irretrievable breakdown. Second, a decree of judicial separation may be granted under the Bill where, and I quote from the Bill, &ldquo;the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent&rdquo;.  Third, the Bill places no obligation on the court on its own account to consider whether proper provision is or can be made for any children of the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the first objection concerning irretrievable breakdown, I have to say at the outset that it is a wholly inappropriate concept in the case of judicial separation and it has been recognised as such, not <Col N="1317" /> only in Northern Ireland and across the water, but also by the Deputy's own party in the previous Government.  It is inappropriate because, unlike a divorce decree which is final in that it dissolves the marriage, a separation decree does not affect the status of marriage &mdash; it merely absolves one spouse from the legal duty of cohabitating with the other &mdash; the parties are still married and may indeed reconcile whereon the decree will be discharged.  In the context of separation proceedings, therefore, it is a misnomer to think in terms of something that is irretrievable when clearly the effect of the decree of separation that is granted by the court is not necessarily final.</P>
    <P>The argument advanced by Deputy Shatter in favour of his proposal is that the courts when determining an application for a decree of judicial separation under his Bill would do so on the basis that the marriage has broken down irretrievably and not on the basis of labelling one or other spouse as being guilty of cruelty, adultry or desertion.  This, of course, goes to the core of his argument that the Bill is a no-fault Bill and it has been the theme of his campaign in the media.  This argument does not stand up to examination.  The reality is that the court may not grant a decree unless the applicant satisfies the court of one or more of a number of facts, all of which, with the exception of the ground of separation, are fault based.  To pretend, therefore, as Deputy Shatter has done, that irretrievable breakdown is the sole ground for granting a decree and that, in consequence, the Bill is a no-fault Bill is misleading and false and my amendments are designed to eliminate that pretence from the Bill.  In this connection, let me quote a recent discussion paper from the Scottish Law Commission on their divorce law &mdash; which is similar to that in England and Northern Ireland from which Deputy Shatter's proposals are drawn.  The commission stated that one criticism of the present law is that it is misleading.  It &mdash; the law &mdash; pretends that there is one ground for divorce &mdash; irretrievable breakdown whereas in <Col N="1318" /> reality there are five grounds &mdash; three based on matrimonial offences and two based on periods of separation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has maintained that the court when granting a decree under his Bill would merely state that the decree is granted due to irretrievable breakdown in the marriage, not mentioning the fact or facts on which it is granted.  He has no basis for saying that.  The courts, when exercising similar provisions in our neighbouring divorce jurisdictions, state in <i>decree nisi</i> orders not only that the marriage has broken down irretrievably but that it has broken down on the fact of adultery or whatever fact is in issue. Decrees of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> granted by our courts at present also state the basis for granting a decree.  Misbehaviour would, of course, become an issue in any event in the context of the financial provisions that may be made by the court under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another problem with this part of the Bill is the unnecessary additional need to prove irretrievable breakdown except, that is, where the spouses consent to an application on the fact of one year's separation. That exception was inserted on Committee Stage following Deputy Taylor's amendment.  The irony is that having copied English divorce legislation for the purposes of a Bill on judicial separation Deputy Shatter uses the very concept which is expressly excluded from separation proceedings in England and, indeed, in Northern Ireland.  Moreover, their experience is that the court would not, in most cases, investigate the matter and in the rare case in which there is a doubt as to whether the marriage has broken down irretrievably, the only practical solution is for the court to adjourn the proceedings to enable attempts to be made to effect a reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas joint committee recommended that once one of the grounds of adultery, desertion etc. is proved the courts should grant the decree.  In that sense the committee's recommendations are closer to my amendments.  Under my amendments the applicant would also only have to prove the facts which correspond to those in the <Col N="1319" /> Bill, apart, that is, from section 3 (1) (f) without any more ado.  Nowhere in the Oireachtas joint committee's report is there a recommendation that there must in addition to one of the facts of adultery etc. be a requirement, as the Bill has, that the court be satisfied that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Deputy Taylor's amendment, removing that requirement where there is consent to the application based on separation for a period of one year, went some way to acknowledge the logic of my argument against irretrievable breakdown but, unfortunately, it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second objection concerning the grounds for a decree in section 3 (1) (f), no one who listened carefully to the arguments so far advanced in favour of the subsection could be convinced that it represents good policy or clear law.  The ground therein is that &ldquo;the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent&rdquo;. It was recommended by the Oireachtas joint committee but was, quite properly in my view, rejected by the previous Government in their statement of intentions as being unduly vague.  Deputy Shatter has stated that this provision is the kernel of the no-fault provisions in the Bill.  My objection does not relate to whether it is a no-fault provision.  In fact I do not agree that it is a no-fault provision because the court in considering an application under this head would have to inquire into the difficulties of the marriage which inevitably would raise questions of fault.  My objection is that it would give the court a <i>carte blanche</i> to grant decrees of separation on almost any basis.  In effect the court is being asked to discharge a spouse from the duties and responsibilities of a marriage, not on the basis of adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion or separation but on something else and that &ldquo;something else&rdquo; is not defined in Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the grounds of adultery, unreasonable behaviour, which includes the existing grounds of cruelty <Col N="1320" /> and unnatural practices, desertion and separation, which under my amendment would include spouses who are leading separate lives under the one roof, would, as they do in our neighbouring jurisdictions, provide a proper basis for a decree of separation.  It would be wrong I think, if we were to ask the court to entitle spouses to live separate from each other on any other basis.  To do so would, surely, be to denigrate the status of marriage and the duties and responsibilities of spouses one to another which exist within marriage.  Section 3 (1) (f) drives a coach and four through the other grounds in section 3.  Indeed it makes all the other grounds redundant.</P>
    <P>If there is a problem in this area then in my view it is related to the case where spouses, even though living under the one roof, are in fact living separate lives. In other words, there are two households under the one roof.  My amendment has been drafted to cover that case.  Under the amendment such spouses can be regarded as separated for the purposes of the grounds of separation.  That so far as I can gather is what is, in essence, intended to be covered in section 3 (1) (f) of the Bill.  My approach is a far preferable approach than that of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally with regard to objection No. 3 concerning the inadequacy of provisions in relation to children, this aspect has been given very careful consideration by me.  At the very least it would seem to be necessary to ensure that before granting a decree of separation the court would have placed on it an onus to make sure that whatever arrangements are made for children are proper in all the circumstances. The provision in section 14 (1) (h) of the Bill in relation to children does not go far enough.  It merely provides that the court can in separation proceedings make an order under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, determining any dispute between the spouses relating to any dependent child of the family.  In other words the court would not have to address the question of children unless an application was made to it under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  Under my amendment the <Col N="1321" /> court, before it grants a decree of separation, must look at the children's welfare whether the parents wish it or not. At present the court does not have that power in guardianship proceedings, nor is it provided for in the Bill and the absence of such a provision in the Bill is to my mind a grave omission.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said will help Deputies to make up their own minds about what is or is not in the Bill and what my amendments aim to do.  We need to be clear in our minds as to the effect the legislation will have when enacted.  Unfortunately the widely advertised statements of people involved in promoting the Bill have been misleading and irresponsible in some respects.  I have dealt with the more important of those. The amendment I am proposing in substitution for sections 2 and 3 of the Bill is aimed at improving the Bill and I ask this House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are opposing the amendments tabled by the Minister, which are similar to amendments tabled by him on Committee Stage.  I find it curious to hear the Minister refer to divorce legislation or reports produced about divorce legislation in other countries.  I would emphasise that the provisions in this Bill have nothing to do with the issue of divorce. They are concerned with, as the Minister during the course of other comments stated, conferring on the courts a jurisdiction to grant decrees of separation and with reforming the law in this area in so far as it has remained untouched and unreformed for hundreds of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 tabled by the Minister deal with the substantive grounds laid down in the Bill for the granting of separation decrees in the event of the Bill becoming law.  I want to emphasise that the provisions contained in the Bill in this regard reflect the unanimous recommendations made by the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown published in 1985.  They are not intended to reflect English or Scottish divorce laws or indeed divorce laws in any other jurisdiction outside this <Col N="1322" /> country.  They are designed to implement a report produced by an Oireachtas joint committee which, for the first time since the foundation of the State, made extensive and comprehensive recommendations about reforming our marriage laws.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the context of amendment No. 1, objects primarily to two aspects of the current Bill.  First, he objects to the provision whereby the one overall ground for the granting of a separation decree is proof of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  The Minister wishes to delete that provision from the Bill.  He also wishes, in listing five grounds for the granting of a separation decree, to remove (f) of section 3 (1), a provision which would enable couples whose marriages have broken down to obtain separation decrees without having to engage in unnecessary name calling or abuse of each other within our courts system.</P>
    <P>The Minister lays down five grounds for the granting of a separation decree. Those grounds reflect five of the facts listed in section 3 of the Bill as it stands which can result in the courts reaching a conclusion that a marriage has irretrievably broken down.  Desertion, unreasonable behaviour or other matrimonial misbehaviour, as it would be regarded, such as adultery is not provided for in the Bill as it currently stands as a means for the courts to label one or other spouse to be the guilty or innocent party in a matrimonial conflict.  The facts stated in the Bill under section 3 which enable the ground of irretrievable breakdown under section 2 to be established are used as symptoms which the courts can take as indicating that marital breakdown has occurred.  In other words, desertion or adultery would be regarded as an external manifestation of the fact that the marriage has run into considerable difficulties.</P>
    <P>If the courts rely on such an application to grant a separation decree, at the end of the day the decree would be granted on the one ground of the courts making a finding that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  That would take out of the <Col N="1323" /> courts system the unnecessary labelling and unnecessary identifying of a husband or a wife as the guilty or innocent party in a marriage breakdown.  Very often, either intentionally or unintentionally, both spouses contribute to some degree to the collapse of their marriage.  It is a very rare case indeed where only one spouse is the contributor to a marriage breakdown.  There are of course many instances where one spouse may contribute to a greater extent than the other to the collapse of a marriage but there is nothing to be gained from the courts having to try to pick out who is the guilty or innocent spouse.</P>
    <P>The essential role for the courts to play is surely one in which they should determine, at the time the couple come to court looking for a separation decree, whether their marriage is a viable one, whether the relationship is retrievable or whether it has irretrievably collapsed. Section 2 of the Bill which reflects the recommendation made by the Oireachtas joint committee provides that irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be the one overall ground for the granting of a separation decree, and I hope that approach commends itself to Members of the House as was previously the case on Committee Stage.  The decision that that should be the one overall ground was reached by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown after two years of deliberations, having received in excess of 700 written submissions and held approximately 24 oral hearings in which representations were received from a cross-section of groups representing a diversity of views.  In the context of all those groups, the view was that the courts should be empowered to grant separation decrees without having to engage in the labelling process and without having to determine in simplistic terms guilt or innocence for the breakdown of a marriage, as the courts have to do at present.</P>
    <P>In that context it is worth recalling and noting on the record of this House that since debate on this Bill has started, no substantial group representing any major <Col N="1324" /> social organisation working in the area of marriage breakdown, no group working in the area of providing legal assistance for couples whose marriages have collapsed, no major church representing any segment of Irish society, have opposed this approach.  The reason is it is agreed among all of them and, indeed, it has been welcomed.  In opposing the Minister's amendment, I say it is regrettable he should again press this amendment, having had an opportunity to have it discussed in great detail on Committee Stage when it was rejected.</P>
    <P>Solicitors spend 95 per cent of their time advising husbands and wives whose marriages have broken down about matrimonial law and representing them in the courts.  It is worth drawing to the Minister's attention, regarding the Government law centres which operate under the aegis of the Department of Justice and deal primarily in the area of family law that their solicitors in their submission to the Oireachtas joint committee in 1985 emphasised, and I quote from page 49 of the committee's report:</P>
    <P>The law, by insisting on one party proving fault, encourages conflict between the spouses.  It actively discourages reconciliations between a couple.</P>
    <P>It states also:</P>
    <P>It should be possible for spouses to obtain judicial separation in the courts when a marriage has irretrievably broken down. </P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister has had no regard, in bringing this amendment before the House, to the very recommendations made by the solicitors employed by his own Department who have experience, so to speak, at the coal face in working with marital problems and who stated very clearly that separation laws should be based on the concept of irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the amendment he has tabled, the Minister referred to the provision in the Bill which allows the courts to reach a determination that a marriage has irretrievably broken down if it can be <Col N="1325" /> established that, &ldquo;the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to co-habit with the respondent.&rdquo;  This provision will enable the majority of spouses who wish to seek a separation decree without exacerbating a marital conflict to do so by coming before the courts and proving in effect that they are totally incompatible and that their marriage has broken down.  It is not a vague or woolly notion as the Minister today and in the past in the context of previous discussions of this Bill has suggested.  A court will grant a decree only if it is satisfied that the marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the couple to separate and that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>There is an essential linkage there.  It makes it very clear that what the court will be concerned with is looking at the question of the viability of the marriage relationship.  To remove this provision from the Bill would re-insert into the law the essential need for conflict in the courts between couples who seek separation decrees where they are still living under the one roof in the one household.  It would move away from the approach recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown who emphasised there was a need to ensure that there was a means of establishing that a marriage had broken down without couples having to make allegations of matrimonial misconduct against each other.  They emphasised in the context of the welfare of children that there was a great benefit in providing such an approach because in providing for a need to prove adultery, desertion or cruelty, you sought to maximise the matrimonial conflict, to drive a further wedge through the current court system between the spouses.</P>
    <P>The joint committee's report acknowledges that where a marriage has broken down and a couple are estranged there is a need to provide a legal procedure which allows them to separate with court help, if such is required, in a civilised way so <Col N="1326" /> as to ensure that estranged spouses with young children will at a later stage be able to co-operate with each other as parents of their children.  In talking about the welfare of children, and this Bill not providing adequately for it, the Minister has substantially missed the point that the Bill is concerned as much with providing a civilised means of enabling couples whose marriages have collapsed to separate as it is concerned with promoting the welfare of children and ensuring that if a marriage has broken down to the extent that the couple have to go to court there is a means whereby they can get court assistance without such court assistance endangering the possibility of future parental co-operation.  Within the Minister's approach deletion from the Bill of section 3 (1) (f) establishing the fact that a marriage has broken down as a ground for the obtaining of a separation decree would ensure that this mechanism to allow separation decrees to be granted without the necessity to maximise the marital conflict would be removed from the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worth making the point that during Committee Stage the Minister claimed he was trying in effect not to follow the approach of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  He says now he is following that approach though patently that is not the case.  He said his intention was to follow the approach adopted by the Law Reform Commission, and the Law Reform Commission's report on divorce a <i>mensa et thoro,</i> or judicial separation, published in 1983, in recommending that the law be reformed and that new grounds be provided for the granting of a separation decree did not adopt the approach of the Oireachtas joint committe.  The Oireachtas joint committee representing all parties and all sides of this House, looked at the Law Reform Commission report and did not accept it and, indeed, proposed the formula we have in this Bill. However, the Law Reform Commission recognised the need to provide a basis for getting separation decrees in the context of couples living under the one roof in the one household and of couples who have separated but who have not agreed <Col N="1327" /> a permanent separation, without their having to prove cruelty, adultery or desertion, which would be required under the Minister's provision.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the proof of breakdown of marriage should itself constitute a ground for the granting of a separation decree and on page 43 of their report gave a variety of reasons why breakdown of marriage should be a ground in that respect.  One was, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...in support of breakdown of marriage as a ground for legal separation, ... some people, may prefer not to involve themselves in making allegations that their spouses have been guilty of matrimonial misconduct. Rather than make such allegations, they may wish to seek a legal separation on the basis that the marriage has broken down &mdash; a ground that involves no name-calling or criticism of the other spouses' behaviour. </P>
    <P>Spouses who want to get decrees of judicial separation without engaging in name calling or criticism of each other's behaviour will, if this Bill remains intact with the current provisions contained in sections 2 and 3 unamended, be able to get such separation decrees where they are living in the one household by reliance on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage coupled with establishing the facts necessary under section 3 (1) (f), that is by establishing that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for them to live separate and apart.  In essence to remove that provision would not only run counter to the views of the Oireachtas joint committee but would run counter to the views of the Law Reform Commission. I would prefer to rely on the view of the Oireachtas joint committee and the Law Reform Commission when they were considering our laws of judicial separation than on any view expressed by the Scottish Law Reform Commission dealing with the issue of divorce in Scotland, and I find it extraordinary that the Minister should come into the House and <Col N="1328" /> by implication suggest, that, rather than us following recommendations made by our own bodies within this State about our laws for judicial separation, we should enact Scottish divorce law.</P>
    <P>To conclude, in regard to the question of children and the welfare of children, I have already made the point about how important is the breakdown principle in regard to the possibility of getting divorces <i>a mensa et thoro</i>&mdash; or judicial separations as they will be called now under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; without having to engage in name calling.  That is important to note, because the Minister has suggested that this Bill does not contain adequate provisions to protect the welfare of children.  Under the Bill if there is any immediate risk to children, section 12 (c) will allow the courts, where any immediate orders are required to protect the welfare of children, to make those orders under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  Where any other court orders are required as regards protecting the welfare of children in the context of guardianship, custody, visitation rights or access matters under section 14 (1) (h) of the Bill the courts will also be able to make orders under the Guardianship of Infants Act.</P>
    <P>In case any Member of this House is in any doubt about the court's powers under that Act, the provisions under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which are incorporated into this Bill expressly provide that, in determining any issue with regard to the guardianship, custody or welfare of children, it is the welfare of the child which shall be &ldquo;the first and paramount consideration&rdquo;.  This Bill expressly brings into operation the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which has been with us for over 20 years which prescribes that any decisions in regard to children should be taken on the basis of their welfare being regarded as the first and paramount consideration, and in respect of which there is a tried and trusted body of judicial case law built up which, in the context of disputes between husbands and wives, has very clearly ensured that the welfare of children is <Col N="1329" /> fully and properly protected in so far as it can be in a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had wished to improve the Bill in regard to the welfare of children there are certain things he could have done that he has not done and that I cannot do in a Private Members' measure. Instead of the Bill having provisions, as it does, to simply improve the court structure, it was always open to the Minister to try to amend it to provide for a uniform system of family courts with special trained judges.  That was not something the Minister saw fit to do, although we asked him on Second Stage to do so and indicated to him that we would be delighted if he did.  If he was serious about taking additional steps to protect the welfare of children, that type of approach would have been helpful.</P>
    <P>The provision of a comprehensive in-court welfare service to assist the judges in making decisions would have been an additional protection.  That cannot be done in a Private Members' Bill without the Government wishing to insert such a measure in a Bill.  There are a variety of additional protections that the Minister could have provided for that cannot be provided in the context of a Private Members' Bill.  In the context of the Minister merely trying to tinker with the Bill and suggesting that we should import into our law parts of Scottish divorce reform recommendations, I find the comments made by the Minister in regard to this Bill not protecting the welfare of children very difficult to take seriously.</P>
    <P>I would hope that I will have, as I had on Committee Stage, the support of all sides in this House in rejecting the two amendments the Minister is tabling which will only result in making it a great deal more difficult for couples who are living in very unhappy circumstances within their own homes and for whom the law currently provides no remedy to find a means of resolving their marital problems. If this amendment is made there will be many couples for whom this Bill holds out a great deal of hope at the moment who will have their hopes dashed and who will find themselves condemned to live in a collapsed and irretrievably <Col N="1330" /> broken marriage without any legal mechanism being available to them to help them and offer them the possibility of reorganising their lives in a civilised way.</P>
    <P>I was grateful for the support this Bill received on Committee Stage and I want to put that on the record of this House. I hope we will have similar support on Report Stage in rejecting these two amendments the Minister has tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, and my party, will be opposing the Minister's amendments. I am disappointed to see the Minister has sought to reintroduce essentially what he moved on Committee Stage.  The arguments he brings forward today are no different to those that he brought forward on Committee Stage.  They were well thrashed out and well discussed; there was a lot of time spent on this item.  It is not that this aspect of the Bill has not been given as wide a discussion as it ought to have but, the Minister sees fit once more to come into the House and attempt to change the basis of this whole Bill, which is to move away from the fault-based adversarial system within family law.  I fail so see why the Minister cannot accept that the full House has spoken on this very principle on Second Stage and in special committee, and has very definitely followed a particular line right through the deliberations of that special committee.  Yet the Minister still sees fit to bring it through on Report Stage, disregarding the views that the House has expressed so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will repeat, because I feel it must be said again, that my feeling is that it is long past the time for these separation proceedings to be removed from the adversarial system of justice as much as possible.  That said, I accept it is not possible to remove it completely, because when one person's word is put against that of another, as in the case of spouses opposing one another, one cannot move completely away from it; but one can &mdash; and this Bill is attempting to do that &mdash; move towards a situation where the courts are seen to encourage as much agreement between the parties as possible, and only the areas which are truly <Col N="1331" /> in dispute are decided by the court.  It is widely recognised that it is extremely dangerous and damaging to the future relationship if couples, particularly those who have children and have to act in the role of parent for the period when the children are under their care.  It is widely recognised that the system which exists at present for dealing with separation is very damaging not just to the spouses involved but also to the children.  It is also widely recognised that the more adversarial the system is, the more trauma there is for the children, and the more the children are used by one party against the other.  Whatever we can do to avoid that is absolutely essential.  The Minister's amendment will, unfortunately, drive us back almost into the situation which we have today.</P>
    <P>I believe we should take family law completely out of the normal judicial system.  We should have a particular approach which, perhaps, is exemplified in family tribunals.  On Committee Stage my colleague, Deputy Harney, attempted to introduce amendments which were ruled out of order which would have done this.  It should be removed from the court-based system and into tribunals, and the law should reflect the fact that it is non-adversarial as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I reject the Minister's amendment also because he sees fit to leave out a provision which relates to the one in the existing Bill at section 3 (1) (f) which allows for situations which are not set out in the other proofs for the the ground of irretrievable breakdown.  There will certainly be some cases which will be taken on the basis of adultery or desertion or the other proofs that are mentioned here but I would agree with Deputy Shatter that in the majority of cases we will find that couples will make use of section 3 (1) (f) simply because it does not require them to come into court and take their marriage apart bit by bit.  That is the danger that is inherent in the Minister's amendment. There is no choice left to a couple, they must go in and take their marriage apart, limb from limb, because they will <Col N="1332" /> be advised that if they do not do that they will lose their case.  That is essential in the legislation.  That is not good enough, as the Minister said, for a couple who live in the one house and whose marriage has broken down but cannot agree on the terms of their parting.  It may be an element in the argument but it is not the entire one.  The Minister's amendment is fatally flawed on that ground alone.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what the Minister said about the welfare of children as dealt with in the Bill.  It is quite a negative move to insist that a court should bring the children's welfare into every case despite the fact that their future and their welfare may be one of the elements agreed on by the couple.  In other words, the Minister is encouraging a couple to bring the welfare of their children into court thereby, perhaps, putting pressure on them to use that welfare as a tradeoff against something else that is at issue in the case.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the children's welfare should be dragged into every case.  There are many instances of health boards taking children into care and there are defined circumstances in which such children are taken care of, whether given over to foster parents or put into residential care.  The Minister in his approach to the Bill does not seem to think that there should be defined circumstances for interfering with parental rights over children, especially when they agree.  When they do not agree it is a quite legitimate for a court to inquire as to the circumstances. I question the constitutionality of bringing the welfare of children into every case when parents have expressed a view on it and agreed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this issue because what we are referring to was highlighted before.  The point against the Minister's amendment is that he wishes to maintain effectively the adversarial system which we have and, in his amendment, seeks to deny the opportunity to couples who wish to separate without mud flinging to the nth degree. He is denying them the opportunity to go to court and prove it or otherwise that their marriage has irretrievably broken <Col N="1333" /> down.  I do not accept the Minister's argument that the term &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; refers simply to divorce.  We are not dealing with divorce, we are dealing with a separation which a couple recognise but cannot agree on the terms on which they will separate, such as the care of the children or other aspects.  In many cases couples would welcome the fact that they do not have to drag up every bit of dirt that occurred over the years in court.  They are forced to do that at present and for that reason I oppose the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one thing to be thankful for it is that at least we have brought the Report Stage of the Bill into the correct forum for discussing it.  I was beginning to wonder whether the entire debate was going to be carried on exclusively in the letters column of <i>The Irish Times.</i> This is a more appropriate venue for the various issues to be discussed rather than in the letters column of that newspaper.  I do not think it was helpful that that exchange of correspondence took place in the run-up to the Report Stage debate.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, I do not wish to delay the House too long by going over ground that has been covered at considerable length on Committee Stage but I should like to make a number of points. There has been a lot of talk to the effect that courts are a bad place to deal with family difficulties and that they should be taken to some other venue.  I have heard the word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; mentioned as though for some magical reason &ldquo;court&rdquo; is bad but &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; is good.  What is a tribunal except a place where people go to have their difficulties resolved and where one person presides.  There is not a great deal to choose between a court and a tribunal and we should get away from this kind of cant or using emotive expressions in regard to the subject.  There is no practical difference between a court and a tribunal; essentially they are the same, one person presides and decides after people have presented their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a lot of cant about <Col N="1334" /> the adversarial system and some suggestions put forward that in some way the Minister's amendment, which we will not be supporting, is to the effect that the adversarial system is bad while the Bill, which gets away from it, is good.  I do not see that as a fair point.  In both cases one is an adversarial position.  If that was not the case one would not be going before the court.  If one was not in an adversarial position one would be negotiating with solicitors, or with the other partner, or with the aid of an arbitrator and resolving difficulties by means of a separation agreement.  Once one reaches the stage where one is availing of the provisions of the Bill one is in an adversarial position. To be fair to the Minister, it is unfair to make that point as far as his amendment is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) (f) states:</P>
    <P>(f) that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent. </P>
    <P>The idea is being put about that that gets away from any adversarial position arising.  I do not think that is so.  I can visualise lengthy adversarial discussions taking place, and evidence being put forward, as to whether it was or was not reasonable for an applicant.  Such a question would surely involve the circumstances of the marriage that had gone before.  I do not see that that, by some mystical process, avoids the adversarial position arising in a dispute.  We have to face the fact that when one is in a court domain it is an adversarial situation.  If it was not there, one would not be in the court situation at all.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulty with the Minister's amendment &mdash; and I looked at it as sympathetically as I could &mdash; is that it is too narrowly based apart from the one ground of consent which was based on the original amendment which I moved on Committee Stage.  The grounds listed are not adequate to cover the needs of a modern society on this issue.  That is not <Col N="1335" /> to say I am entirely happy with the drafting of the Bill as it comes before us now. I do not think it totally reflects what the intent was either in the Law Reform Commission report or in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. When we were debating this on Committee Stage I said I felt that the drafting of it was perhaps over-tortuous and could conceivably give rise to difficulties in court.  Deputy Shatter knows more about it than I do but my reading of it is that it could possibly give rise to difficulties.  The Law Reform Commission report and the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown had one thing in common and that was that they saw the concept of breakdown of marriage as an adequate ground in itself for legal separation.  That appears to be the case from the Law Reform Commission report, page 46 which states:</P>
    <P>After much consideration we have come to the conclusion that the better approach would be for the legislation to include breakdown of marriage as an extra ground for legal separation. </P>
    <P>That is in addition to such other grounds as would be appropriate, desertion, separation or whatever.  The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, when summing up the situation at paragraph 7.3.8 states:</P>
    <P>In considering whether or not a marriage has irretrievably broken down, the court should be satisfied that such a breakdown has occurred if an applicant proves one of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is totally acceptable to me as far as it goes.  In other words if any one of those things are proved then that should be the end of the matter and any of those single grounds independently would constitute irretrievable breakdown.  What it does not say is that there might not be other grounds or that there could be an irretrievable breakdown <i>per se,</i> without anything else.  That kind of situation is well implied in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and it is certainly implicit in the Law Reform <Col N="1336" /> Commission report.  I would have thought that a more straightforward and simpler method of going about the drafting would have been to have listed the possible grounds and given those as adequate to prove that irretrievable breakdown had taken place but that the breakdown itself, even independently of one of those grounds, would be regarded as a ground for judicial separation.</P>
    <P>Taking the two positions now before us &mdash; the Bill which is before us now and the Minister's amendment as drafted &mdash; I would have to say that the Minister's amendment is altogether too narrow to meet the situation and we could not support it.  So far as the point about children is concerned, obviously looking at the matter from outside, one would be concerned that the position of children would be taken care of and would be protected. That would have to be regarded as a very important factor.  One also has to recognise, of course, that when the parties to a marriage &mdash; or should I say spouses at this stage &mdash; reach the position where they are coming before the courts on a judicial separation application, the situation of the children at that time alone has already been adversely affected.  All one can do at that stage is to ensure that the maximum possible protection is provided for them.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that section 12 does all that can reasonably be done to protect the children and to provide for them having regard to the fact that their situation must inevitably have been adversely affected by the difficulties that would have arisen with their parents when that stage is reached.  To sum up, the Labour Party will be opposing the Minister's amendment for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly afraid to get up and speak here lest I might be accused of delaying the proceedings.  I wish to make it quite clear that I want to put on record my feelings in relation to this matter.  I do not think we should be accused on this side of the House of unduly delaying the proceedings in <Col N="1337" /> relation to the Bill.  The fact is that Committee Stage went through quite expeditiously and at no stage did we delay.  If the record was examined it would possibly be seen that more speaking was done on the far side of the House than on this side.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy Taylor had to say.  Indeed, he made similar noises when we were discussing this section on Committee Stage. I thought his contribution both there and here today quite reasonable and very fair in that some other speakers on the far side of the House would try to allege that we on this side of the House are trying to stop judicial separation altogether. Deputy Taylor put his finger on it when he said it is unjust to say that the Bill, as drafted, brings in a no-fault system and that in some way the Minister's amendments, as proposed, do the opposite to that.  That is very unjust and unfair.  It should go out from this House that we on this side of the House have the same idea for widening the grounds for judicial separation.  In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is stated:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will reform the existing court procedure for dealing with family law cases to minimise the legal trauma for all involved and would introduce court procedures which will shift the emphasis in litigation from confrontation to factual inquiry. </P>
      <P>The report states further:</P>
      <P>The grounds on which judicial separation can be obtained will be extended to include desertion, constructive desertion, separation for a period of three years or, where both spouses consent, a lesser period provided that the spouses have availed of counselling. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What could be more reasonable than that?  It mirrors exactly what the Minister has proposed in his amendments.  Deputy Taylor's contribution both here and on Committee Stage was reasonable and fair in that he did not dismiss altogether the Minister's amendments and he saw some merit in them.  Yet when it came to voting <Col N="1338" /> he went back to the Bill as we have it now before the House and he did not, at any stage, vote with the Minister in relation to it.  He said that the Minister's grounds were too narrow and that it boiled down to paragraph (f), which is at issue between us.  It is possible that section 2(1)(b) of the Minister's proposed amendment would take in what Deputy Taylor, and indeed a number of other Members, have suggested, that that could be used in order to deal with other cases which would not come under any of the other sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that irretrievable breakdown was a concept which was more or less alien to judicial separation. I agree totally with him.  Suppose a spouse, a wife, applies for judicial separation on the basis of irretrievable breakdown and, under the provisions of this Bill, succeeded in getting such a decree in court, then let us suppose that in six months, eight months, a year's time or even in five years time the parties get together again &mdash; and that is not inconceivable &mdash; that spouse, the wife, would have to agree with her husband that the marriage had not irretrievably broken down.  The whole idea of judicial separation is that there is still a marriage, still a hope that at some future date there may very well be reconciliation.  To me that constitutes the nub of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the possibility that the parties to a marriage will get back together, however remote that possibility may be, the fact that the two spouses have said that their marriage has broken down irretrievably and obtained a court order to that effect renders some credence to the suggestion &mdash; if this Bill is passed into law &mdash; that the law is an ass.  If this Bill is enacted and such circumstances arose that would be the case.</P>
    <P>Many speakers on the far side of the House made great play of the fact that the provisions of this Bill do away with the fault concept.  I cannot see that.  I think Deputy Taylor said that the provisions do not do away with the fault aspect.  For instance, under the provisions of the Bill, if someone attempted to prove <Col N="1339" /> adultery they would have to prove fault. Again, if they initiated legal action on a number of the other grounds on which Deputy Shatter's Bill is based, they would have to prove fault.  As Deputy Taylor correctly pointed out, it is nonsensical to say it is not adversarial because, in circumstances in which couples can agree, they go to their solicitors and get legal separations by way of deeds of separation. If they cannot agree they will go to court or, likewise if there is some other problem, they will take it to court.  That is where the adversarial aspect arises.  If they go to court on a number of such grounds they will have to prove fault. That is the whole idea of going into court, to a tribunal or whatever; that is the reality.  I would have to say that a court, in determining a judicial separation application, would have to take into account all evidence and circumstances pertaining to a given case.  Obviously they would have to delve into the whole area of who was at fault or which party was more at fault than the other.</P>
    <P>The point was raised earlier on Committee Stage and must be emphasised, that the provisions of the Bill, as presented, go further than the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in that not only do these provisions say that one has to prove that a marriage has irretrievably broken down but, in addition, one has to prove at least one of six further grounds.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the Minister that this could very well render the granting of an application for judicial separation more difficult because the parties would have to prove irretrievable breakdown in the first instance and also one of the other grounds whereas under the provisions of the Minister's amendment they would have to prove one ground only.  That fact must be emphasised and it has not been in any of the contributions emanating from the far side of the House, the people who support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I can foresee cases of people going before a court seeking a judicial separation experiencing some difficulty in <Col N="1340" /> proving that their marriage has irretrievably broken down but yet, for instance, proving that there was adultery involved.  That fact has not been sufficiently explained or emphasised.  If there is an answer it has not emerged from the far side of the House.</P>
    <P>It was most unfair of people to contend that Fianna Fáil were delaying proceedings. I might reiterate that Fianna Fáil have proposed what are in my view reasonable grounds for judicial separation. What we take issue with is the fact that, in addition to those grounds, one must prove irretrievable breakdown. I would contend also that section 3(1)(f) &mdash; and Members on the far side of the House have agreed &mdash; constitutes a catchall phrase inserted in order to get every other case involved, as it were, to allow <i>carte blanche</i> for people to take legal action on the most trivial grounds and apply for judicial separation.  That is not right.  This is a very serious matter. Despite the impression others might like to create, we on this side of the House are treating it as a very important issue. That is why we deliberated on it on Committee Stage and are here again today to put our point of view, because I believe it to be a point of view represented in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the Minister's amendments and to say that the message must go out loud, clear and unambiguously from this House, that there is all-party agreement on the principle behind the provisions of this Bill.  It is important for us to declare again that all-party agreement was present from the first day this Bill was introduced and accepted by Government as one they would support in principle and allow progress through the House on that basis.  It would appear from some of the earlier delaying tactics of the Fianna Fáil Party and the more recent development of correspondents' columns in a national newspaper, that this all-party agreement had disappeared.  It must be made absolutely clear that this House is seriously attempting to address the very unsatisfactory nature of our current law <Col N="1341" /> that very inadequately addresses the subject of marriage breakdown.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter has pointed out that the Bill he has drafted and presented follows very closely the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which committee reported in 1985 after very considerable deliberations.  The provisions of this Bill constitute an effort by us, as legislators, to deal with the unsatisfactory outcome of the referendum on divorce.  The people pronounced that the Constitution should not be amended to allow for divorce and in the vacuum created subsequently we are now endeavouring to give some hope and assistance to people faced with the trauma of marital breakdown.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahern that if this Bill is enacted then the law will seem to be an ass.  Within the context that we failed to deal with the whole question of marriage breakdown in the most sensible, logical way, that is to provide for divorce, then perhaps we are rendering the law somewhat more nonsensical, or more of an ass.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister's amendments must be examined more closely.  There are three basic grounds of objection by the Minister to Deputy Shatter's proposals in sections 1 and 2.  He suggests that the concept of irretrievable breakdown is not appropriate.  By way of the provisions of this Bill we are endeavouring to present a single statement reflecting a logical approach to the problem. We are saying to married couples in this State that, where their marriage has gone wrong to the extent that they believe and can convince a court that things cannot be put right at a given time, then they should be entitled, with the judicial imprimatur of the court, to separate and live apart.  In endeavouring to clear up the mess, the nonsensical legal position obtaining, the very least we can do is make one single legislative declaration such as that contained in the provisions of section 2, as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a couple believe that their marriage has irretrievably broken down they should be able to look to the court for <Col N="1342" /> assistance in separating on whatever basis possible.  That is the basis on which we can clearly and forcibly say that it is an appropriate concept in the context of the way in which our law stands, but it is not beholding of the Minister to quote judicial or legislative precedents in other jurisdictions, which have sensibly and logically faced up to this question and provided the one solution which should exist, namely, divorce, in trying to cobble together another Irish solution to another Irish problem.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party should at this stage appreciate what is being attempted here.  I understood that all of us were setting out to make a simple, logical legislative declaration so that people would know where they stood in regard to the law when a marriage breaks down.  If we were to go further and look at what is proposed in the Bill and in the Minister's amendment together we will see that we are proposing virtually the same thing. There is little or no difference between the sides of this regard.  The grounds have been restated and there has been an ingenious rejuggling, perhaps to reflect the gravity of the sins as the Minister would see them, with adultery being put first whereas in Deputy Shatter's proposal it comes second.  Apart from that there is no difference, except for the omnibus section which is a source of great worry.  In drafting legislation it is normal to allow for a residual omnibus provision. This simply recognises that we, as legislators, might not consider all the different sets of circumstances which can arise in a relationship and which might present themselves to a judge.  In those circumstances, provided the judge is satisfied, we give him residual authority and power to adjudicate within the principles of the law as laid down, which may allow for interpretation, which tells the judge under the <i>sui generis</i> rule where he is obliged to interpret paragraph (f) he must do so in the logical consequence and context of the other provisions.  It does not allow for a nebulous action on the part of a judicial authority.  It is not at all convincing for someone to come into this House to say that they are unhappy about <Col N="1343" /> this wide sweeping, could mean anything provision under paragraph (f).</P>
    <P>As I understand from his contribution on Committee Stage and from a letter published in the letters column of a newspaper the Minister's final concern is that the law as it stands does not help or protect children.  I have to be careful about which word to use but I was both curious and furious when I saw the amendment tabled by the Minister on Committee Stage.  I was somewhat pleased that the lobby to which he was playing did not take up the handle and run with it.  It must be made absolutely clear that this amendment is utterly and totally superfluous.  It is not necessary in the context of family law legislation.  In the 1964 Act we laid down one of the most solidly based provisions and that has been developed to a fine degree by judicial interpretation.  If there is anything that could be said it is that the position of children is very well protected, could not be better protected. In all matters with regard to custody of paramount importance must be the welfare of the children.  It is for that reason I say that what is being presented by the Minister is superflous and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned with what Fianna Fáil are at in tabling the amendment. Last week we had an opportunity to make a comment on the Minister's attempt to shower praise on himself in regard to the legislation he introduced in respect of the abolition of the right of action for the restoration of conjugal rights.  The point was made at that time that we would have an opportunity to test the commitment of Fianna Fáil to family law reform when we came to discuss this legislation.  Over the past number of years we have managed to deal with great fortitude, and with no credit to us at all, so late in the day was it done, with the concept of illegitimacy, with domicile of dependency and with the equalisation of rights under the alien legislation.  Fianna Fáil said they were doing a good job and that they should get a pat on the back.  I believe that when we get down to implementing fundamental reform and dealing <Col N="1344" /> with the question of marital breakdown, which is the one question this House has not been able to grapple with for decades, each and every one of us will be put to the test in terms of our commitment.</P>
    <P>I was worried when Deputy Ahern remarked that if the Minister's amendment is not carried he would consider the law as being unsatisfactory from his point of view and, I presume also from his party's point of view.  They advance the argument that this concept is inappropriate as the marriage would still exist and they postulated the tired example of a couple who obtained a declaration of irretrievable marriage breakdown and then find weeks, months or years later that there is something they can work on and because of this they will find themselves in a ridiculous position.  We cannot take these provisions out of context.</P>

      <P>The objective of this legislation is that every avenue open to the couple for reconciliation should be investigated and pursued before the matter can be presented before the courts.  A judge then has to be satisfied that the marriage has broken down irretrievably before he can make a declaration. If the couple then realise that there is something to build on there would be no problem in having the order vacated, in the partners cohabitating together and doing their best to get back together again.  This already happens under the legislation in regard to barring orders under which the court effectively orders the parties to live apart on either a temporary or a long term basis.  There would be nothing to stop the parties coming back to say that things had been worked out, that lessons had been learned and that they wanted to get back togther again.  Just because a judge grants a barring order for 12 months it does not mean that in the interim period the couple should not seek to vacate that order, to appeal it and to have it set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not put forward spurious arguments against what is good <Col N="1345" /> legislation, and he should not do so at a time when we are all talking about virtually the same thing.  I am worried, and I have said this before, that if Fianna Fáil do not get their way despite the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee which we are following and despite strong debates on Second Stage, Committee Stage and here again today, they intend to pursue these issues afresh in the Upper House.  That is the worrying aspect of all of this.  It is where the real test of commitment to reform of the family law provisions sought to be promoted in this Bill will come to be shown and where Fianna Fáil will ultimately get their way to do down what is otherwise very good legislation.</P>
    <P>I believe that everything which needed to be said has been said.  We are saying exactly the same things to exactly the same people as we did earlier this year. Fianna Fáil make the case that this matter should be debated fully and openly.  We are debating it in public in the presence of virtually all the Deputies who were at the special committee but we are making all the same arguments and the same points again.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil to remember the principle on which we embarked on this legislation &mdash; all-party agreement to try to do something for very troubled people who are left in an unsatisfactory limbo by reason of the inadequacies of our law &mdash; and to allow this legislation to work its way through. It is good legislation and The Workers' Party believe that it does not require any amendment at all because it is well presented.  This legislation should be allowed a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is all-party agreement that there is a need to amend the law in relation to judicial separation, that this should be done in a caring and sympathetic way and that the problem should be dealt with at this stage.  I agree that over the years there has been a need for legislation such as this but the kernel of the debate is whether the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; should form one of the bases on <Col N="1346" /> which a decree of judicial separation should be granted.  The word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; means irreversible or irreconcilable. Something is either irretrievable or it is not.  Judicial separation does not put an end to marriage; judicial separation is not divorce.  In those circumstances one has to ask oneself the question: what are the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; doing in legislation dealing with separation?  Therefore, it would be illogical to describe a separation as an irretrievable breakdown of marriage. A breakdown in a marriage may lead to a decree of judicial separation but can any logical person say, where one is granting a decree of judicial separation, that it is, in fact, irrevocable breakdown or irretrievable breakdown in every case? This Bill ensures that those who go into court must prove not only one of the grounds on which the application is sought but also prove that the marriage has broken down and that it is irreversible and irreconcilable.  I do not believe that the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; have any place in judicial separation legislation.  I know of no other jurisdiction which uses the terminology &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; in judicial separation legislation.  The word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; is widely used in divorce legislation and I believe it belongs in divorce legislation.  For logical reasons, and linguistic reason alone, it clearly does not belong in legislation dealing with judicial separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been made, and made very well and ably, that section 3 (1) (f) of this Bill takes away the element of fault and that there is no longer a need to prove fault in proceedings dealing with judicial separation.  I, too, wish the world were perfect, but the world is not perfect. Far from eliminating the fault concept from judicial separation legislation, the Bill &mdash; by utilising the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; and by ensuring that an individual going to court must prove not just one of the grounds which Deputy Shatter sets out in his Bill but also that a marriage has irretrievably broken down &mdash; immediately introduces fault in an adversarial situation.  For example not <Col N="1347" /> only must one prove the fact that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to co-habit with the respondent but one must go on from there and prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  With regard to adultery, not only must one prove that adultery has been committed but one must go on from there and prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision that the court must grant a decree of judicial separation to the parties in a marriage who have separated for three years one could validly argue that we are coming as close as we possibly can to a no-fault situation. But in so far as this is a no-fault provision, that the individuals must have been separated for three years and that one party can get a separation, the no-fault provision is taken out by Deputy Shatter because he believes that not only must one prove that one has been separated for three years but one must go on from there and prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  The Minister's amendment leaves out the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; and one does not have to prove that.  If a person can establish that he or she has been living separately and apart from his or her spouse for a period of three years, he or she will be granted a decree of judicial separation.  It is that provision of the Bill which comes closest to a no-fault provision but Deputy Shatter, so to speak, defeats the purpose of his own avowed intentions by ensuring that the applicant must also prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>I want to pose the question of how one, in a court room and in an adversarial situation, proves that a marriage has irretrievably broken down.  To prove that a marriage has irretrievably broken down means that one must impute fault for the respondent.  One must say that because of certain circumstances existing with a marriage or because of some reason which is probably caused by one or other party, the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  In proving that a marriage <Col N="1348" /> has irretrievably broken down one is proving something which goes to the very core of the marriage itself.  One is saying that the marriage is at an end and it is ridiculous to assume that the court will not want to know why.  It will have to know why it should make a very serious decree and say that a marriage has irretrievably broken down, is finished for ever.  That is a very serious order for any court to have to make.  The court would have to make an inquiry into that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that section 3(1)(f) of the Bill which provides &ldquo;that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to co-habit with the respondent&rdquo; is a no-fault clause.  This provision appears to mean that the applicant goes to court and establishes that it is reasonable for him to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent. May I ask when is it unreasonable for the court to grant a decree under section 3 (1) (f)?  I suggest it would be unreasonable for the court to grant a decree under section 3(1)(f) when the respondent has done nothing to make it reasonable. Clearly, any fairminded person would consider that would imply fault and this is inherent in the adversarial system.</P>
    <P>It would be marvellous if it were a perfect world and were possible to have an absolute no-fault provision in legislation. However, the tragedy is that we do not have a perfect world.  In my view, it is nonsensical to say when one is trying to prove something is reasonable or unreasonable that there is no fault. Unfortunately there has to be fault on someone's part.  When is it reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent?  The answer to this is not set out in the legislation. Deputy Shatter has said on one occasion that it covers the case where two people living in the one house are effectively living apart.  The Minister has said in an amendment that this would be provided for.  It is fair that it should be provided for.  In order to say that it is reasonable <Col N="1349" /> for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent, you have to rely on the court to decide as the legislation now stands.  This means that the court exercises a discretion as to what is or what is not reasonable.  If this legislation is passed, there will be a large body of case law dealing with what is and is not reasonable.  It is too broad and also vague.  For example, if the husband gets on the wife's nerves for some reason &mdash; perhaps slobbering when eating &mdash; is that reasonable?  The court is being handed discretion in a very serious matter, the marriage bond, and in future years the legislation may be broadened to a far greater degree than was ever intended by this House.  It is handling over what I would regard as the responsibility of this House to the Judiciary, which is unfair to the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>It has been said that if the Government amendments are passed many people will lose out and will not be able to get a judicial separation, even if both want it. This is clearly ridiculous because the Minister has provided in the amendment that if the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a period of one year immediately preceding the application and if both parties so consent, the court must grant the decree.  Therefore, if the two people consent, after having separated from one another for one year, the decree will be granted.  Therefore it is misleading to say that many people will lose out.  Should the situation arise where one party to the marriage does not agree to a judicial separation after living apart for one year, the legislation is quite clear that after three years one party can apply even if the other party does not consent.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions proposed by the Minister for dealing with children it is extremely important that the court in judicial separation legislation should of its own volition decide how the children should be provided for, in other words that there be no necessity for an application by either spouse.  This is perfectly reasonable and should be accepted because very often in the tragedy of marriage breakdown, the children of the marriage suffered most.  The children face <Col N="1350" /> great trauma and very often face a most uncertain future.  It is clearly essential that the court be allowed to protect as far as it is possible the children in the case of a tragedy of a broken marriage.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the court taking account first and foremost of the position of the children in the marriage breakdown, as children have suffered the most in these situations.</P>
    <P>In my view it would be foolish for the Opposition Deputies or parties not to agree that the children of the marriage should be considered first and foremost by the court.  It is virtually certain that the children were not responsible for the breakdown of the marriage.  The children in this situation need the sympathetic and decisive action of the court to protect them.</P>
    <P>The argument that irretrievable breakdown must of necessity remain part of the legislation in order to express what has been described as no-fault judicial separation is inherently defective.  I believe that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; merely encourages people to prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down when, in some cases, it may not have.  In the event that people wish to be reconciled, I believe that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; is a barrier to such a reconciliation because in front of their neighbours and friends in a court of law it has been decided that their marriage has irretrievably broken down.  You cannot reconcile irretrievable breakdown with judicial separation no matter how one twists the words.  No matter how one tries to interpret the words, it is clearly logical that separation is a separation and that irretrievable breakdown is something different altogether.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, I was interested to note the number of speakers who have prefaced their comments by saying it was not their intention or wish to delay the passage of the Bill. There must be an underlying feeling of guilt.  I have not been a Member of this House for a long time, but I think it is <Col N="1351" /> somewhat strange that this evening we should be entering the third hour of a debate on legislation which we have dealt with word by word on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised to see the Minister coming back with the same amendment that was defeated on Committee Stage by a committee of this House.  I would like to place on record that people have spoken on all these points already and that we are not listening to anything new.  I take issue with what Deputy Ahern has said, but I agree that he has a point when he says we have heard absolutely no arguments today that were not dealt with on Committee Stage some months ago.  Having listened to speakers on the Government side, I think there is a fundamental contradiction as to where they stand.  An undercurrent that tends to appear every so often when dealing with the question of irretrievable breakdown is whether Fianna Fáil believe the concept to be too narrow or too broad.  I hope the Minister will address this when replying to the debate.  Does the Minister consider section 3 (2) paragraphs (a) to (f), inclusive, as outlined by Deputy Shatter to be too broad or too narrow?  There is a feeling among certain members of his party that the provisions may be too narrow while others feel that they may be too broad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has succeeded in doing what he did on Committee Stage when he brought in a red herring by referring to divorce-type legislation.  It is very unfair and inaccurate to describe what we are dealing with today as divorce-type legislation.  Referring specifically to section 3 (1) (f), he said that the concept of irretrievable breakdown was being brought into this jurisdiction.  He described it as divorce-type terminology of an alien nature.  I do not know very much about divorce law in other jurisdictions, but I know that it is possible to vacate or discharge a divorce and that parties who have a decree of divorce can re-marry each other.  If Deputy O'Donoghue's point is that irretrievable breakdown relates to divorce, I would point to the case of a well-known actress who <Col N="1352" /> vacated a decree of divorce, notwithstanding Deputy O'Donoghue's argument that it is irretrievable by nature.  The fundamental point we are dealing with is the concept of irretrievable breakdown contained in section (3) (1) (f).  It is important to keep the terminology of that section as it stands.</P>
    <P>The joint committee received approximately 700 submissions and deliberated for more than two years.  It is important that we should not take their opinion lightly.  The report of the committee states that grounds for judicial separation should be geared to show that a marriage has broken down rather than to find which spouse is guilty.  That is the nub of the problem.  We want to move away from laying blame and finding fault. Nobody is claiming that we would have a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; system.  Unfortunately there will be an element of fault, blame and recrimination in almost all cases; otherwise we would be seeing the deed of separation rather than the court hearing. The Bill as it stands minimises the fault and the trauma and reduces the difficulties in itemising the specifics &mdash; adultery, cruelty or whatever else.  We have succeeded in section 3 (1) (f) in suggesting a device which will reduce that trauma.</P>
    <P>The court must look at the overall circumstances of the breakdown.  Both parties must be able to go to court and say they have a problem, without going into great detail as to the origin of the problem. A couple should be able to admit that both are at fault.  Under the terms of the Minister's amendment it would be difficult to have such an arrangement.  If for no other reason, it is important that section 3 (1) (f) should remain intact.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned reconciliation.  I would readily agree that reconciliation is of fundamental importance, but very little can be done about reconcilation while going either up or down the steps of the courthouse.  When proceedings issue and a case is listed for hearing, there is very little scope for reconciliation at that stage.  I should like to think otherwise but the reality is that once proceedings have issued a marriage is heading for an unhappy end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> The Minister dealt to some extent with the finality of separation.  He feels it is not fundamental that a decree of separation should be final and believes that the door should be left open to a coming together or a re-uniting of the parties.  He said that if section 3 (1) (f) were to be passed we would be seeing the finality of separation. I would not agree.  A later section of the Bill contains a provision whereby the parties can have a decree of separation vacated.  Section 9 (2) provides that following the granting of a decree of judicial separation the parties can come together at any stage in the future.  Allowing for that safety valve, we have to look at the number of separations to date and the number of cases where parties decide, for better or worse, to come back together. The number of such people is negligible once they have gone through the trauma of effecting a decree of separation.  We are not dealing with reality when we say that couples may come back together at a later stage.  Statistics do not provide evidence of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Our over-riding consideration must be the report published by the all-party joint committee.  I will not go into detail on the various groups who made submissions. Every group in society had an opportuntiy of contributing and the committee's recommendations were not produced lightly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor felt that the grounds available under section 3 were not sufficiently wide.  He spoke about adultery and desertion and parties living separately for a three-year period.  The concerns expressed by Deputy Taylor are met by the provisions in section 3 (1) (f), which allows for an over-riding concept of marriage breakdown, allowing the court to take a broad look at the marriage rather than to itemise and specify.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to address himself to whether the Bill is too narrow or too wide.  Perhaps the next speaker from the Government side will do that.  There is an impression that they are not too sure.  There is a fear of divorce-type legislation from the Deputy O'Donoghue wing, yet Deputy Ahern can say that seciton 3 (1) (f) taken with the earlier <Col N="1354" /> paragraphs may give rise to too much difficulty in obtaining a decree.  What are the Government party talking about in their opposition to this section?</P>
    <P>A fear was expresed by Deputy McCartan that, if certain amendments were not carried in this House from a Government point of view, amendments might be put down in the Seanad.  If that happens we in this House will have a further opportunity of debating and voting on these amendments.  From that point of view, we cannot allow the passage of this Bill to de delayed further. Quoting from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is all very fine but putting the provisions in terms of that programme into effect is an area where we have not seen much progress.</P>

      <P>I took note of how long the previous speaker took delaying this legislation &mdash; approximately 20 minutes. It now appears he does not want anybody else to make a contribution.  I was sitting here, an innocent bystander, and looking with great fascination at the centrepiece of discussion, that is, the present ministerial amendment to sections 1, 2 and 3 of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  I did not intend making a contribution, and I would not say I was forced into making one, quite the contrary, but in the light of the self-righteous stridency from a number of Opposition speakers that we on this side do not have a right to make a contribution, I felt I might as well throw in my new penny's worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the Opposition's contributions seems to be to put the Government off side, and the Minister in particular, not to mention people like <Col N="1355" /> myself.  This Bill is not about divorce. What we are trying to do is to perfect the imperfect.  I have to bare my soul in this regard.  The FitzGerald referendum was met with contumely and contempt by the Irish people.  I felt it was brought forward too quickly.  If we wanted to bring in divorce, which I support and have consistently supported during my 25 years in this House, then was not the time to introduce that referendum but ten years hence.  Maybe at that time a referendum on divorce would pass.  However, the people in their wisdom decided they did not want divorce and what we are dealing with now is a direct result&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Taylor made an excellent contribution, if I might respectfully so suggest.  That is my opinion, nothing more and nothing less.  I have always taken the view that Deputies are entitled to express their views whatever the Government of the day say.  As a Government backbencher, I do not feel bound by what the Government of the day say. That is being domocratic and I think the Government of the day would see it that way.</P>
      <P>As I said, what we are trying to do here is perfect the imperfect.  We are left with Deputy Shatter's Bill on the one hand and the Minister's amendment on the other.  The Opposition expressed strident condemnation of very reasonable contributions from my colleagues, Deputy Ahern and Deputy O'Donoghue whose contributions were excellent.  The Opposition are entitled to make their points. They say there is a Deputy O'Donoghue wing and a Deputy Ahern wing of the party, and realising a bird flies on two wings now we have the Deputy Andrews wing of the Fianna Fáil Party.

      <P>This may cause confusion.

My views were not expressed even by those who represented my party.  That is why I am making this contribution.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment. Deputy Shatter's Bill deals with divorce, which I cannot see coming into law in this country for a number of years.  I congratulate him for bringing this Bill forward.  He has done a very good job for people who are suffering trauma in their marriages but if we are seeking perfection, there is one area he has omitted &mdash; I am sure he did not do it deliberately, he mentioned if from time to time &mdash; that is, children of a marriage.  I take the view that in the final analysis consenting adults are the authors of their own fortune or misfortune, but in the circumstances we are talking of the children who are the misfortunate ones.  The Minister has properly provided very correct guidelines for children of a traumatised marriage, and it is reasonable that he should have done so.  I am sure there is a very good reason for Deputy Shatter not dealing in depth with that area in his very generous proposal.  The Minister does deal with the children.  He is not meant to quote legislation from outside this jurisdiction in support and in defence of his position but that is the impression given by some speakers from the other side.  The Minister is entitled to express any viewpoint and to defend his position.  To say he should be brought into contumely and contempt for taking a particular position is unreal and unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apologies for this short contribution. I congratulate Deputy Shatter for producing this legislation, imperfect as it may be.  Having heard the Minister's response to Deputy Shatter and not being sycophantic, I think the Minister's explanation merited a lot of attention.  I was always convinced that irretrievability was <Col N="1357" /> as Deputy Shatter fairly presented it, but now I have grave doubts.  The Minister has presented his case and on balance, not because I am a Fianna Fáil backbencher but because I see the logic of his argument, and because he makes very clear provision for children I would be inclined to support him in a situation where I would like to see divorce.  In the meantime, we have to get on with it because there is no divorce.  We have to deal with the position as it is.</P>
    <P>In relation to the leagues of decency, or of indecency &mdash; as set out, the question of committing adultery, unreasonable practice, if one year separation and so on &mdash; and the juxtaposition of whether the Minister includes adultery is not necessarily relevant &mdash; on balance, I support the Minister's position but I am not hypercritical of what Deputy Shatter is attempting to achieve.</P>
    <P>The hype in the letters columns in the various newspapers prior to the introduction of this legislation was unfair to the House and did not do it justice.  I am not denying the right of people to do what they did but it was wrong and was a disservice to a discussion in the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak about the section of the Bill dealing with children. I agree with Deputy Andrews and I was a bit concerned when Deputy Colley said earlier that children should not be brought into all separation procedures.  If I recall correctly, she said that children should not be used in these situations.  I agree with her but it would not be right to take from that that somehow the Minister's proposals will mean that children will be used in cases.  The Minister's argument is that the Bill does not go far enough to protect the position of children. His proposal is that the court would not grant judicial separation unless it was satisfied that satisfactory arrangements had been or could be made for the welfare of children, as is proper in the circumstances. He also said that the court can do this of its own volition.  This is an important issue and I am glad that a <Col N="1358" /> number of speakers referred to it.  Practical suggestions have been made which do not relate to using children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill does not place an obligation on the court and the Minister's proposals are far more satisfactory and practical.  As other speakers said, the debate should not be about divorce; we are talking about separation and the effect of a decree of separation granted by the court is not necessarily final.  If it was, we would obviously be talking about divorce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>In relation to the allegation, particularly by Deputy Colley, that the Minister's amendment would introduce a note of discord and, as Deputy Colley unfortunately called it, &ldquo;muck throwing&rdquo; in the litigation that would be carried out under it, I have looked at the two proposed sections and I have come to a contrary conclusion from that of Deputy Colley.  To take one example of a ground for separation, under the Minister's amendment if a person commits adultery and the spouse claims separation as a result, then separation will follow. However, under Deputy Shatter's Bill, there is an additional requirement that irretrievable breakdown would be proven.  There would be quite an amount of conflict in a contested adultery case and it would be followed by another contest &mdash; in extra time so to speak &mdash; where the parties would contest irretrievable breakdown.  It is possible that parties in a <Col N="1359" /> very sad situation and for tactical reasons might not engage in too much of a tussle or so-called muck throwing in relation to an allegation of adultery and even a beaten party, a respondent who was found guilty of adultery, would find in this further proof of irretrievable breakdown, the possibility of endless muck throwing, discord and upset to a spouse who might be operating against the spouse who was guilty of adultery.</P>
    <P>I can see the other grounds for a claim for separation, that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the respondent, being debated and contested very vigorously in court.  If that issue were decided upon by the court, then one would think that there could be no further question in relation to it. However, under the proposed Bill the whole issue can be reopened and indeed issues outside that broad ground for separation can also be reopened.  Indeed, there could be further litigation with a sympathetic judge hearing the case.</P>
    <P>Some of the other grounds for separation are mechanical, such as being separated for three years.  A claim for separation based on the three year separation rule would be a very painless, non-controversial application and, under the Minister's amending proposals, there is no doubt that it would be clean, efficient and would not give rise to any great emotional trauma throughout the proceedings.  Of course, there could be emotional trauma arising from the preceding facts and because the marriage was being dealt with through separation proceedings but the proceedings themselves would not aggravate the situation under the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed Bill there would be a complete opening up of all possible factors in the marriage which might possibly reverse a bad result for one of the parties and which that party might seek to use to effect by bringing in this further test, this &mdash; if I were to use a vulgar term to describe it &mdash; injury time in separation <Col N="1360" /> proceedings.  These are practical difficulties and we must remember that lawyers are very ingenious people.  They seek to represent their clients in the best possible way.  If they have an oportunity for a second go at a particular issue they will take it up and canvass it for what it is worth.  Unfortunately one will find that, if the Bill goes through as proposed by Deputy Shatter, there will be many more needless disputes in court than there would be if the Minister's proposals were accepted.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to the various Deputies who have said that it is an absolute necessity to have section 3 (1) (f), which relates to the qualification for a separation, retained in the Bill.  That paragraph provides &ldquo;that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to co-habit with the respondent&rdquo;.  Through my experience as a practitioner and a public representative and through my general experience of life, I cannot think of any case which could not be dealt with adequately by the Minister's amendment. It would have helped considerably if the Deputies on the Opposition side were more specific in relation to what they meant by cases which would be most adequately dealt with by the provision of section 3 (1) (f).  They may be insisting on a provision which may, in time, be discovered to be redundant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the charges about whether or not the Government consider the Bill to be full of uncertainty, I am not in a position to speak for the Minister but my view is that there is too much uncertainty in the Bill.  It is not desirable for this House to pass legislation which is full of uncertainty.  Deputy Taylor took the point which I made in the special committee that one does not know how a case, say, in relation to section 3 (1) (f) might be pleaded.  What sort of particulars would be given where one was seeking to establish a case for a spouse under section 3 (1) (f)?  How would a court rule in relation to a request from the other side for particulars?  Naturally <Col N="1361" /> the courts will not tolerate a vacuum in relation to this; they will make their own rules.</P>
    <P>It is a fair comment by Deputy Taylor that the wording of the Bill as proposed is somewhat tortuous.  It leaves too many questions unanswered and it is undesirable that these questions would be left unanswered.  The electorate are entitled to know with reasonable clarity what legislation this House is passing.  That is a principle to which I adhere at all times while, at the same time, recognising that a degree of flexibility should be given to the courts.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister's amending proposals in relation to section 3 (1) and the sub-paragraphs contained in it provide a requisite degree of certainty and, at the same time, the flexibility which will deliver justice in any case that can be reasonably anticipated.</P>
    <P>I warn against getting caught up in a debate in this House about the legal niceties of separation on a non-irretrievable breakdown basis and separation on the basis of proven irretrievable breakdown in all cases, as is proposed in the Bill.  It is fair to say that there are technical reasons why irretrievable breakdown would not be inserted as a mandatory requirement for a separation. These technical reasons relate to the historical development of the concept of judicial separation as opposed to divorce.</P>
    <P>If we look at the practical reasons why people in Britain look for a separation rather than a divorce, we will find that there are real humanitarian considerations involved.  They are not concerned about the legal technicalities but about the emotional, philosophical and religious aspects of going into court and saying, as people do have to say in Britain, that their marriage has irretrievably broken down.  There are many people in Britain, where the two options are freely available and where the separation code remains true to its historical antecedents and does not require the declaration of irretrievable breakdown, who opt for separation precisely because they do not want to say that their marriage has irretrievably broken down.  Some of them will go further and say that they <Col N="1362" /> have philosophical or religious objections to divorce.</P>
    <P>Sometimes prisoners' wives and prisoners' husbands opt for separation because they do not want to say that they have put an end to the marriage. Considerations of loyalty to a person who is incarcerated very often dictate to ordinary people who are not particularly well equipped to decide the legal or philosophical niceties.  They make a practical decision that they want to stay loyal to their spouse while incarcerated and, at the same time, make practical provision by obtaining a separation decree.</P>
    <P>I know I have taken a very dramatic example of circumstances in which people would opt for a separation rather than a divorce but we should consider the ordinary people who go to court and their attitude to making a declaration, like putting a badge on, before they go into court to get the very sensible release that can be obtained under a separation decree, and wear this badge of irretrievable breakdown as a qualification for getting any other release.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage of this Bill I said that there would be a great demand, as a result of the many excellent provisions in the Bill, in relation to property, custody, access and all the various family law matters. I expressed that in the context of my concern that there might be a big rush into the courts and that they would get clogged up.  I must mention it now in the context of that demand affecting many people who, like the prisoners' wives in Britain, for their own reasons might not wish finally to avail of the other release in relation to property and so on because they do not want to say that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. They will see this as an obstacle to their availing of the excellent reliefs contained in the Bill whether it emerges as proposed by Deputy Shatter or is amended by this House.  For that reason I am more than anxious at this stage that Deputy Shatter would not insist on imposing this requirement of wearing the badge of irretrievable breakdown in all cases to avail of the excellent reliefs that will emerge, no doubt, in other respects in this Bill. <Col N="1363" /> If Deputy Shatter took this approach it would eliminate much of the controversy that has arisen in relation to this Bill, possibly would satisfy the general public demand for legislation in this area and perhaps make our discussions more relevant among the public to the general situation which requires to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I will put on record that I prefer the Minister's approach in relation to the requirement that the courts would take it on themselves of their own motion to consider the welfare of children.  Deputy Colley's point about the Minister's proposals being unconstitutional is certainly not well founded because the Constitution provides that the family is paramount. The interests of the family are paramount, not the interest of the individuals, be it the parents or whoever in the family.  Cases have been decided at a high level by the courts which asserted the concern of the courts through the constitutional provisions that the interests of the whole family would be taken into consideration when dealing with family matters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I support the Minister's amendment and commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>A number of people spoke in this debate this afternoon on the question of reality and then went into very long, detailed, technical and sometimes very isolating factors about this Bill.  Again and again I was reminded that this legislation is about helping people in relationships and at times of emotional upset when they are at their most vulnerable. This is when they need support most and that, I believe, is what all Members of the House would like to achieve for them.  Therefore, I found it bewildering that the other side of the House could find such difficulty with the concept of irretrievable breakdown of marriage and the way it is phrased in the Bill, &ldquo;that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent.&rdquo;  At times I was almost led <Col N="1364" /> to believe that people would go into court without their marriages having irretrievably broken down because it was the fashion of the season, that they would have <i>carte blanche,</i> as was mentioned, because in some way they would decide it was a trendy thing to do.  We must underscore again and again in all the legislation and, I hope, all the support services to implement this legislation, that people who reach the stage of going into court to seek a judicial separation have gone through all the stages of trying to hold a relationship, a marriage, a unit, together.  The Bill demands that efforts at reconciliation and conciliation be tried.</P>
      <P>The ethos, the Constitution, the emphasis on the family in this country are totally alien to anybody going into court to get a judicial separation if their marriage has not irretrievably broken down.  I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue's statement that we should deal with this in a caring and sympathetic way. We are bringing this legislation before the House two and a half years after June 1986 when, before the referendum on divorce took place, everybody pledged that there was a tremendous need, an urgent necessity for protective, supportive legislation to allow people to have a legal solution to the ending of their marriages.  At that time we were told again and again that divorce was not necessary, that this type of legislation would be forthcoming anyway and that people would be dealt with in the most sympathetic, caring and supportive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with other Members of this House that this has nothing to do with divorce at this stage.  The proposal in that referendum was defeated, we have accepted in a democratic way that that was so and now we have gone on, late I may say, to try to bring in legislation that will help couples experiencing marriage breakdown who do not have recourse or options such as those mentioned by Deputy Abbott as applying in Britain. They do not have options that they will consider philosophically, theologically or in any other way.  They have the court and judicial separation, and the more supportive and flexible we can make that <Col N="1365" /> within the total understanding and acceptance that people do not lightly and unreasonably go into court for the dissolution of their marriage the better.  We must put an end to any sense of insult to people who find themselves in bad marriages which they have tried to hold together.  That is the recognition and acknowledgement we must give to them.</P>
    <P>People who have happy marriages, who have held together, who have been lucky and fortunate enough to have chosen spouses with whom they can continue to live should feel privileged enough to give every help, support, sympathy and care to those who have not had a similar privilege.  That is what the irretrievable breakdown concept is all about. It is no accident or coincidence that all those working in this area who made submissions orally or even by letter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown agreed with the concept of irretrievable breakdown.  On Committee Stage of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill Deputy Shatter said that in 1975 the Episcopal Council for Social Welfare, a committee of the Catholic Bishop's Conference, in a statement on family law recommended irretrievable breakdown as the basis for granting decrees of separation.</P>

      <P>As this issue has been debated at length the response I have heard is of total support for the introduction of the concept of irretrievable breakdown so as to be rid of the aggressive, antagonistic adversarial system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor said that logically and practically the adversarial system cannot be totally removed in any court separation but we can arouse less antagonism and alienation.  In the context of relationships, we should be attempting to achieve the least damaging situation, not just for the parents but for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Abbott said that many would consider it a stigma if irretrievable breakdown were the reason for the collapse of a marriage.  I know a lot of women in <Col N="1366" /> Irish society who see it as a stigma of shame that they have been battered, deserted, violated, unmaintained, a much more shameful and embarrassing stigma than facing up to irretrievable breakdown of marriage would be.</P>
    <P>Why do we not accept what everybody, the people involved in marriage breakdown and the people who deal with them on a daily basis, accepts, the concept of irretrievable breakdown?  Until we bring in a more inquisitorial, more humane way of dealing particularly with emotional problems like this, we should at least use this concept.  It is not an alien concept or a concept tinged with some dreadful threat of divorce.  It is a humane, decent, acceptable, legal way of dealing with marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>In regard to the welfare of children being paramount, I know of no couple who have gone through marriage breakdown whose first thoughts and whose first anxieties have not been about what happens to the children and how they can protect the children from their particular trauma.  It is not fair or right for us to allege that parents going through marriage breakdown would in some way disregard the feelings and emotions of their children so as to abuse them.  I believe, it is written into the Bill, and other Members who are practising lawyers have said, that we have a good case law that shows that children are and can be protected and we do not have to write it in.  It is not alone redundant but actually insulting that, once again, legislators actually have no confidence in parents, in the courts and in the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>If we do not accept the concept of irretrievable breakdown as a humane, caring and supportive way to help people to cope with judicial separation on marriage breakdown we are not reflecting what people feel and think and have recommended to us.  That is what we have to do.  We always rely on interest groups with experience to tell us how legislation will, in a practical sense, affect them.  We have been told that, as have the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  We must reflect on that.  In <Col N="1367" /> addition, we must trust our other institutions of State.  We should be listening and learning from people outside this House who know the realities of what we are legislating to cover.  These institutions should not only be listened to but should be given due regard as the people who will have to interpret and implement the legislation.  I would not like to think that we, the legislators, would claim to have all wisdom.  I would be horrified, if not a little terrified, if I thought that was the claim we were making.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that there is tremendous doubt as to whether we would be able to trust the judges, if irretrievable breakdown became one of the concepts under which a judicial separation could be sought in court.  Judges are trained to interpret the law, to set precedents, and have proved extraordinarily capable.  There may have been times when we have not agreed with their judgments, but that does not take from the trust and confidence we have in judges or from our respect for them and their independence and their ability to interpret the laws which pass through these two Houses.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not see how it would be at all difficult for the courts and judges to deal with couples who come before them who do not wish to go ahead on the basis that one partner has been totally to blame for the breakdown of the marriage and who use that as a means to come to some financial and economic arrangement. Is it not much more civilised and much more honest, in a partnership as close and as interdependent as marriage, to be able to admit and say that the fault did not lie on one side only and that the relationship failed through actions on both sides?  If one spouse wishes to go in and allege and prove adultery, that is allowed for under the Bill but a couple to whom adultery, desertion, violence or battery do not apply should not have to choose one of those grounds for seeking judicial separation.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Abbott who asked if we could give an example of one situation out there in the world to explain <Col N="1368" /> why we feel like this.  Deputy O'Donoghue said that the Minister's amendments allowed as much flexibility to couples as they needed.  He pointed out that a couple living apart could, with consent, seek a judicial separation after one year and, without consent, after three years but there are many couples, mostly for economic reasons, particularly in the case of the wife, who have not got the means to move out of the house and who, if they had to wait for three years, would be left in a situation where they and their children would be sharing the same house in conflict and with tension. There may be no overt violence and no adultery, but there could be a war of attrition going on.  There may be a climate of tension and we know from researchers and psychologists that that is more damaging to children than if there was a separation and the children were living in a stable relationship with one parent.  I accept that all Members are concerned about the rights of the children and the need to protect them and for those reasons we must consider this issue carefully.</P>
    <P>This is not being done in a vacuum and it is not being done without us having a lot of evidence of what is involved.  We have all learned a lot from participation on the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, from the sad cases we have to deal with daily and from the reports of court proceedings.  All couples who seek a judicial separation recognise that there has been an irretrievable breakdown of their marriage and we should allow them to separate with dignity and show a care for the children.  There is a greater chance of couples settling the issue out of court without blacking one another's character and having a civilised and caring relationship in regard to their children if they do not have to go through a severe adversarial system.  Surely that is what this is all about?  Finally, applicants do not go before the courts for a judicial separation or judges waste their time considering such cases, if they are all not satisfied that the marriage has broken down.  Judges do not examine such cases to ascertain if they are happy marriages.  Sadly, the <Col N="1369" /> issue has gone beyond that when such applications are made to the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my amendment I should like to state that I am amazed at the hope expressed by Members that I would not rerun my amendments on Report Stage.  Those who say that ignore certain facts and, in this case, ignore the procedures of the House.  Standing Orders are framed so as to permit amendments which have been rejected in special committee to be brought again before the full House on Report Stage.  For obvious reasons that is not of course the case in relation to amendments which have been rejected by a committee of the full Dáil.  The main amendments I am proposing are the same as those which I proposed in the special committee and warrant in my view the consideration of the full Dáil at this stage. They are aimed not at a diminution of the Bill but its improvement bearing in mind those estranged spouses who will avail themselves of its provisions and the judges and lawyers who will have to operate those provisions.</P>
      <P>We have a duty and a responsibility as legislators, no more and no less, to see that any laws which are passed in this House are the best possible that we can provide.  I consider what I have said has to be said in defence of the procedures of the House and the status of my amendments under those procedures at present. There is no need for me to go over the ground again.  It is sufficient for me to say that the use of irretrievable breakdown in the context of judicial separation is plainly wrong.  It has been seen to be so in other jurisdictions.  Deputy Shatter's party, when in Government, also rejected the use of the concept in separation proceedings and no amount of verbiage is going to cloud the fact that it is only appropriate in the context of divorce when a marriage is brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, to say that irretrievable breakdown should be the one overall ground for judicial separation when there are certain facts in relation to actual grounds for a decree which are required <Col N="1370" /> to be proved is, in my view, nothing more than to engage in pretence.  The so-called family circumstances ground for a decree is clearly objectionable.  Again, that was the view of the previous Government and it can justifiably be asked why bother with the other five grounds when this ground is in the Bill.  My amendment will provide for the case where all the usual interaction of matrimonial co-habitation has come to and end, that is where spouses while still living under the one roof are in fact living separate lives.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position of children, I make no apology for the fact that on this side of the House we are seeking to have their welfare afforded the highest priority in separation proceedings.  That is why I am proposing that the court examine the position of the children, whether the spouses wish it or not.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with some specific points made during the debate on my amendment.  Deputy Shatter made great play about my references to a recent discussion paper from the Scottish Law Commission on their divorce law which is similar to that in England and Northern Ireland.  I only mentioned the discussion paper because in regard to the grounds for a decree of judicial separation Deputy Shatter's Bill is a copy of English divorce legislation.  The point made by the Scottish Law Commission is of direct relevance to Deputy Shatter's proposals in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Deputy Shatter is proposing irretrievable breakdown as an overall ground for judicial separation and the Scottish Law Reform Commission were commenting on that concept in the case of divorce where it is in fact more appropriate.  They said that irretrievable breakdown as a ground was a pretence, that in reality there were in the Scottish case five grounds.  I am trying to remove the self-same pretence from the Bill and that is a matter Deputy Taylor alluded to in the special committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter said that in my opening speech on my amendment No. 1 I said that I was following the Law Reform Commission.  I did not say that.  What I did say was that my proposals were in <Col N="1371" /> certain respects closer to those of the Oireachtas joint committee and those of the Law Reform Commission.  Neither the Law Reform Commission nor the Oireachtas joint committee recommended that in addition to proving any one of a number of facts there would also be a need to prove irretrievable breakdown. In that respect my proposals are closer to those of the Oireachtas Joint Committee and of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter said that a decree would be granted on the one ground that the marriage had broken down, not mentioning the fact or facts on which it was granted.  This it seems is the kernel of his argument in favour of having irretrievable breakdown as the one overall ground but he has no evidence at all to back his claim that the court will not mention the fact or facts on which it grants a decree.  It does not happen in the UK which has a similar provision to that being proposed by Deputy Shatter in its divorce legislation and neither does it happen here at present when a court is granting a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Colley is of the view that if section 3 (1) (f) is taken out of the Bill spouses may be denied the chance to seek a decree of judicial separation.  That is a misleading statement to make.  The fact is that under my amendments, as I have said on a number of occasions, section 3 (1) (f) will be comprehensive to the extent that it would cover spouses who are already living separate lives under the one roof and wish to seek a judicial separation.  The irony is that according to the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, this was what was purported to be covered by section 3 (1) (f) from which I quote:</P>
    <P>... there are many couples whose marriages have completely broken down who are still residing under the one roof although leading separate lives. </P>
    <P>However, as I have said again and again <Col N="1372" /> section 3 (1) (f) goes much too far and makes all the other grounds in the Bill redundant.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan spoke in favour of section 3 (1) (f) and felt it was wrong to condemn it because it was so wide. Again, I should like to say to the Deputy that it is not only this Government which has opposed section 3 (1) (f) but the previous Government also opposed it for the very same reason because it was so vague.  Section 3 (1) (f), as I have repeatedly said, makes the remaining grounds in the Bill redundant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan asked whether I thought sections 2 and 3 were too narrow or too broad.  I can answer that question quite simply.  I am in favour of a decree of judicial separation being granted on proof of any one of the grounds at section 3 (1) (a) to (e) of the Bill.  I reject section 3 (1) (f) for the same reason which Deputy Flanagan's own party rejected it when they were in Government, because it was unduly vague; in other words, it was too broad.  However, I am trying to replace it with a more appropriate provision which I have already explained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes spoke about irretrievable breakdown taking some of the adversarial context out of judicial separation proceedings.  That argument is unsustainable when a number of facts, all of which accept the fact that separation involves questions of fault, must be proved.  It is only the ground of separation, whether by consent or otherwise, that will create a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; situation.  I am providing for the inclusion of that ground in my amendment.  Incidentally, Deputy Barnes who was in favour of irretrievable breakdown as a ground for judicial separation omitted to mention that her own party, when in Government, opposed irretrievable breakdown as an overall ground for judicial separation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is also on the record as saying that &ldquo;if the Minister is successful in persuading the Dáil to <Col N="1373" /> change the Bill's provisions for the granting of separation decrees, estranged spouses still living under the one roof who recognise that this marriage has totally collapsed but who cannot agree on a basis for separating, will be deprived of the possibility of obtaining a judicial separation where neither can prove the other guilty of a matrimonial offence such as cruelty or adultery&rdquo;.  All I want to say in a straightforward way is that this statement totally misrepresents my amendment and I am sure Deputy Shatter understands that that is a total misrepresentation of my amendment.  He must know full well that my amendment provides for the precise case he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of subsection (3) (a) of my amendment, spouses would not be regarded as living with each other in the same household where there is no sharing of lives between them or, to use Deputy Shatter's words, where they are estranged and the marriage has totally collapsed even though they are living under the one roof.  In other words, there is a factual separation and the spouses, under my amendment, will be able to apply to a court for a judicial separation <Col N="1374" /> on the ground of separation even though they are living under the one roof.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, for obvious reasons, has chosen to ignore the provision in my amendment.  He said that I had failed to mention the position of the spouses in question.  This is a total distortion.  I have made it plain on every occasion on which I have addressed this matter that I believe that spouses in the position described by the Deputy should be catered for by this legislation.  My amendment caters for the precise case where the marriage relationship has broken down totally but the spouses are still under one roof.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and other Deputies also referred to the position of children. He said that the Bill ensures that the welfare of the child will remain the first and paramount consideration.  However, that will only be the case under the Bill if one of the spouses chooses to raise the position of the children.  I want to ensure that the position of the children will be the first and paramount consideration, whether the parents wish it or not.  My amendment is designed to ensure just that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 8 to 21. </P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete section 7 of the Bill without replacement.  Subsection (1) proposes, for the first time, a bar on applications for a decree of judicial separation within one year of marriage.  At present there is no such law as respects applications under the existing grounds of adultery, crueltry and unnatural practices.  A similar bar applies to divorce proceedings in England but not, significantly, in the case of separation proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bar now being provided for is inappropriate. It has been defended on the basis that it will prevent spouses from rushing into court for a separation decree.  In effect the argument is that where a spouse has committed adultery or his or her behaviour has been unreasonable, which concept also includes cruelty and so on, the other <Col N="1378" /> spouse should wait until one year of marriage is completed before applying to the court for a separation decree.  The one year bar provided for in subsection (1) is meaningless in the context of the other grounds of desertion or separation because a period of desertion or separation of at least one year is already prescribed in those cases.  I do not see how in the circumstances where adultery has occurred or where there has been cruelty one can justify a one year bar on applying for a judicial separation.</P>
    <P>I am also opposed to the change in view of the side effects of the provision, particularly those arising out of subsection (2) of section 7.  Subsection (2) provides that in exceptional circumstances the spouses could apply for a separation within one year of marriage. This provision is also based on divorce legislation in England but it proved to be so unsatisfactory that it was dropped in 1984.  The experience of that provision was that applicants were inevitably advised by their lawyers to set out in detail all the facts, however unpleasant, which could possibly constitute marriage difficulties of a serious and exceptional nature.  This caused bitterness, distress and humiliation.  Some spouses were led to exaggerate allegations with the result that any hope of the parties reaching a settlement was jeopardised.</P>
    <P>In the light of this what is the point in retaining this section of the Bill?  In any event there are already adequate safeguards in the Bill by which the parties can avail of counselling or mediation if they wish.  The provision is not only unnecessary but would inevitably increase the adversarial element of separation proceedings, something that the Bill purports to seek to avoid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great curiosity about what the Minister is now attempting to do in the context of what was said in regard to amendment No. 1 which has been accepted by the House.  When criticising the grounds for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> or judicial separation as we will now call it, the Minister said with reference to the concept outlined in <Col N="1379" /> section 3 (1) (f) that it was too vague while other Members said it was too broad and the suggestion was that it was liberalising the law in a way that would allow anyone and everyone obtain decrees of separation regardless of marital circumstances.  We of course said that that would not be the case, that what we are concerned about is allowing couples whose marriages run into difficulties to obtain decrees of separation without having to make allegations about matrimonial misbehaviour and with allowing the courts to investigate the relationship to ascertain whether the marriage is still viable or whether it has broken down. This Bill was designed not merely to provide mechanisms to facilitate couples obtain judicial separations when marriages break down but also provisions to facilitate reconciliation where possible.</P>
      <P>It would be generally accepted outside of this House that if a young couple marry and if within the first few weeks of marriage the marriage runs into difficulties, generally speaking they should seek other assistance to resolve their difficulties through counselling or other help without, within weeks or months of marriage, rushing into court to look for a decree of separation.  Section 7 of the Bill which the Minister is now proposing to delete is designed to encourage couples to avail of counselling services and any other help they may require if during the early weeks or months of their marriage they run into marital difficulties.  I find it extremely surprising that the Minister should be opposed to such a provision which is designed to ensure that the advice given to someone whose marriage has within the early weeks, run into difficulties and who goes to see a lawyer to get legal advice, is that during the first year of their marriage they cannot go to court to obtain a decree of separation.  It is, however, designed to ensure that where there are exceptional reasons, for example, where there has been serious violence in the relationship, that court proceedings, if necessary, can be brought during that 12 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is specific provision which allows <Col N="1380" /> a court application to be made where there have been marital difficulties of a serious and exceptional nature.  I find it very difficult to understand why the Minister should want to delete this provision from the Bill.  It is designed to encourage couples to get help other than legal or court help when their marriage runs into difficulties during the early days of the marriage.  In effect what the Minister is saying is that if there is a single incident in the first few weeks or months of marriage that incident should be able to form the basis for a young wife or husband to rush into our courts.  Rather than the Minister opposing the provisions in section 7, I would have expected that he would have welcomed the provisions.  I would have expected if that section was not in this Bill that we would have heard from the other side of the House that this Bill was encouraging people, in the first few weeks of marriage, to go to court if they ran into marital difficulties.  It is a sort of Catch 22 situation because as we have gone through the Bill we have discovered that the Minister will pick holes in particular aspects of the Bill but the holes he picks are not necessarily either logically or philosophically consistent with holes he may pick in it later on.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if section 7 was not in the Bill the Minister would be criticising the Bill on the basis that it allowed people in the first few weeks of marriage to bring their relationship to an end by getting separation decrees. However, because it is there the Minister wants to have it taken out.  I ask him to reconsider the approach he has adopted to this section.  If he is serious in believing that when marriage difficulties occur that couples should be given some space and time to consider what action they should take as regards the difficulties they are experiencing, it would seem to me that this section is designed to give the necessary time and breathing space to a young couple who experience difficulties during the first few months of marriage.  This section, of course, knits in with the other provisions in the Bill which are designed to ensure that lawyers give advice to husbands or wives who seek legal help to <Col N="1381" /> encourage them to seek counselling in the early stages of a marriage running into difficulties.</P>
    <P>This section forms part of an overall pattern in the Bill.  It is part of the provisions in the Bill which are designed to encourage and facilitate reconciliation as opposed to being part of the structure of the Bill which provides for the granting of separation decrees when relationships have ceased entirely to be viable and a marriage has completely broken down. As I said, it is a matter of some astonishment that the Minister should seek to have this provision taken out of the Bill. I am sorry that yet again, in dealing with an aspect of this legislation, the Minister should refer to this in a disparaging way on the basis that <i>ipso facto</i> it is something found in divorce legislation in other countries and should not be included in a Bill relating to judicial separation.  I say in response to the Minister that this is something which is found in marital legislation in most other countries so as to ensure that in the early weeks of a marriage a couple who have marital difficulties do not resort to litigation.  The fact that other countries have it in divorce legislation rather than in separation legislation is purely part of the accident that most other countries deal with marital breakdown in the context of divorce legislation whereas in this country and within this jurisdiction we deal with marital breakdown in the context of judicial separation legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a great deal more to be said about this provision.  I would simply urge on the Minister that he would reconsider the approach he is taking and that, in the interests of ensuring that couples do not needlessly head into courts to seek separation decrees within the first few weeks of a marriage when difficulties occur, he would consider withdrawing his proposal to have this section removed from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate what I said about this section on Committee Stage.  It is a most valuable section and I think this would be recognised by those who work in the area of marital law and <Col N="1382" /> also by those who work as counsellors and mediators.  When there is a marriage breakdown, I think it would be recognised that it is unrealistic of couples who encounter difficulties in the first few weeks or months of their marriage to assume that that is the pattern which is going to be followed continuously in their marriage and that there is no point in continuing the marriage.  This is an admirable section in that it sets out to protect marriages.  Surely the basis of our efforts here is to protect those marriages which can be protected and to allow those people who cannot continue with their marriages, or who find it very difficult to do so, some dignity and some room to manoeuvre legally.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any doubt in the minds of people who deal with people who are newly married that the first year of marriage is a very difficult period. There is absolutely no doubt about that and the statistics of marriages which break down show that uncontrovertibly. A much higher percentage of marriages break down in the first year of marriage than is the case with marriages which last longer.  It is not that couples break up in the first year.  They encounter troubles in the first year and if there is no encouragement of these couples to look for help or to go for counselling or other kinds of help then it seems that we are inviting couples to obtain separations, which I have no doubt many of them would regret obtaining some time later.  Many of these couples could perhaps be young &mdash; another area which we have not dealt with but which badly needs to be dealt with is the age of marriage &mdash; and given that a fair proportion of people get married quite young, and certainly in their early twenties, that is a totally new experience for them and they will only have allowed themselves a few months together, I think it is reasonable to expect that they cannot rush headlong into separation. We should not make it easy for them to do so while at the same time encourage them to obtain counselling or to get other professional help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 does not totally deny the right of couples who are having difficulties to <Col N="1383" /> apply for a separation.  I believe that is right.  However, some exceptions to the rules are left in the section so that it is not a total bar.  I know that the argument was made on Committee Stage that what this section may do is to impose further costs on the couples who really want to seek a separation order.  While that may be the case, there is a price to be paid for effectively protecting a marriage in the first year of its life.  It is recognised &mdash; and I am repeating this because I think it is worth repeating &mdash; that it is a very difficult time for couples; it is a time of adjustment and a time when they need help to stay together rather then help to move apart.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by the Minister both here and on Committee Stage that what this section will do is to condemn couples who, for instance, are experiencing the kind of difficulties which follow from adultery and other problems to stay together no matter what.  I want to say to the Minister that in real life there is an episode of adultery or something akin to that in many marriages. Problems arise which are extremely serious for many people and they do not continue with their marriage.  However, many people continue with their marriage.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister saying they must be allowed to rush into an application for separation before they have had time to consider the matter?  It is reasonable to suppose that any couple who begin to experience difficulties within weeks or months of their marriage will take the best part of a year before coming to the point of decision about what route they wish to follow, whether it be separation or some other route.  It is a reasonable period during which the couples can reflect.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the arguments put forward from the vantage point of protecting marriages and to allow that period, which is not excessive.  by the time many couples come to the point of realisation about the seriousness of their difficulties, it will be the best part of a year, anyway.  The inherent judgment <Col N="1384" /> behind this section is that it is far better for conciliation, or mediation, or counselling to take place rather than that the machinery of the system of justice roll into action and be almost unstoppable once it has begun.  We owe it to people who are inexperienced in marriage to allow them that period of reflection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate briefly the points I made on this Government amendment on Committee Stage.  It is puzzling to see this amendment presented.  If I had any fault with the section I might have thought that perhaps one year was too short a period and that one might have considered a slightly longer period.  I do not understand the thrust of what the Minister is trying to achieve here.  Presumably there should be some purpose to the amendment.  I am trying to figure out what it could possibly be.</P>
      <P>First, we have to see what this section does not say.  It does not say that people who have been married for less than one year may not separate; they can separate if they want to.  It does not even say that people who have been married for less than one year may not enter into a separation agreement; they can do that too, if they so wish.  All it says is that within the period of a year they may not take the very serious step of issuing a writ, of going to law.  That is a very different matter.  When you bring the continuation of the marriage into the legal ambit, you are putting the whole question of that marriage on a different level altogether from the wife going back to her mother for a short while because of difficulties, or a period of incompatibility, or whatever. At this stage you are going to a solicitor, getting counsel, all at great expense, assuming that you can afford that &mdash; and I shall be talking about that later.  You are setting in train a much longer lasting, more permanent procedure involving perhaps division of property, succession rights, all sorts of things.  That is major activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the section says is that they may not do that within one year of the marriage. What possible harm can it do to say that <Col N="1385" /> you may not go to law about the marriage until one year from the date the marriage has expired?  Where can the damage be in saying that?  I can see some good coming out of it, although perhaps not a great deal because I do not think this would arise in very many cases within a year, anyway.  When people get married young, are immature and may not have settled within a period of a year, the fact that they cannot have the finality of legal proceedings to separate them is a cautionary factor that would induce them to try harder to make a go of their marriage.</P>
    <P>As a solicitor practising law, I visualise that a spouse could come to me saying that she was married three months ago and wanted me to issue a writ on her behalf for judicial separation because the marriage had broken down.  I would not wish to take instructions in such a case.  I would like to be able to tell that person that the law does not allow her to do that, that it is far too soon to think of issuing a writ to have a permanent order made to separate her from her spouse, to sell off the family home, pay off the mortgage, divide the proceeds and set in train a whole permanent set of matters.  I would like to be able to tell that spouse to go to the mediators who perhaps could resolve the difficulties.  That would take some months and in the meantime her whole attitude might change completely and she might see things in a completely different light.  At least nothing irrevocable would have been done in the meantime, no steps would have been taken in the way of property and all the ancillary orders that could arise within that period.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what is the problem. This seems to be an eminently sensible provision that certainly cannot do any harm and might just do some some good.  Why not leave it there so that people would know that there is that small degree of discipline &mdash; and it is only a small degree &mdash; that when they enter their marriage they know that at least for one year the question of going to court about the marriage to get permanent orders made will not arise.  That discipline might just save some marriages, and if it <Col N="1386" /> saved even one it would be well worth while having it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There was certain merit in what Deputy Shatter proposes here but with the elimination of section 3 (1) (f) the need for this section has gone.  The grounds on which one many now seek a judicial separation are very serious grounds.  I would be concerned that perhaps a wife would have to sustain beating or mistreatment and would not have the right, if this provision stays, to apply for a decree of judicial separation. She should have that right and the Legislature should ensure, in so far as it can, that she does have that right.  It has been the experience in other jurisdictions where similar provisions to subsection (2) of this section apply that the parties to the marriage get involved in recrimination. What happens is that one or both of the parties start making accusations against the other and this causes bitterness, distress and humiliation.  I do not believe that this provision in any way assists the situation and in so far as this House can stop name-calling, accusations or bitterness during the course of the proceedings I believe the House should ensure that it does so.</P>
      <P>Experience has shown that where one party has to prove that the difficulties are of such a serious and exceptional nature that it would warrant a decree, the hearing of the decree has been all the more bitter and recriminatory.  I believe that including this provision would merely exacerbate and heighten tensions within the entire procedure.  Accordingly, I support the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this section on Committee Stage and again I will speak very briefly on it.  I can appreciate what Deputy Shatter intended when he put this provision into the Bill, however, I feel it could lead to circumstances where couples who are in difficulties after a month or two would have a very hard decision to make whether their case came under subsection (2) &mdash; serious and exceptional circumstances &mdash; and would have to seek advice from their solicitor <Col N="1387" /> in this regard.  The solicitor might say that in his opinion the circumstances were not serious and exceptional, while they might feel they were.  They would then have to decide whether to proceed and possibly they might be refused an application under subsection (2), which would then lead them back to square one. Rather than trammelling the procedure by this section, it is probably better to leave it out altogether.  For that reason I agree with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is an exact repetition of what was proposed on Committee Stage.  It baffles me now as it did then.  It is some months, 1 June 1988, since we had the opportunity to debate the legislation in the special committee, and anything that was said then or since baffles me as to where Fianna Fáil are going in this legislation.  All kinds of conspiracies and motives come to mind &mdash; many of which I hope are not true and will not come to pass when this Bill leaves the House &mdash; as to where the legislation is going.</P>
      <P>The grounds on which the Minister and his supporters seek to challenge this section are, as I understand it, threefold: First, they oppose it on the basis that it attempts to restrict the operation of the scheme intended and included in the Bill; second, it is suggested that the delay of one year is a concept more appropriate to legislation dealing with divorce; and finally there is the omnibus reservations that the section is unnecessary in the operation of the law.  In trying to deal with each of these points, it is important to understand why the section is in the Bill and what it hopes to achieve.  We have moved an amendment to sections 5 and 6 on Report Stage and therefore it is necessary to refer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is seeking to extend and expand upon the very narrow grounds upon which parties to an otherwise valid and subsisting marriage are entitled to go to court to seek a judicial separation. Prior to this it was grounded on cruelty and desertion.  By reason of accepting the Minister's first amendment, we have <Col N="1388" /> laid down a series of further grounds.  We are seeking to make judicial separation more easily obtainable and to liberalise the law.  In order to ensure public support and acceptance of the legislation, a unique scheme was built into it which is encompassed in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill.  I previously described this as revoluntionary in the development of law in any sphere because it places on the shoulders of practising lawyers positive duties to their respective clients &mdash; to the applicant and, by virtue of an amendment agreed on Committee at the behest of the Labour Party, to the respondent.  At the point of or prior to the initiation of proceedings, the parties to the proceedings are made fully aware of the prospects of reconciliation, the importance of the position of marriage and the contract between the parties.  They are also made aware of the non-desirability, in the interests of the common good, that marriages be lightly done down and that there are solemn dimensions to the contract. They are also made aware of the reconciliation and other facilities provided by the community either directly or indirectly through the courts to try to make good the differences that have brought the parties to that stage.</P>
    <P>The legislation has on the one hand the objective to liberalise the law on the grounds that people who believe their marriages have broken down can seek help from the courts, and on the other, ensuring that it is in only the most extreme instances where all other avenues and alternatives have been exposed that a court can ultimately make an order.  If one approaches the legislation from that perspective, one then comes to understand fully why section 7 is there.  The section recognises what I would have thought to be a readily acceptable fact, that the first year of marriage can prove to be the most traumatic. This is a time when the greatest number of questions, many of them completely unanticipated, will have to be dealt with by the couple and they might simply not have adequate experience.  They could well avail themselves or be forced to avail themselves of a breathing space and to <Col N="1389" /> have a second, third or if necessary a fourth look at their problems which would give them an opportunity to give the marriage a chance.  Section 7 is there for that reason.  The section is conservative in its intent and is a counterbalance to the liberalisation in the earlier sections.  It certainly stands very well in the scheme of liberalisation with the revolutionary inclusion of the necessity to have recourse to reconciliation advice from lawyers and this breathing space under section 7.  That is why it is there. It is based on what I would have understood to have been a readily acceptable fact, namely, that the first year of marriage can often be the most traumatic for people with the least amount of experience and capacity to deal with such trauma.  We are providing that rather than allow such people to have immediate recourse to the procedures, they should cope with their marriage by whatever means for at least 12 months.  If at the end of that period they are still committed to the view that things are not working out, they can go to their lawyers and after advice on reconciliation they can go to the courts.</P>
    <P>In the face of this conservative reasonableness, the Minister suggests that the provision is too restrictive.  This is remarkable when one has regard to the fact that under our law people can marry at such an early age.  They can be forced to marry by social, parental or church pressures in the most unsatisfactory and undersirable circumstances.  The proverbial &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; marriage is still prevalent. People are allowed to marry from the age of 16.  It is remarkable that we should not seek to legislate for people of such immaturity who may have been forced to marry for immature or illogical reasons.  If we allow them or force them to marry, let us have regard for what we have done and recognise that people in such circumstances will be presented with major problems which may seem to them to be utterly insurmountable and which can only be resolved by judicial separation. We have to be inconsistent.  If we are to accommodate this kind of approach to the institution of marriage, <Col N="1390" /> we must be in a position to legislate that people who are allowed to enter marriage in such unreasonable circumstances are required to remain committed to it and address it as an institution, once embarked upon.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this section is more appropriate to divorce law.  This was a point made by the Minister of State on Committee Stage.  Our legislation has nothing to do with divorce.  We have ensured by referendum that divorce cannot, unfortunately, be introduced into our law.  Consequently, we are legislating for the huge gap that exists in family law as a result.  It is very unfair of the Government side, in commenting on this section and trying to dress up an argument as to why it should not be there, to try to taint the section and the whole Bill by constant references to divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>One of my main concerns is that Fianna Fáil do not approach the legislation in the schematic way in which it has been drafted.  The Bill is intended to adopt a balanced approach to reform.  I voiced the view on Committee Stage that Fianna Fáil were trying to do down the legislation by simply throwing divorce muck and mud at it in the hope that it would stick and that the hounds of the right and &ldquo;SPUCers&rdquo; in the community would be howling in the letters pages, on the doorsteps of representatives' clinics and in the galleries and hallways of this House.  It did not seem to work.  I now see a possible alternative scenario.  In their haphazard approach, Fianna Fáil are seeking to introduce an unsavoury element so that it will be an easier Bill to knock in its entirety when it leaves the Floor of this Chamber and moves to the Upper House or wherever.  One wonders if the promoters of the Bill will ever succeed in getting the legislation to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>If this provision is taken out the Bill will become less balanced.  I believe it is a very sensible and useful provision.  The Fianna Fáil group were worried about the omnibus section 3 (1) (f) on the basis that it was too wide but they are now attacking this section on the basis that it is too restrictive.  On the one hand they want to <Col N="1391" /> tidy up and confine in precise terms the grounds on which a judicial separation can be obtained and they have succeeded in doing that in the vote they have just won.  Here we have a provision which is acknowledged to be restrictive but which maintains a balance in the legislation. Fianna Fáil say it is too restrictive and should be taken out, that people who see difficulties in their marriage should be allowed within days to present themselves to lawyers and the courts declaring that they want to tear up their solemn contract and go their separate ways.  The notion of marriage one day and separation the next smacks of the British gutter press.  It is the type of scenario no reasonable person concerned with the preservation of marriage would be anxious to see.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, given the remarks and approach of the Fianna Fáil group on the earlier section and the direction in which they were going, that they should now be turning around and suggesting that the legislation as proposed is too restrictive and should be made more easily available within days or weeks.  I believe they are trying to do as much damage and harm to this Bill as they can and to set it up so that it will be more easily knocked.  By taking out the subsection which required, in addition to the proof of the specific grounds that a court had to be satisfied that the situation was nonetheless still irretrievable, there is no doubt that yet again a safeguard which had been built into the legislation was being taken out without explanation thus setting up this legislation to be knocked by its inevitable detractors who are waiting on the sidelines to chew this to pieces once they get the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Another point made in earlier contributions by the Fianna Fáil group dealt with the inconsistency on our side, as perceived by them, of the suggestion that we had argued that people do not lightly apply for judicial separation and that therefore one should not be worried to introduce a restriction or a time limit. If anybody talks about an inconsistent approach to this legislation, I must lay <Col N="1392" /> that charge squarely at the feet of the Fianna Fáil group.</P>
    <P>I have illustrated as best I can that the thrust in the Bill is of a scheme which is unique in many respects, which has never been seen in family law, which has never even contemplated the counselling by lawyers before proceedings are issued, of reconciliation, of attempting to retrieve the difficulties in a marriage and so on. That is the consistent and balanced approach into which section 7 readily and comfortably fits.  The Government side, having won the previous vote and got rid of section 3 (1) (f), have restricted the operation of the Bill to the very serious grounds where they feel the can take out this section.  This is completely inconsistent. They have no idea why we have this legislation, where it is going or what it is attempting to achieve.  Admittedly, the Government won the last vote but that cannot impact on the purpose of section 7.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this section fits in remarkably well as a balance to the new provisions in this legislation and it is addressed particularly to the very realistic view everyone takes of marriage, that is, that the first year is the most difficult and that people should have the time to take a second or even a third look at their problems.  In those circumstances I cannot fathom what the Fianna Fáil Party are doing, but I believe what they are doing is far more sinister than any of them would acknowledge.  This will emerge when this legislation is debated elsewhere, if ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well able to look after himself, but this business of us being a sinister organisation or having a sinister point of view on this section appears to be an unworthy attack on the democratic process.  As legislators, surely we are entitled to make our views known? As I said, Fianna Fáil speakers can defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to do, and this must be recognised even by The Workers' Party who are so aligned to Deputy Shatter's Bill &mdash; it amazes and astonishes me that their philosophies should merge on <Col N="1393" /> this occasion &mdash; is to purify this legislation and perfect it.  As I see it, the section is a piece of legislative sunburstery &mdash; the legal principle on the one hand and on the other.  This is what makes money for lawyers.  At present we are in the process of ensuring that lawyers should not make money that, the law is not seen as some sort of ogre, and that people in the hands of lawyers do not feel they are at the end of their time on this earth.  Based on the plaintiff and the defendant principle, section 7 (1) says that no application for judicial separation shall be presented to a court for 12 months while section 7 (2) says you can, in exceptional circumstances, and section 7 (3) wraps the whole thing in legal absurdity.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister.  This must have given the draftsman nightmares trying to justify it while conforming to fairmindedness and the position Deputy Shatter took.  I hope I am not doing the draftsman an injustice, but this legislation must have given him sleepless nights.  I can imagine him throwing his hands up in the air and saying the only thing we can do is to delete this section. That is what we are doing.  To impugn hostility, evil and unfairness to this side of the House is grotesque, and that is what Deputy McCartan is doing on behalf of his party.</P>
    <P>I could not be here for the other contributions because I had to deal with problems outside the Chamber but I think they were fair.  I wish the tenor and general standard of the debate had been maintained at the level attained in the committee.  From the contributions made from the Opposition side, it appears that Fianna Fáil are the bad boys and girls, that we are the people who are doing down citizens who are suffering traumas as a result ot marital breakdowns, and at the end of this debate Fianna Fáil will probably be charged as having caused the breakdown.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the Minister for the Environment in particular in view of the pending building society legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not being facetious when I ask the Minister to consider withdrawing his attempt to delete this section.  I have listened to his comments and that of his party members, and failed to see how we are doing anything other than protecting the institution of marriage.  I do not intend to go back over old ground with regard to referenda but the people spoke on those occasions and &mdash; rightly or wrongly &mdash; presented the view that they are interested in the protection of marriage. Section 7 (1) and (2) deal with the protection of marriage and the prevention of material breakdown.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the debate and on Committee Stage it was said that the first year of marriage is an extended honeymoon where everything in the garden is rosy.  I take issue with that in view of the fact that several reports came to the conclusion that the first year of marriage is the most traumatic for a newly married couple.  That is not difficult to understand in so far as newly married couples have financial difficulties, they may be settling into a new home and sadly, all too often, they may be moving in with parents or in-laws while awaiting local authority housing or saving enough money to allow them to purchase a house privately. These are the problems which married couples face and it is very important to protect them.  The one protection we can give them is to prevent them from rushing into legal proceedings and this is what we are doing in section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to be convinced by the Minister's opening address on the amendment.  He said he was not in favour of the section because it was more relevant to divorce legislation.  It is not the first time that this red herring has been introduced to the debate on all Stages from that side of the House.  How many times must we reiterate that we are not dealing with <Col N="1395" /> divorce legislation?  We are dealing with judicial separation and family law reform.  The suggestion that the section is more relevant to divorce legislation is not worthy of support.  The section provides badly needed protection for the newly married couple instead of issuing a High Court civil bill six or seven weeks after marriage.  This preventive clause will give them an opportunity of engaging in the process of conciliation, reconciliation, mediation, help and the kind of support to build a marriage and to protect it instead of rushing headlong into court.  I made a comment about court procedures earlier on and I will repeat it: I do not believe that legal proceedings lead to reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the section would increase the adversarial nature of court proceedings but I fail to be convinced that that is the case.  How can a preventive measure substantially increase the adversarial nature of proceedings? It would have the opposite effect because it would drive them towards the support groups, inadequate though most of them are.  By deleting section 7, we are talking about something that has been bandied about in discussing the Bill in a derogatory manner when the concept of the &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; separation was mentioned.  By passing this amendment, we are encouraging the concept of a &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; separation.</P>
    <P>We are reducing the status of marriage by not allowing a preventive measure in the Bill.  A very good case can be made for withdrawing the amendment and allowing this period of 12 months &mdash; not a very long period by any manner or means, having regard to the fact that the average citizen's greatest step in his or her life is marriage &mdash; for reflection.  It is very important that the marriage is not dissolved in the way it would be if the section did not exist.</P>
    <P>There has been a reference to the influence of section 3 (1) (f).  Having regard to the amendment already made, does the Minister feel as strongly about the amendment now?  In view of the narrowness and clearly defined concepts for <Col N="1396" /> separation following a recent amendment, is it still necessary for the Minister to proceed with this one?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue made a point on the rather emotive issues pertaining to marriage breakdown when he cited instances of what might happen when marital difficulties occur.  Did he read subsection (2) which states quite clearly that if there are exceptional circumstances &mdash; and certainly the circumstances outlined by the Deputy were such as to lead me and any reasonably minded individual to believe that those circumstances were exceptional &mdash; it is open to a judge on an <i>ex parte</i> application to deem the circumstances exceptional. He can also arrange a hearing in about six weeks and, in the meantime, he can qualify it by advising them to seek support. If this advice was forthcoming from somebody with a judicial status, it could well be considered quite seriously by the applicant and the respondent.</P>
    <P>The necessary valve is in section 7 to ensure that nobody is forced to live in an impossible situation if there is difficulty in a marriage.  However, the restriction of 12 months will not make a huge difference. If there is a problem of an exceptional nature the valve will come into operation but our overriding concern must be for the protection of the marriage. From that point of view, it is important that the section remains in the form envisaged by Deputy Shatter so that the back-up services may be availed of instead of going beyond the point of no return as far as the marriage is concerned and where we, as legislators, will be seen to encourage people to seek decrees of separation instead of discouraging them. The status of marriage must remain as fundamentally important as heretofore.</P>

      <P>There is a very wise old saying &ldquo;if you want to know me, come and live with me&rdquo;.  It has a grainy, gritty reality which did not come about by accident. It came about because people have realised for centuries that two people coming together even, as one commentator said recently, with unbridled <Col N="1397" /> optimism about marriage and the continuance of their married relationship, have to take into consideration that the adapting and the first difficulties a couple have to work through for the first months of their marriage are an absolute mine-field.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to something which, I hope, we are continuing to follow and to implement, the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. I would like to quote from page 14 of that report, paragraph 3.2.2, which states:</P>
      <P>The Committee is concerned that support for marriage, especially during the early years when marriages can be most vulnerable, is at best inadequate.</P>
      <P>On page 15, paragraph 3.4.1 it states:</P>

    <Title>Child Care Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said the last day, I welcome in particular the positive nature of the provisions of the Child Care Bill, 1988.  From now on it will be mandatory on health boards to promote the welfare of children in their areas who are not receiving adequate care and attention. This aspect of compulsory caring for children is dealt with in Part II of the Bill and it is a very broad provision.  There are tremendous possibilities of wide interpretation by the health boards and their officials and, where appropriate, by the courts.  I can envisage a great development of the quality and type of services to be provided.  For instance, it might be possible to use the provisions of the Bill to deal with such problems as glue sniffing or under-age drinking as they affect particular areas or particular children.  There <Col N="1398" /> is possible scope for development in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill imposes a duty on health boards to take children into care who may require care or protection.  These provisions constitute a very significant development and a giant step forward in our whole concept of the care of children. They give tangible expression to the aspiration expressed in the Constitution to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  They bring the law up to date both in line with theoretical thinking and also with daily practicalities.  In relation to looking after, guiding and protecting children, our thinking now is protection where it is needed but prevention and care is the goal.  In this respect the provisions obliging health boards to set up at least one child care advisory committee in their area to advise the board if they are complying with the Act will be of benefit to the health boards in providing them with informed and specialised opinions from experts in the field.  I would like to see specific provision that each such committee must have at least one child psychiatrist.  The reason for this is that while the experts who may be attached to voluntary organisations or social workers who in their own right are attached to health boards will have their own expertise and advice to offer, if we are to keep the law up to date and be conscious of developments in relation to child care and child psychiatry, then obviously the particular expert necessary to give effect to this would be a child psychiatrist.</P>
      <P>I should have said that I am also glad to see the abolition of the old distinction between children under 15 years and children over 15 years.  I do not know of anyone who, certainly in this day and age, sees the logic of the old distinction. To abolish it and provide that everybody under 18 years of age is a child was a wise move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part III of the Bill, which deals with the protection of children in emergencies, there are very necessary provisions, particularly those which enable members of the Garda to take a child out of a disastrous home environment <Col N="1399" /> without a warrant.  Many people, from time to time, even where they know that children are being abused or, at best, neglected, are unwilling to deal with the matter or even to report it, having regard to interfering with the affairs of another family.  To give power in the Bill to a member of the Garda to take a child under threat out of a home environment without warrant is a very necessary provision.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with some of the time provisions in this Part of the Bill.  For instance, I can see a lot of practical difficulties arising, particularly at weekends, with the provision whereby a child must be brought to court within 24 hours. If, as might sometimes happen, a father came home drunk on a Friday night and abused a child, the earliest court hearing would probably be Monday or Tuesday of the following week.  I can see practical difficulties arising with that time limit. Likewise, in relation to the eight days or less in which a child can be kept in a place of safety; that time, in certain circumstances, may not be long enough.  For instance, if a health board has to make an investigation or an inquiry or has to engage the expertise of professional people, eight days may not be enough time in which to do so.  I know that the thinking behind this provision is that it would be unwise to take a child out of a home environment for longer than eight days and I can sympathise with the concern of the Minister in that respect.  Perhaps an additional phrase or subsection could be added to that part of the Bill to enable the health board, if they had not completed their inquiries or if the professional advice was not readily to hand, to apply to the court for an extension beyond the eight days.</P>
    <P>I support those who say that no court hearing should take place at any stage without having a representative or a social worker from the health board present.  In that respect I am concerned about the wording of section 11 (4) (c) which states that an application for any such order may be made, heard and <Col N="1400" /> determined <i>ex parte.</i> While that paragraph may be desirable, specific provision should be made for a representative to be present and heard in court.  I am also concerned with the provision whereby a child can be taken to a place of safety, bearing in mind that the definition section of the Bill includes in its definition of a place of safety a Garda station.  I can envisage no circumstances in which it would be desirable to have a child in a Garda station for up to eight days.  It might be desirable, in relation to that section, to specifically exclude a Garda station as being a place of safety.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some of the comments which have been made in relation to district courts and district justices.  It seems that people have been saying that district courts are courts of rough justice.  That is a very unfair attitude to adopt.  I am glad to see that the Bill gives expression to the general desire to have speedy access to courts and provides that the applications be made to the District Court because I see the District Court as a court of relatively cheap, certainly local, justice.</P>
    <P>One or two comments which I was not happy with have been passed about district justices.  Generally district justices have a great deal of professional expertise in the law and a great deal of practical experience.  They are ideally suited to deal with questions under this Bill.  In fact, they deal with questions of custody and access at the moment under differenct items of legislation, so I see nothing wrong in that.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with care proceedings. There will now be a duty on health boards to apply for care orders or supervision orders.  These are possibly some of the most positive and enlightened provisions in the Bill, and I welcome in particular the anticipatory nature of some of the sections whereby health boards can apply to the courts for a care order, for instance, not just if damage has been done or abuse or neglect is taking place but if the health board or their officials feel they are very likely to arise.  That is to be welcomed very much.</P>
    <P>Section 15 (2) provides that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> In the exercise of its jurisdiction under this section the court shall have regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, and the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child. </P>
    <P>In questions of custody and access there has been a development over the years in our law and the courts have interpreted the law to say that in cases where there may be a conflict it is the rights of the child which are paramount.  I feel that were this section to be interpreted over a period of time the courts would make a similar interpretation and it might be wise and might save a number of potential litigants a great deal of cost if such a statement was included at the end of that subsection.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provisions of section 15 (7) whereby if the health board takes a child into care and the parents of a child are financially in a position to support the child or make a periodical payment to the health board the court may make an order requiring them to do so.  I see no reason they should not be asked to do that if by their own conduct or neglect they have contributed directly to the health board having to take the child into custody.</P>
    <P>Section 19 (c) allows a court to discharge a care order.  I welcome in particular the provision that a care order can be discharged but, as it were, varied down to a supervision order.  I can imagine that the parents have got their act in order so to speak and a court could feel that it would be unwise or unreasonable to continue to impose a care order on the family but might still be concerned to monitor the situation and make sure that if the care order were discharged they could keep an eye on the family situation.  This provision whereby it can be varied down to a supervision order is a wise insertion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 21 I am glad to see that any proceedings under this Bill will be heard in private and, almost as important particularly in relation to children, in as informal a manner as possible.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with children <Col N="1402" /> in the care of health boards and allows them to be taken into foster care or children's residential centres, and provides that the health boards can make other suitable arrangements.  This Part of the Bill gives a very wide range of options to a health board.  A health board will now be able to ask, &ldquo;What have we available, what is the best thing to do in the interest of a child?&rdquo; and take the appropriate steps.  That is a wise provision.  I welcome section 32 which allows the health board to apply to a court for directions as to how they should behave or what they should do in a given set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part VI and the supervision of pre-school services, a necessary feature of the new law is that a system of supervision and inspection of pre-school services is to be introduced to cover pre-schools, play groups, créches, etc.  This was recommended by many interested groups and organisations, and it is wise to provide that the Minister must consult with the Minister for Education before making orders under this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say it will be necessary to provide additional financial resources if the very welcome provisions in this Bill are to be applied satisfactorily and to the limit.  Although it is acknowledged in this House on all sides and throughout the country that we live in very difficult times, I hope more resources, financial and otherwise, will be made available to enable the children of our society to be properly cared for, particularly children who may be under threat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill into the House.  It is somewhat similar to another Bill which was initiated in 1985 by the then Government.  One thing we are all aware of at present is the general increase in the number of reported incidents of child abuse whether they be physical abuse or sexual abuse.  I know a debate will always follow as to whether this arises from an increase in the number of incidents or whether it is merely an increase in the reporting of cases.  Possibly it is a combination of both; there was always a certain incidence of abuses many of which were not reported in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> Obviously now with modern communications and better services generally there is a greater likelihood of their being brought to the attention of schools, medical practitioners, public health nurses and the various other services.</P>
    <P>One thing fundamental to the operation of the Bill when and if it becomes an Act is the practical measures that are to be taken to ensure its effectiveness. Unless they are there, legislation simply does not work.  For instance, detection is a very important part of child care as is the need to protect children as set out in this Bill.  One area is the schools.  I do not accept for one moment that the teachers should spend their time assessing children to see whether they are being abused in one way or another, but there is one very simple method that has been well established but unfortunately is coming under some pressure in recent times. That is the school medical examination.</P>
    <P>We had a very good system of school medical examinations whereby it was possible for medical practitioners and nursing staff to have access on a regular basis to virtually every child in a school. Unfortunately, that is the case no longer. In countless incidences school medical examinations do not take place within a given year, and there have been incidences of children going through the primary school system scarcely having had a school medical examination at all.  If we are to be really serious about the operation of a Bill of this nature and particularly the intricacies of the law which could affect its operation in one sense and could affect the protection of the officials carrying out the law in the other sense, it is important that there be regular monitoring through the schools by way of school medical examinations.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is essential that parents' rights are recognised, and care must be taken that spurious allegations are not made.  Notwithstanding all that, the children of the people who need protection are vulnerable, so it is essential to set in train sufficient mechanisms to ensure children's rights, and this is what this Bill proposes to do.  The children's rights <Col N="1404" /> should be protected and their health and wellbeing safeguarded.  All necessary machinery should be in place to ensure that that can be done without a series of litigations whereby the law would be brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board, I doubt if the resources are available to the health boards to carry out the functions set out under the Bill.  Other Members of this House are members of health boards and must have knowledge of the type of cases envisaged under the terms of the Bill, the type of case to which public representatives sometimes have to respond urgently at weekends.  The general public, relatives or parents may need to talk to someone and invariably they end up with a public representative.  It is unfortunate that that should be the case. Within the system there should be various services.  Provision was made for their inclusion within the system but they do not seem to be available as heretofore, and obviously this is because there are a number of financial restrictions which are now impingeing to such an extent as to impair the effectiveness of quite an amount of our legislation.  This is sad, and it would be particularly sad if it were to become obvious in relation to the Bill we have before us tonight.</P>
    <P>I, and many other Members of this House, have come across cases where a neighbour, a relative or a member of the family has brought to our attention circumstances which they feel are undesirable.  In the ideal situation there would follow a period of close monitoring with an official of the health board visiting the child or the household by some innocuous means in order to assess the situation at first hand in the early stages. I would not like to see a situation whereby days, weeks or months would go by before somebody would have an opportunity to assess a particular case.  Nor am I suggesting that a deep psychological assessment be carried out instantly in each case.  I do not expect that.  When a case comes to light &mdash; and I accept that one has to be very careful lest spurious allegations are made &mdash; it is imperative that, should an emergency arise, some <Col N="1405" /> kind of contact be made with the family and an interim decision arrived at to ensure that the rights of the child are protected.  There have been a number of instances in the past where difficulties arose and allegations were made afterwards. Everybody seems to be wise after an event in regard to what should have been done.  Under the previous Acts there was not sufficient power at the disposal of the health board or the Garda to take the kind of action that can be taken today.</P>
    <P>There has been an increased incidence of reports of such cases.  There are a number of areas which could result in children being under threat.  Financial deprivation is one, bringing pressure to bear on a family which may result in the children being neglected.  Marital breakdown could result from financial deprivation, leading to serious abuse of a child or children.  In a case where parents are taken from them, a number of junior members of a large family could be left to fend for themselves in vulnerable circumstances. There again it is necessary to rely on the health board.  If we are to depend on the health board in these circumstances we need the resources to supply the services of a home-maker, not just somebody who will sit in a local health centre once a week or every second or third day to interview people who come along.  We need somebody who will have sufficient resources and time to visit that family in their home on a daily basis if necessary to ensure that an accurate assessment can be carried out and the situation kept under review until such time as the official concerned is satisfied that there is no threat to either the children or the family unit that is left at that stage.</P>
    <P>This does not apply just to cases where the parents have died or there is marital breakdown.  It could apply where there is any strange development in the family unit that is detrimental to the interests of the children.  It would then be invaluable to have available to that family the kind of service I am talking about, not just intermittently, whereby somebody has to make an assessment on the basis of one <Col N="1406" /> visit, but continuous, constant and careful observation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that one of the possible causes of problems is financial deprivation.  It can lead to situations that are undesirable in a family unit.  Another cause is poor housing conditions.  Overcrowded or unfit housing conditions lend themselves to a situation that could lead to family disputes and physical and sexual abuse of children.  I am not suggesting for one moment that this always happens, but bad housing is undesirable and we should try to remedy things at that level rather than carry out fire brigade actions afterwards.  We all know families that are overcrowded to the extent that alcoholism or drug abuse or various other signs of pressure in the family occur.  They occur directly as a result of inadequate accommodation.  I am sure all public representatives have had to deal with such cases and from their detached observation I am sure they came to the conclusion that the home life was unsatisfactory for many reasons, including overcrowding.  I accept that that does not come within the ambit of the Bill but it has an effect on its provisions.  Action must be taken in that area.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise the need to provide adequate funds to enable health boards implement the provisions of the Bill.  The staff of health boards are more than willing to carry out the functions for which they have been trained provided they can do that in a reasonable fashion. It is wrong to strain the resources of the boards to such an extent that a sketchy service will be provided.  It would be better not to provide a service than to provide a half-hearted service.  Adequate finance and staff must be provided.  The worst thing that could happen would be that the staff of the health boards would be able to detect only a number of incidents or to carry out a superficial examination due to a lack of resources.  That would be most undesirable.  We must have regard to that important element in the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A home-maker type of service is required to deal with people who suffer <Col N="1407" /> bereavements.  I am thinking of a person who will call at regular intervals to talk to all age groups of a family and gain their confidence.  That person, on the basis of those conversations, should be able to come to a conclusion as to whether any child of that family is under threat.  Such an official would be in a position to take the necessary remedial action.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 21 to hold care proceedings in private.  That is important from the point of view of parents who may have temporarily neglected their responsibilities but also from the point of view of the children who may be called upon to give evidence. It is also important from the point of view of staff of health boards or gardaí who may be called upon to give evidence.  The purpose of the Bill is not to titillate the public mind but to provide for an obvious need.  The greater good will be served by holding the hearings in private.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provision under which health board officials or gardaí can take action with a view to placing a child in care, whether it is institutional care or foster care.  I do not see anything wrong with that provision but it might be difficult to ensure that a child placed in foster care is secure from the natural parent.  That parent, through modern means of communication might be able to learn of the location of the child.  That would be unfortunate because it would put unnecessary pressure and strain on the foster parent and put the child under threat.  I accept that there are provisions in the Bill to deal with such incidents but we have all read of the so-called tug-of-love cases and something similar could develop in regard to these provisions.  A natural parent may seek to get a child back to the family home, a natural reaction, but in such cases it should not be tolerated.  The whole purpose of putting a child into care would be defeated if that care was interrupted by a parent, even for good reasons, taking the child away.</P>
    <P>We should take into consideration the burden which will fall on health boards as a result of having to implement the <Col N="1408" /> provisions of the Bill.  Social workers and public health nurses who move through the community on a daily basis will be expected to report on incidents of child abuse.  That is in order but to carry out what is envisaged in the Bill it will be necessary to augment the number of social workers or public health nurses by a further 20 per cent.  It will not be possible for the existing staff to give an effective service.  There must be a dramatic increase in the number of personnel if we are to implement the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the type of pressures that are on families and children. I note that section 58 states that it is an offence to sell solvents to children for glue sniffing.  There has been a huge growth in that activity.  I presume that there were abuses in the past but we did not hear about them.  In my view those who attempt to sell solvents to children knowing that they will be used for a purpose which would seriously endanger their health should be given a jail sentence. Fines would be too lenient for them.  In socially and economically deprived areas there has been a rash of solvent sniffing.  That has been put down to various reasons but somebody somewhere must be aware of those who supply children with the glue.  Once children have sampled glue sniffing it is difficult to curtail the habit unless there is strict parental control.  The health of the child will suffer as a result.  Once a child is subjected to or has access to such solvents in an area there will be the obvious threat of peer pressure and the use of similar solvents by their playmates or friends. All in all that particular section is to be welcomed.  I hope it will be effective.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I sincerely hope the Bill is as effective as we would like.  It can only be effective if certain extra resources are made available to the people who have to operate and implement it on the ground.  If that is not so, we will have wasted our time.  If, on the other hand, those resources are made available and staff are redeployed to those areas, we can have very effective legislation and that is to be applauded.  I hope this will be something we can look <Col N="1409" /> back on in years hence and say that a good day's work was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The changing face of Irish society, the changing values in Irish society or, indeed, the absence of them, has unveiled many problem areas which have given rise to concern, probably to every TD and every person in public life in this country and none more so than in the area of child care.  Child care has been traditionally the cinderella area of social services provided by health boards.  It is an area which has never had the priority it should have had.  This was because of the hidden aspect of child abuse, child neglect and, in many cases, sexual abuse, something which was hidden until recently when the spotlight was put on it and certain taboos were lifted in Irish society.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for Government officials and health boards to elevate child care to the priority it deserves in the world of today.  The pressures many young people are now subjected to, allied to the weakening fabric of society and the widespread breakdown of marriage, add to the difficulties of many adolescent youths.  It is in this area that health boards will have to provide more money.  The youth of today are particularly vulnerable to the breakdown of marriage.  Every effort will have to be made to protect them from the trauma of broken marriage and the various pressures to which they are subjected by society.</P>
      <P>An alarming statistic issued recently is that eight out of ten young people in this country start to drink while still under age.  Statistics have revealed that young people start to drink at the age of 12½. That is an alarming and sad statistic and shows that the breweries and the drink purveyors are winning in their battle for the lucrative teenage market.  It illustrates the power of the repetitious and seductive advertising that is beamed into every house in Ireland and which has had an immense influence on the youth of today.  Many of the teenage problem children who are out of control also have a drink problem which is certainly a very worrying statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> As a means of counteracting this problem perhaps a new role should be found for a section of the Irish community who have rendered tremendous service to Irish society over the years.  I refer to the religious, to the priests, nuns and brothers who have provided generations of Irish people with education.  Unfortunately, they are now being downgraded and in some areas of the country are disappearing from the teaching profession. Perhaps a new role could be found for them.  There is a great need for hostels and institutional care to be provided for children of broken families. Each village and town in this country has marriage breakdowns and has children in need and in trouble.  In every village and town there are those extra problem families that everybody in the area knows are at risk.  Because of the scarcity of money resources health boards, while they might be aware of the problem, are unable to get in and tackle it.  To take a child from a problem family and put him or her into an institution is to isolate the child.  To provide institutions or homes where entire families could be given shelter and care, thereby preserving the family unit, would be more beneficial than taking into care one child, and probably another at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Some of the vacant schools which belong to the religious orders, and some of the orphanages which are now empty as a result of the removal of the taboo and stigma that attached to the unmarried mother and of the payment to her of a lucrative amount of money could be utilised and converted to cater for families experiencing the type of difficulties we are talking of.  In my area the nuns have moved out and in some cases are living in problem areas and are providing a pastoral presence, thereby continuing their contribution to Irish society.  This area of care seems an ideal one for the religious to continue to make that contribution. They could be paid on foot of contract or perhaps by way of subvention from the health boards.</P>
    <P>While realising that resources are <Col N="1411" /> scarce at present, the provision of institutions and hostels is an absolute necessity. Equally, I am aware that capital costs and meeting the wage bills of staff would constitute serious problems.  However, where the nuns and schools are there already it is my opinion that such facilities could be provided for a very realistic figure.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of involving the religious orders in that area.</P>
    <P>I might comment briefly on several aspects of the provisions of this Bill.  For example, I welcome the revised definition of a child where the age has been raised from 16 to 18 years unless married. I should say that there is also a need for licensing pre-school groups and crèches. I contend that a licence should be required to open a crèche which should be subject to regular inspection by social workers or health board officials.  As the law stands, anybody can open a pre-school group or crèche.  Indeed a person who themselves had been guilty of sexual offences against children can open their doors, inviting children to join their crèches.  This should not be allowed to happen.  There should be some licensing arrangement devised by the Department or the relevant health board.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine the undesirable position obtaining thereto.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill refers to the protection of children and provides emergency powers to the Garda to act when they have reasonable grounds for believing that a child has been neglected, abused or assaulted.  I welcome that provision. However, I contend that in such circumstances the person who should be removed from such a home is not the child against whom the sexual crime is committed but rather the offender.  It is not advisable to take a frightened child from its natural habitat, leaving the offender free to commit a similar crime against a second or even third child. Therefore, the person who should be removed is the offender who should not be allowed back into that household for many years.  Unfortunately, statistics show that many people who commit <Col N="1412" /> sexual offences against their children had been themselves the subject of sexual attacks in their youth.  While that may be astonishing, nonetheless it is a true statistic and illustrates the need for treatment by specialists in that area, people who are specialists in sexual disorders. Such statistics illustrate the need for treatment for such people to be provided on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>It is a very distasteful subject that has reared its head in recent years on account of the courage of many people, including Gay Byrne, who highlighted the problem on his programme, subjecting it to public scrutiny.  Of course incest has been carried on in this country, like others, for centuries but it is an appalling problem which must be curbed and, if possible, eliminated.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that health boards do everything possible to uncover this particularly dastardly crime against children.</P>
    <P>The other aspect to which I refer is the need for specialised training of Garda who may be involved in this area.  For example, if a garda is involved in the removal of a child or offender from a home he will need to be trained for that work and equally to liaise closely with health boards and social workers.  He will need to be particularly discreet in his handling of such cases.  Indeed a special course should be initiated for Garda personnel. Any members of the force engaged in such work should be sympathetic persons and, if necessary, sent abroad for training in that delicate area.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the need for more social workers.  For example, in my county, with a population of between 80,000 and 90,000 there are no more than five or six social workers.  In that county, encompassing two large urban areas, Dundalk and Drogheda, with populations approaching 30,000, it is physically impossible for five or six social workers to attend to the many problems arising.  I applaud the many people engaged in social work, social workers and public health nurses.  However, bearing in mind their numbers, there is no way they can get to the core of the many problems they encounter.  I contend that <Col N="1413" /> the health boards, particularly the North Eastern Health Board &mdash; that has lived within its allocation for the past ten years, indeed the only health board to do so &mdash; should open their coffers now and spend more money on the provision of social workers.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the need for the provision of institutions and hostels for young people.  I can think of two particularly suitable venues in my county for such purpose.  One is St. Michael's College in Omeath which closed its doors some years ago and has been lying vacant ever since and St. Mary's hospital in Drogheda which was closed, not by the North Eastern Health Board but by the Department of Health, which possibly will be sold to provide money for the ultra-modern hospital to be opened in Cavan.  That hospital in Drogheda should be kept open, it should not be sold to a developer but rather used for the care of problem families and children.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on having introduced this much needed Bill.  I hope he will upgrade its provisions without waiting too long.  Indeed, I contend its provisions would warrant annual revision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief because I know the Minister will have a lengthy reply.  As chairman of the all-party committee on the 1985 Bill naturally I welcome this one on behalf of the Labour Party and my party will be giving it full support in the hope that it will receive a speedy, efficient passage through the House, so that at long last we shall have a Bill to replace the 1908 one on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree with me paying tribute to my colleague, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, on the work he put into the drafting of the 1985 Bill during his period in office.  If one examines the Bill one will realise that its provisions are largely based on the 1985 Bill taking into account the amendments tabled by the all-party committee in the early stages of the discussions on Committee Stage of that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> One category which so far as I know has not been referred to is itinerant children whom we all tend to forget.  There are thousands upon thousands of children of all ages living in squalor along the side of the road.  Not alone are they being abused in the normal sense but they are also being abused by the people of this country in that they are not given the rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution.  We can enact all the laws we want but if we do not provide the resources so as to cater for these children we will only have wasted the time and effort of the national Parliament. Many local authorities have made strenuous efforts to assist itinerant families in every way possible.  They have provided housing and halting sites but there are others who have done nothing at all with the result that these families have been kicked from Billy to Jack and run out of one locality only to be faced with the same problem in another local authority area.  This is a problem which should be concentrated on under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I sometimes say that it is a child's world.  Children are always supposed to be happy and insulated against the harsh realities of life.  This may be true for some children but not for all.  There are many unhappy and deprived children.  Some are the victims of broken homes, of parents who could not care less, of sexual or other abuse while others have their young lives disturbed by misfortune for which no one can be blamed.  This year close on 4,000 children will pass through the care of health boards because they need the security and protection which otherwise would not be available to them. Also not taken into account is the work being done by voluntary bodies.  Some may remain in care for years while others may find it possible to return to their families after only a few weeks or few months.  There are thousands of other children who while not taken into care will require the support of the social services, health boards and voluntary bodies.  In this connection let me say that the victims of cutbacks in any sector are the voluntary bodies.  If we are to cut back on full-time care in hospitals we <Col N="1415" /> will end up having to fall back and be dependent on voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>In many areas children are mainly cared for by voluntary bodies.  The responsibility for providing for such children rests with the Minister for Health acting through the various statutory and voluntary health agencies.  Obviously it is essential that there should be suitable legal provisions in place to empower various agencies to intervene on behalf of children where it is necessary to do so. Furthermore, since the family unit is sacrosanct in our society it is necessary that the law should be such as to safeguard the family from unwarranted interference. There must be limitations on the State or any of its agencies interfering in the lives of children unless there are compelling reasons for doing so in the interests of their welfare.</P>
    <P>Public concern for children has its roots largely in the various humanitarian movements in the latter half of the 19th century and in the legislation of that period.  The initial Acts were mainly concerned with removing young children from the harmful influences of workhouses and jails and providing industrial schools and reformatories for them.  They also introduced boarding-out arrangements for very young children and strengthened the laws for the protection of children against exploitation and abuse.  In 1908 most of these laws were amalgamated into one Act of Parliament and considerably expanded.  The then new comprehensive Act was an important milestone in social legislation and it has withstood the test of time.</P>
    <P>While there have been some changes in the law in the intervening period many of the provisions of the 1908 Act are still in force.  However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a need for new legislation and we in the Labour Party, as I said at the outset, welcome this Bill.  The political and administrative structures have changed and new values and attitudes have evolved.  There is now a more sensitive understanding of the psychology and needs of children.  Furthermore, there is an acceptance that <Col N="1416" /> children have rights of their own and their individuality should be recognised.  Some of the cruel prejudices of the past have been eliminated, notably those in respect of single parents or, as we now call them, unmarried mothers and the children born out of wedlock.  We now have legal adoption and many of the children previously unwanted and forced to grow up in institutions are now being integrated into families who cherish them.  However, while we live in a more tolerant society which has brought benefits to some children, regrettably there is another side to the social scene.  There are many broken families with the children being the main victims.  There are many new hazards such as drug abuse and glue sniffing and the decline in moral values.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must say sadly that the erosion of the broadly based family has removed an important family prop in times of trouble.  As I said, the Labour Party welcome this Bill and, as one who chaired the all-party committee, I will be giving it every support, as will my colleagues, during the remaining Stages.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill.  I am pleased at the support it has received from all sides of the House and the constructive and positive tenor of the debate. I am also glad to say that the Bill has generally been welcomed by all of the statutory and voluntary agencies concerned with childcare.  A large number of issues were raised during the debate and I would like to respond to some of them while other points which came up will require more detailed consideration.  I wish to assure the House that I will consider them between now and Committee Stage and indeed the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, will be studying all the contributions which have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of resources was raised by a number of Deputies.  I accept that the implementation of the Bill will require the allocation of additional resources to the childcare area.  It is important however to point out that it <Col N="1417" /> has never been the practice to include in a Bill details of the resources which are to be made available to implement it. Frequently, this is not realised outside the House.  The allocation of resources is a matter for political and administrative decision in the context of departmental Estimates and health board decisions on expenditure priorities.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the success of the Bill will depend on the allocation of additional resources to fund the improvement of existing childcare and family support services, the development of new preventive strategies and the appointment of additional social workers and other staff.  It will require a significant increase in spending on childcare services. It will cost a lot of money but the cost of not doing so in terms of human misery and the suffering of young children would be a great deal more.  I want to assure the House that despite the hard economic times in which we live, the money for improvements in our childcare and family support services will be found. It will necessarily be a gradual process but my policy of directing a greater proportion of available resources to community services will benefit in particular childcare and family support services.</P>
    <P>The process of increasing expenditure in the childcare area has already begun even before this Bill will be enacted.  This year the Minister and the Department allocated £500,000 from the Department's share of the national lottery surplus towards the improvement of services for sexually abused children.  A further sum of £4 million has been allocated from the national lottery surplus to fund a range of services and other developments for young people at risk such as the young homeless, young travellers and substance abusers.  The allocation included over £1 million to assist health boards and voluntary bodies dealing with young people throughout the country who for one reason or another are not living at home. I am confident that this substantial injection of funds will enable significant progress to be made in the provision of appropriate services at local level for this vulnerable group of young people.  It is <Col N="1418" /> the Government's intention that the childcare area will continue to benefit from the welcome injection of funds from that particular source.  Indeed, I think the public should be made aware that we have received support from the national lottery for this area of policy.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in his opening speech, this Bill and, in particular, the provision in relation to taking children into care have been very carefully drafted in the light of the relevant constitutional provisions and recent judicial interpretations.  Article 42.5 of the Constitution expressly provides for intervention by the State where parents fail in their duty towards their children.  The Supreme Court has ruled that while there is a constitutional presumption that the welfare of the child is to be found within the family this may not always be the case and there may be exceptional cases where children would be better off if they were removed from their parents.  It is for these exceptional cases that we are trying to legislate in this Bill.  Part IV of the Bill envisages that care proceedings would be taken only in exceptional cases where the parents had failed to care for their children or where there were other compelling reasons why the welfare of the child was not to be found within the family.  I do not, therefore, anticipate any constitutional difficulties with the provisions of the Bill and I am confident that they would, if challenged, be found to be in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill should contain a comprehensive statement of children's fundamental rights. This suggestion is based on the frequently repeated but entirely mistaken contention that children have no rights. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Bill before the House cannot be considered in isolation but must be read in conjunction with the Constitution and the various judicial pronouncements about the rights of children and parents. The Constitution guarantees rights for all the citizens of the nation, including children.  Article 42.5 refers to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  In <Col N="1419" /> other words, the Constitution acknowledges that children have natural rights over and above any rights granted to them under the Constitution.  In recent years the courts have begun to enumerate these rights.  For example, in the case known as G. <i>v.</i> The Adoption Board, 1980, the Supreme Court declared, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The child's natural rights spring primarily from the natural rights of every individual to life, to be reared and educated, to liberty, to work, to rest and recreation, to the practice of religion and to follow his or her conscience. The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend (and to have preserved and defended) that life and the right to maintain that life at a proper human standard in matters of food, clothing and habitation.  It lies not in the power of the parent who has the primary natural right and duties in respect of the child, to exercise them in such a way as to intentionally or by neglect to endanger the health or life of the child or to terminate its existence.  The child's natural right to life and all that flows from that right are independent of any right of the parent as such.... </P>
    <P>This judgment makes it clear, beyond doubt, that children have rights and that these rights are protected by the Constitution. I do not accept, therefore, that there is any need to try to spell out in this Bill the rights of children.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies criticised the fact that care proceedings are to be heard in the District Court and called for the establishment of family courts.  I would like to remind the House, first of all, that the District Court has been dealing with fit person orders and other provisions of the Children Acts since the foundation of the State and, to the best of my knowledge, it has been doing so reasonably successfully.  I might also make the point that the Bill introduced by the previous Administration also envisaged child care proceedings being dealt with in the District Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> The District Court exercises jurisdiction in a range of related areas including proceedings in relation to custody of and access to children under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the protection and maintenance of spouses and children under the Family Law Acts.  Taken together with the care proceedings envisaged under the Bill, the District Court will have a fairly comprehensive jurisdiction in relation to child care and family law.  There are obvious advantages for all concerned in having related proceedings dealt with in the same court.</P>
    <P>As regards, the introduction of legislation to provide for family courts, this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins.  I want to make it clear that I am not against the establishment of family courts.  Indeed I can see many merits and advantages in such a development.  I would not be happy to delay the passage of this much needed Bill to await the establishment of family courts.  If, at some stage in the future, a system of family courts were to be set in place it would be a relatively simple matter to transfer to them jurisdiction in relation to child care proceedings under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell challenged the legal competence of the District Court to deal with care proceedings arising under the Bill.  He claimed that the District Court, as a court of limited jurisdiction, does not have the necessary authority to make far reaching decisions about the welfare of children.  I do not accept this contention. The most significant power which the District Court is being given under this Bill is the power to make a care order.  I would ask the House to look at this for a moment to see whether there is anything in it that would exceed the limited jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
    <P>The effect of a care order is to suspend a parents' right to custody of and day-to-day control over their child.  This does not, however, mean that the parents lose their parental rights while the care order is in force.  The parents remain guardians of the child and retain many of their rights, including the right to decide major issues in relation to the child's education <Col N="1421" /> and religious upbringing.  Parents can appeal against the making of the care order and the appeal could, if necessary, go all the way to the Supreme Court. Whether they appeal or not, the parents have the right, at any time, to seek the return of the child either by applying to have the care order discharged or by taking proceedings for the return of their child under the Guardianship of Infants Acts.</P>
    <P>All of this shows that the making of a care order is limited in its effects; it is not a final or irrevocable decision.  It is completely unlike an adoption order which terminates the parental rights of the natural parents and transfers them permanently to the adopters.  I am satisfied that the District Court would be acting well within its powers to make a care order and I believe that the fears expressed by Deputy McDowell on this point are not justified.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell questioned the legal authority of health boards to act as fit persons under the Children Act, 1908. The Deputy claimed that because there is no specific provision in the Health Acts explicitly empowering health boards to act as fit persons, the boards have no legal authority to act as fit persons and are acting <i>ultra vires</i> in doing so.</P>
    <P>I would have to reject this interpretation. I am satisfied that a solid case can be made in support of health boards acting as fit persons.  While it is true that there is no specific reference in the Health Acts to the fit person provisions of the Children Acts, I believe that the health boards have an implied power to act as fit persons by virtue of their general responsibility under the Health Acts to care for needy children.  Furthermore, I might make the point that Article 42.5 of the Constitution places an obligation on the State to intervene and supply the place of parents where they are not fulfilling their parental duties.  Successive Governments have allocated this responsibility to health boards as agents of the State.  Health boards have been taking children into care under the Children Acts since their establishment and <Col N="1422" /> the health authorities were doing so for many years before that.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that this practice has recently been endorsed by the High Court.  In a judgment delivered on 15 July last, Miss Justice Carroll indicated that she was satisfied that a health board can act as a fit person.  In order to put the matter beyond doubt in the future, section 14 of the Bill imposes a clear statutory duty on health boards to initiate care proceedings whenever this appears necessary.  This will ensure that there can be no arguments in future about the authority of the health boards to take children into care through the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked how the care proceedings envisaged in the Bill will relate to the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court.  Care proceedings under the Bill will in no way affect the power of the High Court to take children into wardship. Wardship forms part of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  The most common situation in which it is used is to obtain independent protection for a minor's property.  However, a minor may be taken into wardship where no property matter is involved although I understand that this power is seldom used.</P>
    <P>The care proceedings will exist side-by-side with wardship as the fit person provisions of the Children Acts have coexisted with wardship for many years.  I would expect that the vast majority of children who require care and protection will be dealt with under the care proceedings but the option of wardship will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of the law where a number of alternative legal remedies are available and I do not think that the existence of wardship will create any difficulties for what is proposed in the Bill or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The dramatic increase in the number of reported cases of child sexual abuse was referred to by a number of Deputies. In my opening speech, I give some indication of the steps that are being taken within the health and social services to improve services and facilities for sexually abused children.  I might mention that the Law Reform Commission are at <Col N="1423" /> present undertaking a study of the law in this area.  The Commission have received submissions from a number of organisations and individuals dealing with the problem and members of the Commission have also had discussions with agencies involved in this area and with parents of abused children.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Commission intend to publish a discussion document on the changes in the law which may be needed in this area.  Among the issues which it is hoped to address will be the definition and classification of sexual offences in relation to children, evidential and procedural matters relevant to the child's testimony, procedures for the reporting and investigation of alleged abuse and the civil procedures relevant to the protection of children.</P>
    <P>Many of these issues, of course, fall within the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the publication of the Commission's discussion document and I will carefully consider any recommendations which relate to areas for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that where a child is abused at home, the response should be to remove the offender rather than the child.  While at first sight this seems a reasonable proposal, I can foresee major difficulties with it.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it is vital to remember that the people we are talking about in many cases are alleged offenders.  No matter how much society may abhor the abuse of innocent young children, under our system of justice alleged offenders are innocent until proven guilty.  Persons against whom serious allegations of abuse are made are entitled to a fair hearing and the question of removing them from their family home could only be considered where there is firm evidence.</P>
    <P>What Deputies seemed to be suggesting was that it should be possible for a third party, namely a health board, to seek a court order barring a parent who abused a child living in the family home. This is completely at variance with the original concept of a barring order. <Col N="1424" /> Barring orders were created by the Family Law Act, 1976 to enable one spouse to have the other spouse removed from the family home, despite their mutual duty to cohabit.</P>
    <P>Allowing a third party to separate a married couple, particularly if it is against the wishes of one or both of them, would be a very serious step to take.  I am not sure that such a proposal would find general public support or that it could be framed in such a way as to avoid falling foul of the constitutional guarantee to safeguard the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>There would also be practical difficulties. It must be borne in mind that it is already possible for a spouse to obtain a barring order where the safety and welfare of any child of the family is at risk due to the conduct of the other spouse. What is being suggested, therefore, is that a health board should be able to seek a barring order in circumstances in which a spouse can seek a barring order but either has not done so or is unwilling to do so.</P>
    <P>One must have serious doubts about the effectiveness of an order obtained by a health board in such circumstances.  The success of a barring order depends to a large extent on the willingness of one spouse to bar the other spouse from the home and to report breaches of the order to the gardaí.  One wonders if spouses who are reluctant to seek a barring order in their own right would be willing to report breaches of an order obtained by the health board.  If the spouse is not willing to ensure that the barring order is observed, it would be almost impossible for the health board to do so.</P>
    <P>Given the difficulties which I have outlined, I feel that this proposal requires much closer scrutiny before it could be enshrined in legislation.  I understand that it is one of the ideas being considered by the Law Reform Commission in the context of its examination of the law in relation to child sexual abuse.  It will be interesting to see what views the Commission will have to offer on this issue.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers called for the establishment of a national children's council.  None of them managed, in my <Col N="1425" /> view, to put forward a convincing case for such a body.  Given the continuing constraints on the public finances, any proposal to establish a new organisation to be funded by the Exchequer has to be very carefully considered.  In particular, the Government would have to be satisfied that there is a pressing need for the proposed body and that the work envisaged for it could not be undertaken by any existing State agency.  I do not believe that such is the case in relation to the proposed national children's council.</P>
    <P>The main role envisaged by those who advocate such a council is providing advice to the Minister and health boards on childcare policy.  This must be viewed in the light of the fact that the childcare area has been the subject of numerous reports, studies and investigations in recent years.  I think it is fair to say that there is now a broad consensus among the different shades of political opinion and the various interest groups as to what needs to be done.  The real difficulty is getting sufficient resources to bring about all the changes and improvements that are necessary.  I do not believe that the establishment of a national children's council would help to resolve this difficulty. On the contrary, the operational expenses of a council which could be up to £100,000 per year would only divert resources from the frontline services out in the community.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to make it clear that I am not opposed in principle to the establishment of some form of consultative and advisory body in the childcare area.  If the financial situation were to improve and the need for it were to be more clearly established, I could avail of power which I have under the Health Acts to appoint consultative bodies to establish a national advisory body on childcare.  This is the legal basis for the National Council for the Aged. However, for the reasons I have mentioned, I would not be disposed at this stage to making special provision for a national children's council in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The absence from the Bill of provisions <Col N="1426" /> to afford greater security to foster placements was raised by a number of Deputies. The House will recall that the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985 contained proposals which would have enabled foster parents or other persons who were bringing up a child apart from his parents to obtain an order granting them legal custody of the child.  The reaction of health boards and childcare interests generally to those proposals was generally unfavourable.  For example, the Irish Foster Care Association, which represents foster parents, said that the proposals did not provide any real security or sense of permanence for foster placements.  Social workers expressed concern that parents having difficulty in caring for their children might be deterred from placing them in foster care because of a fear that the foster parents would obtain legal custody of their children. Apart from the negative public reaction to the proposals, there were also some doubts about their constitutionality. In the light of all this, the then Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, on behalf of the previous Government informed the special committee which was dealing with the 1985 Bill that he did not intend to proceed with the custody proposals.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill, it was decided not to resurrect the custody proposals for the reasons which I have just outlined and also because children in long-term foster care may, in certain circumstances, now be eligible for adoption under the Adoption Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>It was claimed that Part VI of the Bill, which deals with the inspection and supervision of services for pre-school children, does not go far enough.  I have to say that I do not accept this view. While children must be properly cared for and protected, I am anxious to avoid creating an elaborate supervisory system which could interfere with family arrangements and ordinary neighbourly help.  It has been estimated that over 60 per cent of pre-school children of working <Col N="1427" /> mothers are being looked after by grandparents and other relatives or by non-relatives who reside in the family home. I believe that arrangements of this kind, for example, should not be subject to State intervention.</P>
    <P>There are two main types of services which will be subject to statutory control under the Bill; first, nurseries, créches and other pre-school services which operate on commercial lines and, secondly, community playgroups and other services which operate on a non-commercial basis.</P>
    <P>All of these services will be required to comply with regulations which I will make following consultations with the Minister for Education.  Health boards will be required to have the services inspected from time to time and will be able to call on the assistance of inspectors from the Department of Education in the case of services which have an educational dimension.  In the event of serious or persistent failure to adhere to the regulations, the court will be able to impose fines and, more significantly, order that the service be closed, either temporarily while improvements are being effected, or for longer periods. These provisions are adequate to deal with abuses that may arise in the area of pre-school services.  I do not think that it is necessary to introduce a registration process, with all the expense and bureaucracy that it would involve. Indeed, these matters will be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about the apparent growth in the incidence of solvent abuse, as indicated by reports in the media of the deaths of eight young people resulting from solvent abuse during this year.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputies concern about this and accept that the provision in the Bill imposing restrictions on the sale or supply of solvents is not, of itself, a complete answer to this problem.  Unfortunately, however, the problem does not lend itself to easy answers.  The number of ordinary domestic products which contain solvents and which may be abused is enormous. <Col N="1428" /> They include all forms of aerosols and adhesives, paint stripper, cleaning fluids and butane gas.  A ban on the sale of all of these products to children would be both unrealistic and ineffective since there are few homes where at least some of them are not readily available.</P>
    <P>The best and most effective answer in the long term is to create greater awareness of the dangers of solvent abuse among children, among parents and those who work with children and among traders.  There is now a clear need for a special effort to heighten public awareness of the dangers of solvent abuse.  The Health Promotion Unit of my Department is at an advanced stage in preparing an information programme aimed at combating solvent abuse.  Even this is not without difficulty as any campaign in this area runs the risk of exciting children's interest and prompting experimentation that might not otherwise take place. However, I am confident that the carefully planned programme which is being developed will avoid this danger and that it will in time reduce the incidence of solvent abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked for an explanation as to why private foster care is not dealt with in the Bill.  Controls on private foster care or what used to be called children at nurse are a relic of the last century.  The original legislation was introduced in 1872 in an effort to prevent the destruction of the lives of infants put out to nurse by their parents.  This was at a time when it is estimated that 80 per cent of so called &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; children put out to nurse in London died at the hands of their nurses.  These controls were strengthened in the Children Act, 1908, and these provisions, subject to certain amendments, remain on the Statute Book to this day.  Briefly, they require persons undertaking the nursing or maintenance of children whose parents are not married to notify the local health board. In certain circumstances, persons undertaking the nursing or maintenance of children whose parents are married are also required to notify.  Health boards have power to supervise these children and to <Col N="1429" /> remove them if they are not being looked after properly.</P>
    <P>Private foster care has little place or relevance in the modern childcare system.  The introduction of legal adoption, the development of day care services, improvements in family support services and the introduction of social welfare payments for unmarried mothers have all contributed to the virtual elimination of this form of care.  Furthermore, following the enactment of the Status of Children Act, 1987, it is no longer permissible to distinguish between children on the basis of the marital status of their parents.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I have decided not to re-enact the provisions in relation to private foster care in this Bill.  Children who, for one reason or another, are living apart from their parents will be safeguarded through other provisions of the Bill: for example, section 3 which imposes a statutory obligation on health boards to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and sections 10 and 11 which give new and expanded powers to the Garda and health boards to intervene in cases of child abuse and neglect.  I am satisfied, therefore, that there is no longer any need for specific provisions dealing with children in private foster care.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to once again thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  I will carefully consider the various points which have been made both here in the House and in the many submissions which I have received from the various organisations concerned with childcare.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate something which I said when I opened this debate, that is, that the whole thrust of our childcare policies and services is to support families and to ensure, as far as possible, that children can grow up in their own families.  Where this is not possible, our aim is to provide children with an alternative family, whether in a foster family, with adopters or in a family group home. I would like to emphasise, however, that I would see children being taken into care <Col N="1430" /> against the wishes of their parents only in exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have commented on the fact that a large portion of the text of the Bill deals with taking children into care and have contrasted this with the smaller portion which deals with the provision of family support services.  I would like to explain that the lengthy provisions in relation to taking children into care are essential in order to spell out in precise terms the powers of the courts and the health boards and to ensure that the constitutional and other rights of children and their parents are protected. However, in practice the emphasis will not be on taking children into care but on developing our childcare and family support services so as to help parents in difficulty to care for their children.</P>
    <P>This is an historic Bill.  We must bear in mind that since the Act of 1908, this is the most important Bill to come before this House.  Again, I would like to express my appreciation and that of my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, to all who contributed to the debate on Second Stage.  I thank the Deputies who have contributed and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, who was involved in the Department of Health.  I wish to place on record my appreciation of the officials from my Department who have spent so much time working on this legislation.  I am sure they will be delighted, as I and the Minister are, that it has now come to the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this very important issue in the House tonight.  Injustice, inequity and unfairness are now the hallmarks of the national fuel scheme as revised by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>The winter freeze-up marks the big freeze-out for many deserving needy persons. My main criticisms of the scheme are under three headings.  First, people with similar incomes and in similar circumstances to those in designated categories are not now permitted to qualify. Secondly, and even worse, the discretion of the health board officers has been substantially interfered with in a way that is quite sinister in that the Minister has refused to produce the guidelines issued to health board officers which restrict that discretion.  Thirdly, in many ways the fuel scheme as at present administered is leading to a Star Chamber-type injustice.  It is Kafkaesque in some ways in that applicants do not have access to the guidelines on which their claims are decided and furthermore they have no right of appeal against such arbitrary decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has attempted to defend the indefensible by making reference to a large number of additional applicants who will qualify under the revised scheme, but it transpires from a reply by him in the Dáil on 15 November that there will be no additional numbers in the 1988-89 scheme as opposed to the numbers who qualified in 1987-88.  The scheme has given rise to huge anomalies and it is quite unjust and unfair that people with similar or lower incomes and worse circumstances than those qualifying are now being excluded from the scheme.  Let me give some examples.  Under the scheme as promulgated by the Minister two people who would be eligible in their own <Col N="1432" /> right are both debarred because they are sharing the same household.  A widow living with a son who is in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance will find that she and her son are debarred from entitlement.  People whose sole source of income is an occupational pension, other than a State pension, which is lower than a contributory old age pension are debarred from entitlement, although they are worse off.  Deserted wives who are existing on maintenance payments which are less than the social welfare deserted wife's benefit are debarred from the scheme.  People who are in receipt of pensions from the UK and elsewhere which are less than the contributory old age pension rate are also debarred.  There are so many anomalies that I could detail them through the night.</P>
    <P>The most outrageous of all is the situation of the long-term unemployed person whose son or daughter is at school but happens to have reached the age of 18.  I personally know of a number of such cases and a couple of them have come to my attention in Bandon, my home town. Quite a number of my colleagues have also come across such cases and it appears to be a reasonably widespread problem. Let us look at the situation of an unemployed person who does what many would believe is the right thing by encouraging their offspring to complete their second level education.  If that child reaches the age of 18, naturally they will not be entitled to unemployment assistance. The father loses the child dependency allowance for that son or daughter, which amounts to about £10.20 per week. The mother loses child benefit of £15.05 per month or £3.47 per week.  To compound this, the Minister now tells them they are not entitled to the winter fuel allowance.  Is the presence of this son or daughter who is studying for the leaving certificate supposed to heat the household? This family, doing the right thing by encouraging their offspring to remain at school are penalised not just by the loss of the child dependency allowance and the child benefit but by an additional £5 per week through the loss of the winter fuel allowance.  This is probably the most <Col N="1433" /> outrageous of many anomalies under this scheme.  It is totally without justification that such an anomaly should continue.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the Minister is not very proud of the scheme. It is rather odd that my many efforts to get full details of the scheme met with a blank wall as far as the Minister was concerned.  Telephone calls to his Department seeking detailed information were met with the courteous response that leaflets were available, which were duly sent to me.  My inquiries about the guidelines on which the scheme was based received no response.  I raised the issue on the Order of Business on a number of occasions and received no response.  I then put down a Dáil Question seeking to have made available in the Oireachtas Library the guidelines on which the revised national fuel scheme was being operated by the Minister's Department and the health boards.  I got a page of ráiméis, the bottom line of which was that such guidelines were for internal use only and that Members of this House would not be permitted sight of such.  That is surely not a way in which any democratic system should operate. That a reasonable request should be met in that fashion is absolutely outrageous. It indicates that the Minister attempted to ensure that Members of the Opposition would not be furnished with the guidelines on which the scheme is based.  It is something of which the Minister should not be very proud and I as a democrat must take issue with it.  It is clear that the Minister's reluctance to produce the guidelines arises from the fact that the said guidelines prescribe a significant reduction in the discretionary role of health board officers, which will of course affect many needy people and which may be illegal under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.</P>
    <P>I have been fortunate in that, while I was unable through normal channels to obtain a copy of the guidelines in question, I have been able to obtain access to a copy by other means.  In this four-page memorandum, which the Minister did not think Members of this House should see, there is a direction issued by his <Col N="1434" /> Department to the health boards making it clear that the discretion of health board officers, granted under sections 209 and 212, are to be considerably circumscribed, that is, that the normal discretion available to the community welfare officer will no longer be exercised as heretofore.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there must be a question of some illegality in relation to these guidelines because the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, a major Act with over 300 sections and with which I have some connection as I was chairman of the committee which dealt with it, specifically provides the circumstances in which the health boards can deal with cases of need.  It is entirely inappropriate that the Act with these sections should be interpreted, reinterpreted and misinterpreted by the Minister to the extent where the discretion which was up to now exercised by health board officers is no longer available to them by direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 212 of that Act specifically provides that a health board may, in any case where it considers reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, determine that supplementary welfare allowance shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need.  Yet it is clearly stated in the secret guidelines that payments under this section should not be made unless specifically stated in the guidelines, unless there are exceptional circumstances involved, and then it makes clear it was never intended that these sections be used to pay fuel allowances to persons who are not catered for under the national fuel scheme.  I am not sure how that interpretation could have issued from the Department in light of the fact that the Act goes back seven years and that the national fuel scheme as revised by the Minister only came into operation last month.  I cannot see the sense in the direction that it was never intended that these sections would be used to pay fuel allowances to persons not catered for under the national fuel scheme.  It is odd, to say the least, that there should be such a retrospective interpretation of the spirit <Col N="1435" /> of the Act which was put through by this House in 1981.</P>
    <P>In considering the broad issues of social welfare, it is clear that changes in the social welfare system should be guided by broad parameters.  Everyone in the House will agree that the broad parameters I have in mind are sensible and can be supported by all.  The kind of objectives against which one should measure such a scheme are those parameters which I would define as follows: first, there should be an adequate level of support for the poor; second, we should have a system that targets help on those who need it most; third, there should be a graduated response to different levels of need; fourth, there should be a simple and understandable system, and fifth, there should be a system which gives discretion to those who operate at the front line.</P>
    <P>Measured against any of those objectives for a fair and just system, the national fuel scheme, as revised by the Minister, does not measure up.  He has put in place rigid rules which make no allowance for hardship.  The local information, painstakingly built up by community welfare officers over the years, is cast out the window and now we have rules from Dublin, and if the cases do not fall within their guidelines, tough luck. The people are told to stay out and stay cold, that they need not come back knocking on the window.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have heard of the ESRI report on poverty.  This raised an awareness of the need for a more caring approach to the needy in our society. More and more people want a caring attitude, one which is responsive to the needs of the poorer people.  The solution to the problem is to ensure that those who are worse off than those who now qualify under the scheme are given an opportunity to have access to the scheme and not left to freeze in the winter and, very importantly, we must restore to the local health board officers the discretion which has been withdrawn by this secret directive and which they exercised capably, fairly and with compassion in the <Col N="1436" /> past.  In this way there will be a reasonable chance that those in real need will be sought out and their needs catered for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is new to his position and consequently may not be fully familiar with the changes that have taken place in the last 12 to 18 months, but I will explain them very briefly.  The procedure dealing with the publication of guidelines is standard throughout the service generally.  The Deputy has given a very good example of how someone using internal guidelines can get totally confused.  First, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is still in existence and is explained in the leaflets which are available to the Deputy, and which were supplied to him.  The quote in the guidelines to which he referred is not new.  It is quoting the Act.  There has been a major change, but it is a major improvement which the Deputy seems to have missed.  As regards discretion, the health boards still have discretion under the Act.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seems to have missed the point that I provided a saver for people under the old scheme when I introduced the new rationalised standardised scheme.  There will be anomalies but we are not creating any more anomalies. Nobody had the courage up to now to take the scheme and to create one national scheme making sure there would be no new anomalies.  The Coalition were in power for four and a half years and they never even attempted to do anything about this.  They kept giving free fuel to people with extra incomes, people with incomes as high as bank managers and bank officials, as well as the incomes the Deputy mentioned.  There is now one standard set of criteria throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 I introduced the first national fuel scheme to replace <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which had been in existence before them.  This national fuel scheme was administered by the health boards and applied to recipients of long-term social welfare and health board payments.  This scheme operated alongside the urban fuel scheme administered by local authorities <Col N="1437" /> in 17 urban areas, which had different conditions for entitlement to the national scheme.  There were also a variety of different methods of payment.  A Deputy living in west Cork, should know the very different circumstances of his constituents compared with those in Cork city, Dublin city or other areas.  That enormous anomaly has been removed and the scheme is now uniform throughout the country.  Because of the many anomalies which resulted from the existence of these separate schemes I introduced last year a new standardised national fuel scheme with uniform criteria to replace the two previous schemes.</P>
    <P>The standardisation of the fuel schemes which I initiated last year is now completed.  In October last year I extended the national fuel scheme for the first time to some 30,000 long term recipients of unemployment assistance. These represent some of the lowest paid and worst-off categories within the social welfare net and, despite this fact, their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national fuel scheme was ignored for years, including the time when the Deputy's party were in Government. Their inclusion in the scheme from October 1987 was a major step forward particularly in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The new national scheme, which operated from 17 October is uniform throughout the country for the first time. Everyone who was entitled to a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme last year had their entitlement preserved. There is not, and never was, any question of withdrawing fuel allowances under the national, or urban, schemes from persons who rightly received the allowance previously if their circumstances had not changed.  Our intent was very clear.  Lest there be any doubt I would like to again emphasise this point: all existing entitlements were preserved unless circumstances had changed.  If Deputies have any case in mind where they feel that this has not been borne out in practice I will be happy to look into it on receipt of the particulars.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful if I clarified a couple of aspects of the standardisation which <Col N="1438" /> have a bearing on the position.  First, it was necessary for the Department to set up details on their computer system of all pensioners who were receiving fuel allowances from the health boards under the national fuel scheme.  This was a massive undertaking involving over 91,000 health board records.  In some cases the record could not be matched with particulars on the Department's system and these cases had to be queried with the individual or referred back to the health boards for further information. A small number of these &mdash; a few hundred &mdash; have yet to be finalised.  In all cases where the health board confirmed that a client had been properly paid under the national fuel scheme the entitlement was preserved.</P>
    <P>Secondly, apart from their responsibilities in the past for applications under the national fuel scheme, health boards also provided assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to people with special heating needs. Recipients would not necessarily be aware of the fact that they received a payment under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme rather than under the national fuel scheme.  This has resulted in a number of inquiries from people who benefited under the SWA scheme and expected to receive fuel allowances automatically this year under the national fuel scheme.  The people involved have been advised of the position and that it is open to them to apply for assistance under the SWA as heretofore. If they got a special needs heating allowance last year and their circumstances had not changed substantially this year then they should receive the allowance again this year from the health board.  The Deputy should note the position.</P>
    <P>The position of applicants with children over the age limits for child dependant allowances has been raised.  It is a condition for entitlement to a fuel allowance that a person receiving a qualifying payment should reside either alone or with categories of persons whose residence is disregarded for the purposes of the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition of the <Col N="1439" /> scheme.  Thus, a pensioner or recipient of long term unemployment assistance who resides with a dependent spouse and/or dependent children is eligible under the scheme.  If a child dependant allowance is payable for a child, a fuel allowance may also be paid; if a child dependant allowance is not payable, e.g. because the child is above the age limit, a fuel allowance is not payable.  The age limits for dependancy allowances for children are 18 years, generally, and 21 years in the case of widows' and orphans' pension, and payments for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives. The extension of the age limits for child dependancy allowances would, as I indicated earlier today, have major cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  The previous Government did nothing about it either.  However, as I also said earlier today I have this year provided that where a child goes over 18 in the course of the heating season the fuel allowance continues to the end of the season.  That did not apply before and I have made the arrangement specially.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a single national fuel scheme, extended to cover the long term unemployed, was a major achievement. It is based on uniform criteria throughout the country with separate provision for those who do not qualify but who have special heating needs.  Clients now receive their entitlement automatically each week and they will not have to apply again for the next season or for future seasons.  One notable feature of the new scheme is that many pensioners are now applying who did not <Col N="1440" /> apply under the old arrangements.  My Department have so far this year issued fuel allowances to some 8,000 pensioners who were not previously in receipt of an allowance.</P>
    <P>My Department are now responsible for the payment of fuel allowances to all eligible social welfare pensioners and the long term unemployed.  The health boards continue to pay fuel allowances to recipients of disabled persons' maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance and basic supplementary welfare allowance.  They are also responsible for persons with special heating needs due to ill health or infirmity in the family, or where there are other exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to staffs of the health boards, local authorities, An Post and of my own Department who co-operated in the smooth transition to the new national fuel scheme.  I will be reviewing the scheme during the season and considering the scope for any further improvements as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that this scheme is a great improvement on the previous one and will be very much appreciated by the beneficiaries.  It is an effective, efficient scheme and will remove many of the difficulties people experienced when making an application.  They will automatically receive their payment in future.</P>

      <P>In the period from 1 January 1988 to 11 November 1988, approximately 22,500 allowances were terminated.  The majority ceased because of the death (15,766) of the beneficiary.  Others arose as a result of the Department's ongoing control and review procedures which revealed that the conditions for receipt of the allowance were no longer satisfied in 3.9 per cent of cases (6,749).</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 16, 20, 29, 32 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national fuel scheme is a non-statutory scheme.  Fuel allowances under the national fuel scheme are paid to <Col N="1192" /> recipients of long-term social welfare and health board payments who are living alone or only with excepted persons and who satisfy the Department or the health boards that they are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  The scheme operates for 26 weeks from 17 October 1988 to 14 April 1989 and the fuel allowance payable is £5 per week.</P>
    <P>A new information leaflet, SW 29, which explains in more detail what the national fuel scheme is about, has been issued to all the Department's information and local offices in addition to health centres and post offices.  Copies were also made available to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1987 there were two types of fuel schemes, namely, the urban fuel schemes administered by local authorities with automatic entitlements to fuel allowances for certain persons living in a number of towns and cities, mainly along the eastern and southern coastlines, and the national scheme which was operated by the health boards throughout the whole country and subject to a means test and stated eligibility conditions.  The fact that there were two separate fuel schemes with different conditions for entitlement was unsatisfactory and highly inequitable.</P>
    <P>The question of standardising of the fuel schemes had been raised on a number of occasions and commitments had been given by previous Ministers to introduce one scheme.  No progress was made however until 1987 when the Government decided to proceed with standardisation on a phased basis.  The first step we took was to extend the scheme on a nationwide basis to 30,000 persons on long-term unemployment assistance living alone or with dependants. The second step was to set up one scheme throughout the country under unified administration and subject to the proviso that any existing entitlements would be preserved.  This has now been achieved and under the new arrangements all beneficiaries will henceforth have their entitlement to fuel allowances determined and paid in the same way as their qualifying payments.  Thus, the <Col N="1193" /> Department caters for the entitlement of pensioners, the Department's local offices cater for the long term unemployed and the health boards look after the needs of beneficiaries under schemes they administer, namely, supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and infectious diseases maintenance allowance.  The health boards also cater for payments for fuel to people with special heating needs by reason of ill-health.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements pensioners qualify for a fuel allowance under essentially the same conditions as applied under the scheme previously administered by the health boards.  Persons in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance are entitled to a fuel allowance provided that they live either alone or with a qualified dependant only. A qualified dependant for this purpose is a person in respect of whom an adult or child dependant allowance is payable with the unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The conditions which apply in the case of unemployment assistance recipients are more restrictive than those which apply to pensioners in that in the case of unemployment assistance no allowance is payable where a person other than a qualified dependant is residing with the claimant.  In the case of pensioners, however, an allowance is payable even if another pensioner is in residence.  The extension of the scheme to unemployment assistance recipients brings in an additional 30,000 people and I regard this as a major achievement.  I will be reviewing the operation of the scheme at the end of the present heating season and any changes considered necessary will be made in time for the following heating season.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties created for casual and seasonal workers by the change made in the Social Welfare Act, 1987, which increased from 26 to 39 the <Col N="1194" /> number of weekly social welfare contributions required to qualify for insurance based contributions; if, in view of this, he will reduce the number of contributions required back to 26 or give claimants the option of using the annual level of earnings and annual amount paid in PRSI to establish entitlement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for insurance based benefits a person must have at least 39 contributions paid at the appropriate rate and 39 contributions paid or credited at that rate in the governing contribution year.  Prior to April 1987 the number of contributions required to satisfy both conditions was 26.  The increase was designed to ensure that scarce resources are directed to those in greatest need and to ensure that for entitlement to full weekly benefits under the social insurance system there is a reasonably lengthy history of recent attachment to the labour force.</P>
      <P>Persons who are employed on a casual or seasonal basis and who are unemployed otherwise would normally, by a combination of contributions paid while they are working and credited contributions for weeks of unemployment, be able to fulfil the conditions for continuing entitlement to benefit.  Where, however, persons are employed for a certain period on a full-time basis and for the rest of the time are employed on a part-time basis they may not have sufficient Class A contributions to maintain their entitlements.</P>
      <P>Part-time workers who are employed for less than 18 hours per week and who are not mainly dependent on their earnings from that employment are insurable at a reduced rate which gives cover for occupational injuries only.  Weeks of insurance at the reduced rate do not reckon for the purposes of entitlement to disability or unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole position of part time workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> social insurance coverage is under review to see how such workers might be provided for within the system while ensuring that entitlements <Col N="1195" /> to full weekly benefits are not obtained on the basis of minimal contributions.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an earnings criterion to establish entitlement to benefits would have major implications for all social insurance schemes.  The National Pensions Board have also specifically been asked to examine the question of pension entitlements of part-time workers.  The board is expected to address this issue in detail in its final report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>There were four main recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare and action has been taken on all of these.  These are: 1, improvement in basic payments; 2, improved child income support; 3, broadening the insurance base; and 4, improvement in delivery of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which covers the period up to the end of 1990 includes a commitment that the overall value of social welfare benefits will be maintained and, within the resources available, special provision for <Col N="1196" /> greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments will be considered.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, from July of this year there was a general 3 per cent increase in personal and adult dependant rates of social welfare payments.  Those on the lowest payments, namely unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, received an increase of 11 per cent.  In addition, there has been a streamlining of child dependant rates with a 6 per cent increase for child dependants in the case of persons on the lowest payments.  The full year cost of these increases is £101 million, of which £30 million went to increase the level of the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>Future increases in the level of payments will be considered in a budgetary context and will build on the improvements made this year, taking account of the findings of the recently published ESRI report on poverty, and the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Another major development which was in line with the Commission's recommendations was the extension with effect from April of this year of social insurance cover for pensions to the self-employed including farmers.  I would also like to refer, in particular, to the measures I have taken to introduce greater flexibility in the unemployment payment schemes, and to review the operations of the family income supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>These and other major policy developments which I have introduced are in line with the Commission's recommendations. In addition the major and ongoing improvements which are being made in the quality and delivery of social welfare services are in line with specific recommendations made by the Commission in this area.</P>
    <P>The process of review of the social welfare system will be an on-going one and in formulating further proposals for reform and development of the system I will be taking fully into account the recommendations and views of the Commission and the recent ESRI report.  I can assure the House that any measures which are required to fulfil the commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and any further measures which <Col N="1197" /> can be taken in reforming and developing the social welfare system within the financial constraints which exist will be provided for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of recipients of family income supplement at present is approximately 5,200 and the average payment about £18.00 per week.  The estimate for 1989 assumes a similar take-up rate.  This is a lower rate of take-up than anticipated, despite an intensive publicity campaign.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a detailed study of the workings of the family income supplement was commissioned. This study is now concluding, a draft report has been prepared and the final report will be available shortly.  The question of low take-up and appropriate action to rectify the situation will be considered in the context of this report.</P>
      <P>The study indicates that only some 15,000 may be entitled to any payment under the scheme compared with the original estimate of 35,000.  I significantly improved the scheme in the 1987 Social Welfare Act which accompanied the budget.  It will be further considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that officials from his Department are reducing unemployment assistance payments by as much as £150 per annum in cases where the recipients are reputed to be cutting their own turf; and if it is proposed to make any alterations in this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions <Col N="1198" /> of the legislation governing the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes, where a claimant cuts his own turf, the value of the turf harvested, whether for home consumption or for sale, must be assessed as means.</P>
      <P>In practice, it is mainly smallholders who cut their own turf.  Income from farming for unemployment assistance purposes is assessed under section 146 (1) (c) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 as the yearly advantage accruing from the farm.  The calculation is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the income from farming less the expenses necessarily incurred in earning that income.  In determining the income from farming, account is taken of the value of any produce used for domestic consumption, including the value of free fuel available to the applicant. In such cases, allowance is made for the costs incurred in harvesting the turf.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant for unemployment assistance who is not a landholder has access to free fuel, the value of that fuel is taken into account in accordance with section 146 (1) (e) of the 1981 Act which provides that any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant or his spouse is assessable as means.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the means assessment is to ensure that all applicants are treated in an equitable manner having regard to their situation.  Access to one's own source of fuel is an advantage which other applicants do not enjoy and I think it is reasonable, therefore, that the legislation should provide for that advantage to be taken into account.  I have no proposals at present to change this position which has operated for well over 50 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, increases in social welfare payments are generally payable in respect of child dependants up to the age of 18 years.  However, special arrangements apply in the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers, who are receiving a social welfare pension or allowance. In such cases increases are awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years provided that they are in full-time education at either second or third level. This extension of the age limit was introduced in recognition of the special needs of these families.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of long-term unemployment can qualify for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme provided they are living alone or with a qualified dependant.</P>
      <P>Children aged 18 years or over are not qualified dependants for unemployment assistance purposes in that a child dependant allowance is not payable in their case.  A fuel allowance cannot therefore be paid in this situation.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the age limit for entitlement to child dependant increases would have major cost implications. Any such extension would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Persons aged 16 years or over who are in employment are covered by the social insurance system.  If they become unemployed they may sign on the live register and they would qualify for unemployment benefit if at least 39 contributions have been paid in respect of them.  Otherwise they would be eligible to sign for credited contributions.</P>
      <P>Persons under 18 years are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The Commission on Social Welfare in their report stated that they would not support any form of income maintenance which could, in any way, encourage young persons to leave the education system prematurely.  To have a social welfare scheme for persons aged under 18 years with no previous attachment to the labour force could have that effect.  It would also have very significant financial implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision whereby the various <Col N="1201" /> benefit and assistance payments made by my Department and the health boards include increases in respect of dependent children until they reach the age of 18. Also supplementary welfare allowance, while not normally paid to those under 18, could be paid if the health board is satisfied that the young person is living away from home and is in need of financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The training and other services of FÁS are available to young unemployed people aged 16 to 18.  In addition the Ministers for Labour and for Education recently introduced a new Youthreach programme to assist early school leavers. This programme is aimed at those unqualified school leavers who leave the educational system without doing any examinations and who are still unemployed after six months.  The programme offers such young persons up to two years further training, work experience and vocational preparation.  During this time they receive the usual FÁS allowances. It is expected that up to 3,000 places will be available on this programme during the coming year.</P>

      <P>The recently published ESRI Report on Poverty commissioned by my Department contained certain information about non take-up of social welfare benefits.  Accurate information in this area is very difficult to obtain and the ESRI will be further refining their conclusions in this area.  In relation to the family income supplement scheme I have received a draft report from a consultant whom I had engaged to review the scheme and to look at the level of take-up which is a major issue in relation to that scheme.  The draft report is being considered by my Department at present.</P>
      <P>As far as publicity is concerned, my Department pursued a very active policy to increase public awareness of the services available by providing a wide range of information on its schemes and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 34 public offices and information centres around the country providing an information service to the public on all aspects of social welfare entitlements.  In addition a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets is available.  New leaflets are added as the need arises and these are advertised extensively.  It is my policy to upgrade and simplify all departmental leaflets and booklets and in line with this policy I recently launched a new leaflet which summarises, in a convenient pocket guide, when, where and how to <Col N="1203" /> claim the various social welfare payments. The issue of this new guide was widely publicised in the media.</P>
    <P>Research into the area of public information suggests that most people prefer one-to-one personal contact when they want help in social welfare matters.  For this reason information officers are being located in most of our social welfare offices.  Similarly officers of my Department participate on a regular basis in a variety of talks, lectures and seminars to different groups.</P>
    <P>I am of course concerned that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure that all persons who have entitlements under our social welfare system are fully aware of them.  In this connection the methods of disseminating information are subject to continual review and are improved and developed as resources permit.</P>

    <P>Some 500 cases have been sent for prosecution to the Chief State Solicitor's Office so far in 1988.  Details are not, however, yet available of the numbers that have been in the courts or the outcome.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that it should be necessary to resort to the prosecution of individuals to the extent indicated but I am satisfied that this is necessary to provide a deterrent against the actions of those who would otherwise abuse the system to a greater extent.  I am, however, keeping the matter under review with a view to ensuring that the policy of my Department in relation to prosecutions is both fair and cost effective.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement is designed to lessen the disincentive to work caused by the narrow gap which can arise between low take-home pay and social welfare benefits.  It is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  In many cases such workers may be only marginally better off than if they were claiming disability or unemployment benefit and the scheme is intended to reduce the extent of that poverty trap.</P>

      <P>National lottery moneys allotted to the Department of Social Welfare have been of great value to those working with the deprived, the homeless, the physically and mentally handicapped, the elderly, children's groups, single parents and family and women's groups.  They have provided an impetus to many voluntary organisations and those who work in them.  In 1988 a sum of £750,000 was made available to my Department from national lottery funds for once-off grants to projects being undertaken by voluntary organisations in the social services area.  All grants under this scheme are allocated in consultation with the health boards to voluntary organisations providing social services to deprived groups and people in need.  Details of the organisations to which funds have been allocated under the scheme are set out in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In addition, a sum of £100,000 was allocated to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to enable the society to undertake a major programme of personal development and home management courses around the country.  Over 5,000 families will be catered for in these courses which provide practical advice and assistance to people with whom the society are in contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally a sum of £50,000 is being made available for a special pilot scheme of assistance to voluntary organisations who involve unemployed people in their <Col N="1206" /> activities.  Applications under this scheme are being considered at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the steps he is taking to ensure that the structure of social security financing which varies greatly within member states of the EC is brought into some degree of harmony in order to ensure an equality of competition and <Col N="1209" /> competitive costs between member states within the framework of 1992; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Commission are currently studying the structure of social security financing in the various member states.  The aim is to establish what measures can be taken at national level and whether it is necessary to take measures at Community level to ensure that methods of financing social security do not give some member states a competitive advantage over others.  Consideration is also being given to the overall competitiveness of the Community in this regard <i>vis-á-vis</i> third countries. Officials of my Department are keeping in touch with these developments and over the past few months have attended a number of meetings organised by the EC Commission at which the structure of social security financing in the various member states has been examined.</P>
      <P>Recent international comparisons show that, Ireland is one of the countries in the EC and in the OECD that has a competitive advantage in this area.  The employers element of the PRSI contribution, currently 12.4 per cent, is the second lowest in the EC.  For example the rates of employer's contribution are much higher in France (34.07 per cent), West Germany (17.75 per cent), Greece (17.0 per cent) and the Netherlands (15.48 per cent).  The UK rate is 10.45 per cent but with no upper earnings ceiling. The most recently published OECD comparisons indicate that employers social security contributions as a percentage of GDP is 3.7 per cent for Ireland compared with an EC average of 6.5 per cent and an OECD average of 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The extension of social insurance pension cover to the self-employed who comprise 20 per cent of the workforce will in the years ahead ease considerably the burden on employers and employees of financing the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems facing all countries with well developed social security systems in the coming years is <Col N="1210" /> the financing of pensions as a result of the ageing of the population which will result in an increasing proportion of the population drawing pensions.  One of the major tasks which the National Pensions Board has set itself is to examine in detail the overall financing of pensions in this country and in particular how our system compares with other countries.  The board's conclusions in this area will be considered fully in the context of further changes in the social insurance system.</P>

He appealed against this decision and was examined on 23 February 1988 by another medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>His appeal was referred to an appeals officer who decided, following an oral hearing, that he was not incapable of work in respect of the period from 21 November 1987 to 25 April 1988 and is not entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of that period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 119 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>I have already announced to the House that a Christmas bonus will be paid this year to recipients of long term social welfare and health payments including the long term unemployed.  The payment of the bonus recognises the extra financial pressures which those who are dependent on social welfare have to bear coming up to Christmas time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's bonus will be the same as that for last year and the year before, i.e. sixty five per cent of the recipient's weekly payment.  It will be paid on the first appropriate pay day in December and in all cases will have been paid by 9 December.  Almost 580,000 recipients will benefit, with an estimated 350,000 dependants, giving a total of almost <Col N="1212" /> 930,000 beneficiaries.  The cost of this year's bonus is £21.0 million compared with £19.8 million last year.</P>
    <P>Examples of the effects of the bonus are that: an elderly couple in receipt of old age (contributory) pension will receive a bonus of £60.50 bringing their total payment to £153.50; and a couple with three children on long-term unemployment assistance will receive a bonus of £64.20 bringing their total payment to £163.00.</P>

      <P>My Department has been having discussions with the ESB on this matter but the proposal would have significant cost implications &mdash; at present rates it could cost up to £2.8 million.  Any change of this kind would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will change the provision in the social welfare code whereby a person who has received 156 days unemployment benefit and has less than 280 contributions paid in the seven years prior to the date of claim is put on reduced rate of unemployment benefit, which is often less than the claimant would receive on unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>When the maximum duration of unemployment benefit, which is now 390 days, was extended from 156 days to 312 days in 1967, it was decided that payment at the full rate after the first 156 days would be subject to the additional condition that the claimant had an annual average of 40 contributions paid over the preceding 7 years.  Where this condition is not fulfilled, the rate of unemployment benefit payable to a claimant is the equivalent of the standard rate of unemployment assistance payable in urban areas.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that by providing an 11 per cent increase in the rates of unemployment assistance in the context of the last budget effective from July of this year I also reduced the gap between the full rate and the reduced rate unemployment benefit.  Any further change in this provision would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The only area under my aegis which has a direct involvement with business and industry is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The following is the position in relation to that Office.</P>
      <P>Inland Revenue</P>
      <P>The introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed commencing in 1988-89 has had very significant implications with regard to the administrative requirements imposed on the self-employed, and is directed specifically at the simplification and streamlining of the system of direct taxation.  In this context the basic income tax form (Form 11) has been redesigned to facilitate completion by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other changes are under consideration in the areas of VAT and PAYE which will ease the administrative <Col N="1219" /> requirements on small and medium sized businesses in particular.</P>
    <P>Customs and Excise</P>
    <P>Customs documentation derives almost exclusively from EC requirements. In this context, the EC Commission is at present drawing up a draft Community customs code, the aim of which is to present a comprehensive, clear and consistent version of the law in a codified form, to replace the individual Directives and Regulations applying at present.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the removal of internal frontier barriers in the context of the completion of the internal market in 1992 will greatly reduce administrative burdens for companies.  The introduction on 1 January 1988 of the Single Administrative Document (SAD) was a first step towards this.  The SAD is a harmonised customs declaration form which replaced 19 separate customs forms previously used here.  In addition, a new simplified form (C &amp; E 1047) was introduced on 1 July 1988 for use in the case of temporary importation of goods into the State.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners make regular use of public notices to convey information to traders and the general public about customs and excise regulations, systems and developments, and up to date information is readily available from any office of the Revenue Commissioners about official requirements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in view of the reduction in interest rates over the past 18 months if he will consider reviewing the legislative provisions relating to the taxation of benefits-in-kind of employees of banks <Col N="1223" /> and other financial institutions who obtain loans at a preferential rate; and if he will introduce measures whereby the benefit-in-kind is calculated as the difference between the interest rate actually paid and 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1982 provides for a specified rate of 12 per cent to be used in assessing the benefit-in-kind from loans given by employers to their employees at preferential rates.  This rate applies to both mortgage and non-mortgage loans.</P>
      <P>Since 1982, the specified rate has been lower than commercial rates charged for non-mortgage personal finance such as term loans.  That is still the position.</P>
      <P>Commercial mortgage rates have from time to time been above 12 per cent since 1982; they have also stood at less than 12 per cent, as they do at present.  However, in the determination of the benefit-in-kind charge on mortgage loans at preferential rates of interest, income tax relief is allowed (subject to the normal conditions attaching to mortgage interest relief) on interest deemed to have been paid under the specified rate system as well as on interest actually paid.  This has the effect of substantially mitigating the benefit-in-kind charge.</P>
      <P>The tax treatment of preferential loans, including the level of the specified rate, is being reviewed in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>In order to contribute to increased usage of unleaded petrol in this country I introduced a special excise duty rate of £28.67 per hectolitre (as opposed to £29.47 per hectolitre for leaded petrol) in the budget of 1988.  This change has enabled garages <Col N="1224" /> to retail unleaded petrol at the same price as leaded petrol.</P>
      <P>The taxation of petrol, including the differential excise duty on leaded and unleaded petrol, is kept under review in the light of all relevant circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Government's current decentralisation programme is based on the original list of centres selected in 1980 when decentralisation of Government Departments to provincial centres was first proposed.  These centres are at Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The decision to confine the revived programme to the centres selected in 1980 was guided by the ready availability of sites in many of these locations, and the degree of preliminary planning which had been carried out regarding both the accommodation required and the staff to be transferred.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation programme now under way is an ambitious one, and the Government's present priority is its implementation.  The Government will however at a later date and in the light of the experience gained be in a position to consider representations from other centres including Roscommon as further locations for decentralised offices.</P>

The long term solution to the problem may be the use of computerised equipment and the feasibility of this is being examined at present.</P>

The approach radar was available for operational use but the instrument landing system which is the principal precision <Col N="1234" /> approach aid and the high intensity lighting at Cork were withdrawn from service due to works in connection with the extension of runway 17.  The instrument landing system and approach lighting were restored to service on the extended runway on 22 October and work is now proceeding on the installation of centre-line lighting which will permit landings to lower weather limits than heretofore. This work will be completed shortly.  In addition installation of a second instrument landing system for the southern end of the main runway is due to commence in the next week or so.  This new precision approach aid will be available for operational use in April next.  Tenders were recently received for the replacement of the main radar systems at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.  It is expected that contracts for the required radar systems will be placed next March and that the new radar system for Cork airport should be available for operational use by March 1991.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 June 1987.  Payment of benefit was authorised for a maximum of 52 weeks as the person concerned had only 159 contributions paid. He exhausted this title to payment on 18 June 1988.</P>
      <P>In order to requalify for payment, the person concerned would need to obtain a further 13 weeks of insurable employment, for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Government's decision to review the legislative and administrative burden on business generally, a review was initiated of the administrative and legislative requirements of this Department in so far as business and industry are concerned.  A report on the matter was furnished to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for assessment by the industrial cost monitoring group.</P>
      <P>The main contact between the Department and business and industry relates to the collection of pay-related social insurance in respect of employees and self-employed, enforcement of the social welfare code by both employers and employees, and requests for information in relation to new and ongoing claims to benefit including details regarding insurability of employment.</P>
      <P>The current requirements are seen as vital to the effective and secure administration of the social welfare system. Ongoing computerisation in the Department is facilitating better cross-scheme checking and is minimising the likelihood of unnecessary inquiries to employers. All forms and leaflets issued by the Department are currently being redesigned and simplified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further measure which is helping to streamline present arrangements is the setting up on a nationwide basis of a Joint Investigation Unit involving officers of this Department and the Revenue Commissioners to detect fraudulent claims and non-payment of PRSI contributions.

      <P>No special payment is being made to social welfare officers to deal with new applications for free fuel allowances. However, the work of the social welfare officer grade is measured on a time unit basis and the time units for the social assistance schemes with the exception of unemployment assistance have been adjusted to take account of the free fuel element of the work.  Each social welfare officer station is based on a yearly quota of time units which is set and agreed with the staff side at conciliation council.  Social welfare officers who exceed the work quota in a quarter may be entitled to extra remuneration providing the overtime working has been approved in advance.  The effect of the adjustment in the social assistance time units is that the extra remuneration position of some social welfare officers may be affected.  It is not possible at this stage to say what amount of extra remuneration expenditure will be attributable to <Col N="1245" /> the free fuel element of the work of social welfare officers but it will be marginal and will be met from within the existing allocation for overtime payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I arranged earlier this year for a detailed study of moneylending and indebtedness to be carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency.  Following on this study, the report of which I have recently received from the agency, the Government have decided to approach the issue of moneylending and indebtedness on two levels, intervention through legal and financial measures and intervention through providing information and education on debt and money management.  As far as debt counselling is concerned, the measures which I have recently announced include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the provision by the National Social Service Board of a money service on a nationwide basis,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the introduction of basic information leaflets on debt avoidance and money management to be distributed at all social welfare offices in conjunction with payments,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the inclusion of a module on debt and money management in courses organised by FÁS, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the inclusion of a similar module in civics and other courses in primary and second level schools and also in adult education courses.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard also, as Deputies will be aware, I made a grant of £100,000 earlier this year to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for a nationwide series of personal <Col N="1246" /> development and home management courses aimed at providing practical advice and assistance, including financial advice, to over 5,000 families throughout the country.  These courses are ongoing and are proving to be very successful. Great credit is due to the society for their work in this regard.</P>
    <P>The report also contains information on the very worthwhile efforts of the society and of credit unions in various parts of the country to give direct assistance to people in debt to moneylenders to enable them to get out of the moneylending trap.  The Government are committed to supporting initiatives of this kind and I will shortly be discussing with the society and the Irish League of Credit Unions the operation of a special fund which I have now set up to assist those trapped by moneylending debts.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the determination of whether a rent supplement should be paid in any case is a matter for the health board.

She appealed against the decision and her appeal was unsuccessful.</P>

    <P>It is understood that she left local authority accommodation to move to the private rented accommodation in respect of which the rent supplement was sought.

The Eastern Health Board have offered to assist with these <Col N="1247" /> arrears.  She has, however, refused to accept offers by the local authority of accommodation in the area she left and in alternative areas.  Her application for assistance under the footwear scheme was refused by the health board on the grounds that her circumstances did not warrant a payment under the scheme.

      <P>In the case of most farmers, self-employment PRSI contributions will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners at the same time as income tax and the health and employment training levies are being collected.</P>
      <P>A farmer is liable to pay a contribution of 3 per cent or £208 (whichever is greater) on his reckonable income in the income tax year 1988-89.  In the year 1989-90 the rate of contribution will be 4 per cent and in 1990-91 it will be 5 per cent.  All reckonable income up to a specified ceiling (£16,200 in the current year) is liable for PRSI.</P>
      <P>A farmer who is told by the Revenue Commissioners that he does not have to make a return of income is liable to pay a flat-rate contribution of £104 per annum unless his income is less than £2,500 per annum.  If his income is less than £2,500 per annum he is not liable to pay PRSI for the self-employed.</P>
      <P>PRSI for the self-employed applies to people between the ages of 16 and 66 only.  Accordingly, a farmer who is 66 years of age or over is not liable to pay PRSI contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for a contributory old age pension a person has to be in insurable employment or insurable self-employment before reaching age 56.  Therefore, farmers who become insurably self-employed after they have reached age 56 cannot qualify for a contributory old age pension unless they have paid an adequate number of contributions in respect of previous insurable employment. They are however, liable to pay PRSI contributions until they reach old age pensions age.  If, on reaching that age, they do not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory old age pension, they can claim a refund of the old age pension element of their contributions.  The old age pension element is approximately 50 per cent of the contribution.  It should be noted in respect of self-employed persons, including farmers, who become insurably self-employed after reaching age 56 that the contribution also includes cover for widows' and orphans' pensions.  Widows <Col N="1251" /> could qualify for widow's contributory pension after three years' contributions have been paid and children could qualify for orphan's contributory allowance after 26 contributions have been paid.</P>
    <P>All PRSI contributions paid by farmers under the Scheme for the Self-Employed are paid into the Social Insurance Fund. The fund is used to pay the pensions and other benefits of the Social Insurance Scheme.</P>
    <P>Farmers who want more information about the scheme can get a copy of &ldquo;Your Guide to PRSI for the Self-Employed&rdquo; by contacting any office of my Department</P>
    <P>The aspects of the matter which fall to be dealt with by the Minister for Finance are being answered in reply to Question Number 56.</P>

      <P>To qualify for old age contributory pension a person must have entered social insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This requirement has applied since the scheme was introduced in 1961.  The same requirement applies in the case of self-employed persons.</P>
      <P>Self-employed persons who are over age 56 on entering insurance will of course be able to build up entitlement to widow's contributory pension after three years' insurance.  Furthermore, their insurance as self employed persons can also be combined with any previous insurance they may have had as employees and as voluntary contributors to establish entitlement to either the old age or widow's pension.</P>
      <P>Self-employed persons who were over 56 on 6 April 1988 and who do not satisfy the means test for entitlement to old age non-contributory pension will be entitled to receive a refund of the old age pension element of any social insurance contribution they have paid.</P>
      <P>The arrangements which have been made in bringing the self-employed within the social insurance system are equitable and represent a fair and reasonable way of involving the self-employed in sharing the costs of pensions generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I cannot speak authoritatively for the EC Commission, I have no reason to believe that it has any objection, in principle, to the establishment of a Community patent system under an appropriate Community instrument. Indeed, on the contrary, I believe that the Commission would welcome the possibility of establishing a Community patent system in this way, rather than by <Col N="1258" /> Convention, since this would bring the matter within the framework of the Rome Treaty.</P>
      <P>It has been apparent, however, from an early stage that certain member states have been unable or unwilling to accept the establishment of such a system by way of Community instrument since, in their view, to do so would imply community competence in this area, which is something that the member states concerned are unwilling to concede.  This would appear to be the reason why the Commission has not proposed a Treaty basis for the establishment of the system.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Irish Ministers at Council meetings and Irish officials at Working Party meetings have repeatedly proposed that the Community patent system be established by an appropriate instrument under Article 235 of the Treaty on the grounds mainly that such a legal basis would overcome the constitutional problems which Ireland has about acceding to the Convention.  This position was also explained in detail during the December 1985 Luxembourg Inter-Governmental Conference which was convened to attempt to make provisions under which the Community patent system could be brought into being initially without ratification by Ireland and Denmark.  For the reasons I have already mentioned, however, our viewpoint has so far failed to gain general support.</P>

      <P>The problems created for our exporters by the events of last May have been brought to the attention of the Commission.  As I anticipated in my reply of 31 May 1988, the Commission does not readily see what useful action it could take in particular circumstances such as these, involving industrial action by workers.</P>
      <P>It has been put to the Commission that the particular difficulties experienced on that occasion serve to illustrate the relative disadvantages for our economy which are associated with our peripheral island location, particularly in the context of the impending completion of the internal market and construction of the channel tunnel.</P>
      <P>The development of our transport links to Europe will be of great importance in combating the disadvantages of our peripherality and also offers the best defence against the effects of strikes outside our jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 162 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>There are not special funds available from my Department for investigation of emissions.  Complaints in relation to such emissions and any necessary follow-up action are a matter for the relevant local authority, in this case Cork County Council, who have adequate powers available to them to deal with any breaches of planning permissions, or any air or water pollution problems or other nuisances arising, and to take appropriate follow-up measures.  I am satisfied that Cork County Council has a high degree of expertise directly available to it for these purposes, which may, as necessary, be augmented by advice and assistance from my Department, semi-State bodies or competent private consultants, so as to enable it to monitor, as required, emissions from factories in the Cork harbour area to waters and to the atmosphere.</P>

Controls operated by the Department and local authorities tend to be non-recurring and it is the policy of the Department to keep its operations and those of local authorities under review, so as to ensure that necessary burdens on business and on the public generally, are kept as light as possible.</P>

Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of any works on such roads, including the timing and provision of the necessary finances, rests with Roscommon County Council.  The local authority may use the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department to supplement expenditure from is own resources on such roads.  A block grant of £592,000 has been allocated to the local authority for 1989 which is the same as for 1988.  A grant of £880,000 was also allocated to the local authority for 1989 for strengthening works on county roads.  This is an increase of £205,000 or 30 per cent over the 1988 allocation.</P>

      <P>Full eligibility for health services free of all charges is conferred by section 45 of the Health Act, 1970 and for administrative purposes is usually recognised by the grant of a medical card.</P>
      <P>Charges could arise where a person has been in receipt of in-patient services for thirty days or for periods aggregating in total thirty days within the previous twelve months provided that person does not have full eligibility and has no dependants.  The relevant regulations are the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976 as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987.</P>
      <P>Persons who are in receipt of institutional assistance in long-stay homes may be required to contribute towards the cost of their maintenance from the day of their admission under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1954 as amended by the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965.

      <P>The arrangements regarding diocesan and other approved panels are contained in Rule 97 of the Rules for National Schools.  They provide that teachers who become redundant due to <Col N="1297" /> insufficiency of enrolments have the option of going onto the appropriate panel with a view to re-deployment. Panel teachers continue to teach in their schools until such time as they secure alternative posts.  They are still subject to the rules other than those governing the continuance of their existing posts, they continue to be paid their full salary and any allowances due to them.</P>
      <P>A panel teacher who is offered an alternative permanent post must accept it unless it is outside the specified distance. A teacher who refuses to accept a post which he or she should accept under the rules, will have his-her salary withdrawn as provided for in the rules.</P>
      <P>The re-deployment scheme for lay teachers in Catholic secondary schools is the result of an agreement between the religious-clerical authorities of the Catholic secondary schools and the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland.</P>
      <P>The agreement establishes agreed procedures by which lay teachers are redeployed to full-time teaching posts within mutually agreed deployment boundaries in the event of a closure of a secondary school or where the number of teachers who may be paid incremental salary is required to be reduced in accordance with the Rules for the Payment of Incremental Salary to Secondary Teachers. I am arranging for a copy of the scheme to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position in the case of the vocational sector is that the teachers are appointed to the teaching staffs of vocational education committees and their assignment to vocational schools is a matter for each particular committee. Teachers may be transferred between schools under the aegis of the committee to which they were appointed in accordance with the needs of the committee's educational scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>The vacancy in this school arises from the granting of voluntary redundancy to one of the teachers which was awarded exceptionally at the request of the manager on the clear understanding that the resulting vacancy would not be filled in the 1988-89 school year.  The question of my Department paying a part-time teacher does not therefore arise.</P>
      <P>My Department's records show that the final account for the extension project at St. Mary's secondary school, Newport, County Tipperary was approved on 31 July, 1987 in the sum of £503,884.01.  A grant of 80 per cent of this sum was paid by my Department in accordance with the procedures for grant aid for recognised secondary school building projects. Consequently there are no moneys due to the school from the Department in respect of that transaction.</P>
