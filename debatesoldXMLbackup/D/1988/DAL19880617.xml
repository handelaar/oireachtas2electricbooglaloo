    <P>Pay and allowances, etc., account for 82 per cent of the total Estimates and show an increase of 1 per cent compared with 1987.</P>
    <P>The net provision for the Garda Síochána Vote for 1988 is £273.053 million. Salaries, allowances and overtime account for over £205 million of this amount and the superannuation provision is £41.6 million.  The other major items are £9.67 million for travelling, subsistence, compensation and miscellaneous expenses; £7.65 million for Garda transport; £5.93 million for the purchase, rental and maintenance of <Col N="867" /> radio, computer, office and other equipment; £5.52 million for postal and telecommunications services and £2.25 million for uniforms and accessories.</P>
    <P>The overall financial allocation for the Garda Síochána this year represents an increase of 1 per cent over the 1987 allocation. While the allocations under some individual headings show a reduction as compared with last year, I must emphasise that, in deciding on the financial allocations that could be made for all the various services, the Government took particular account of the vital importance of the Garda service to the community. The financial provision made for the force reflects the Government's concern with preserving that service to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The provision for salaries and allowances takes account of the application to the Garda Síochána of the restrictions on public service numbers announced in the 1987 budget.  However, even in these times of necessary economic stringencies, the Government have shown their commitment to the Garda Síochána by their proposal to make 1,000 appointments over the three-year period 1989 to 1991 from a recruitment competition to be held later this year.  This competition heralds a new era in Garda recruitment in that new entry qualifications and recruitment procedures and a radical new training programme are being introduced. Briefly, candidates will be required to have achieved an educational standard of at least Grade D in five subjects in the Leaving Certificate or equivalent, including Irish, English and Mathematics.  Candidates will have to undergo an intelligence test and final selection will be by means of a competitive interview.</P>
    <P>The new Garda training programme gives effect to the recommendations of the Walsh Committee on Garda Training. Under the new programme training will be ongoing over a period of two years.  In that time recruits will spend 42 weeks in all the training centres in Templemore and the balance of their time undergoing on-the-job training at selected stations.  There will be an <Col N="868" /> emphasis during training on the development of practical policing skills and recruits will also be given some grounding in the basics of criminology, behavioural science, psychology, public relations, communications, social science and management skills.  It is expected that details of the proposed Garda recruitment competition will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The reduced allocation for Garda overtime reflects the decision to abolish the 15 minute pre-duty &ldquo;parading time&rdquo; in the Dublin Metropolitan area and in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford and to re-roster certain specialist groups in the force.  As the Minister has previously indicated to the House, the Garda authorities are satisfied that none of these changes will seriously affect the effectiveness of the force.</P>
    <P>While the maximum economies have to be made in all areas of expenditure on the Garda Síochána, specific reductions have been made in the provisions for uniforms and transport.  The provision of £2.25 million for uniforms shows a reduction of £0.25 million over the 1987 allocation.  The particularly high allocations for Garda uniforms in 1986 and 1987 allowed for the introduction of the new Garda uniform.  The provision of £7.65 million for Garda transport requirements reflects a reduction of £250,000 for the purchase of vehicles and a small reduction in the provision for maintenance and running expenses having regard to the reduced price of petrol.  I am satisfied that these savings can be achieved without any serious effect on Garda resources.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the present difficult economic situation, the necessary resources are being made available to enable the modern technological facilities required by the Garda to be provided. The new national communications network was planned and designed specifically to meet Garda requirements. The rural part of the network is operating very effectively in all Garda stations outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area and a sophisticated new radio communications system for the Dublin Metropolitan area is planned to come into operation later <Col N="869" /> this year.  Approximately £20 million was spent on the Garda communications network system until the end of last year.  A further £3.5 million is being provided this year and this amount is sufficient to meet all the commitments which will arise at this stage of the project.</P>
    <P>The Garda also have modern computer facilities at their disposal.  These facilities continue to be improved and there is provision of £1.083 million in the 1988 Estimate to allow for further development in the Garda computer systems.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Garda Commissioner recently made a number of proposals for changes in organisation and procedures in the Garda Síochána and the Minister has approved these proposals. Collectively they will have a significant impact on Garda performance. The Minister has also recently announced the establishment of a Garda Advisory Group.  This group will act as a source of advice to the Minister on Garda matters in relation to which professional skills and expertise, drawn from outside the Garda Síochána, can be expected to be of particular value.</P>
    <P>I hope that the various measures to which I have referred will underline the fact that every effort is being made to ensure that Garda resources are deployed as effectively as possible in meeting our policing needs and that the potential of these resources is tapped to the full. Overall, I am satisfied that all essential policing needs are being fully met and I am confident that the Garda Síochána will continue to respond in a very positive way to the many demands on their services.</P>
    <P>The problem of crime is a matter of constant concern to the Government.  We must never sit back and say we have reached an acceptable level of crime.  We must recognise that crime is an inevitable feature of a modern democratic society and indeed it features in our society at a low rate by international standards.  We have to accept it as a price to be paid for democracy and concentrate our minds on it as a problem which will always be with us, albeit in different forms and different degrees.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have shown <Col N="870" /> over the years their commitment and ability to handle the various forms, and the at one stage extremely worrying level, of crime in our society.  The level of recorded indictable crime at the end of 1987 had in fact decreased by over 17 per cent since 1983 and in that period we have had to contend with the emergence of various disturbing forms of crime such as drug abuse, attacks on the elderly, joy-riding and armed raids.  Such crimes have been and are being successfully controlled by a combination of Government initiatives and special operational measures and, as a result, the statistics for the end of 1987 indicate that the incidence of all these types of crime has dropped significantly over the past few years.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot become complacent. The crime fighters' work is never done.  Indeed this prompts me to make reference to the recent publicity in the news media about an increase in crime in the first four months of this year.  It certainly is important that any increase in crime is carefully monitored and analysed and the necessary and appropriate steps taken to counter any problem that emerges. However, crime is too big a concern for us to permit of a rash response and we must, therefore, be careful not to react inappropriately, particularly when inaccurate statistics are quoted.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner in a press statement gave the correct figures for the first four months of the year, an increase of 3.5 per cent for the entire country, representing a 9.13 per cent increase in the Dublin area and a decrease of 4.9 per cent elsewhere.  The Garda authorities are monitoring the situation closely and are responding and will respond actively where special measures prove necessary. However, I would be at pains to emphasise that statistics relating to incidence of crime over short periods of time are only of very limited value as indicators of long term tends and indeed the preliminary indications are that the level of recorded indictable crime for the country as a whole for the first five months of this year is broadly in line with that for the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>However, we must be realistic in the <Col N="871" /> role we expect the Garda to play in the fight against crime.  The Garda cannot provide round-the-clock protection for every home and every business in the country but they can help by encouraging the community to take appropriate steps to help themselves.  This the Garda do by offering crime prevention advice to the public, encouraging such basic precautions as ensuring doors and windows have adequate locks, that homes and cars are not left unlocked and unattended and that large amounts of cash are not carried. The Garda have also encouraged increased community involvement in crime prevention by way of initiatives such as neighbourhood watch.  This particular success story continues to grow and there are now almost 600 neighbourhood watch schemes involving 145,000 households in existence throughout the country.  That the operation is a success appears evident from the growth in the number of participating households. However, the schemes are being formally evaluated to assess their impact on crime.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Prisons Vote.  About three-quarters of the total current expenditure provided for in this Vote is in respect of subhead A which covers salaries, wages and allowances.  It is obvious, therefore, that in attempting to control expenditure on this Vote particular attention must be paid to staff costs.</P>
    <P>When speaking in the Estimates debate last year, the Minister informed the House that he was not happy with the level of dependence on overtime working inherent in the operation of the prison system and that this was an area to which he intended to pay special attention.</P>
    <P>In 1986 overtime working in the prison service cost £13.4 million and, while this was partly explained by staff shortages in the light of the increase of 50 per cent or so in the number of prisoners in custody since 1982, successive Ministers for Justice had also recognised that inherent defects in the rostering arrangements were also a major factor in the level of <Col N="872" /> overtime working.  Following the recruitment of almost 200 extra staff in late 1986 and early 1987, it was possible to eliminate much of the overtime which had been arising because of the need to cope with the increases in the numbers in custody and expenditure was reduced to £10.3 million.  However, I think it will be clear that, even with that reduction, the level of overtime expenditure was still far too high.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the matter, it was evident that further significant reductions in overtime and an increase in staff could only be efficiently achieved in the context of addressing the inherent defects in the rostering arrangements.  These defects centred around the fact that the period between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. in the institutions &mdash; the prisoners' evening recreation period &mdash; was staffed almost exclusively on overtime.  In the circumstances, when making the 1988 financial provision for the prison service, the Government decided that the overtime provision should be £6.3 million and that a further 200 extra staff should be recruited, in conjunction with the introduction of a revised rostering system.</P>
    <P>As was previously explained, negotiations with the Prison Officers' Association on a revised roster had been taking place for over three years.  By the end of January last, it became clear that there was no prospect of agreement.  Clearly, the lack of agreement could not have been allowed to jeopardise the creation of jobs for 200 people.  Accordingly, new rostering arrangements designed to reduce dependence on overtime were introduced in the various prisons in the earlier part of this year.  The House will be aware of the opposition of the Prison Officers' Association to this approach and of the general course of subsequent developments, culminating in the withdrawal of labour by members of the Prison Officers' Association which lasted from 16 April to 14 May of this year.</P>
    <P>The agreement between the Minister and the association which led to the settlement of the dispute essentially provided that there would be an independent review of actual rostering arrangements <Col N="873" /> and that any claims in relation to compensation would be processed under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The House will appreciate the importance &mdash; in the context of control of public service pay generally &mdash; which had to be attached to maintaining the line that no special arrangements in relation to pay should be made available to the Prison Officers' Association beyond those available to other staff.  Arrangements are being made for a copy of the settlement terms to be lodged in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>Professor Basil Chubb has been appointed to carry out the review of rostering arrangements provided for in the agreement and thanks are due to him for agreeing to undertake this work.  Before moving on from this subject, I am sure the House will join with me in paying tribute to all those who contributed to the successful running of the prisons and places of detention during that dispute &mdash; in particular, the Governors and their support staff and the members of the Garda Síochána and Army.  I also want to place again on record the Minister's appreciation of the efforts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in seeking a resolution to the dispute.</P>
    <P>Probably the most significant feature in the operation of the prisons and places of detention in recent years has been the unrelenting pressure on accommodation. Despite that pressure, however, every effort has been made to preserve &mdash; and, where possible, improve &mdash; the quality of the regimes operating at the institutions.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the actual physical quality of accommodation at the institutions is only one &mdash; albeit a very important one &mdash; of the factors which determine the nature of the overall regimes in the institutions.  Other factors also have an important role to play.  In this context I would refer, for example, to the provisions made for education and work training programmes in the prisons and places of detention.  There are now 103 teachers &mdash; equivalent to 97 full time teachers &mdash; providing tuition to offenders.  The teachers are provided mainly by vocational education committees. Basic courses in numeracy and <Col N="874" /> literacy and general school subjects are given priority but social education, art, physical education, languages, woodwork, drama and music are also taught.  A number of offenders are pursuing degree courses with the Open University.</P>
    <P>The work training programmes provide industrial training and occupational activity designed to prepare offenders for employment.  A variety of workshop and agricultural activities are also available, which cater for a wide range of aptitudes and interests among offenders.  The importance of work training in the prisons is borne out by the fact that such programmes have been grant-aided from the European Social Fund in recent years and it is hoped that financial assistance will again be available this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>An allocation of £235,000 is provided for education materials and equipment and £592,000 is provided for the work training programmes. I should mention that, in general, teachers' salaries are not provided for in the Prisons Vote &mdash; the cost is borne by the vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the question of accommodation, £6 million is allocated this year for capital expenditure on prisons and places of detention.  The money provides for completion of the new place of detention for 320 offenders at Wheatfield. Construction and servicing reached the stage of virtual completion on 4 February 1988.  Furnishing, equipping and commissioning are currently being finalised. Apart from Wheatfield, work related to the upgrading of security services and to the improvement of facilities generally is in progress in Portlaoise, Mountjoy, <Col N="875" /> Limerick, Cork, Arbour Hill, St. Patrick's Institution, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new place of detention at Wheatfield, it is expected that the question of the use which may be made of it will be brought before the Government in the very near future.  While originally intended for juveniles, there have been developments since the project was initiated &mdash; such as the unprecedented rise in the overall numbers in custody and the emergence of a group of offenders identified as having AIDS antibodies &mdash; and these developments may have implications for the best use to be made of the facility at Wheatfield.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated on the operation of the prisons system but it is, of course, the case that alternatives to imprisonment are a vital ingredient in the overall penal system.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, which the Minister initiated and which has now been in operation since January 1985, provides that offenders can be required by the courts to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work for the benefit of the community.  The work is performed under the general supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The courts are another area which is provided for in the Justice group of Votes.  The Minister has broad responsibility for providing the services necessary to enable the courts to function effectively. That responsibility extends to the promotion of legislation relating to the establishment, jurisdiction and functioning of the various courts and the making of Statutory Orders under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware of the problems with the suitability and adequacy of courthouse accommodation. I must emphasise that responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities and it is vital that local <Col N="876" /> authorities meet this responsibility if justice is to continue to be dispensed on a local basis.</P>

      <P>This is a very important Estimate.  I know it is not the fault of the Chair, but it is a total waste of time if we do not have an adequate opportunity to debate these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The normal thing to expect from any Opposition spokesperson on the Estimates debate each year is for him or her to concentrate on the need for extra resources in whatever area is covered by the relevant Estimate.  In some cases this can be entirely justified and Justice is, in my opinion, one of these areas.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, they called for more money to be spent on everything, telling the public as they did on the last occasion, that the Government of the day were operating Thatcherite policies at the expense of the ordinary person.  They were at their very best during their last term in Opposition from 1982 to 1987 and, boy, did they play the traditional Opposition card?  They did this at the expense of the people of this country, but they do not mind that.  They operate on the basis that what is good for Fianna Fáil is good for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Power at any cost.  If they did what Fine Gael are now trying to do during this period of Opposition, this country would be well on the road to recovery.  The role being played now by Fine Gael is a very difficult one, some might say it is political suicide, but I hope <Col N="877" /> it will show the electorate that some politicians are prepared to put the interests of the country before their own personal electoral gain.  I have faith in the public and I am confident that when the time comes, despite what the polls now say, we will get a favourable response.</P>
      <P>The Estimate debate is probably the only time we have an opportunity to discuss the many areas under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice. During the term of office of the previous Government, there was an Oireachtas Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and the very valuable work carried out by that committee was tremendously important.  Instead of abolishing this committee, the Government should have upgraded their status by giving them additional resources and extra powers to continue their work.  I remind Fianna Fáil that this committee were set up, in the first instance, at their request; indeed they made that a condition before they agreed to other committees coming into operation.  I ask the Minister to bring pressure to bear on the Government to re-establish this committee with the additional powers about which I spoke earlier.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months I used every opportunity to try to put on the Statute Book a law dealing with the problem of under-age drinking.  I went so far as to produce my own Private Members' Bill to deal with this very serious problem.  I am very pleased that we recently passed the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, part of which incorporates the provisions of my Private Members' Bill on under-age drinking. This is the first stage in dealing with under-age drinking and I sincerely hope that with the co-operation of everybody concerned, particularly parents, it will not be too long before there is a massive improvement in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another serious problem facing us is the addiction by people, especially the young, to gaming machines.  Recently we read of the unfortunate and untimely death of a young person who, because of his addiction, committed suicide.  The law controlling the licensing of these <Col N="878" /> machines is an ass.  It is totally out of date and lacks proper controls to meet the requirements of the eighties and nineties. Because of the involvement of local authorities, there is no consistency in the way the law is administered.  Some local authorities permit amusement halls in their areas and others have banned them.  It is time the law was amended to relieve local authorities of their responsibility in this area and to replace it by setting up a gaming board which would be responsible for the issuing of certificates before a licence could be obtained.  I propose that the gaming board should be given very strong powers to decide who and what premises should get a certificate and, before issuing a certificate, they should insist on very high standards being maintained.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some examples of the powers which the gaming board should have: (a) powers to refuse the issue of a certificate and power to cancel a certificate in force if standards were not maintained or if the holders of a certificate did not conform with the requirements of the certificates; (b) the annual inspection of premises on a minimum basis and the right to inspect at any time; (c) the right to remove machines for examination at any time; (d) the power to set minimum requirements regarding pay-outs from machines which would not be below 90 per cent; (e) the power to ban particular types of machines and to decide what machines should be allowed on these premises; (f) the power to set age limits for those allowed on licensed premises, who should not be under 18 years and (g) the power to set the maximum stake permitted and the maximum value permitted to be won by a player in any game.  These are only some of the stringent requirements which the gaming board should set because it is vital to stamp out the present abuses in some areas.  We must control who can hold a licence and who is allowed on the premises.  We should not wait for another death before doing something about this problem.</P>
    <P>The idea of the gaming board could be developed from the recent intoxicating <Col N="879" /> Liquor Bill under which Bord Fáilte are required to issue a certificate and unless such certificate is produced the court in question cannot issue a licence.  If we amend our laws, set stringent limits and high standards, we could do something practical to deal with this problem.  At present there is a lot of talk about machines &mdash; one group says we should ban them and another says they should be allowed &mdash; but in the meantime nothing is happening.  My suggestions are constructive.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some of the points made by the Minister and to refer to the increase in the number of crimes recorded in the first quarter of this year as against the same period last year. Members on this side of the House have consistently warned against this possibility. Not alone has there been an increase in the number of crimes committed but also in the type of crime involving the use of firearms.  Most of us probably saw an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> on Monday 6 June where there was a heading &ldquo;Armed Crime Rate in Dublin Worse than the US&rdquo;.  That is a terrible reflection on what is happening, especially in our capital city.  It is commonplace now to open the daily newspapers and to read of another armed crime in some part of the country, but particularly in the greater Dublin area.  It is time for us all to co-operate to do something constructive to eliminate this horrific increase in the crime level.  Of course, putting more gardaí on the streets and amending our laws will not answer the problem which is due to high unemployment, to more and more people opting out of education and to our prison policy which appears to lock up people for a short period and then release them on to our streets, more hardened criminals than when they went into prison.  I warn any Government against the dangers of cutbacks in the area of justice because if we do not have sufficient resources to deal with the type of problems which the Department of Justice are expected to deal with it will be reflected in other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> There is a general feeling that crime pays and there is a need to introduce a new system whereby offenders will have to recompense their victims.  How often has a member of the public suffered as a result of a crime, for example, in his or her home?  The normal procedure is to report the break-in to the local Garda station.  A garda will probably pay you a visit but the chances are your property will never be recovered and there is an even greater chance that you will not hear anything further about the matter.  There is a breakdown in public relations in dealing with the public and there is a feeling that the public are being alienated from the system.  If somebody reports a burglary or another crime, he or she should be told of the eventual outcome of the complaint.  Above all, it is time the victims of crime were recompensed by those who ultimately are caught and, instead of being put in prison for six months at the expense of the taxpayer, the person should repay the victim of the crime and do something constructive in the community. I am not saying we should close down our prisons &mdash; many people must be sent to prison &mdash; but there are numbers for whom it does absolutely nothing except to make them tougher criminals. In the meantime the unfortunate victims not only have to suffer a loss of property but have to fund the stay of the prisoners while in prison.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work being done by the Irish Association for Victim Support who get the massive sum of £8,000 from the state each year for the very valuable work they do.  This voluntary group do tremendous work in the community, in particular with people who have suffered as a result of serious crime.  This group give a very good counselling service and I think they deserve recognition from the State.  The miserable allocation of £8,000 is ridiculous, particularly when we read about the sums being thrown around from the national lottery.  Depending on what constituency you are in, you can collect a cheque for £50,000 and deliver it personally.</P>

      <P>Indeed, there is nobody in the House and the debate will probably finish early.</P>
      <P>I have a few suggestions to make on the Garda Síochána.  Again, it is not to call for more money to be spent but rather to examine the manner in which the money is spent.  I honestly believe that the time has come &mdash; given the size of their allocation, £273 million &mdash; that the Garda Síochána should have more independence in deciding how this money is spent, in particular on the management structure of the Garda Síochána.  I am not merely suggesting that we promote more people to the rank of assistant superintendent or to assistant commissioner but I think we should bring in expertise in financial control.  There should be a financial controller at the level of deputy commissioner.  In addition there should also be a personnel manager at the same level.  These people should be able to set up proper controls for the expenditure of money and also pursue a proper staff policy.  Any organisation that has a workforce of 11,000 people in this day and age would have the services of a trained and skilled personnel manager.  I think that on a once-off basis a financial controller and personnel manager should be recruited and that those two individuals could set up systems whereby in the future members of the Force could be appointed to these divisions if they have the necessary skills.  The only way to set about that is to recruit into the Force two or more individuals who would set about putting these procedures in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to compliment the <Col N="882" /> Garda Síochána on the excellent work being done under very difficult circumstances. I had the pleasure recently of meeting one of the new community policemen operating in my constituency. This is a brilliant idea and is a return to the original concept of a community police force.  These gardaí are operating on the ground very effectively and they are becoming part of the community. They are meeting on a daily basis youngsters who might possibly get into trouble in the future.  They engender a sense of community involvement and of doing the thing together.  I sincerely hope that the Force, with the exception of the specialist branches, will revert to their original intention, that is a community police force.</P>
    <P>I hope we get back to the man on the beat, who would meet Mrs. Murphy every day and have a chat with her and who would be meeting all the youngsters and building up a worthwhile relationship with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy Barrett, in being disparaging about the time this House has been given, not just for this debate but for every Estimates debate I have taken part in. The same problem occurred during the debate on the Labour Estimate and in fact, although the Minister galloped through his speech of 22 pages he did not reach the end, despite his best efforts.  I believe the work of the Department of Justice starts from the point where crime exists in our community and certain measures must be taken to eliminate it. <Col N="883" /> The Department have responsibility for all aspects of the elimination of crime and for the provision of justice in the procedures used.  There is a lot of money involved in running the Department.  The Minister's office alone is allocated £17.8 million; the Garda Síochána, £273 million; and the prisons, £57.5 million.  These are enormous sums of money.  I think it behoves this House, as Deputy Barrett has said, to give a reasonable amount of time to discuss Estimates where such a huge amount of taxpayers money is going.</P>
      <P>I can only touch on certain areas that are worth mentioning for a minute or two and that is disparaging towards the public at large who have paid taxes which are paying for these services.  We have no right of real scrutiny over the spending of this money, and after all this is a debate in which we can discuss this expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I will deal with the Estimate for the Office of the Minister.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the allocation to the Legal Aid Board and to the difficulties that they have been experiencing since their initiation.  The legal aid scheme was set up in December 1979 and there are now 12 centres. However, there are still 18 counties without law centres.  Even though Dublin which has the highest population density has four centres, there are still weeks and months when centres have to close because they are inundated with work and cannot cope.  What does this say about the justice we are offering our people?  What does it mean for the battered or deserted wife or the person in dire straits?  Sometimes because of the urgency of their case people may skip the queue but those whose cases are not so urgent have to live with a very great problem on their minds which they cannot resolve and cannot get advice on and in some instances they cannot take action which would alleviate the problem. Sometimes people are waiting two or three months or more for advice on how to eliminate problems.  I do not think that is good enough.  In fact the Legal Aid Board has been promised four more <Col N="884" /> centres in early 1987 and as of yet we have had no move on this.  In addition we are awaiting legislation to put the Legal Aid Board on a statutory basis and until that happens I think there is a great deal of doubt about this Government's commitment to such a board in the long term.</P>
    <P>Until they have statutory form we will not know the terms of the Government's commitment to the board.  New legislation on marital law reform and on adoption, to mention a couple of areas, are going through this House at present.  As a direct result of the implementation of this legislation more cases will come before the Legal Aid Board and they will simply not be able to cope as they are presently constituted.  I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at the workings of the Legal Aid Board and their centres. I do not in any way wish to denigrate the work done by the personnel there; there is an enormous commitment on their part.  However, I would ask the Minister to review the way in which it operates to ascertain whether there is any way in which the extra centres promised last year can be provided.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with another group working on behalf of those who suffer because of crime.  I refer to the Irish Association for Victim Support.  The £8,000 the Minister has seen fit to allocate to this association is an absolute pittance. I would claim that the amount of money saved by the State by the work of this association would be far in excess of that amount.  They are a voluntary associations and wish to remain so.  They are not asking to be paid counsellors.  I believe there is a strong case to be made for the proper funding of the training of such counsellors, and their work.  People are experiencing more and more trauma on account of being victims of crime.  It is said that one in every seven persons in Dublin has been mugged.  That is an horrific figure and it is one only of many that could be cited to illustrate the contact with crime of the ordinary man or woman in the street.  The work of that association is valuable, essential and should be supported and there are ways <Col N="885" /> of doing so without requiring the overall budget be increased.</P>
    <P>For instance I know that, in Britain, the proceeds of unclaimed stolen property remaining in police stations are devoted partly to such an association there.  I see no reason why that should not take place here.  It is my understanding that at present such proceeds go back into central funds.  It is my belief that it would be quite simple to divert those proceeds to such an association.  I ask the Minister to consider doing so by way of a preventive measure rather than allowing people to end up in hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and in doctors' care at an undoubted cost to the State.  At the annual conference of the Irish Association for Victim Support the Director of Public Prosecutions delivered a very interesting paper on the victim's place in the criminal justice system.  Its contents are well worth thinking about.</P>
    <P>He demonstrated very carefully that the history of the victim and his or her place in the system led us into the position in which the State has taken over all responsibility for eliminating crime practically without reference to the victim. Originally it was the victim who prosecuted. Then the State took over that prosecution on behalf of the victim.  It now appears that the State takes over the prosecution on behalf of the public at large.  In so doing the victim is lost completely to the system and they know they are irrelevant, except to turn up on the day and give evidence.  That is not good enough because it merely contributes to the trauma occasioned by the crime itself.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to initiate proper procedures with regard to consultation with the victim, provision of information on the way a case is proceeding, information on why a case is not being brought forward or the reasons for certain types of consequences or causes being prosecuted and others not.  I ask him to examine also the possibility of compensation to be paid by the offender to the victim.  I do not believe that would be suitable in all cases. It is my belief that some offenders would simply opt out of any earning capacity they might have, or disappear, and that <Col N="886" /> would be the end of it.  The initiation of community services orders is very useful. Again I would contend that, where possible, compensation would be given because it would provide a direct line between the criminal and victim.</P>
    <P>I believe that the re-organisation of the Garda Síochána initiated is very welcome. There is no doubt that in recent years there has been a crying need for a proper management-oriented re-organisation of the force.  That is beginning to take place.  I would point the Minister in the direction of the fact that there is public unease because there is no evidence of the replacement of certain units within the Force which have been disbanded. In view of the increase in crime figures the unease of the public about the disbandment of special units within the Force has been aggravated.  I know there has been a decrease in crime figures over the past year or two but I contend that that decrease must be viewed in the context of the enormous rise in the previous seven or eight years.  It is not good enough to say that crime has been beaten because statistics have decreased over the past year or two.  The facts are that crime increased four- or five-fold in the previous seven to ten years.  We still have a long way to go before we can maintain that we have got on top of the appalling rate of crime.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prison service I should like to put on record that I believe the strike that occurred in the last year was totally unnecessary and was damaging to the prison system itself.  It spoke of a confrontational approach taken by both sides, quite unsuited to industrial relations, and spoke volumes about the lack of industrial relations and personnel management in the prison service and, I would go so far as to say, within the Department of Justice.  Both sides should take note of what happened in the course of that dispute and why it led to industrial action which could not be overcome for so long when there was so little dividing the parties to the dispute.  In the end it is my belief that there was no real shift in the positions of either party.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Wheatfield Prison <Col N="887" /> and others which may be planned for the future, proper planning is absolutely vital.  I know from my experience of serving on the Committee of Public Accounts that the kind of stop-go planning that has taken place on the building of prisons in recent years has resulted in millions of pounds being spent unnecessarily.  For instance, there was the debacle about the prison officers' accommodation in Portlaoise Prison which arose directly out of a failure to go ahead withi the building of a new high security prison there.  As a result, there was the scandal of 200 extremely expensive special prison doors made and bought.  They are now in cold storage and will be for the foreseeable future, because the planning of the new prison was a stop-go exercise, with nobody knowing who was in control and nobody taking responsibility for decisions at appropriate times.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to extradition, an issue which has arisen again in the course of the past week in relation to the McVeigh case.  It is important that the Government should realise that the fuss occasioned and the difficulties created between this country, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as a direct result of that case, arose out of their very heavy politicisation of the whole extradition issue last December.</P>
    <P>This Government insisted on bringing extradition into the political arena.  They insisted on bringing a political appointee, the Attorney General, into the decision-making process.  Not alone is the Attorney General prosecuting the case or presenting the warrant, but he is also in a quasi-judicial way making a decision before he does that, as to whether or not there is evidence to back that up.  Because of all the politicisation of extradition, we had the debacle this week that what prior to this might have appeared to be a simple criminal justice or judicial decision is now seen as a political decision and no matter what Irish politicians or the Irish people say it will be seen in Britain and in Northern Ireland that we are against extradition.</P>
    <P>It has to be said from the floor of this <Col N="888" /> House that this Government created the situation by politicising extradition.  We must urgently change the 1965 Extradition Act so that the decisions on fine points of law which district justices are expected to grapple with at the moment can be removed to a higher court.  It is not realistic to expect them to grapple with these points.  The onus should be removed from the district justice.  There is nothing wrong with a district justice making a simple yes or no decision in a case but if there are fine points of law to be discussed and decided upon it should not be left in that forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will commence on the point on which the previous speaker concluded, the extradition question.  I totally disagree with her comment that district justices are not capable of dealing with fine points of law.  That is not correct. District justices are very capable of dealing with fine points of law and they do it very well, but the district justices can only deal with the law as they find it and that is where the responsibility of the House comes in.  We have not met that need. The law in this area has proven totally unsatisfactory relating to the McVeigh case which gave rise to the difficulty during the week.  The Minister's and the Government's response is totally inadequate and will not meet the needs at all.  The Minister says he will appeal this by way of a case stated to the High Court. That may be all right as far as it goes but that is not what is needed.  We are dealing here with a question of the law of evidence under the Extradition Act and we need short, sharp, quick amending legislation to deal with the question of evidence. That should not be too difficult for the Minister to introduce and if need be it could be put through both Houses of the Oireachtas even in one day.  I am sure the co-operation of all parties would be forthcoming on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Identification as required under the code has proven totally unsatisfactory.  A standard of identification ought to be set down in a new short simple Bill.  I am surprised that no announcement has come from the Minister to say that will be <Col N="889" /> done and that it will be brought forward urgently, because there will be further McVeigh-type cases with difficulties arising. The Government do not seem to be motivated towards putting their house in order on this issue.  A Bill amending the law of evidence of identification could set down varying standards and it would be for the House to consider what those standards might be.  There could be a very low standard of proof, for example that a senior officer of the Garda might be held as sufficient evidence of identification if he says that in his opinion and from his knowledge the person named on the warrant is the person now before the court.  That might not be a high standard but it is a possibility which equates more or less to the basis we had where a senior officer gives as his opinion that a person is a member of an illegal organisation. Alternatively, there could be higher standards. These are matters for the House to decide.  At least there ought to be some clearer basis of identification set down.</P>
    <P>At the moment the District Courts apply the law as they find it and we cannot find fault with them when they apply the law as it is before them.  Will the Minister look into the question of amending the law of evidence to put extradition on a proper footing?  If the Minister does not do that, notwithstanding what we may say we will be open to criticism both here and abroad, particularly in the UK, that we are not serious about bringing in an effective and workable system of extradition. The present system is not working and we warned it would not work.  No extradition has taken place under the new Act, and what could be greater proof than that.  I do not know how many people are sought under that code, but something will have to be done about it. To say that the long procedure of a High Court case stated application will meet the need is wrong.  We are open to serious criticism on the extradition question.  If an announcement was forthcoming to say that the law of evidence was going to be clarified and amended in an appropriate way to deal with the matter of identification, which is the major problem, that <Col N="890" /> would go a long way towards meeting the situation.</P>
    <P>The criminal injuries code is totally unsatisfactory.  The previous Government, and it reflects no credit on them, made major cutbacks and utterly decimated the system under which awards of compensation would be given to people who sustained serious personal injuries from stabbings, assaults or whatever, as a result of serious crimes.  That was reduced by the previous Government and now the only compensation that can be recovered by a person attacked and sustaining serious injuries is that he can get his loss of earnings or hospital expenses. That is all.  At the time the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition said what was proposed was outrageous and unthinkable and that it should not be done but they have not done anything about it since they came to Government.  I see no move to reinstate it.  Even worse, those small sums to cover expenses and loss of wages may not be recovered quickly because there is not sufficient money in the scheme.  We are told that even where decrees for those small amounts are made it will take a year or more before those moneys can be recovered from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.  That is regrettable.  I ask the Government to re-examine the question of reintroducing the scheme which was so badly cut back and which cutback was criticised so strongly at the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley made reference to civil legal aid.  The system is a disgrace.  It is an absolute outrage that year after year we allow a situation to continue where access to the law remains by and large the preserve of the rich.  With money behind them they can maintain their rights, their property and their actions and claims with a full access to the law that is denied to ordinary people who cannot afford the very high level fees required in many categories of action. That is totally unjust and it is an ongoing shame and disgrace that successive Governments have allowed it to continue to this day.  Not just this Government but previous Governments should feel ashamed.  This is an even bigger disgrace <Col N="891" /> when we realise that even the poor legal aid system that is there was brought in not because we decided it was necessary or because we wanted to bring it in, but because we were directed to do it by international organisations, the EC, the Council of Europe or whatever.  If that had not happened, I wonder whether we would have no legal aid system.  It is a denial of the basic ordinary rights of the citizen.  He or she should have the same access and be in a position to avail of those rights which the law gives him or her in like manner to a person who has wealth.  Otherwise we are not complying with the directive in the Constitution to treat all children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>We are introducing new legislation giving new rights of judicial separation as pointed out by Deputy Colley.  There will be no benefit in giving those rights unless we give with them the means to avail of the right.  What advantage is it to anybody to have a right if they do not have the financial means to avail of that right?  I regret that that is the position at present. We are bringing in here, with the consent of all parties, new rights to facilitate the grant of judicial separations.  Any person who has money, even under the existing law, can get a judicial separation if they need one.  Anyone who can put £1,000 or £1,500 on the table up front for those solicitors who specialise in that line of country will have little or no difficulty in getting a judicial separation.  We are bringing in new remedies but if we are serious, we must also provide the financial means to people who cannot afford to avail of those rights.</P>
    <P>Our record in the area of law reform is poor in the extreme in this country. We have an appreciable number of fine reports brought in by the Law Reform Commission and other organisations recommending much needed reform in our laws.  We seem to regard that as having a very low priority in our order of things in this House over the years.  It is totally unsatisfactory that it should be left to Opposition parties in this House to bring in law reform measures.  They do that within the limited time available in <Col N="892" /> Private Members' Time.  Some parties in the House do not have any Private Members' Time and consequently are unable to deal with the problem in that way.  The primary responsibility for law reform must rest with the Government and they are doing very little in that regard.  It is an appalling waste of resources that the Law Reform Commission have been there all these years, at considerable expense, recommending much needed changes in the law and their reports gather dust on the shelves.  Little or nothing is done to implement those reports.  There must be couple of dozen reports covering a wide spectrum of both civil and criminal law, occupiers liability, rape, and so on, and a very small percentage of their recommendations ever reach the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>What is the point in having the Law Reform Commission there and paying out the millions of pounds which are spent on them if, when their reports come out, they are not dealt with.  The measures they recommended are non-controversial and there would be no problem at all in bringing them to the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  They could be introduced, passed and adopted very quickly and provide a much improved legal system for the citizens with no political difficulties whatsoever.  I wish the Government would have a look at that and set aside some time, perhaps on Fridays, to deal with non-controversial law reform measures.  That would be a very valuable step for the House to take.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and the crime situation have been referred to.  There is an air of complacency abroad that all is well on this issue, but all is not well.  I comment and protest in the strongest possible terms that in the Dublin area the report shows that, in the first four months of this year there was a 9.1 per cent increase in crimes in the Dublin area.  That is an outrageous figure.  There is no mystery, what is the cause of it?  The cause is the cutbacks in the resources made available to the Garda Síochána to deal with crime. I am concerned about the greater Dublin area where there was a 9.1 per cent increase &mdash; almost a one-tenth increase <Col N="893" /> in the first four months of this year &mdash; and we do not have to look very far to find the reason for it.  There was a 1 per cent increase in Garda resources in the current year, in other words, a substantial reduction in real terms in the resources available to the Garda Síochána.  Nobody need be surprised that there is a 9.1 per cent increase in the crime rate in the Dublin area, a crime rate which even before that was totally unacceptable and was far too high.  We are looking for a reduction of 9 per cent, not an increase of 9 per cent.  The Government must see to it that they make the resources available from whatever means may be appropriate.  There are plenty of means available, through capital taxation and otherwise, to ensure that the necessary Garda resources are provided.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of senior gardaí in the outer Dublin suburbs who have informed me that they do not have the manpower and womanpower they require to cope with the problem of crime particularly in the densely populated areas in the new towns of County Dublin. They are complaining about that and they do not have the resources to tackle it.  A lot of Garda resources are wasted.  I have seen courtrooms with 20 or 30 gardaí waiting from 10.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. in the afternoon for cases to come up.  Do not tell me that some better system of dividing up the time and organising listing systems cannot be devised to ensure that there are no more than three, four, five or six gardaí waiting in a court at any one time.  The remaining 20 or 30 gardaí can go about their business and give their expertise and energies to dealing with crime which is what they are required for.</P>
    <P>The question of fines was touched on in the Minister's speech.  The Minister, on the one hand, is complaining that there are a substantial number of uncollected fines, many of them going back a number of years, amounting to many millions of pounds.  On the other hand, he has pointed out that there are staff shortages and a restraint on the numbers of people being employed in issuing these fines.  All I can say is that the Minister cannot have it both ways.  A distinction <Col N="894" /> ought to be drawn between those areas of Government which are self-financing and those areas which are not.  There is no excuse or reason why areas which are self-financing &mdash; including fine collection, Revenue and the Land Registry &mdash; should not be given the staff they require to carry out their functions in a proper manner. It would cost the Government and the taxpayers at large nothing.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why one has to make a blind rule that covers everything as though an equal situation arose when it does not.  Those areas that are self-financing should be dealt with in a special way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <P>I am obliged to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to make some observations on the proposal of the Minister in respect of the Estimates for the Department of Justice. The time allocated for debate on Estimates is taken by all Deputies in the House as an opportunity to raise issues of varying degrees of importance and of concern to them in the area of responsibility of the Minister.  It is an important time in the House and one that is attended to very carefully by all Deputies who contribute.  For that reason it is regrettable that we have taken the debate at this time today.  I respect the fact that the Minister for Justice has pressing and urgent business elsewhere and could not be available to the House today at any time.  Nonetheless, I open my remarks by saying to the Whips, or the people responsible for the ordering of business, that we should have found another time, or another day, for this debate when we could have had the Minister present.  That is no reflection on the Minister who made the opening speech or on the Minister of State who is listening to our remarks here today.  Because of the importance of this debate and its significance in the overall ordering of Dáil Business, I ask the spokespersons of the various parties to ensure that on the next occasion the Minister will be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the matters I wish to raise and touch on briefly, two are issues I have attempted unsuccessfully in the past <Col N="895" /> couple of weeks to raise on the Order of Business, the Adjournment, Question Time or otherwise.  The first is singularly urgent and pressing and, I regret, is not touched upon in the whole of the Minister's speech, either delivered or in the written text available to us.  I refer to the alarming incidence of deaths in prison. The last such very unfortunate death occurred on Monday, 13 June last when a young man of 29 years took his life in Mountjoy Prison, from all available information hanging by a piece of sheet in his cell.</P>
    <P>Various questions must be asked about that incident.  First, he was not a stranger to prison.  He had been in and out many times and going back to prison was no problem to him as far as his family were concerned.  He was an outgoing, happy person who had a short term to serve and a future ahead of him.  He had a young girlfriend who visited him on the day of his return; he had been out on compassionate release.  He went back to prison on Wednesday, 8 June, he was visited on Thursday, 9 June by his girl-friend and on Saturday, 11 June he had a discussion with his younger brother who was serving time in prison with him.  At that stage his brother observed, as was obvious to anyone, that he had a broken arm.  He had gone back to prison fully fit with no problems.  Some time between Wednesday, 8 June and Saturday, 11 June he was involved in an incident that led to his arm being broken and put in plaster of paris.  He complained to his brother at the time of having been bullied and the bullying involved prison officers. He complained he was banging on his cell door looking for medical attention and not getting it.  Early on Monday morning he was found dead.  I understand he was removed from his prison cell to the city morgue at 3 a.m. on Monday, 13 June.  I wonder why that was done at such an early hour.  I believe he was removed before the Garda Síochána were admitted or the State Pathologist had an opportunity to see the location of his death. Subsequent requests by members of his family to see the cell were refused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> All this raises very serious and important questions.  The demand I made on Monday, 13 June was that there would be a full inquiry not just of this incident &mdash; which deserves it &mdash; but because in three years we have had 13 separate incidents of death by suicide in our prisons.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to serious overcrowding and the increase in percentage numbers in prison &mdash; clearly an important factor &mdash; and problems in the prisons of administration on the one hand and coping with conditions by prisoners on the other.  The absence of the appointment of a full time medical director with overall responsibility for prison medical services has yet to be dealt with even though it was one of the short term immediate objectives and recommendations of the Whitaker report in 1985.  Simply letting this death and many others rest on individual coroners' reports and inquiries is not sufficient.  A report is carried in today's papers of a coroner's inquest in Cork yesterday where the coroner suggested as a rider to the jury that the recommendation be attached of the appointment of an overall medical director.  He saw from the evidence before him questions to be answered and issues to be tackled in regard to our prison services.  I say to the Minister that a judicial tribunal of inquiry must be appointed to look into the whole series of unfortunate deaths that have occurred, that patterns and reasons of connection must be identified and he must make recommendations that must be implemented, if anything is to be done in the area.</P>
    <P>The second issues relates to what occurred at Portlaoise Prison on 18 May last.  I touched on it briefly in the extradition statements we made earlier this week and I do not want to go back over the points I made then.  Subsequent to that debate the Minister for Defence in this House said that from his inquiry he was satisfied that the member of the armed forces on security duty on the prison who shot towards McVeigh to his mind had acted correctly but he refused to tell us why or on what grounds.  The <Col N="897" /> Prison Officers' Association are not satisfied about it and a prison officer is currently on suspension from duty pending a disciplinary inquiry.  He was ordered to pursue McVeigh but declined to do so because he was under fire and was not going to put himself at the risk of running into the cross-fire.  I demand that the Minister reinstate that man without delay.</P>
    <P>I ask him whether it is proper that an inquiry should not be established or some form of liaison take place between the three wings of security oftentimes in Portlaoise, the Army, the prison officers and the Garda.  Some form of co-ordination should take place which did not occur on that morning.  The prison officers were unaware when they were conducting the prisoner out what was likely to happen outside.  They were totally unaware that a directive was available to the armed personnel that should there be difficulty they were entitled to and should open fire.  It was an unhappy event and what transpired in court later was more unhappy.  For the sake of that one person who, for very good reasons, was reluctant to carry out the duties ordered of him I ask the Minister to put this matter right and end the confusion that surrounds it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate the view he has with regard to the previous Government's proposals about the establishment of a Garda authority.  This has not been addressed by the present Government or Minister in the course of debates on the Garda Síochána or mentioned in the address to the House this morning.  Nonetheless, it is pressing and will always rear its head when accusations arise of interference in the work and development of the services of the Garda Síochána.  On the other hand, the complaints board who have been established have serious problems of overwork.  They have been rushed with applications, I believe double what the CEO expected in their first year, and from my most recent information have not commenced any full hearings, nor have the appeals board been established to hear appeals from the decisions of the board.  That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> It has been indicated that the training recommendations of the Walsh Committee will be fully implemented and that the Minister intends in 1989 to receive over a three year period 1,000 new recruits.  Recruitment to the Garda Síochána must be ongoing on an annual basis to avail of the ready talent that comes from our schools yearly.  Templemore is not the most suitable place to invest £15 million and I agree with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on that.  It should be centrally based with proper facilities in Dublin, and Carysfort has been highlighted and pointed out as a suitable and available premises.  In any event, the Minister promises to spend £15 million on it.  That work has yet to begin and will not be completed in time to avail of the 1,000 new recruits coming in in the next three years.  That is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the prison services, I reject the proposals of the Prison Officers' Association that the Minister should recruit more staff and in that way overcome the difficulties of overtime and rostering that have been raised between the association and the Minister.  It is not and never should be a demand for increased staffing in our prisons we should be looking for but a decrease in the number of inmates.  Many services are available to the Minister that are far more cost effective and constructive, such as community area work, community services work and the Probation Service.  They should be expanded.  More resources should be put into them and more emphasis placed on non-custodial means of dealing with petty crime rather than sending them back to prison.  Clearly, the Minister must open Wheatfield without delay.  Another institution that has not been mentioned today and on which millions has been spent developing is at Dundrum.  That has been idle for upwards of five years.  When will that unit be opened for whatever purpose? That is another valve of modern new facilities available to help relieve overcrowding and any other peculiar difficulties that will need to be addressed when Wheatfield is opened.</P>
    <P>In the few moments remaining I should <Col N="899" /> like to refer the Minister to a problem that was brought to my attention in regard to the criminal injuries compensation tribunal.  This morning a solicitor in the city drew my attention to a problem that has arisen in a case in which he is involved.  An incident occurred on 25 September 1985 and following it an application was made to the tribunal within the requisite period, three months. A communication was sent to the tribunal in July 1987 and the solicitor was advised by letter in October 1987 that a decision on whether compensation would be available would be made in June or July of this year.  However, this morning a letter was received by the solicitor indicating that a decision would have to be deferred for a further 12 months.  On current standards, payment will follow 12 months later.  Consequently, what little support there is for victims &mdash; it is little enough &mdash; will not be paid for upwards of five years, based on current expenditure to compensate those entitled to it.  That is a scandal that must be redressed immediately. Money must be made available to enable that tribunal discharge all outstanding claims without delay.</P>
    <P>My final point deals with the gaming machines issue.  I understand that there will be a hearing before the High Court on Tuesday in which the gaming hall owners will be using the arguments used in the Fortuna lottery game in support of their challenge.  Machines have now been adopted so that when the gambling is finished and the gambler wants to collect the proceeds from the machine he or she will have to answer questions of skill.  The question may be, how many legs does a horse have?  The question is presented in this way, &ldquo;is it correct to say that a horse has four legs, true or false&rdquo;?  On the basis of what have been described as questions of skill those people are hopeful of reintroducing gaming machines in the areas where they are banned.</P>
    <P>It is not for us to comment on the outcome of proceedings pending but I should like to ask the Minister to keep a close eye on the outcome of that case. Should the need arise, I invite him to <Col N="900" /> introduce an amendment to the legislation to ensure that the device is not successfully employed to allow gaming back into the areas where it is not welcome. I should like to thank the Chair and I hope the Minister will respond positively.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to respond to the outrageous allegation made this morning that the role of the Attorney General was in some way politicised in connection with extradition. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Attorney General has always exercised a quasi-judicial function. Indeed, up to the time of the creation of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General decided whether or not a person should be prosecuted in connection with an offence. The Attorney General now decides whether there is sufficient evidence for a person to stand trial and that is the first time we have introduced a safeguard in connection with extradition.  In many countries there is a process under which a <i>prima facie</i> case must be established before a citizen will be extradited to the jurisdiction of another country.  Our Extradition Act, 1965, was deficient in that it did not provide a safeguard in relation to the extradition of an Irish citizen. In the last year or so there has been a considerable amount of confusion throughout the country about this issue. I have heard an allegation that the Office of the Attorney General had in some way been politicised.  That, to say the least, was a mischievous and unhelpful allegation in the present climate.  It was a disgraceful comment.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have made a tremendous contribution to Irish life.  It is not often appreciated that it is an outstanding force and one we can be proud of.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask Deputy Bruton to pay attention to the Member in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have had their difficulties such as last year <Col N="901" /> in Tipperary but all police forces have their difficulties.  We are all aware that other police forces have had to deal with corruption in their ranks but that has never occurred in the Garda Síochána. It is fair to say that they have given a tremendous service and behaved impeccably since they were established.</P>
      <P>The greatest drawback that exists in relation to court costs is the fact that we have an outdated list system.  It can take up to five years from the date a High Court action is instituted for it to be tried. Very often that means that a number of adjournments are involved.  Such adjournments, particularly in rural areas, can run for several weeks and that means that several professional witnesses, doctors, dentists, architects or engineers, will be obliged to attend on each day the case is listed and must be paid for their attendance.  I am no apologist for the Bar Council but it must be said that while such professional witnesses are paid for each day they turn up for a case, whether that case proceeds or not, the barristers and solicitors are not paid.</P>
      <P>Until such time as the list system is organised in such a way that the legal profession, and those involved in cases, can be made aware of the day their case will be heard, we will be left with high court costs.  The abolition of juries, or the two senior counsel rule, will not of themselves reduce insurance premiums. It is well known that in a given High Court action the fees and expenses of professional witnesses more often than not exceed the fees of the barristers and solicitors put together.  It is clear that some form of listing which will indicate to people the day when their case will be heard is needed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to recent events in Dublin relating to a wellknown alleged criminal.  To say the least of it it was not funny to see pictures in newspapers of that individual in what was described as Mickey Mouse attire.  This business is far too serious for the media to trivialise crime in this manner.  That is precisely what the media did in this matter.  The Garda have a duty and that duty should not be undermined by the media in this <Col N="902" /> manner.  The fact that you trivialise or make a situation such as this look funny begins to make many people think that the position is not as serious as it really is.  The facts are quite different and I believe that the media behaved irresponsibly, to say the least, in this matter.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy McCartan say that the Garda training headquarters should not be in Templemore but in Dublin.  I am not from Templemore but I object to the promotion of centralisation which Deputy McCartan seemed to suggest.  If we start to move training centres such as this to Dublin, the next proposal will be that we move the whole country to Dublin.  One-third of the population is already in Dublin.  Most of those people are from the country which, of course, is why there have been very good football teams in Dublin in the past ten years.  Many of those were of Kerry descent.</P>

      <P>There is a necessity for more staff in the Land Registry.  The Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds deal with very important matters.  Young people very often find that their mortgages are held up for interminable periods because of the delay in getting registrations completed in the Land Registry.  This applies in particular where a person is trying to get a title by long possession.  The responses from the Land Registry seem to take a considerable period of time.  If the registration is a first registration it can take from three to five years to get one's title.  It appears that the problem here is that there is not sufficient staff to deal with these matters.  I would go as far as to say that there have never been sufficient staff in the Land Registry to deal with the problems there.  This is no criticism of the people working in the Land Registry because, for the most part, they are excellent people and are very much on top of what can be an extremely difficult job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Intoxicating Liquor Bill recently introduced will be of tremendous <Col N="903" /> benefit to tourism areas.  Far from being a liberalisation or a softening up of the previous rules in relation to after hours drinking, the increase in fines is a major deterrent, to say the least.  It is a major deterrent for the publican and, without a doubt, for the customer.  The extension of the hours was required and will assist the tourist industry in a major way in tourism resorts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention the question of courthouses.  In many parts of the country there are courthouses where the public do not have an opportunity to sit down.  I know of at least one court in County Kerry where the public are obliged to stand from 11 a.m. until the court closes, very often at 5 p.m. There is room for the judge and the solicitors to sit down, but not for the person who is clearly the most agitated on the day.  This is merely symbolic of the state of these courthouses.  Some of these buildings are wrecks.  They are not just falling down, but they should be brought down.  The sooner we introduce a priority list for the repair of courthouses throughout the country the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is a pity that more time was not allocated for discussion on this very important Estimate. The Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, Deputy Barrett, has already made that point.  I know it is not a matter for the Chair &mdash; his hands are tied in the matter &mdash; but a much longer period should have been allocated.  I understand that a solicitors's Bill has been on the stocks for some time and that the purpose of that Bill is to update the present solicitors' Acts and confer further authority on the Incorporated Law Society to regulate the profession.  I urge the Minister for Justice to bring that Bill before the House at the earliest possible moment.  When the last Bill was introduced it took about 20 years from the time it was first mooted until it became an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provision that the Irish language should be qualification for the solicitors' profession.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not intend to <Col N="904" /> belittle or run down the Irish language but I want to be practical about it.  The Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Act, 1929, provides that before a person is admitted as a solicitor he shall establish, to the satisfaction of the Incorporated Law Society, through an examination, that he or she has sufficient knowledge of the language to take instructions and conduct a case through the medium thereof.  That provision was enacted when there was much more enthusiasm for reviving the Irish language than there ever has been since.  This provision demands a very high standard of knowledge of the language.  It is perhaps doubtful that any worthwhile percentage of the solicitors practising at present could discharge the obligations imposed on them by the Act I have just mentioned, but the Act is still there.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss this provision in relation to emigration, strange as that may be.  Emigration now seems to be an accepted fact of life.  I was listening to the radio recently and the newscaster, from the tone of his voice, seemed to treat as good news the fact that the emigration laws in the United States were being processed quickly and that they would be very favourable to the Irish emigrants. He seemed to be almost as pleased about that as he was about the win of the Irish team last Sunday.</P>
    <P>There are enough solicitors, if not too many solicitors &mdash; there is a surplus of solicitors &mdash; in this country and there is a ready demand for them in the United Kingdom.  When young solicitors emigrate to England they must practise as law clerks because they are not qualified as solicitors under English law.  Somebody might ask why we do not have reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom so that our qualifications may be accepted there and their qualification will be accepted here.  The stumbling block is the provision about the Irish language. We cannot accept the United Kingdom qualification unless their solicitors pass this requirement which was laid down in 1929.  That is a pity and we should have a realistic approach to this. I am told that 1992 will change all that. <Col N="905" /> Whoever will be alive to see it, 1992 will be a great year because it will apparently change everything if we take it at face value.  A realistic approach should be taken to this provision with a view to ensuring that if young solicitors have to cross the water in search of employment, they do so as qualified solicitors, with qualifications that are acceptable in the United Kingdom.  In my view, that can only be done if we have a reciprocal arrangement.</P>
    <P>Something has been said about the Land Registry.  The solicitors' profession comes in for a lot of blame for delays.  I would be the last person in the world to say that there are not delays in solicitor's offices which could be avoided, but there are some delays over which solicitors have no control.  Delays in the Land Registry is one of these areas.  The Land Registry is grossly under-staffed.  A lot of work in a solicitor's office is done through the Land Registry and depends on the speed and promptness with which they do their work.  The Land Registry staff are doing their best to give a service but they simply do not have the staff.  Strangely, they have the money to pay for staff because my information is that last year the Land Registry made a profit of £1.5 million.  Still, they do not have sufficient staff to supply the documents and process the applications lodged with them.  I urge that something be done about this.  In my opinion, at a time of high unemployment, there is no sense not employing people in an institution that is making money and can pay staff to provide a better service.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the extradition farce which recently took place here.  I believe we have a good court system and that our system of justice and the administration of justice compare very favourably with any throughout the world, but episodes like that which happened last week damage, not alone the image of our legal and court system but the image of Ireland abroad. The question is whether the district justice was right or wrong in requiring further evidence of identification of the person wanted, in other words, whether <Col N="906" /> he was right or wrong in requiring further evidence that the person wanted was the person named in the warrant.  I will not go into the rights or wrongs of that.</P>
    <P>In the case mentioned by Deputy Taylor, the Cawley case, at least there was a question of doubt and maybe the district justice was bound by the High Court case where a judgment had been given on the same topic only weeks earlier. I still think there is ground for complaints on two issues.  If the British authorities were advised by our legal people that no further evidence was required as to identification, and that advice was wrong or if there was any doubt about it, the person who gave that advice should have erred on the side of caution, because it is better to have too much evidence in court rather than not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly when it was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Even without that evidence the case could have been and should have been saved.  From what I have read about the case, it appears no application was made for an adjournment.  If it appeared that this evidence was missing or that further evidence was required, the normal thing to do was to apply for an adjournment of the case for a week or even two days.  In the case, I do not think injustice would have been done.</P>
      <P>From my experience &mdash; unless things have drastically changed in the last few years &mdash; that would have been a very normal application to make.  If a witness was not there or the evidence was not available, the normal procedure would be to ask for an adjournment.  Why was an adjournment not asked for?  I will go further: if the district justice knew he was going to dismiss the case on a technicality, it would not have been unusual for him to suggest that the case should be adjourned.  That was not done either, and the result was to damage the image of our administration of justice and the country in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan when <Col N="907" /> he expressed alarm at what I call the number of prison suicides.  That should not happen.  There have been far too many suicides over the last few years. It is very sad to see people, who are incarcerated in the custody of the State for, among other things, the protection society and who are not even protected against themselves when they are in a state of uncertain mind or when their mind is deranged.  There should be ways and means of removing from cells anything which could be used by a prisoner to inflict damage on himself.  I join Deputy McCartan and other Deputies in highlighting this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and I regret the general lack of interest shown by Deputies.  The Minister's speech encompassed a review of his Department's work and plans for the future, but I would point out that there has been very little progress towards fulfilling the promises made in last year's Estimate speech.  I will not be able to make all the points I would wish in the time available, so I will confine myself to some general comments on the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the prison service is considerable.  I would maintain that there are many people within society who should be behind bars but on the other hand I would question the wisdom of district justices imposing custodial sentences for crimes which are not considered serious.  This point was recognised some years ago when provision was made for community service orders.  District justices have not, however, paid sufficient attention to this weapon.  In the main, the option of imposing community service orders has been ignored, despite the fact that such orders would be a far better penalty than custodial sentences particularly for young offenders, and could go a long way towards preventing crime in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of money has <Col N="908" /> been allocated by the Department of Justice for educational facilities within prisons. I am aware of the need for cutbacks and financial rectitude and I would question some of the other perks available within prisons.  The recreational facilities in Portlaoise prison are a case in point. Long-term prisoners at Portlaoise have luxury facilities, while people in the town who are living in areas of high unemployment find it difficult even to survive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the incident on the public thoroughfare outside Portlaoise prison when Patrick McVeigh was released and subsequently arrested. There is serious disquiet about this incident and a number of questions have been left unanswered by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice.  I would call for a public inquiry into the manner in which the matter was handled. A member of the security forces discharged ammunition from a weapon at 8.30 a.m. on the edge of a large, busy provincial town on the main Dublin-Cork road, the busiest road in the country. There are questions to be asked about the order that was given, the manner in which the shots were fired and where the discharges ended up.  Why was no effort made by the authorities to divert traffic? How was it possible for people to gather at the gates of the prison from 6.15 a.m. until 8.30 a.m. without being impeded by the authorities?  Why was there no direct channel of communication between the prison officers and gardaí on duty and the members of the Defence Forces?  Was the senior member of staff who is now suspended told that the gentleman to be released was to be immediately rearrested? It is unfair that a particular prison officer has been made a scapegoat, especially when a foul-up is alleged.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that Mr. McVeigh was actually released and that his arrest was made on the public thoroughfare and not within the grounds of the prison.</P>
    <P>This matter can only be cleared up by a public inquiry.  Many people within my constituency are urgently requesting such an inquiry.  A number of suspected terrorists have in the past been arrested <Col N="909" /> upon their release from prison.  The recent incident is only one of many and no doubt similar incidences will occur in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of 1 per cent in the allocation for the Garda Síochána, although the amount is paltry.  I hope we will see a halt to the closure of rural Garda stations.  Over the past 18 months many such stations have closed entirely, while stations in larger towns provide a morning service only, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and for an hour on Sundays. This is not a move in the right direction. We have been told that when a Garda station is not manned there is a radio telephone communication facility known as the &ldquo;green man&rdquo;.  I hope this is the case and I would urge the Minister and the Department to ensure that members of the public are aware of the availability of this facility.  I am sure that in many areas the popular perception in the locality is that once the Garda station is closed this mechanical green man will be sought.  While obviously the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; is inferior to the blue capped man, nevertheless it is something that might be publicised a little more.</P>
    <P>There is a need for radical change in the court system.  Perhaps the Minister over the coming months would address himself to the need to review the jurisdiction of courts and perhaps consider increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court again from the sum of £2,500.  Perhaps he would also consider an increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to alleviate the delays that still exist as far as High Court actions are concerned, albeit significantly less than in the past.</P>
    <P>The family law area is still the poor relation.  The Minister and his predecessors have stated on a number of occasions that a reform of the family law courts to include family law tribunals would involve considerable expense. Maybe for 1988-89 it would not be too much to expect improvements in that area.  If family law tribunals are not to be set up, I see no reason the Department cannot see fit to have a special day for family law sittings in each town so that people in our society engaging in family <Col N="910" /> law proceedings will not have to do so in the intimidating atmosphere of a criminal court which is what is happening at present.  I do not see that there would be an extra cost on the Department of Justice in having a special family law sitting day once a month in the major District Court towns throughout our country.  It would go some way towards alleviating the adversarial and intimidating conditions that face family law litigants at present.</P>
    <P>On the question of legal aid, I regret to have to stand here and watch the demise, monthly, of the legal aid system here. Our Constitution states specifically that we should cherish the children of the nation equally but as far as legal aid is concerned there is certainly not equal access to justice.  Legal aid centres around the country are not operating half as much as they should be.  In some areas legal aid centres have closed down.  For many years Dublin and Waterford were the nearest law centres to my area.  In March 1987 it was announced, amidst considerable publicity, that a legal aid centre was to be provided and made operational in the town of Portlaoise.  I would like to know from the Minister for Justice the number of cases that centre has processed and how many working days per month it is operating.  My information is that is has almost ground to a halt and that is particularly sad.</P>
    <P>So far as the Law Reform Commission is concerned I would like to see a close relationship between it and the Department. I would like to see the Government acting and responding more quickly to the Law Reform Commission reports. The commission has done a lot of good work in the past.  I would hope that it will continue to do so and I hope that the Government does not allow too many of the Law Reform Commission reports to lie gathering dust.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by previous speakers to the extradition matter with particular regard to the unfortunate events of the past few days.  The time has come to remove the extradition applications from the remit of the District <Col N="911" /> Court entirely.  We had considerable confusion over last week's decision in Portlaoise. Earlier we had confusion over a hearing relating to the same gentleman in Portlaoise some three weeks ago when initially the District Justice granted the order and then, 20 minutes later appeared to change his mind for no apparent reason.  The seriousness of this matter demands the attention of a Circuirt Court judge.  The day has come to review this is a matter of considerable urgency.</P>
    <P>Let me just address one final question to the Minister which I hope he might refer to in his reply, that is, the question of the family mediation service.  I understand the pilot project is to be completed at the end of July 1989.  Perhaps the Minister could address his thoughts to the future of that service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make about this.  The first thing I would like to refer to is the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  There have been very long delays here.  The Minister makes the point that this service pays for itself.  It seems to me if it pays for itself it should not suffer the rigours of the Government embargo on staffing because it is obvious that additional staff taken on in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds would speed up the registration of deeds, thereby increasing the annual income of the registry and making commerce and business more efficient without costing the State an extra penny because the extra revenue would pay for the additional staff.  It seems to me to be arrant nonsense to apply an embargo of this kind to a body that could pay for its own staff from the extra revenue it would generate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice Estimate is an extremely large one.  The expenses involved are very substantial.  It is one of the biggest cost elements in the total State expenditure and it is important, in these times when we are seeking economies, to look at ways in which one could provide a more cost-effective justice service and perhaps to apply a little bit of lateral <Col N="912" /> thinking to the way in which justice is operated.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is constantly put forward as a justification for more spending on the Garda is the increase in reported crime.  I would ask the Minister if he would inquire to see if there is any correlation between the rate at which particular crimes are reported and the extent to which people are insured against those crimes.  For instance, is there a very high rate of reportage, for example, of car thefts but a relatively low rate of reportage of other thefts against which people are not insured, and does the mismatch lead to an allocation of resources that is less than optium?  For instance, a general household survey of burglary in Britain has shown that over the past ten years there was an increase in the crime rate for burglary but that this had more to do with reporting behaviour among victims in respect of insurance than it had to an actual increase in burglaries.</P>
    <P>The prison service is enormously expensive.  I remember doing a study a few years ago as to the areas of Government spending that had shown the greatest increase between 1970 and 1980.  The biggest by far was health and the second biggest of all Government spending over that decade was prisons.  We have to try to find other ways of accommodating offenders.  I am not sure of the figures but I think the cost of a prison place annually &mdash; perhaps Deputy Colley may be able to correct me on this &mdash; is somewhere in the region of £20,000 to £25,000 a year. If people could be kept out of prison and deterred from committing crimes we could do an awful lot of other things with the money we saved.</P>
    <P>Let us take as an example the system operating in New Mexico where drunk drivers, and this could apply to other petty offenders, are confined to their own homes.  One may ask how one would keep them there but in New Mexico they use a system known as the electronic bracelet, which is worked using a radio frequency. If those people are not where they are supposed to be during the relevant hours, this shows up on a central recording <Col N="913" /> device.  The equipment which they operate in New Mexico might be extremely expensive but it could hardly be more expensive than keeping these people in prison.  The way the system works is that these people are confined to their homes during the hours they are not working and this enables them to go out and earn a living for themselves and their families. In effect, they are imprisoned in their own homes during the non-working period of their day.  Can the Minister tell us whether such a system has been considered?</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to any particular case but we hear stories of people currently in prison who have large sums of money which are being used for various purposes.  It would not be unreasonable to suggest that those in prison who can afford to make a contribution towards the cost of keeping them in prison should be asked to do so.  Why should they not be asked to do so, given that it costs more to keep them in prison than in the Berkeley Court Hotel?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the proceeds of the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it appears that it is much easier to convict persons of crime and put them in jail than it is to get the proceeds back.  I am not suggesting that the money which might be available would necessarily be the proceeds of a crime because people may be independently wealthy for perfectly legitimate reasons and still commit an offence.  I am not concerning myself with the way in which that happened, legitimate or otherwise, but why should they not make some contribution towards the cost of keeping them in prison?  This may be a rather original and different approach but that is no reason why the Government should reject the suggestion. It would, of course, require legislation but, again, that would not be an obstacle if the Government decided to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are just two suggestions on the prison service.  Another suggestion which I would like to make is that, instead of <Col N="914" /> putting people in jail, they should be asked to make restitution to the victim of a crime.  I am aware that magistrates in Coventry in England operate a system whereby a sentence can be deferred to see if a private contract can be entered into between the victim of a crime and the offender under which the offender would agree over a period to make agreed restitution to the victim, financial or in kind.  If an agreement is reached the judge can take account of this in passing sentence and he can simply decide to pass no sentence or pass a deferred sentence conditional on the agreement being honoured.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to keep those people out of prison, working in the community and making restitution to the victim, rather than putting them into prison where it costs the State between £25,000 and £30,000 a year to keep them. As well as that, by the offender making some restitution to the victim, the victim would be relieved of some of the trauma victims suffer in particular now that we no longer have criminal injuries compensation, and it would give the offender a sense of expiating the offence.  Everybody would gain, the State, the victim and the offender, from such an approach and I think this suggestion should be considered actively by the Government.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the cost of the Garda Síochána, the largest element listed at £273 million.  I believe substantial savings could be made without there being any reduction in the effectiveness of the service provided.  I understand that it is the policy of the Garda Síochána to have two man patrol cars.  Obviously it costs so much to run the car but it costs a good deal more to pay the occupants. A survey was carried out in San Diego where a system of one man patrol cars was introduced.  It was demonstrated as a result that there was an 83 per cent saving in costs with minimal loss of effectiveness. Given that people can radio for help, most of the incidents a patrol car comes upon can be dealt with by adopting a commonsense approach and with the intervention of one person.  Obviously there will be occasions when that person <Col N="915" /> will need help and on those occasions a garda should be prudent in his approach. Do we need to operate a system of two man patrol cars in all cases to cope with those occasions when it is necessary to have a second person present?  What sort of savings could be obtained from adopting such an approach?  I would say fairly substantial.</P>
    <P>Legal aid is a major expense and it seems there might be a case for making it compulsory on individuals who enter into certain types of contract which are liable to end up in litigation to make provision under the terms of the contract for compulsory insurance against legal costs resulting from any dispute.  Instead of the taxpayer having to pick up the cost, an insurance fund should be established to meet the cost.  Only those entering into contracts of that kind should pay.</P>
    <P>On a more fundamental level one must ask why should it be necessary to have legal representation to get justice?  I know the legal profession will answer that question by saying that it is not necessary and that any man or woman is entitled to go into any court and plead their case but, as we know, they are not in practice really able to do so.  It seems that the role of the judge needs to be examined. Should it not be the case that the judge should not be a person sitting back and allowing advocates to make the case but rather someone with a more inquisitorial role to play, seeking the truth rather than waiting for the truth to be presented to him?  If a judge adopted such an approach, would it not obviate the need for legal representation in many cases?</P>
    <P>I know this suggestion is contrary to the adversarial system upon which our system of justice is based and is closer to the continental system but, as I have said, lateral thinking in regard to an area of expenditure as large as this is entirely justified.  The original concept of justice was that the ordinary citizen could go to some place or person to get justice such as the king who went out to meet his subjects and make decisions on any disputes.  Recently courts have become <Col N="916" /> much more arcane in their operations and now a person must have someone to speak for him.  It would seem to make sense to consider returning to the original concept of a court as a place where people go after doing certain things themselves and where a judge seeks to dispense justice rather than waiting for the facts to be presented to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First simplify the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, because a judge is supposed to understand the legislation.  A judge is trained in law so why does he need to have advocates explain it to him?  A system along the lines I suggest would require the appointment of far more judges but would it not be less expensive to appoint more judges than to spend as much as we are spending on legal aid?  I ask the question; I do not necessarily answer it.</P>
      <P>The other question I want to ask in that context is, would it not be wise for the Government as a deliberate policy &mdash; and perhaps the Minister should discuss this with the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; to seek compulsory arbitration clauses to be inserted into more private contracts so that people could settle their disputes by an agreed system of arbitration rather than have it end up in the courts: in other words, transfer the burden from the public sector, which is the courts system, to the private sector. I do not understand why that could not be done as a matter of deliberate Government policy so that the courts would deal only with cases they have to deal with. I believe that would save considerable amounts of money.  I hope the Minister in his reply to the debate will respond to some or all of the suggestions I have made, all of which are designed to help the Government reduce their overall expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of general policing, one of the points which comes up frequently at public meetings in constituencies is the deployment of man or woman power in the <Col N="917" /> Garda Síochána and the need for the optimum utilisation of the manpower that is available.  That takes into account the number of motor cycles, gardaí, ban ghardaí, patrol cars, etc.</P>
      <P>Because of expanding populations, new demands arise all the time.  It is amazing that in some densely populated but newly developed areas, such as the area in which I live, it is much easier to get a response from some emergency services than it is from others.  For instance, the fire or ambulance services can respond instantly to a distress call but &mdash; obviously this is because economies have to be made and in some cases policies are such &mdash; it is more difficult for the general public to get a response from the Garda Síochána.  There have been a number of complaints in relation to this, particularly from people in the newly expanding areas.  In many of those areas the Garda stations close down between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. or 12 midnight and 8 a.m. thus leaving some areas at the mercy of would-be hoodlums of one kind or another.  People like to think they have the security, at the end of a telephone, of being able to call on someone for assistance who will respond quickly.  However, given the resources at their disposal at present, the Garda Síochána, with the best will in the world, are not in a position to respond in all such instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give a microcosm of the position nationwide.  In the Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge area there is a population of about 25,000 or 26,000 people but after a certain time in the evening no Garda station in that area is open.  People who live in an area in the centre of the city with a similar population would not be too far away from another Garda station which would be open &mdash; but this is a serious problem in rural areas.  The patrol car from Naas which operates in that district does not cover the Leixlip area because it is in the Dublin metropolitan district.  It covers Rathcoole, Celbridge and Maynooth. This is quite a distance and if emergencies occur in Maynooth and Rathcoole at the same time this makes it very difficult for <Col N="918" /> the Garda Síochána to respond quickly to these emergencies.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the responses I have received to this matter from the Minister, the Garda Commissioner or Garda superintendents.  It should be possible to have a patrol car &mdash; and it is immaterial whether it is a one or two-person patrol car &mdash; or a patrol car and a motor cycle constantly on the road from the time the stations close until they open up again. They should be on patrol in those areas so that they can respond to calls within five minutes or ten minutes.  A response within ten minutes is not unreasonable to expect when you can get the ambulance service or fire service to respond within that time.  If there was more than a ten minute or 15 minute delay in the response of the fire brigade, people and public representatives would immediately be up in arms.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána provide an essential service and it is up to the powers that be to ensure that the mechanisation is in place whereby they can respond to calls. There is absolutely no reason why that cannot be done.  I accept the old story that there is a shortage of manpower but I am trying to point out the ways in which the manpower can be deployed so as to obtain the maximum benefit from the resources available.  I ask the Minister to take that into account and in relation to the areas I have mentioned, to provide a patrol car or motor cycle on a round-the-clock basis during the hours the stations are closed.  Despite all the replies to the contrary, this would be possible.  Before anybody replies to me and says there already is a patrol car in that area, I know there is a patrol car but it does not cover the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Garda, the Minister for Justice and previous Ministers for Justice on the success of the neighbourhood watch scheme.  That has done a great deal to bring communities and the Garda Síochána together in their efforts to defeat criminals or would-be criminals. It also creates an awareness among the young people whose parents are involved in the neighbourhood watch scheme that somebody somewhere will help them and <Col N="919" /> their neighbours in their efforts to combat crime.  There are many competing forces of a destructive nature which can influence young people, whether it is the media generally or what they read, hear and see.  There is a general contempt and disregard for property, authority and life. Some of the more recent and horrific crimes we have seen &mdash; and I will not make reference to any case in particular &mdash; are of such a nature as to give me, and I am sure everybody else, the impression that the inspiration for such did not come normally; the people who committed those crimes must have had some heinous inspirations from some quarter.  I am not going to digress into another area about these influences but I honestly believe they are not natural reactions.  They must surely be inspired by something people have read or seen in newspapers, television or radio.  We have to look at the possible consequences those influences will have in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two other points. In some instances the response to the general public brings the law into disrepute. I have dealt with some of these cases and I am sure everybody else here has done likewise.  In the case of the ordinary law abiding citizen going about his or her business, whose car happens to be in collision with a stolen car, the thieves escape and the law abiding citizen is injured and perhaps ends up in hospital. What happens in that situation?  The answer is nothing.  The insured and law abiding person, interfering with nobody, will be the victim and the perpetrator of the offence, because no claim will be lodged, will get off scot free.  I have known of one such case where the victim had six months' stay in hospital and there was no malicious injury claim because malicious intent could not be proved.  As a result, that unfortunate victim was out of work for six months and merely got sick benefit.  He was a completely innocent victim of a crime over which he had no control whatever and was comprehensively insured.  We need to be thinking about changing legislation to meet such instances.  One or two serious <Col N="920" /> instances like that are inclined to bring everything associated with the law into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I want to mention also the delay in the making of payments through the criminal injuries tribunal.  There can be very long delays after the decisions have been made and victims have to wait so long for payment that they consider themselves once more victims.  That brings people to believe that if there is justice out there, it is a long way off.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become involved in individual cases and again this is purely a layman's view.  We have heard in this House over the last number of years various reactions to judgments in the courts. Some judgments were valid and perhaps all were &mdash; I do not know.  Certainly, they caused concern and discussion, animated discussion at times.  The public need to feel that the courts will rule consistently and fairly and entirely in response to the facts.  I am quite sure that it is never the case &mdash; and I would sincerely hope that it is not &mdash; that judgments are handed down not simply on the basis of the facts presented to them.  There should be no consideration whatever given to any other influences or consequences.  The decision would then be consistent and would stand up to any scrutiny.  Political or other considerations regarding the consequences of conviction shall not at any time be taken into consideration.  I say that merely because there has been quite considerable comment, in this House and outside it, on various decisions reached in the courts, sometimes in a positive way and sometimes in a negative way.  It is not possible for decisions of the courts to be popular with the public at all times &mdash; we accept that. However, there is an absolute need for consistency, for having regard solely and wholly to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case and the general good at any time.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer, <Col N="921" /> and can do so only briefly in the short time at my disposal, to the extradition problem which faces us at present and which I regard as extremely serious.  On one day this week, seven people were murdered in Northern Ireland.  It is possible that, either now or at some time in the future, those who perpetrated those seven murders will come into this jurisdiction. It is quite possible that the Garda Síochána may be able to arrest them. There may be evidence available against them.  It is intolerable that we are not now in a position to extradite people such as those, even if the evidence is complete.</P>
      <P>Nobody has been extradited out of this jurisdiction to Britain or Northern Ireland since some time last year.  There have not been any extraditions since the latest legislation was passed in December of last year.  I do not know how we can continue in this situation, given the position that exists in Northern Ireland and the degree of violence there.  The matter will have to be addressed very seriously by the Government, by the Department of Justice.  They will have to start from the basis that they cannot accept a continuation of the present situation.  I know that it is difficult, because there are demands for protection of the rights of individuals on the one side, but there are huge demands and needs on the other side also.  I do not know how, as a civilised country, we can continue this situation indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one aspect and perhaps the most important aspect of the position on crime in the country today.  It is disappointing to read the comments of the Minister this morning on crime as if things were improving, were almost satisfactory here.  The truth of the matter is that last year there was a decrease in recorded indictable crime.  The main reason for that is that most people now have given up reporting crimes unless they are very serious.  That is the truth of the matter. The Garda Síochána Commissioner recently announced a further increase in the early part of this year in recorded crime.  That to my mind is very alarming, given that much crime is not recorded at all.  More consideration is needed than <Col N="922" /> was shown in what the Minister said this morning.  It is not the brevity of what he said, because the nature of this debate causes everybody to be brief, but it is the relative complacency concerning what is happening, in a country where virtually everybody is now living in fear and where, for elderly people in particular, it is a real nightmare.  It is hard to believe that this is the same country as the one in which 30 years ago people never locked their doors, and were never the subject of a criminal attack, burglary or breakin. If there was an incident in a particular locality, it was the talking point for months.  Nowadays, armed robberies frequently get one or two sentences in a middle page of a newspaper, where they would have got banner headlines before. It shows the State that we have got to.</P>
    <P>I welcome moves that have been made recently towards the reorganisation of the Garda Síochána, but it seems to have been done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, at the insistence of the Commissioner.  This is the sort of matter that should be the subject of a White Paper by the Government and should be debated properly. Down the years I did not favour the idea of an authority for the Garda Síochána because, having been Minister for Justice myself for a number of years, I took the view that a great deal of the work of the Garda Síochána is related to quasi-political, or allegedly political, violence and it was necessary that the Government of the day should have direct contact with the Garda in countering such activity.  I am still of that view in so far as that end of things is concerned.  I wonder if, for the more general duties of the Garda Síochána, it is not now appropriate to consider the question of a Garda Authority. The manner in which things have developed <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Garda in recent years has not been entirely successful and the Garda are the first to acknowledge that.  For that reason, a different approach might now be appropriate.</P>
    <P>While the incidence of crime is extremely worrying and needs far more attention and concern than has been exhibited by the Minister in the debate here, the most difficult and important short <Col N="923" /> term aspect of it is the lack of extradition from this country at present and the Government should be called on to make a full statement on the matter without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  In spite of the limited time, which was agreed by the Whips, Deputies managed to cover a wide area including some which are outside the scope of an Estimates debate.</P>
      <P>The Justice group of Estimates covers six Votes in all and accounts for net expenditure of approximately £367 million this year.  The biggest of the Votes is that for the Garda Síochána where there is a net provision of £273 million.  One of the most important points which must be made in relation to this Vote is that the Government have decided that 1,000 appointments should be made to the Garda Síochána over the three year period 1989 to 1991 from a recruitment competition to be held later this year. The competition will be on the basis of new entry qualifications and recruitment procedures and those recruited from the competition will undergo a radical new training programme.</P>
      <P>There is a programme for the rebuilding and refurbishment of the Garda Training Centre, Templemore, over a three year period and it is expected that the work will get under way later this year.  The programme will provide the Garda Síochána with a modern training college, as modern a college as in any police force.  It will be implemented on a phased basis so as to ensure sufficient accommodation for the proposed intake of new recruits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is also being made to enable the modern technological facilities required by the Garda to be provided. The rural part of the new national communications network is operating very efficiently in all Garda stations outside the Dublin metropolitan area and a new system for the Dublin metropolitan area is planned to come into operation later <Col N="924" /> this year.  Approximately £20 million has already been spent in this area up to the end of last year and a further £3.5 million is being provided for this year.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner made a number of proposals recently for changes in organisational procedures in the Garda Síochána and these have been approved. The establishment of a Garda advisory group was also announced recently.  All of these developments underline the fact that every effort is being made to ensure that Garda resources are deployed as effectively as possible in meeting our policy needs and that optimum use is made of all of the resources available.</P>
    <P>In this context Deputy Colley raised the question of disbandment of the Garda Task Force.  Arising from the ongoing review of Garda structures and procedures, the Garda authorities decided to replace the central crime task force based at the Dublin metropolitan area headquarters, Harcourt Square, with separate task force units in each of the five Garda divisions in the area.  The Garda authorities consider that this reorganisation will lead to a more efficient and effective use of resources.  The Garda authorities have no plans to disband the special task force based at Harcourt Square and operating throughout the State as required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and others raised the increased incidence of crime.  Crime is a topic to which the Government continue to give close attention.  The level of recorded indictable crime at the end of 1987 showed a decrease of 17 per cent over 1986.  In that period various disturbing forms of crime such as drug abuse, attacks on the elderly, joy-riding and armed raids had emerged.  This type of crime has been and is being successfully controlled and as a result the statistics for the end of 1987 indicate that the incidence of all these types of crime has dropped significantly over the past few years.  Despite this, of course, there is no room for complacency.  The fight against crime must go on.  The figures for the first four months of the year which show increases in crime in the Dublin area are being closely monitored by the <Col N="925" /> Garda authorities.  It must be pointed out that statistics over the short periods are of limited value only as indicators of long term trends and in this context it is interesting to know that the preliminary indications are that the increase in the first four months of the year is not being maintained.</P>
    <P>Another point about crime, and a very important one, is that the community must take steps to help themselves.  In this context it is very encouraging that there are now almost 600 neighbourhood watch schemes involving approximately 145,000 households throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Overtime working in the prisons has been a matter for concern as the House has been told previously.  In 1986 the cost of overtime was £13.4 million.  Two hundred extra staff were recruited in late 1986 and early in 1987 and this led to a reduction in overtime expenditure to £10.3 million.  As overtime expenditure was still too high, a further 200 extra staff were recruited and this enabled a new rostering arrangement to be introduced. On this basis the Government decided that the overtime provision for this year should be £6.3 million.</P>
    <P>This approach led to opposition by the Prison Officers' Association which culminated in a withdrawal of labour by members of the association which lasted from 16 April to 14 May of this year.  An agreement between the Minister and the association which led to the settlement of the dispute provided that there would be an independent review of working arrangements and that any claims in relation to compensation would be processed under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter in relation to prisons is the unrelenting pressure on accommodation.  Every effort has been made, however, to preserve and, where possible, improve the quality of the regimes operating at the institutions.  The quality of the accommodation is only one aspect of the regimes. Other factors are also very important and in this context specific mention should be made of the provision <Col N="926" /> for education and work training programmes in the prisons and places of detention.  The equivalent of 97 full time teachers operate in the institutions provided mainly by vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Community Services) Act, 1983, is a vital ingredient in the overall penal system and was referred to by many Deputies.  The Act provides for an alternative to imprisonment by providing that offenders can be required by the courts to perform a specified number of hours unpaid work for the benefit of the community.  Since the Act came into operation in December 1984, 2,981 orders have been made.</P>
    <P>The courts of justice also have a Vote of their own in the Justice group, as the Minister has broad responsibility for providing the services necessary to enable the courts to function effectively.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is one of the aspects of the courts which comes to mind.  Outside the Dublin area the provision and maintenance of court accommodation is vested by law in local authorities.  In Dublin it is worth noting that nine additional courtrooms have been provided within the last few years by the Office of Public Works.  It is hoped to provide four more new courtrooms in the Four Courts complex when the necessary finance becomes available.</P>
    <P>It is important where possible to streamline procedures in court offices to speed up the manner in which business is dealt with.  An important development in this area has been the replacement of special adhesive stamps in court offices by accepting direct payments of cash, cheques etc., and using franking machines and cash registers to impress documents with the record of payment.</P>
    <P>There have been delays in the hearing of High Court civil actions averaging 12 months countrywide and up to 32 months in Cork.  The President of the High Court has been taking steps to deal with delays particularly those in Cork where he has been arranging special extra sittings. Delays in hearing civil actions are not always related to court sittings and in <Col N="927" /> many instances cases are not pressed forward by legal advisers in the interests of their clients, for example, while awaiting final medical assessment of the likely long-term effects of accident injuries.  It is understood also that a substantial amount of business in Cork is taken by a relatively small number of counsel and this inevitably means delay until counsel can reach cases.  The provision in the Courts Bill, 1986, proposing the abolition of jury actions in personal injury cases should reduce the number of cases coming to the High Court and will certainly reduce the time taken to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to extradition arrangements and there have been suggested changes in procedures, some of which would involve legislative changes. At this stage I would like to remind the House that there is a provision in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, for the annual report to the House on the operation of extradition arrangements. It is the Government's intention to review the operation of extradition arrangements and report to the House as soon as may be possible after 1 January next.  That will be a comprehensive review.  To propose change now in the light of one or two cases is not necessarily the best course of action.  The review I mentioned earlier will be a much more satisfactory approach to the matter and this broader approach to the question should be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to deaths in prison.  The deaths which occur from time to time in prison are a matter of deep regret.  I understand, however, there are a number of parliamentary questions put down to the Minister for Justice on this subject for answer next week, at which time the matter can be gone into in greater detail. However, I ask the House to accept that in general the unfortunate reality is that <Col N="928" /> where an individual offender is determined to take his or her life there can be severe limits to what the prison authorities can do to prevent this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual debate on the Estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs presents a useful opportunity for us to review the broad spectrum of issues which arise in our dealings with the rest of the world. While opportunities to debate individual questions arise fairly regularly &mdash; there was a discussion of the Cecchini report on the European Community's Internal Market a few weeks ago, for example &mdash; it is only during consideration of the Estimates that there is the possibility of a general debate in which Deputies can express views on any aspect of foreign policy that concerns them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, I do not think there is much dispute in this House and in the country about our main foreign policy concerns and interests and the principles on which they are based: (1) We believe that our interests, and those of all other states, are best served by respect for the rule of law in international affairs; (2) Our membership of the European Community is of central importance in our approach to international affairs.  We are committed to the Community enterprise of economic integration and political co-operation directed towards European Union; (3) We strongly believe in and support the United Nations system; (4) We want to see a continuation of the improvement in relations between East and West, further progress in arms control and disarmament and negotiated solutions to regional conflicts; (5) We look to eventual achievement of the goal of general and complete disarmament set by the United Nations nearly 30 years ago.  We are encouraged in particular by the commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union to pursue, as the first priority, the goal of the reduction of nuclear weapons and, ultimately, their <Col N="931" /> elimination. (6) We will maintain our policy of military neutrality; (7) We uphold the values of Western liberal democracy and respect for human rights; (8) We are committed to the peaceful reunification of our country by consent; (9) We are determined to protect the interests of our citizens abroad, including our emigrants in Britain, the United States and elsewhere; (10) We are intent on maintaining conditions favourable to international trade, investment and tourism; (11) Within the limits of our resources we are determined to make a commitment in solidarity to help developing countries.</P>
    <P>It is important to have a general national understanding on the principles on which our foreign policy is based.  The day-to-day application of these principles to concrete international issues is what the conduct of foreign policy is all about. In many cases the foreign policy issues we face will be looked at in the context of the close co-operation with our neighbours and partners which Community membership and participation in European political co-operation entail.</P>
    <P>In the case of those many foreign policy questions that fall to be considered in the first instance in the framework of our Community membership, our foreign policy aims are achieved, in co-operation with our partners, through the effective taking into account of the Irish point of view in the determination of Community policy or of Twelve joint positions in EPC.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the main issues requiring our attention at the moment.  The problems of Northern Ireland have remained at the forefront of the Government's concern over the past year.  The atrocities of the past year, and indeed of the past few days in Northern Ireland, have deeply saddened all of us. The Taoiseach has spoken for all of us in his condemnation of these terrible atrocities. Our most heartfelt sympathy goes to the family and friends of all the victims of violence.  It goes without saying that the bomb and the bullet can have no part to play in the achievement of political <Col N="932" /> progress.  We condemn violence unequivocally; it is not only horrific in itself but counter-productive in terms of the stated aims of its perpetrators.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that a lasting solution to the Northern Ireland problem, leading to peace, reconciliation and stability, can only be found through the Anglo-Irish framework established in 1980.  The Government are using in full &mdash; actively and imaginatively &mdash; the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985 to bring about reforms and improvements in Northern Ireland.  The Intergovernmental Conference has been meeting regularly throughout the year and the Joint Secretariat in Belfast continues to operate fully, performing effectively the functions it was designed to accomplish.</P>
    <P>In implementing the agreement the Government have sought to broaden the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference while continuing to press for progress on those items which had dominated the attention of the Conference from the outset.  We have forthrightly put forward views and proposals as provided for in the agreement.</P>
    <P>Equal access to job opportunities may be regarded as the touchstone of a fair society.  It is arguable that, more than any other single factor, it was the long experience of discrimination in employment which added most to the alienation of Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  That legacy of discrimination can only be overcome by a vigorous and activist approach which will hold realistic promise of change.  An essential part of such an approach is a clear commitment to affirmative action programmes specifically designed to ensure a more equitable distribution of job opportunities.  The fair employment issue has been among those which has been most actively on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference since this Government assumed office.</P>
    <P>The Government continue to encourage the stimulation of North-South economic co-operation especially for projects <Col N="933" /> likely to increase employment possibilities in both parts of Ireland.  The International Fund for Ireland has a special role to play in this area and we are grateful to all those who contribute to it.  I am pleased to be able to report, following detailed discussions in the Conference, on a recent joint Irish and British approach to the European Community and we are gratified by indications that the Community may now be favourably disposed to contributing to the fund.</P>
    <P>Tackling the economic wasteland of west Belfast is, in our view, another priority for the Intergovernmental Conference. In our contacts with the British side, through the Conference and the Secretariat, we continue to insist on the need to ensure that the security forces and the administration of justice in Northern Ireland are such that they can command the support of both communities. We are encouraged in this regard by the emphasis in the Joint Statement of the Intergovernmental Conference of 25 March on giving a new impetus to the programme of work in this area.  That impetus is recognised by both Governments as especially required in the light of the dreadful events which occurred in the early part of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government in particular attached priority to finding measures which will deal effectively with the problems which arise from everyday contact between the ordinary person and the security forces in Northern Ireland.  The most frequent complaints which come to my Department from Nationalists in Northern Ireland concern harassment by members of the security forces.  This is a difficult and longstanding issue and one not easy to resolve but I can assure the House that the Government are using the Anglo-Irish Conference and Secretariat to the fulliest extent in our efforts to control the problem and to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Extradition according to law is an important element in the efforts of civilised countries to ensure their security. Issues which arose concerning arrangements by the British authorities to meet the provisions of present Irish legislation <Col N="934" /> have now been resolved.  Despite the difficulties which arose in a specific case earlier this week, I believe that extradition requests will now be dealt with in a manner which contributes to security while protecting the legitimate rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In the security area, we have two priority objectives: (1) the protection of the security of this State and (2) the protection, to the utmost of our ability, of the interests and security of all the people of Northern Ireland.  It is clearly in the interest of all of us living on this island that security co-operation be as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish relationship is both a very close and a very complex one.  The state of the relationship at any given time tends to be very significantly influenced by developments in Northern Ireland but there is also a series of issues which may be primarily regarded as East-West rather than North-South ones.  Among the issues affecting Anglo-Irish relations over the past year were the Birmingham Six trial and its outcome, continuing concern about the Guildford Four and Maguire cases, and the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  We will continue our discussions with the British authorities on the Birmingham Six and other cases as well as on the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>In an eloquent and perceptive speech on Anglo-Irish relations on 22 April, Sir Geoffrey Howe spoke of the multiple ties which bind our two countries and of the responsibility of both Governments to tackle the very difficult problems which confront them.  It is our wish also that Anglo-Irish relations should be as positive and productive as possible and that the problems which arise in the relationship should be resolved in a timely and constructive way.</P>
    <P>Currently there are signs that a process of reflection and re-examination of issues is going on at many levels and in many quarters within Northern Ireland.  I am hopeful that this process will lead to positive and concrete results.  For the Government's part, the Taoiseach has made clear on a number of occasions that <Col N="935" /> he is willing to engage in dialogue with any parties which have renounced the use of violence and that, in particular, he would welcome hearing at first hand, and without preconditions, the views of the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Irish abroad may I congratulate the Irish team and their management most sincerely on their achievements in the European Championship. In particular I might congratulate the 15,000 or so Irish supporters whose conduct has been a credit to themselves and their country.  These merry, jovial ambassadors and their enthusiasm have enhanced the good name of Ireland. I wish them well for the remainder of the championship.</P>
    <P>My Department have been active on the emigration issue over the past year, in particular in the United States where the status of many of our recent emigrants is unclear or uncertain.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy has two main strands.  In the first place we have encouraged moves for legislative reform in the United States.  The Government are hopeful that reforms will be enacted this year that will improve substantially the situation of those of our citizens who wish to live and work legally in the United States.</P>
    <P>The second major strand in our policy is in the welfare and advisory area.  I can say that the harnessing of the dedicated expertise and energies of the local immigration groups in the United States is already bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>The Government have also been active in monitoring emigration trends in other areas of importance to our young emigrants. A grant of IR£250,000 was made available to the DÍON Committee at the embassy in London to supplement the efforts being made by various social welfare bodies working among our emigrants in Britain which is, as before, attracting most of those who emigrate.  Our embassies in Canberra and Ottawa and in the countries of the EC are also monitoring the position in their countries and providing advice to newly arrived immigrants when called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Following his return from the United States in April, the Taoiseach decided to improve the co-ordination of the activities of Departments here at home involved in emigration matters.  A special interdepartmental committee has been set up under the aegis of my Department to do this.</P>
    <P>With the coming into force of the Single European Act on 1 July 1987 the Community took as significant a step forward as has been taken on any occasion since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.  After the Single European Act came into force attention focused mainly on the Commission proposals &mdash; the Delors Plan aptly entitled <i>Making a success of the Single Act</i>&mdash; which represented the blueprint for the future economic regeneration of the Community. It was this package of proposals which provided the focus for the lengthy and complex negotiations which culminated in agreement at the Brussels European Council on 11-12 February last.</P>
    <P>This outcome of the European Council reflects acceptance by our Community partners of the need to ensure that progress towards the internal market is paralleled by progress on cohesion.</P>
    <P>The European Council agreed an overall expansion of the Community's funding sufficient to implement the new policies introduced by the Single Act.  The Community's finances have thus been placed on a sound footing in the medium term. The budgetary wrangles which have hamstrung the implementation of agreed policies in recent years can be put behind us.  The recent adoption of a Community Budget for 1988 is a welcome indication of progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>The agreement on agriculture stabilisers reached at the European Council represents the culmination of the process or reform of the common agricultural policy which has been underway for some years.  While the process of reform has entailed painful decisions for most member states, including Ireland it was necessary in order to ensure that the long-term viability of the common agricultural policy was secured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> The decisions taken at the European Council provide a stable and adequately-financed basis for the effective future operation of the CAP.  The Government are determined that the CAP should continue to serve its fundamental objectives, in particular the safeguarding of family farm incomes.  We will actively seek to ensure that it also provides a suitable framework for the further development of agriculture and of our food industry.</P>
    <P>Community assistance to the less developed regions is of major importance to Ireland.  This assistance has made an important contribution to the economic and social development of the country and to the living standards of our people. It has helped us in our continuing efforts to close the gap between Ireland and the more prosperous member states.</P>
    <P>Community commitment to narrowing that gap was given a new impetus in the Single European Act in that the policy of cohesion for the first time was given Treaty status.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Commission's proposals, particularly those relating to reform of the Structural Funds, was endorsed at the Brussels council where it was decided that the resources available for the three structural funds would increase from £7 billion ECUs in 1987 to £14 billion ECUs in 1993.  The European Council in an effort to concentrate the funds where they are most needed. decided that the contribution to the less developed regions would be doubled by 1992 and that a special effort would be made for the least prosperous regions which will include Ireland.  This outcome was welcomed by Ireland as we had been one of the strongest supporters of the Commission's proposals in the negotiations leading up to the European Council.</P>
    <P>Negotiations continue on the precise details of the new arrangements and are now virtually completed.  We have, at all stages during the negotiations, made every effort to ensure that adequate funding will be available during the coming years to make an effective contribution to the structural needs of our economy.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the major reform of its <Col N="938" /> finances and on the adequate funding of the Structural Funds has provided the Community with the necessary framework within which to concentrate its attention on the great objective of the completion of the internal market by 1992, as outlined in the Single Act.  The Government are fully committed to the achievement of this objective.  We look forward to the increased opportunities it will bring for Irish business.</P>
    <P>In working for the early achievement of the internal market, with all the benefits it involves, the Government are also aware of the challenges it will create for Irish industry.  The Government are thus working to soften the impact of the Commission's proposals on sectors of particular sensitivity for Ireland such as the insurance industry and tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>More broadly, the Government are concerned to ensure also that the achievement of the Single Market does not result in disproportionate gains for the more prosperous central regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to ensure that Irish business is fully aware of both the opportunities and the challenges posed by the impending completion of the interal market.  To that end.  The Government will be launching, on 4 July, a major public information and awareness campaign, designed to make both business and the general public aware of the implications of 1992.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging aspects of our economic performance last year has been the growth of our exports.  They exceeded £1 billion in value for the first time ever, and the likelihood is that that performance will be bettered this year.  In fact, the surplus generated on our exports has been instrumental in our achieving a surplus in the balance of payments for the first time since 1967.  This has been a remarkable achievement.  The Government's strategy is calculated to enable our exporters to maintain the momentum they have built up and to develop their markets abroad.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the Single European Act came into force on 1 July last <Col N="939" /> year, following ratification by all the member states.  It has not changed the process of European political co-operation or the nature of our involvement in it.  In EPC, the member states, operating on the basis of consensus, exchange information, consult together and seek to adopt common positions and to take joint action in the foreign policy field.</P>
    <P>The promotion of a vigorous and effective United Nations is a central element in the Government's foreign policy.  We welcome recent indications of a renewed interest on the part of UN member states in seeing the organisation fulfil its role as the main international forum where the most important issues are addressed.  We have seen recently in the case of Afghanistan the positive results achieved by patient diplomacy conducted under United Nations auspices.  In today's interdependent world many of the problems which we face transcend national frontiers and can only be resolved by effective action on a global basis.  The work of the United Nations in such diverse areas as the resolution of regional conflicts, the fight against hunger in Africa, the protection of our environment and the battle against disease, indicates the absolute need for a universal institution through which our individual efforts can be channelled and co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>One of the most important services provided by the United Nations to the international community is that rendered by the UN peace-keeping and observer forces.  Ireland has a proud record of service in this area.  It is a tribute to the standing of this country in the peace-keeping area, and in particular to the high esteem in which our Defence Forces are held within the UN, that we have been invited to participate in the new military inspection teams established on foot of the Geneva agreement concerning Afghanistan.  Five Irish officers are at present serving as part of this force in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We have no doubt that they will carry out their duties with their customary skill and professionalism. We pay tribute also to Irish personnel serving with other UN forces: <Col N="940" /> in Cyprus, on the India-Pakistan border and at various places in the Middle East, especially those with UNIFIL, our main contribution to UN peace-keeping at present.</P>
    <P>We remain concerned at the conditions under which UNIFIL is obliged to operate. The Government have made clear at the United Nations, as well as in direct contacts with the Israeli authorities, the importance they attach to ensuring a more satisfactory position in this area and the unacceptability of any action which threatens the safety of our personnel.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to press for an improvement in the financial position of UNIFIL.  We look to all member states to honour their obligations in regard to the financing of this Force and thereby ensure that it can continue to play its important role.</P>
    <P>The past year has witnessed significant and welcome developments in the relationship between the superpowers. We are encouraged by the comprehensive nature of the dialogue now taking place and the opportunities it offers for the easing of tensions and the enhancement of international peace and security.  The Government also attach great importance to the achievement of progress in disarmament at the multilateral level.  As an earnest of the importance we attach to the role of the UN in this area, Ireland's keynote speech to the current third special session on disarmament of the United Nations General Assembly currently taking place in New York was delivered by the Taoiseach.  My Department have overall responsibility for co-ordination of official development assistance (ODA).</P>
    <P>The largest item is the bilateral aid fund which provides for the central Bilateral Assistance Programme (BAP) run by my Department.  The allocation of £10 million for 1988 represents a significant reduction on the 1987 level of £14 million, a reduction necessitated by Ireland's current budgetary difficulties which have forced the Government to embark on a programme of wide-ranging expenditure <Col N="941" /> cuts affecting all sectors and Departments. However, I can assure this House that the full range of programmes operated under the BAP has been maintained into 1988, albeit at a lower level of activity given the scaling down of resources.  A basic programme of assistance to our priority and partner countries is being maintained and all of our commitments are being met.</P>
    <P>Having visited Tanzania and Lesotho earlier this year I can confirm the standing of our Bilateral Aid Programme as a highly valued, high quality and effective mode of assistance.  Despite the small scale of our aid we are making a serious impact on the problems our projects are designed to tackle.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main issues facing this country in the realm of foreign policy and the positions which the Government have taken and will continue to take on these issues.  At a time of interesting developments on the world scene, many of which are, thankfully promising for the world as a whole, Ireland's foreign policy is one that is based on firm principles. We can make our contribution to internationl harmony by ensuring that the management of our international relations continues to be guided by these principles.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to repeat a point I made last year, a point that virtually every speaker has made in this House during Estimates debates for as long as I have been involved in Foreign Affairs, that is, the inadequacy of the discussions on foreign affairs that we have in Dáil Éireann.  We are now going to debate the Estimate, which in terms of the overall budget is quite small but in terms of its importance to this country and its future is extremely large, in a matter of three hours with a contribution from each speaker of only 15 minutes, which is totally inadequate and will allow us only to focus on the priorities as we see them and indeed only to block in headlines rather than tease out in detail what should be done in the area of foreign affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I will repeat as politely as I can, a request that has been made and a promise given by the Government for a foreign affairs all-party committee of this House. We are now coming to the end of the fourth term during which this Government have been in power and my understanding is that in each of those terms the Government Whip has promised the Fine Gael Whip that such a committee would be set up.  The Minister is as good at addition as I am and it would be entirely inappropriate if this House were to set up such a committee against the wishes of the Government and without the participation of the Government party.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>As the Minister laid out in his speech, a whole range of subjects need to be discussed here.  The area of ODA will be dealt with by Deputy Griffin on behalf of Fine Gael so I will not deal with it now. In approaching the question of spending Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs we have to be ever mindful of the great urgency of putting in a proper planned structured programme to meet Ireland's obligations in the area of foreign policy, in particular with regard to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in congratulating the Irish at present in Germany for the way they have honoured Ireland by their behaviour both on and off the field and by their skill and courage on the field.</P>
    <P>The past year has been a very difficult and controversial one in terms of Anglo-Irish relations.  Nonetheless, there is a solid track record of achievements under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, achievements which have had a direct and positive effect on the lives of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  I still have to say frequently in broadcasts and interviews that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is not an end in itself but a framework in which progress and change can be achieved.  As the date for the review of the workings of the agreement approaches&mdash;and again because of the way it is sometimes misrepresented, I will clarify that it is the workings of the agreement which are up for review under <Col N="943" /> Article 11 &mdash; the Government must set out an agenda for the next phase of that progress.  There must be clear targets and objectives and a demonstrated will to continue on the process of securing peace, justice and stability in all parts of this island.  I would be less than honest if I said I was pleased with the Government's performance in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months I have on a number of occasions drawn attention to the fact that the Government are not pursuing the Anglo-Irish Agreement with either the tenacity or the determination with which it should be pursued. Consequently, the Government find themselves at frequent intervals, as they are today, going in to the conference on the defensive.  Today for the umpteenth time in the past 18 months they are going in on the defensive.  Instead of discussing today what the reported agenda says is a programme for West Belfast and fair employment, something which has been trotted out at every conference meeting and which has been dealt with quite well, the conference will discuss something else.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be any discussion taking place today under Article 7 on the administration of justice and confidence in the security forces.  Why is that? Why is it that three months have elapsed since there was a meeting of the conference from 25 March to 17 June? Because the Government have not been insisting on regular meetings of the conference they now find themselves going into a conference where they will have to defend what happened in the courts here earlier this week about extradition and where they will have to reiterate their commitment, as they should, but not in defence of anything to do with security or the bombing that took place yesterday. This is entirely unnecessary and it is the Government's fault for not actively insisting on another meeting.  The Minister promised on 25 March that there would be another meeting of the conference in a very short time, or words to that effect. From 25 March to 17 June on anybody's <Col N="944" /> calendar is not a very short time, and on something as sensitive and important as Anglo-Irish relations and the North is concerned, it does not show a commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The thought is being allowed to develop in the minds of a number of people &mdash; including mine &mdash; that, as Deputy Blaney said, the Anglo-Irish Agreement is being allowed to wither away.  I hope that is not true.  I certainly do not think it is true of the present Minister or the Minister here today and I hope they will not allow it to wither away because of their neglect.</P>
    <P>An immediate priority must be the improvement of the economic situation of both communities in Northern Ireland. The international fund, to which the Minister referred in his speech, which was established under the agreement, has begun the process of identifying areas of potential, economic growth and employment. The Government must adopt a more vigorous approach to using this source of revenue effectively.  As the Minister said &mdash; and I agree absolutely with him &mdash; social justice in Ireland must be pursued on the economic front as well as through the legislative process.  That is right and I have no hesitation in applauding that sentiment.</P>
    <P>Reform of the judicial process, in addition to the improvement of the administration of justice, lies at the heart of transforming society in the North.  This cannot be set aside or forgotten.  It is not adequate to have a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in which Article 7 &mdash; as far as I know and I am only judging by press reports as I have no other source of information &mdash; is not on the agenda today: the reform of the administration of justice and the confidence-building measures between the nationalist community and the security forces.  The Irish Government must ensure that judicial reform is a priority in discussions and in any review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  For instance, the matter of three judge courts must be restored to the agenda.  I do not want to go back over the long history of this subject except to say that, under the <Col N="945" /> Anglo-Irish Agreement, both Governments solemnly agreed that it was important that those being governed should have confidence in the administration of justice and in the security forces.  That is clearly absent in the North.  That should be exercising the minds of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their officials on a daily basis.  They should compare notes on how they can achieve that end.  Indeed, under the agreement they are obliged to set about it on a daily basis.  For that reason it was proposed that the one judge Diplock Courts should be replaced by two judge Diplock Courts.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this Government are married to the idea, exclusive of all other ideas, or getting confidence in the administration of justice.  The British Government have turned it down.  They are obliged under the agreement to do something about confidence in the administration of justice in the North just as are the Dublin Government.  If they do not like that idea, they must come forward with another.  Because they have failed to come forward with any other ideas with regard to building confidence in the administration of justice, the Irish Government should immediately, today, put it on the agenda and say: &ldquo;If you have no other ideas, let us look again at the possibility of changing the one judge Diplock Courts and three judge Diplock Courts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The west Belfast package has been trotted out over the past few days as being of major importance because west Belfast needs special attention.  It needs the attention of the Secretariat, the Conference and of the two Governments for very obvious reasons.  Are we seriously saying that a £10 million package spread over a number of years &mdash; these are the reports I have been getting but I hope when the Minister stands up to reply that I will be proved wrong about this &mdash; will cure the ills of west Belfast? It is only a drop in the ocean and it will go absolutely nowhere.  If the Governments are serious about changing the social, the security and the total environment of west Belfast they must realise it needs <Col N="946" /> investment like that almost every month. That is obviously an exaggeration but it needs a demonstration by the British Government that they are serious about it and would need to contribute more than £500,000 or £750,000 which is what is talked about at present.</P>
    <P>In Anglo-Irish relations during the past 12 months dialogue has become the in-phrase or the catchword.  This is a very good thing because everybody in this House would agree that talk-talk is better than war-war.  Any talks, even talks about talks, must be undertaken in good faith and have the potential for progress. It is not enough to think that the talks are an end in themselves.  I would like to caution the Government in this regard and to remind them of the words which T.S. Elliot gave to Thomas a' Becket in his play about the last temptation being the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reason.  Talk itself is not enough.  It must lead somewhere.  It must lead towards peace, new political structures, trust, a structure that in the future will benefit both communities in the North, both traditions on this island and both islands in the European Community.</P>
    <P>An intergovernmental parliamentary tier is a useful mechanism for enhancing co-operation in the Anglo-Irish sphere.  I am glad that slow but steady progress has been made in that regard in the past 12 months.  I hope that when we come to debate the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs next year, we will have something solid on which to report in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes I have left I should like to turn to the European Community and a few other topics which I do not want to skip.  The Minister devoted a good portion of his speech to the European Community but did not mention the most important thing which happened this week, the blocking by our Minister of the programme for the new financing of the Community in the future.  He did not say why he did this, what is the latest position and what will happen.  Is what is being proposed by the Commission so out of line with what we want that we <Col N="947" /> had to take this extreme measure of blocking it?  Why was this not spotted before last Tuesday?  How did it happen that the European Commission were allowed to put forward a package that would be out of step or not over-lapping with what was agreed when the Single European Act was negotiated, that there would have to be cohesion and that the finances of the Community had to be guaranteed so that those on the periphery &mdash; those less well off &mdash; would not be allowed to fall behind in the benefits that will accrue to the Community by the completion of the internal market by 1992.</P>
    <P>The European Community is an essential aspect of our foreign policy considerations. Since the passing of the Act last year the Government have been woefully inadequate in the preparations for completing the single internal market for 1992.  The Minister said there will be a meeting on 4 July.  I would like to thank the Taoiseach for the invitation he sent me to take part in that meeting which I am very happy to accept.  But 4 July 1988 is 12 months after 1 July 1987 when the Single European Act came into effect, that is, 12 months late and there has been no action in the meantime from this Government, even though at the last count 80, and maybe at this stage 100, of the Directives in regard to 1992 have been processed and have gone through.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to discuss the American election and the opportunity it gives us at this stage to influence both candidates as regards the illegal immigrants in America and to have on their agenda something to stop the continued supply of funds that are bringing about the kind of violence we saw the day before yesterday.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not time to complete some of the other points I wanted to make in regard to this very important Estimate.  I appeal again to the Minister to take note of what I have said about the committee on foreign affairs.  I am sure he will readily agree to doing it but I hope that agreement will extend beyond merely the courtesy of an agreement in <Col N="948" /> this regard to providing further time for a debate on foreign affairs in this House.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Barry, I think it a very sad reflection on the Dáil which has been acknowledged by the Minister of State in his opening speech, that this is the only opportunity, the one opportunity in the year, we get to discuss real matters of foreign policy, developments in the world at large and Ireland's place as a so-called neutral country in these developments.  Developments in the world today, especially in the disarmament area, have huge implications for this country in the coming years.  Yet we are allocated only 15 minutes today, 15 minutes in the year, to discuss such matters.  There have been only three foreign affairs debates since I entered the Dáil 15 months ago and it is notable that all of the issues, the peace plan on Nicaragua, the position of out-of-status immigrants in the US and the Birmingham Six motion this week were organised and debated mainly in the Opposition's time in the House.  The only other debate of a foreign affairs nature, the debate on the Cecchini report, the cost benefit analysis of the implications of the single internal market by 1992, was requested by the Opposition and we dedicated one day to it.  The only time I am aware of that the Government set aside in the schedule of business for a debate of a foreign affairs nature was the 20 minutes or so allocated to the party leaders every year to report back on EC Heads of Government meetings. This is not good enough.  Again this year I support the call by Deputy Barry for the setting up of a foreign affairs committee in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in a changing world where the Russian Leader, Mr. Gorbachev, is involved in discussions of an historic nature on disarmament with President Reagan.  The nature and balance of power in the EC is undergoing a major revision even this year, with Austria talking of entering the EC, increasing relations between the EC and the COMECON countries in circumstances in which we are destined to implement 350 or so proposals for the <Col N="949" /> completion of the internal market by 1992.  Yet, we never discuss these fundamental matters in this House.  The superpowers are now dealing directly with one another.  Yet we never mention the sensitive area of defence security developments in the world today.  I believe we are afraid to because of our so-called traditional policy of neutrality which is the most important instrument of our foreign policy.  Successive Irish Governments in claiming to support the policy of neutrality are supporting a doctrine which has no clear set of guidelines. We have never debated it.</P>
    <P>I will give a crowning example of this doctrine of neutrality and how we implement it.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, told the Dáil during the debate on the Single European Bill last year that he as the Leader of our Government implementing that so-called traditional policy of neutrality had occasion, at European Heads of Government meetings, to listen to after-dinner discussions about decisions which might lead to disarmament.  Deputy FitzGerald then stated: &ldquo;By a convention which we have all established together in this House I remain silent during these discussions.&rdquo; I pose this question to the House today: if we were really a neutral country should a Taoiseach have to sit down during discussions on disarmament in Europe?  No, I believe he should not, because a truly neutral country with its neutrality well thought out would have clear views on nuclear warfare and the desirability of disarmament.  We have never debated or even thought out seriously our foreign relations in so far as they impinge on defence questions.  We do not even have a foreign affairs committee in the House.  Simplistically we say we are neutral and want to leave it at that.  Vaguely we hope if there is a war that someone will protect us and, if pressed to say who, we feel it might suit the US to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not widely appreciated that in international law a state loses its neutral status if it cannot take steps to prevent a belligerent using it to the detriment of <Col N="950" /> another belligerent.  Sweden and Switzerland know this and as real neutrals have always acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>I turn now to European political co-operation and some issues I would not have an opportunity to raise in the course of debate in this House during the year. We spend no time at all in this House debating defence security developments in the world.  We have laudable statements every few years from the Taoiseach of the day, the most recent one made by the Taoiseach in the US in the past few weeks, with which I agree, but we never discuss the whole area of security and defence as it impinges on this country's foreign policy.  Yet, the French, the British and the Germans are taking steps both bilaterally with one another and through the Western European Union to differentiate their security concerns from those of the US.  A major motivating factor has been their concern at the limited peripheral role permitted to them in the current arms reduction talks between the two power blocs and in particular the deployment of missiles within Europe.  Similarly, the other members of NATO &mdash; Norway, Spain, Portugal, Greece and, most recently, Denmark&mdash;which fought its recent general election on the question of admitting NATO warships with nuclear weapons on board into its ports &mdash; are demonstrating a greater willingness to assert their independence whether it be over the presence of nuclear armed vessels or air bases.</P>
    <P>As the superpowers deal directly with one another and US political interests diverge from those of the western European nations, the inherent tensions within the European alliance &mdash; I use that word loosely &mdash; are becoming more apparent.  On the one hand direct talks between the Soviets and the Americans fuel European apprehensions that their interests would be overlooked and that ultimately they might be left to their own resources while, on the other hand, there is the fear that increased tension between the superpowers will find them entrapped in procedures up to and including the use of force without every having had an <Col N="951" /> opportunity to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  This oscillation between fears of abandonment and fears of entrapment is making some of our European partners more open to new ideas.  Yet we never discuss them.  EC member countries are already beginning to think of a common defence policy in Europe.  By the year 2,000 we will be posed this question by our economic allies in Europe: where do we stand? We as a country have not prepared the answer.  We have never debated the defence neutrality question seriously.</P>
    <P>Three options seem to exist for this country and I would like a national debate to start on this issue.  The first option is to continue talking about our so-called traditional policy of neutrality while never defining it.  Let us consider the real options.  Should we assert now a coherent positive policy of neutrality in all international fora in which we as a country are involved and accept the serious financial consequences of that or should we be prepared to play our part, as Governments in the past have indicated we should, in all aspects of an increasingly integrated Europe which could in the future involve the evolution of a common defence policy without economic allies in the European Community? If we are to contemplate doing so, we should try to be in a position to establish the parameters of a Europe that could be non-nuclear.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my disappointment at the views of the Minister of State on the harmonisation of VAT come the internal market in 1992.  I was disappointed that the Minister simply stated that he is working to sustain the impact of VAT harmonisation.  The Minister has not yet spelled out the full Government policy on this issue.  As Deputy Barry said, it is disappointing that the Government only committed themselves to conducting an information and awareness campaign on the huge implications of 1992 as a direct result of Dáil pressure from the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We deplore the hesitant leadership on the part of the Government which has since last year's referendum allowed public perception of the single market in 1992 to become synonymous with VAT on food and clothes.  In my view that is wrong and uninformed.  The EC single market programme, which is well under way involving more than 350 proposals at the last count, is overwhelmingly in the interests of this country. However, the Government allowed the debate to go down a negative cul-de-sac of &ldquo;Can we afford the VAT proposals on food and clothes or can we not?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The harmonisation of VAT does not mean a single VAT rate throughout the Community.  Two VAT ranges are provided for in the 1992 proposals, a lower band of 4 per cent to 9 per cent for necessities, such as foodstuffs, and a standard rate band of between 14 per cent and 19 per cent for other goods and service. Therefore, it should be possible for the Government without undue revenue implications, and a bit of forward planning which we have not seen, to bring food in at the lower 4 per cent rate and compensate the poorest sections of the community for that imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that so great is the Government's &mdash; and their predecessors' &mdash; dependence on indirect taxation that the revenue objection to the full harmonisation of VAT is a serious one. However, there is a way to meet this target.  There are three options that could be pursued by the Government.  First, Ireland could accept the revenue reductions and trim public expenditure accordingly but, given the Government's present financial position, that, in practice, is not a real option.  Secondly, other resources of revenue could be tapped. That is an obvious and practical solution. The third option is to appeal to the Community for a transfer of funds to tide us through the transition stage.  The new EC structural funds could be used in part for this purpose.  The fact that Ireland's heavy reliance on indirect taxation is <Col N="953" /> recognised explicitly by the White Paper suggests that this would not seem an unreasonable request but, at most, such funding would only partly compensate for the revenue loss.</P>
    <P>Our party believe that a combination of the three options, accepting some reduction in expenditure and, therefore, revenue, tapping other tax sources and receiving some transfers from the Community, allied to a very gradual and phased approach towards harmonisation could and can be pushed through by the Government if they are determined and committed to the concept of tax reform within the EC.  The fundamental view of our party is that no derogation, no further exemption, is necessary.  The Government should use the deadline of 1992 to provide the ideal externally imposed opportunity to introduce the long overdue reform of our tax system.</P>
    <P>In the time remaining I should like to touch on a number of other issues.  There has been a cut in our aid programme to the Third World of more than 25 per cent in the last year.  Those cuts are deplorable even given our financial constraints. Third World aid is one of the last that should be cut because of the commitment of our people to poorer parts of the world.  In the Estimate the Department have picked on the overseas aid offices in Lusaka and Kenya and on the Agency for Personal Services Overseas. Instead of homing in on the weak we could have joined the EC office in Brussels to the embassy in Belgium, for example.  We did not close some of the consular offices in the US or join the two embassies in Italy, the embassy in the Vatican and the embassy in the Italian state.  I believe that is an option presented by the Minister for Finance in the Estimates to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will be interested to hear the reaction of Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to that proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe so.  We did not join together the Council of Europe <Col N="954" /> representation to the embassy in Luxembourg. We did none of those things but took up the soft option which was to reduce overseas aid.</P>
      <P>The final point I should like to deal with concerns Israel.  For 40 years we have avoided having a resident ambassador from Israel in this country or establishing a embassy in Israel.  When Israel was standing high in the world we would not do so and when Israel's reputation sank we had a ready excuse, as we have now.  However, at the same time we have a PLO office operating in Dublin which it is almost assuming the status of an embassy.  It is time we considered giving Israel access to this country.  I deplore the activities of the Israeli Government in recent months but if we are an open neutral country, we should allow representatives from that country to put their views here particularly when we have the PLO, a terrorist organisation akin to the IRA, fully represented here.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Government's attitude to Libya.  It has been the most curious part of our foreign policy in the last year. Despite mounting hard evidence that Libya gives arms and money to the IRA, we refuse to break off diplomatic relations with that country.  Spurious reasons are produced in support of this as we learned in response to various questions put to the Minister in recent months.  Because of the huge arms shipments to this country, the time has come to break off diplomatic relations with Libya.  I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil have been so cautious about making such a move.</P>
      <P>I did not raise the issue of Northern Ireland today because I was anxious to mention some issues that I cannot deal with during the course of the usual debates in the House.  However, I hope that a full Anglo-Irish Summit will be arranged between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher before the review of the Agreement at the end of the year.  The side meetings at meetings of Heads of State are not sufficient.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Members who have complained <Col N="955" /> about the inadequate amount of time allocated to a debate on Foreign Affairs. I welcome the conversion to the idea of a foreign policy committee in the House. For those interested in the evolution of this concept I recommend that they read my description of the history of such a committee contained in the spring edition of <i>Studies</i>.  It is contained on pages 63 to 67.  In that issue I gave a description of the struggle for a foreign policy committee. When I was a Member of the Seanad on 10 December 1986 I moved a proposal to establish a foreign policy committee with 11 stated terms of reference.  On that occasion I was assured by the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad that they supported the idea.  It was opposed by the then Leader of the Fine Gael group in the Seanad, Senator Dooge.  In the event, Fianna Fáil abstained on the vote and the Fine Gael group defeated my proposal.  I make that statement to set the record straight.</P>
      <P>I should like to set the record straight in terms of fairness.  Professor Dooge, one of our most distinguished Ministers for Foreign Affairs, argued against my proposal not on a matter of principle but because of the terms of reference I put forward for it.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to the proceedings in the other House but <i>Studies</i>, spring 1988, which thankfully has recorded the total events and the history of this committee.  I want to refer to what happened in this House on the same issue.  I have asked the Taoiseach again and again would he agree to the establishment of a committee on foreign affairs.  I almost became a caricature as I stood up on the Order of Business and asked him if he had given consideration to the idea.  I was told it was under consideration, deep consideration, further consideration.  One day I asked him whether it was in deep refrigeration or in fermentation in his brain.  The Taoiseach <Col N="956" /> and the Government were against a committee on foreign policy.</P>
      <P>I want to be very clear about the implications of this because I have not the time to go into it in detail.  I make a case for an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy to take up some of the issues raised by the immediately preceding speaker, Deputy Kennedy, so that we will have an informed debate about neutrality.  After listening to Deputy Kennedy I am quite confused as to where the Progressive Democrats stand on the issue of neutrality. I am also confused as to where a number of other Deputies in this House stand on that issue.  There has been a long debate on neutrality within my own party.  There is a published policy paper. The debate began not with de Valera, as many people suggest, but with Tom Johnson who wrote about neutrality.  We have, in our policy document, stated what we mean by principles of positive neutrality.</P>

      <P>We could debate this issue if we had a foreign policy committee. It would be very much better than the kind of confused extra-parliamentary comment that is going on.  Neutrality is not a concept simply about a European dimension.  I very much object to and resent the suggestion that we should take on some kind of under labourer conception of ourselves, that to play our part in a European sense makes a case for making swipes at a badly defined set of actions that have been justified in the name of neutrality.  Neutrality is a wider concept addressed to a world of mutual interdependency, a world threatened by war, in which there have been significant developments in this year alone towards disarmament and in which there has been a great imbalance of resources in favour of armaments and against the removal <Col N="957" /> of necessary resources from the tasks of development and, perhaps most important of all, the displacement of resources from addressing the great issues of world malnutrition and world hunger.  It is within that dimension and framework that you have to address neutrality and not within a narrower framework in terms of geopolitics, time, history or scale.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I have a very limited time.  There is agreement in this House among a large number of Deputies for the setting up of a foreign policy committee to debate this and other issues and yet it has not been set up.  I assert that one of the reasons for this is the confusion that has existed for many decades in this country between two quite separate things &mdash; the informed intellectual and often brilliant practice of diplomacy and the establishment of foreign policy.  We have been elected to this House to establish, develop, maintain and give voice to principles of foreign policy.  The Government of the day are most of the time, as the Minister of State has said and as Deputy Barry has often said, operating within a consensus on many of the great issues of principle.  There are other areas where there are real differences and equally there are areas where policy needs to be evolved.  One example is European political co-operation.  Now there is the issue of the consequences of the integrated market, the balancing issue of cohesion and so on.  These are issues on which elected representatives should establish principles of policy.  What elected representatives sometimes get are reports on part of the diplomatic activities.  This is an old argument, as old as the history of diplomacy, and it goes back to Talleyrand's victory over the elective process in terms of diplomatic practice.  We need a foreign policy committee to give democratic expression to the will of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead, we are going in the other direction.  I have time to give only a fleeting example.  Far from establishing a foreign policy committee, we have disbanded the committee which dealt with aid and assistance.  I was a member <Col N="958" /> of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Co-operation.  It was a forum to which Third World groups and development workers came.  In its day it established a charter of practice.  It addressed the issue of moral and adequate development, North-South relations, the transfer of technology &mdash; I could go on.  That committee was one of the first casualties in the demolition of the committee system.  We are going away from having fora in which we can debate foreign policy rather than establishing accountability.  Thus we have a very limited opportunity for debate in this House.</P>
    <P>We have 15 minutes each to discuss what role Ireland might play in the world in relation to the great issues that I mentioned &mdash; disarmament, development and world hunger &mdash; to discuss Europe, the zones in areas of conflict, be they in the Middle East or Central America, and to discuss the developments in the relationships between the super-powers. It is an insult to the intelligence that we have only that short time to discuss Northern Ireland and the horrific events that are taking place there, to discuss emigration, the details of European policy, the immoral behaviour of the South African Government, to discuss Kampuchea and the question that has been raised about the recent Arab-Israeli conflict.  It is ridiculous.  In the minutes I have available to me I can comment on just a few topics.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Northern Ireland.  There is need for a rediscovering or, some might say, an injection into the process of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. There must be revulsion among people of any humanity to the most appalling murders that we have seen since we last debated Northern Ireland in this House. Other shadows have been cast over the Northern Ireland dimension in our foreign affairs policy in the last 12 months. One of the most important of these has been the British attitude.  There is evidence that yet again there is an enormous difficulty in the British mind in accepting some basic fundamentals of sovereign <Col N="959" /> independence, in accepting Ireland's attitudes and opinions in relation to the resolution of the difficulties in Northern Ireland and in accepting that it is dealing with a sovereign equal.  There is also the elevation of issues of security to the exclusion of other issues such as the lost legitimacy of the Northern Ireland State and the impact of this on the communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was very interested &mdash; again the time indicates that I must be brief &mdash; in the Minister's reference to emigration.  He referred to two aspects in particular: welfare in general and the specific position of the Irish illegal emigrants in the United States.  I will put a straight question to him now because a question of mine was transferred from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday. Will he establish a commission on emigration? Because of the volume of emigration, there was a commission on emigration from 1948-51.  It has been estimated that 35,000 people will emigrate between now and 1992 and 25,000 between 1992 and the year 2000.  Those are the projected figures from the Economic and Social Research Institute. There is a tacit acceptance in this country that we must rerun the old experience of the fifties, that we must not question the economic and social structures that expel people through involuntary emigration. People are driving us daft in this House talking about the near consensus that is established about economic policy.  Let us be perfectly clear.  Those economic policies are not creating jobs even in conditions of falling interest rates, high exports and low inflation.</P>
    <P>There is the issue of welfare but here is my question: if the Minister is sincere about the welfare of emigrants, will he do what other European countries do? Will he give a vote to the emigrants? Will he arrange voting facilities for those citizens who involuntarily emigrate?</P>

      <P>On the question of the European Communities, we had a day's debate on what is an indirect report on the cost of non-completion of the market, but we have not had an opportunity in this House to look at and compare two competing logics &mdash; the logic of completing an internal market and, at the same time, achieving principles of cohesion.  Many people welcomed the specific formal references to regional policy in the Single European Act.  There was a debate on this and people welcomed the commitment to increasing funds, but this House has not been told what precise mechanisms are being used to develop the regional cohesion aspect in such a way that it can mitigate the effects which are unfavourable to this country in terms of completion of the market.</P>
      <P>I am tired of hearing that preparations are well advanced in relation to making submissions.  What will be the sub-regional procedures?  How will projects be submitted?  What will be the Commission's requirements?  We are left in the dark in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time left, may I raise another issue, that is the way we have had to race things through this House.  At the end of last year I submitted a request to the Department of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Nicaraguan Government for a very specific kind of aid &mdash; a country free of foot and mouth disease asking another country without foot and mouth disease to give 3,500 tonnes of dried powered milk to assist children and elderly people.  I was told this would come up in the context of a meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the Community and the Foreign Ministers of Central America <Col N="961" /> on 29 February and 1 March 1988.  It did indeed come up, and there was a regional community commitment to increase aid to the region.  I have heard nothing since despite serveral questions asked in the Dáil, sometimes of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and sometimes of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  One does not know where one stands on such a minor matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister&mdash;in the likely event of there being executions in South Africa&mdash;to reconsider his position in relation to sanctions and to stop the scandal of Ireland importing coal from a Government who are behaving in such an immoral way.</P>

      <P>As other speakers have said, the time allocated for this topic is totally inadequate.  It might be reasonable if we were allocated this amount of time every week to discuss foreign affairs because the area is developing so fast it is impossible to deal adequately with even one issue in the time available.  I support fully the call by Deputy Michael Higgins for a foreign <Col N="962" /> policy committee to be established urgently so that the areas of concern in foreign affairs, which have been referred to and which no doubt will be referred to again can be adequately discussed and dealt with.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up initially the remark made by Deputy Kennedy with regard to the PLO, linking them with the Provisional IRA.  This is a superficial linking of the two groups because there is no similarity between them whatsoever. The PLO are a national organisation representative of the Palestinian people and are recognised as such, not just by the United Nations and most non-aligned countries but also by a number of our EC partners.  The Provisional IRA are a small, sectarian, bigoted organisation which represent virtually nobody except a small group who for a variety of reasons find themselves, in some cases, trapped into support for them and others, because they misunderstand totally what are the objectives of the Provisional IRA either in the long term or the short term.</P>
      <P>In relation specifically to the Israeli and Palestinian question, it is my conviction that the Government should introduce diplomatic and economic sanctions against the Israeli Government to protest at that country's continued killing of Palestinian civilians and other abuses of human rights in the Israeli occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Almost 350 Palestinian civilians have been killed since late November-early December last year, a little over six months.  It is estimated that something like 10,000 civilians have been wounded by Israeli security forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relatively strong stand taken by the Irish Government on Israeli activities so far was more than welcome and certainly went further than any previous administration on this issue.  Certainly the comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Calleary, in the Dáil on 26 May last when he condemned &ldquo;the harsh and repressive response of the Israeli forces&rdquo; were particularly appropriate and he was, I believe, speaking for the vast majority of Irish people when he <Col N="963" /> referred to the &ldquo;the widespread sense of outrage at the harsh measures adopted by Israel&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has visited the occupied territory, as a representative of The Workers' Party and other Members of the Oireachtas did recently, could not but be shocked by the outrageous actions of the Israeli security forces which resulted in the death of almost 350 Palestinian civilians and wounding almost 10,000 more.  What is striking is the similarities we see on our television screens almost daily between what is happening in Soweto and other South African townships and what is happening in those occupied areas.  The parallels between life for blacks under South African rule and for Palestinians under Israeli rule are shocking.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the question of Northern Ireland.  The building of democracy within Northern Ireland and the central role of the people of Northern Ireland in that process remain the essential priorty for the promotion of peace and political progress not just in Northern Ireland but on this island as a whole. Devolved democratic structures, an effective and comprehensive Bill of Rights, a united community effort to defeat sectarian terror and massive investment in jobs have been and must be the consistent foundation of a programme for peace and progress in the North.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that there has been too much talk about the future of Northern Ireland in terms which ignore or undervalue the democratic rights of the people there.  I would be pleased to see a genuine improvement in relationships between the Government of Britain and the Government of the Republic of Ireland, an end to the stubbornness, stupidity and hostility which have acted against the interests of the people of both countries. Northern Ireland's problems will not be solved by some deal between the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister.  No lasting or effective solution will be found by going behind the backs or over the heads of the people within Northern <Col N="964" /> Ireland who must live with the consequences of any such deals.</P>
    <P>In the absence of democratic political structures in Northern Ireland, the evil of sectarian terror has flourished.  This is the overriding threat to democracy, not just in Northern Ireland but in this island as a whole.  We cannot simply join in the chorus of regret when some new atrocity moves the public conscience and then settle back to do nothing until the next opportunity for breast-beating occurs. We need to root out the attitudes which have sustained the Provisionals in society for 20 years.  We need a firm consensus among the democratic forces throughout Ireland which will maintain an implacable hostility to terror and all those who would support or excuse it.  The Provisionals are conducting a savage sectarian campaign of murder against all those who oppose them and, as long as this is the case, there can be no place for them in any democratic political dialogue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to the on-going discussions taking place between the SDLP and Provisionals.  It is appalling, in the aftermath of the massacre in Lisburn and the murder of another man by the Provisionals in Belfast in the past few days, that the SDLP can announce yet again that they intend to continue their talks with the Provisional IRA.  We in The Workers' Party have consistently condemned these talks but the public must be confused by the apparent reluctance of the other parties to condemn them.  There is a lot of ambivalence and ambiguity on the part of spokespersons on radio and television when asked about their attitude to these talks.  The general reply is: &ldquo;If John Hume thinks it is okay, who are we to criticise John Hume?&rdquo; While I and my party have the height of respect for John Hume, we believe that he is wrong in carrying on these talks with the Provisional IRA when they have consistently stated, as recently as the day before yesterday, that they intend to continue their campaign of terror in Northern Ireland and elsewhere until their objectives are achieved.</P>
    <P>These talks are a total waste of time and are lending the Provisionals a false <Col N="965" /> legitimacy.  I call on Mr. Hume to end those talks and I would urge other parties in this House to do likewise.  He is doing nothing for the advancement of peace, progress and democracy in Northern Ireland while maintaining these talks.  I do not deny that he entered into the talks in an effort to wean the Provisionals away from their campaign of terror but the evidence of the past six months shows that it is a false hope and that he is not dealing with people who are prepared to listen to logic and reason in relation to peace and progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Clearly there has been very great progress internationally in regard to nuclear disarmament, especially during the past 12 months when advances have been made by the President of the United States and the Leader of the Soviet Union.  There is a great feeling of hope among people that nuclear weapons can be eliminated.  They are now talking about eliminating rather than reducing them.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to have read the contribution which the Taoiseach made to the United Nations on the question of disarmament.  It was a very positive contribution which represented the feelings of most people in this country with regard to nuclear weapons.  If I can find no other basis for agreement with the Taoiseach on a whole range of issues ranging from Northern Ireland to the economy, I am happy to be able to say that I welcome his United Nations contribution. I hope he will urge his Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to actively pursue the three specific proposals he made.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that the Taoiseach emphasised, as did the Minister of State today, the need to place the United Nations at the centre stage internationally in dealing with relations between countries as well as various regional problems and conflicts.  In recent years The Workers' Party have been aware of a shift away from placing the UN at the centre of international affairs and an attempt to pull back into the European Community as the focus and centre of our activity.  We also felt that there was <Col N="966" /> a drift towards allowing the European political co-operation process to dictate what our position should be internationally. I am happy to say that I detect a slight improvement in the situation, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>In regard to South Africa, we should as a matter of urgency impose a ban on the importation of coal from that country. There is no doubt that we are dealing with a rotten administration which thrives on the repression of human beings. Anything we can do to end that administration should be done.</P>
    <P>I would also emphasise the urgent need for an Oireachtas foreign policy committee. A lot of common ground could be found between the parties, although obviously there would be major areas of difference.  The only realistic forum for the kind of debate which is needed on foreign policy is a foreign policy committee.  I urge the Minister of State to impress upon the Government the need for such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fine Gael spokesman on Overseas Development Aid, I will confine my remarks specifically to Vote 41, International Co-operation.  This debate on the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation has been in progress for approximately an hour and a half, but during this short period of time a total of 2,275 children in the Third World have died of malnutrition and preventable diseases.  It is acknowledged by all Third World agencies that at least 25 children die every minute of every hour of every day.  These horrific figures exclude adults and teenagers.  I am not recalling that for the sake of sensationalism.  I believe those statistics might concentrate our minds and help us to debate the International Co-operation Vote against the stark reality of the real world, the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this awful background of human misery and suffering, the Estimates introduced by the Minister of State here today make appalling reading. They are indicative of the Government's <Col N="967" /> attitude to the plight of the weakest and most vulnerable section of humanity. Above all else it proves, if proof were necessary, the Government's uncaring and totally insensitive approach to this major human problem.  The Minister is so very rich in rhetoric but so poor in delivering the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>Let us put aside the verbiage and look at what the Minister and his Government have to offer us today.  They are announcing, although couched in parliamentary language, that the ODA for 1988 is to be reduced by a massive £14 million, from over £45 million in 1987 when we left office to a little over £31 million now, a cut of over 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, the cuts go much deeper when one realises that, as members of the UN and EC, we are obligated to give about half of this aid.  So the reduction in what we contribute voluntarily is a massive 40 per cent or thereabouts. I maintain that this is callously disproportionate to the 6 per cent overall reduction in total Exchequer expenditure in 1988.  In fact, the total expenditure on the Foreign Affairs Vote was increased by approximately 3 per cent.  I should have thought and hoped that all Departments would be asked to bear an equal share of these cutbacks but the soft option of the overseas development aid has been more severely hit.  The Minister and his Minister of State must stand accused of not defending their portfolios more successfully and vigorously around the Cabinet table against the preying hands of their more grasping colleagues.</P>
    <P>That £14 million cut impinges mostly on what is known as our bilateral aid fund.  The bilateral aid fund is concentrated mainly on four sub-Saharan African countries three of which, Lesotho, Tanzania and Sudan, are on the United Nations list of the 40 least developed countries in the world.  The fourth priority country, Zambia, has applied to be reclassified into this group. The least developed countries, including the four I mentioned, have a <i>per capita</i> gross national product of roughly 200 American dollars per annum compared <Col N="968" /> to Ireland's 5,000 American dollars. Indeed, in Ethiopia it is reckoned that it is as low as 110 American dollars, and we compare that with the almighty high figure in the USA of 16,690 American dollars per annum.  So we are talking about taking essential aid from the poorest of the poor.</P>
    <P>We are told that the disaster relief provision is to be reduced by over half a million to a derisory, token £1,000 and this against a background of rumours and stories of further disasters in Ethiopia, in Mozambique and in the Sudan.  Again, when we remember that Ireland is reckoned to be the 27th richest nation in the world, voluntary contributions to the UN agencies such as the UN Childrens' Fund and the UN High Commission for Refugees are to be cut also by £1.2 million a 67 per cent cutback.  This affects the basics of food and health care which in the poorest countries can be matters of life and death and this, again, is against a background of 25 children dying every minute of every hour.</P>
    <P>A pledge was given as recently as March 1986 to contribute £1.5 million to the world food programme, and that now is not to be honoured.  The world food programme provides food aid in famine situations so this is also an issue of life and death in Ethiopia, in the Sudan and in Mozambique.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN is to have its contribution reduced by almost £0.5 million, a further massive 90 per cent cut.</P>
    <P>This year's aid, as a percentage of gross national product, will fall from 0.25 per cent in 1987 to 0.185 per cent in 1988, the lowest it has been since 1981.  Fine Gael, as the major partner in the previous Government, accepted the UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product and were progressing steadily towards that figure.  On leaving office it was at 0.25 per cent but it is at a miserable 0.185 per cent.  There is widespread alarm and fear among all those agencies involved in the Third World that if cuts of the same magnitude are imposed again in 1989 it will mean the death-knell of our bilateral aid programme.  Ireland's overseas development aid has been built up painstakingly <Col N="969" /> over the past 13 years with the sweat and toil of missionaries and volunteer workers.  Indeed, it would be tragic if all that expertise, that fund of knowledge and know-how, all those magnificent projects undertaken, were to cease.</P>
    <P>I want to get a categorical assurance today from the Minister present that when the Estimates for 1989 are being discussed he will tell his colleagues to keep their hands off the ODA Vote, that it is sacrosanct, that it has already borne more than its share of cutbacks, that there is nothing else to cut bar the very programme itself.  Indeed, I would urge the Minister to restore the aid to the level it was at when he took office and set it on its way again towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product.</P>
    <P>While speaking in Brussels recently the Minister of State was quoted as saying that further cutbacks could be made, and in his response to me in the Adjournment debate of 1 June he was far from convincing and left a lot of doubt about the Government's commitment to ODA. During the course of the debate he also tried unsuccessfully to equate a small reduction in the Coalition Government's last budget to the massive £14 million cut in this year's Estimate.  He also tried to persuade the House that the same level of projects, of operations, of works can be maintained despite the huge and massive cut of £14 millon.  No one believes that and I doubt if the Minister himself believes it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of Fine Gael in regard to ODA is beyond reproach. When in Government we appointed, for the first time, a Minister of State <Col N="970" /> with responsibility for development co-operation and I doubt if the present Minister of State will be held in the same high regard as his immediate predecessors, Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and George Birmingham. I speak, of course, on a political level.  I know the Minister in his personal capacity is a man of the highest integrity.  I am referring to this political portfolio.  If and when the present Minister matches these contributions to ODA, financial or otherwise, I will willingly withdraw my criticism.</P>
      <P>These cuts could not have come at a worse time for the Third World.  Despite all of the international assistance, things have got progressively and steadily worse since the early eighties.  Serious economic problems have arisen on the continent of Africa, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of the chronic shortage of resources available for development, another more acute problem has arisen. Much of Africa has suffered a serious fall in trading income as the prices of its export commodities declined sharply.  Its burden of debt, already high in relation to its means, increased as it resorted to more borrowing, much of it on marketrelated terms which it was ill-fitted to service.  We are told that the total indebtedness of the Third World now amounts to a massive US$1.19 trillion and that US$30 billion are being syphoned and squeezed out of the Third World each year to service this enormous debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister would have had the full support of the Irish people in any increase.  Famine relief has always found a ready and sympathetic response from us.  I suppose the great hungers of the mid 1840s still lurk in our subconsciousness.  We too were colonised for over 700 years, and like the 500 million under-privileged people in today's Third World, we experienced deprivation, hunger and victimisation. A survey carried out in 1985 indicated that 83 per cent of Irish people supported the principle that the Government should at least maintain, if not increase, their contribution to the Third World.  The response of the Irish people to Bob Geldof's Band Aid and Live Aid <Col N="971" /> is legendary and their magnificent contributions to Trócaire, Concern, Goal and a host of other worth while relief agencies leaves one in no doubt about where their hearts lie.  It would be churlish of me to omit reference to the many missionaries of all denominations, nuns, brothers, and the splendid voluntary workers of APSO who are prepared to give a more lasting and tangible proof of their Christian belief in the brotherhood of man.</P>
    <P>Against this background of moral support the Government are missing out on the role the Irish people would wish them to play on the world stage.  Ireland could act as the beacon light for the Third World and could highlight in all international fora the scandal of the Third World.  It could continuously prick the consciousness of the First World and keep reminding them of their obligations and responsibilities to the poorest of the poor and the weakest of the weak, but all of that is now irrevocably lost.  Our moral platform has been abandoned because we too took the thirty shillings and sold our Christian heritage for £14 million.  I know that some of this aid will be restored as soon as economic circumstances permit, but how many more children will die in the meantime and how many Ethiopian or Sudanese mothers with babes at breast will expire in the desert sands before economic circumstances improve?  I ask the Minister to consider these thoughts before he and his Cabinet colleagues axe further ODA as he is literally playing with life and death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concentrate on three issues: first, the general conduct of foreign affairs in the context of the involvement of this House; secondly, neutrality; thirdly, Anglo-Irish relations.  If I have time I would like to say a few words on human rights in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday evening this House passed unanimously, certainly without dissent, a resolution in regard to Irish prisoners in British prisons.  The terms of that resolution asked the House to call <Col N="972" /> on the British Government to carry out a certain range of acts in regard to these prisoners.  It is not all that long since another resolution of the House was made and before that again demands were made that the Government should articulate an insistence on the closing of nuclear power stations across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a political meal out of either of these issues.  I merely want to raise the question of whether it is wise for this House to articulate demands on foreign Governments?  I think it would jeopardise the dignity of this House if we were to put this House in a position or indeed for a Government to put themselves in a position where they articulated demands in fairly peremptory language to a foreign Government, demands which we may be 100 per cent justified in making, but which that foreign Government may very easily ignore.  I do not think we should give foreign Governments the opportunity to either say, think or act as though they were thinking; &ldquo;Let those people over there in Dublin go and take a running jump for themselves&rdquo;. There must be more diplomatic, and perhaps more effective, ways of doing international business than articulating resolutions in this House no matter how praiseworthy the contents or objectives of the resolutions.  I would not like to see the House doing that because, if we find in one month's time that the House has been ignored, it is only the House and its, own dignity that will suffer.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to deal with is an issue which I never forget to mention in the debate on this Estimate, that is, the question of neutrality.  I had intended to say a few words only on this issue and probably would have done so were it not for what I heard Deputy Higgins saying. He seems to think that it is unworthy of us to adopt what I believe he called &mdash; if I misheard him, I am sorry &mdash; an underlabourer, whatever that is, conception of defensive co-operation.  He thought it was not good enough for us to say that we all should pull our weight with all of the others out there and put our shoulders to the wheel.  I think it is better to be an <Col N="973" /> under-labourer than to be a sponger and that is the condition to which this State has reduced itself during the years and from which it now shows signs of being about to shake itself free.</P>
    <P>I go this distance with Deputy Higgins. I am not 100 per cent clear in my mind what Deputy Kennedy's and her party's attitude is towards neutrality but I know she is willing to reopen the question and that is what I also want.  I suspect that there are many sleepers in this House among all parties who also share this view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be reopened by way of a debate in a committee, which is what Deputy Higgins wants, but by way of leadership being given by that body in this State to which responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs is entrusted by the Constitution under Article 29, namely, the Government.  We are tired of having debates in this country. We always read in the newspapers of notice being given that there is going to be a long hot summer of debate on this issue or a Minister calling for a long winter of debate on the issue.  What we want is leadership.</P>
      <P>If I may appeal to the gentlemen opposite, Mr. de Valera understood this and did not call for debates on this or that.  He was scarcely willing, by all accounts, to tolerate debates even in his own Cabinet but he most certainly delivered leadership whether it was for the better or the worse, particularly in the conduct of foreign affairs when he thought it was proper to do so.  He did not set up committees to discuss this or that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins cited former Senator Johnson who was a very respected Irish politician and statesman who gave this State very important assistance in the twenties in getting its democracy off the ground and keeping it there.  My God, he is being cited 60 years on by Deputy Higgins as having articulated on behalf of the Labour Party a policy of neutrality. There were people in the Fine Gael Party <Col N="974" /> who also did so, not least General Mulcahy and nobody will accuse him of being a pacific man and keeping to his own fireside.  The reason Irish voices back in the twenties advocated neutrality was that they had the recent example under their eyes of the First World War when millions and millions of people were fed like cannon-fodder into the trenches and died in seas of mud for no discernible ideological reason on either side.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of Irish people of both colours, orange and green, left their bones in Flanders and in northern France and the Labour Party's military wing in those days, the Citizen Army, paraded under a banner saying, &ldquo;We fight for neither King nor Kaiser&rdquo;.  I believe had I been around, I would have cheerfully stood beneath such a banner because from the point of view of the Irish there was nothing to choose between King and Kaiser but that does not mean that there is never going to be anything to choose between two sides confronting each other.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke here I had the great privilege of not only having Deputy Higgins listening to me but also Deputy Mac Giolla and I asked them the following question: &ldquo;Are you or are you not in favour of our having been neutral in the conflict of 1939 to 1945?&rdquo; That seems to be an unanswerable dilemma in which to place people who prate about our traditional policy of neutrality. If they support, retrospectively, the policy of neutrality in 1939-45, if they are willing to say the State was right to stay out of the Second World War, then the ladies and gentlemen over on the left have no business to be going on about fascism because what they say amounts to this &mdash; if they had been in a position to influence events 40 years ago they would not have lifted one finger to push down fascism.  Yet they prate about it now when the world has been made safe for them to do so by the sacrifice of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard that before from the Deputy.  If, on the other hand, they were honest enough to admit they would have been willing to join that particular conflict and that fascism was something unique, it would seem to be a very handy scapegoat for everybody.  It is a sort of agreed point of reference, it is the parading of wickedness, no question of its unexampled wickedness but it is not the only wicked thing in the world.  If they had been willing to say &ldquo;Very well, we would have made an exception in favour of fighting against fascism and we would have lifted a finger against that as many people in their tradition fought against Franco in Spain&rdquo; then they would be saying &mdash; and this, of course, is the truth &mdash; the issue of neutrality is not one you can permanently decide as a matter of standing State policy.  It requires to be decided like any other question on which a man or a group of people have to decide, namely, in the conditions of the time and in response to the challenges of the time.</P>
      <P>When I put up that dilemma to them, I am sorry to say that Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Higgins departed from the courtesy which the House had shown them when they were speaking and they both attempted to shout me down.  They turned scarlet with indignation, the two of them were like a pair of turkeys gobbling at me with fury that I had put them in this unanswerable dilemma.  They did not want to say they would have fought fascism and they could not say they would not have fought it.  That is the plain fact of the matter.  Somebody who is in favour of and advocates what they call a traditional policy of neutrality must take up a position about that episode, the only time since the foundation of this State when it mattered a damn to anybody what this State did and whether we fought or stayed on the sideline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to Anglo-Irish relations. They have been very much in the headlines during the past few days and I do not want to say anything in my small role here which would make things any worse. Having, in a couple of different media, tried to defend this State against the <Col N="976" /> indignation which the British always exhibit when anything goes wrong here or whenever anything here works in any way different from the way it worked in the days when there was a British Executive sitting in Dublin Castle, I said it is a separate State, it runs things in its own way and there probably is a different ethos and a different manner of doing things, even in the courts, from what the English are used to in their country.  But it is not fair &mdash; and I must say this in order to redress the balance &mdash; to look on the British as being in the grip of some quite out-of-place post-colonial feeling of exasperation towards us.</P>
    <P>It is not altogether the case that they feel this country should jump to their bidding or do what they expect of it simply because they do not recognise this as an independent country.  There is also another element in it, and in fairness to the British I think I have to say this. They are not willing, no matter how many tricolours we fly or how we parade our independence, to entirely regard us as foreigners.  That can be an amiable feeling in them and is not in any way sinister, even though it causes irritation here.  Let me say again, to try to do them justice and to lower the temperature in so far as a speech from a backbencher can do so, that they show in their practice, not just in words, that they do not regard us entirely as foreigners.  Their diplomatic missions in the many countries in the world in which we have no representation are automatically and regularly, as a matter of course, at the disposal of Irish citizens who are not within reach of one of our missions.  They have always permitted citizens of the Irish Republic, uniquely among foreign nationals, to exercise the vote in their parliamentary elections. This ought to be mentioned because whenever a unit of the British air force flies over Hackballscross or somewhere like that hoping to spot some terrorist activity, there are wild cries from the guff Republicans over there in the House about infringements of our air space and our national sovereignty. These people forget that our air sea rescue service, at any rate to the extent <Col N="977" /> that it is not possible to provide such a service with the limited resources of the Irish Air Corps, are effectively provided by the British for nothing.  I asked a question about this a few months ago and quite accidentally &mdash; I had no collusion with him of any kind &mdash; my friend, Deputy Enda Kenny, also asked a question on this.  It emerged from the answer to these questions that in the past five years &mdash; I am giving the House very rough figures &mdash; British helicopters and other forms of aircraft flew rescue missions over Irish territory no fewer than 300 times for nothing.  No charge was accepted for that humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not grovel with bogus gratitude towards another state which does for me what I certainly would do for it if the conditions were reversed, but I think these are practical forms of neighbourliness that it is unseemly for us to lose sight of.  It would be well for us to keep them in our minds in trying to understand the British attitude towards this country, which exasperates me fully as much as it does other ladies and gentlemen in this House.  I know that country quite well and, annoying though it may be to say it, they regard us as something special and not in the way they regard other foreigners.  I believe many of them genuinely feel hurt and offended when they get from this country treatment which to them is incomprehensible.  I say that merely to try to redress the balance because we frequently say too much about one another in the opposite sense.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to human rights elsewhere. I know the first thing I am going to say will not please my friends on the far Left.  I do not understand why South Africa should be a unique pariah in the world.  I say that although it is obviously a regime that is detestable.  I would not wish to live there and I would solemnly warn anyone belonging to me who lived there to get out of it.  If I did live there I would try to make sure that at least my children left and lived somewhere else.  I do not think they are going to be running that kind of a state in ten or 20 years time &mdash; one cannot put a date on it but it <Col N="978" /> cannot go on the way it is at present.  I accept all that but I do not understand why that makes it a unique pariah among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>The world is full of detestable regimes, with some of whom we have diplomatic relations.  So far as I can see Iraq and Iran are murdering each others young men by the hundreds for nothing.  Both of these countries have detestable autocracies. They do not know what the rule of law is all about.  One can disappear into a prison there and never be heard of again just because of one's faith.  I do not see any difference between one's faith and one's colour.  It is true that one cannot change one's colour but ought I change my faith or opinions in order to be acceptable to the Government?  If we are going to treat countries as pariahs, then let us have a single rule for them all.  I suspect &mdash; and I am sorry to have to say this because I do not want to upset friends on the other benches &mdash; the reason South Africa has been souped up into a unique pariah in the world is because of its wealth and strategic position.</P>

      <P>If it was an agricultural country in the middle of Central Africa with no Simonstown naval base, with no command over the waters between the African continent and Antarctica there would not be half the fuss about it.  It is because of its strategic necessity &mdash; and I am not saying people over there believe it, and it may not even have occured to them &mdash; that some forces in the world want South Africa to be destabilised and that this unique campaign against that country, detestable though its regime is, is mounted and maintained.</P>

      <P>The last thing I want to say &mdash; and this will, I hope, make peace with my friends over here because it seems far nearer to what they like to hear &mdash; is that the improvements, or apparent improvements, in human rights conditions which appear to be on the way or to be in sight in the Soviet Union, while they still fall a very far distance short of satisfying a western European, but we are very privileged here, must be welcomed by fairminded people.  I was not happy at the sight of President Reagan lecturing Mr. Gorbachev so continually on the subject. He has to recognise that people must make a start somewhere and that there is a deadweight of 70 years &mdash; not 70, but 700 years &mdash; of brutal autocracy to be overcome.  That cannot be done overnight. I am willing to assume that Mr. Gorbachev does mean well and will do his best to improve matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the Americans ought not to be let go without our gently telling them that there are aspects of their policy which we here, and certainly I, would regard as intolerable.  One that I shall mention is the regime which the various American States are allowed to maintain, almost all of them, in regard to the infliction of the death penalty.  I consider that to sentence a man to death in 1979 or 1980 &mdash; it may be that he has been convicted beyond doubt of some appalling brutal multiple murder &mdash; and allow him to sit for six or seven years in a death cell when appeal after appeal is going on and perhaps even the law may have changed in the meantime and then to drag him out and put him to death with a gas capsule, or the electric chair, or invite in a corps of volunteer snipers to shoot him to death behind a curtain, is an inhuman and disgusting display.  When the United States <Col N="980" />&mdash; and I mean the states individually because they are all individually competent in this matter, not the union &mdash; put that particular part of their house in order, I shall listen with more patience to their appeals with regard to human rights in the rest of the world.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to take up the matter of Brian Keenan, as a fellow Ulsterman. The Government have made strenuous and extensive efforts with all the parties in the Middle East that might be in a position to help so that we could get some line on the kidnapping of Brian Keenan and make some effort to have him released.  This is true also of the Opposition, Deputy Barry and members of the other parties of this House.  The Government have maintained contact with other countries that are in the same unfortunate position as we are, in having hostages in Lebanon.</P>
      <P>The Government have also seen to it that the hostages who have been released have been contacted, to get information as up-to-date as possible on the position. The Taoiseach himself discussed this matter with the Foreign Minister of Iran recently and the conversation was a very friendly and positive one, in the Taoiseach's own words.  Actual hard information on Mr. Keenan's whereabouts, unfortunately, is not available.  On behalf of the Minister and of the Government I want to assure the House that we will continue to make all efforts to establish Mr. Keenan's whereabouts and to secure his safe release as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Deputy Kennedy spoke about our position on disarmament and arms control. She acknowledged that the position of Ireland on these issues was set out comprehensively very recently by the Taoiseach in New York.  Indeed, Deputy De Rossa paid tribute to the substance of the Taoiseach's speech also when making his contribution.  I have heard from ambassadors from the eastern part of Europe that they were very impressed by what the Taoiseach had to say.  Deputy Kennedy agreed with this position, which is entirely premised on the maintenance of our policy of military neutrality.  This policy was endorsed by the people in a referendum, during which the issue was very thoroughly discussed only last year. It was one of the areas that was highlighted during the course of that campaign.</P>
    <P>With regard to emigration, in our election programme we undertook to enter into a major initiative on behalf of young people who, unfortunately, have to emigrate. We have delivered on that commitment. In visits to the United States the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers have raised the issue with key legislative and administrative officials. We know, as does the House, that substantial progress towards legislative reform in the United States is under way. We are told that there are difficulties because of the presidential election, etc., in getting the legislation through the House of Representatives, but we are hopeful that it will be enacted before the end of the year, to provide permanent benefit for our citizens.</P>
    <P>In the area of advisory and welfare services, substantial progress also has been made.  The Minister of State in his speech referred to this area.  All our consulates have been given explicit instructions to cater for our emigrants.  New staff and resources have been allocated.  Also, we have brought together the main groups working in the immigration area, to ensure that their activities are co-ordinated and the benefit of wide and lengthy <Col N="982" /> experience made use of.  We have a network of services &mdash; the Government are confident that this is so &mdash; to help our young people.  There has been a very positive response from them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Barry's contribution on the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, there has been a full use of this conference. Specifically with regard to the frequency of the meetings of that conference, there is no appreciable difference between the record of the present Government and that of the previous one.  Since the Government took office there have been ten meetings of the conference, seven ordinary meetings, including today's, and three special meetings.  In the period November 1985 to March 1987, which is considerably more than a year, the previous Government took part in nine meetings of the conference, seven ordinary and two special.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Barry's concern regarding the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, I should refer him to the communiqué issued after the Anglo-Irish conference meeting on 25 March which agreed to give a new impetus to the work of bringing forward special measures to improve relations between the security forces and the community in Northern Ireland and <Col N="983" /> to build confidence in the system of justice. The conference decided that officials of the two Governments should draw up a new programme of work on these issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry will note when he reads the communiqué of today's conference that: &ldquo;The Ministers also reviewed a number of issues relating to confidence in the administration of justice and took note of the work in hand.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins, with regard to South Africa, can be assured that the policy of Ireland and of the Twelve with regard to South Africa is regularly reviewed in the light of developments in that country.  The Government and all our partners in the Twelve are gravely concerned at the trend of developments of South African Government policy and will, if present trends continue, look again at their policy.  In that connection, the Government continue to urge the addition of coal &mdash; this was mentioned, of course, in the debate &mdash; to the restrictive measures of the Twelve.  Deputy Kennedy said that there was a PLO office in Dublin almost akin to an embassy; that is not so.  Far from having any PLO embassy here, there is not even a PLO office in Dublin.  Our relations with Libya are no different from those of any other western European country, apart from the United Kingdom.  The Government have at all times made their position clear.  We shall not condone any assistance from anywhere to violent organisations here.  If it becomes clear that any State is engaged in such assistance the Government will draw the appropriate conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to diplomatic representation, Deputy Kennedy suggested the amalgamation of our mission to the EC with our embassy in Belgium.  She also suggested the amalgamation of our embassy in Italy and in the Holy See, the amalgamation of our embassy in Luxembourg <Col N="984" /> with our representation to the Council of Europe.  The last is already the case.  Our ambassador to Luzembourg is also our permanent representative to the Council of Europe.  In regard to the other two, I should point out that resident diplomatic relations are established by agreement between the States concerned. Not all States are willing to accept diplomatic representation along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>We need separate representations for the institutions of the Community to deal with the complex issues arising there.  We need representation to the Belgian State to conduct our relations and to protect our interests in that country because it is a founder member and an influential one of the European Community.  Our officials in Europe have to work very hard indeed and if they were members of trade unions they would hardly agree to the long hours and tough schedules which operate there.</P>
    <P>As to the amalgamation of our embassies in Italy and the Holy See it was suggested that Deputy Kennedy's party intended to remove the Deity from the Constitution and now they are trying to abolish our representation to the Vatican&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">

    <P>Deputies have spoken about the reduction in Ireland's overseas development assistance this year.  We very much regret that, for budgetary reasons, the Government have been forced to reduce the level of that assistance.  Nonetheless, we have maintained the full range of programmes and the House will be glad to know that. Indeed, some of my subheads were cut by 70 per cent or 80 per cent.  Under the <Col N="985" /> bilateral aid programme we are continuing to meet all our commitments, including those to our main partner countries, Tanzania, Lesotho, Zambia and the Sudan.  I assure Deputies that the Government are aware of &mdash; and sympathetic towards &mdash; the needs of developing countries and remain committed to the maintenance and expansion of our aid programme when economic circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific matter of milk powder for Nicaragua, the allocation of Irish food aid is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food and we will pass on the content of the contributions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to a foreign policy committee, notwithstanding what was said &mdash; and the remarks have been noted &mdash; the Houses of the Oireachtas have ample opportunities to consider foreign policy issues and do so.  Some Deputies have acknowledged this.  This debate, of course, is the major one on international relations but we also have other opportunities to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been criticisms about the amount of time allocated to the Estimates debate.  This has always been a difficult issue in regard to all Estimates.  I remember a time when many Estimates were passed without debate at the end of the year.  I remember seeing Conor Cruise O'Brien, as Minister, dealing with five or six Departments in about ten minutes, with a considerable flurry of papers from the bull pen beside me.  The House will agree that it is better to have three hours available for each Estimate instead of having them rushed through in an unseemly manner.  The late Vivion de Valera used to complain annually about the lack of time allotted to discussing the <Col N="986" /> Estimates but, thankfully, that has now been changed.</P>
    <P>We have had regular discussions on the European Community issues on the basis of the twice yearly reports on developments in the European Community either here or in Seanad Éireann, and the Taoiseach's report on European Councils. There have been motions on Anglo-Irish affairs, some of which were not totally acceptable to Deputy Kelly. We have also had the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, the Cecchini report on which there was a full debate and there have also been a number of Adjournment debates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said that neither Iraq nor Iran had any conception of the rule of law. However, both of them maintain that they are adhering to the rule of law - Muslim law - and they simply have different interpretations of it in regard to their frontiers. In regard to his remarks about the Soviet initiatives, glasnost and perestroika and the movement in the Soviet Union, I am sure the House agrees that this is desirable in relation to foreign affairs.
