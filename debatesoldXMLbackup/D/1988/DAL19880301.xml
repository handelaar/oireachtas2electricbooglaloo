      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, before Question Time begins I must point out to you, Sir, that the list of questions for the Taoiseach today is incomplete.  I had a question down to the Taoiseach today, as had other Members of the House, which has been disallowed &mdash; and I have your communication of this morning &mdash; on the grounds that the questions anticipate statements to be made in the Dáil this afternoon.  It seems to me, A Cheann Comhairle, it would be fitting, right and proper that before statements are made we should have the opportunity of teasing out any information the Taoiseach has so that our statements later in the afternoon can be better informed.  I would like to protest, a Cheann Comhairle, at the decision you have made in this case.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that statements made in this House could only gain from the maximum amount of information possible being available to Members of the House before making those statements. It seems that on that ground the operation of the rule as indicated by the Ceann Comhairle obstructs debate rather than helps it.</P>

      <P>Before you deal with what Deputy Dukes has said, will you allow <Col N="1048" /> me, Sir, to add a short comment.  Essentially, I wanted to raise the same matter but on a sightly different level.  If the case should be that the Taoiseach's statement which everyone will be interested in does not contain answers to their specific questions which were put down last Wednesday by myself and other Deputies, will you allow latitude for those Deputies who put questions down and now find them put off the paper because of the Taoiseach's forthcoming statement to ask the Taoiseach questions when his statement is complete?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that my only intention was to be helpful. I considered whether it would be more helpful to Deputies to deal with these matters by way of Question Time or by way of statement and my understanding was that the majority of Deputies would prefer statements.  However, I assure the Deputies that my only wish was to give as much information as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not levelling any accusation at the Taoiseach.  What I am saying is that the interpretation of the rules of procedure in this House, as you have laid out, which would seem to preclude questions on an issue where there are going to be statements later on is, in my view, not very sensible and does not help the process of debate.</P>

Sin an méid airgid atá againn i láthair na huaire, agus tá an chuid is mó den airgead sin do mhuiroibreacha, geallta.  Thug muid cúnamh do Oileán Thoraí.  Fuair siad deontas beag do halla pobail ar scuabadh an díon de. Tá réiteach againn in Oileán Árainn Mhór le blianta anuas.  Tugann mo Roinnse suim mhór airgid, agus tugann an Chomhairle Chontae suim mhór airgid le haghaidh bóithre.  Taobh amuigh de sin níl aon réiteach eile déanta againn i láthair na huaire.

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason his Department have discriminated against small farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance who are now debarred from entry into the Jobsearch scheme and who are consequently debarred from taking up employment in social employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decision initiating the national Jobsearch programme specifically provided that the programme be confined to persons on the <Col N="1056" /> live register.  It also provided that the programme should have a substantial bias towards those longest on the register.</P>
      <P>Smallholders do not form part of the live register and they are not, therefore, invited to participate in the programme. The objectives of the Jobsearch programme are the provision of help and support to the long term unemployed in particular, with emphasis being placed on securing suitable placements for as many as possible.  Smallholders are not without work and there are good grounds for confining the programme to those who are actually without work and on the live register.</P>
      <P>For the record I might perhaps mention that prior to the introduction of the Jobsearch programme, it was not the general practice to refer smallholders to the former National Manpower Service for consideration for social employment schemes.  Referrals were made only at the request of the individual and I gather that the number requesting such a referral was always very small.</P>
      <P>While the position is as I have stated, there will always be the possiblity of a small number of smallholders being placed on social employment schemes once this is not achieved at the expense of persons selected under the Jobsearch programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  First, at least the matter has been clarified because there is a great deal of ambivalence between his Department and the Department of Labour, who are trying to ride two horses at the one time.  They are trying to give the impression to the 14,000 small farmers who have no alternative but to draw unemployment assistance that on certain occasions they could be entitled to avail of the Jobsearch programme and on other occasions that they could not be.  I ask the Minister a straight question.  Does he consider this to be gross discrimination against 14,000 unemployed people, who would not be drawing unemployment assistance were it not for the fact that they have such a poor farm income?  The <Col N="1057" /> Minister has said that persons on unemployment assistance were not referred to the National Manpwer Service but I have to disagree with him because on the application form there is a question on whether a person contacted their local National Manpower office.  That question has been on the form for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of clarification.  The question of clarification arose when a small number of smallholders who had been referred to the local National Manpower Service failed to take up the invitation to participate in a local social employment scheme.  There were some objections to this because they had their work to do as smallholders.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the arrangement whereby smallholders are in receipt of unemployment assistance mainly arises from their income from their smallholding, would it not be more appropriate to switch them to the family income supplement scheme?  Secondly, is the Minister aware there are some 12,000 people, apart from smallholders, comprising 9,000 women and 3,000 men, who are debarred from social employment schemes?  Although they are unemployed they qualify because they are on the unemployment register for sufficient time but they fail to get on social employment schemes because they are not actually in receipt of money from the labour exchange.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 21, 45, 48, 49 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Department have an advanced programme of computerisation which is intended to link all the Department's local and headquarters offices on a computerised network.  This is being designed with a view to providing a more modern, efficient and effective service for social welfare claimants througout the country.</P>
      <P>The level of investment necessary is, of course, quite considerable and discussions are held from time to time with other organisations such as health boards, FÁS, the banks, Telecom Éireann and An Post to ensure the most effective deployment of resources.  Discussions have been held with An Post in relation to the services at present provided in the handling of pensions, child benefit and unemployment payments at post offices.</P>
      <P>The use of national lottery terminals for social welfare payments is not and has not been envisaged.  Furthermore, I understand, that the lottery terminals are not designed for dispensing payments and that their network of data lines would not be available for sharing with other organisations for security reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the Department's computerised systems will make possible a wide degree of flexibility in the ways in which the Department pay their claimants.  Possibilities, such as payment into bank or post office accounts, will allow movement away from payment by cash which is done at most local offices and which undoubtedly presents certain security risks.  The network of post offices throughout the country provides acceptable, convenient and efficient payment <Col N="1064" /> outlets for large numbers of beneficiaries. Many of these offices are combined or associated with retail outlets.  It is not considered that the provision of lottery facilities in these outlets should give rise to any special concern about the interests of social welfare claimants.  However, I am concerned about future possible developments and difficulties which might arise for some individuals and their families.  I have instructed my Department to keep this matter under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said quite categorically, the use of the national lottery terminals is not envisaged, nor has it been envisaged.  I think I have made that quite clear.  The Deputy is further asking me to say at this stage that, if a post office is using these terminals, we shall not make use of that post office for our purposes. The Deputy will realise that a great deal of our business is done through An Post. All I can say at this stage is that I shall be keeping this matter under review and would be concerned about future possible development in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister has refused to take a very clear stand at this point.  Here we are allowing An Post to develop plans for putting on-line terminals in post offices throughout the <Col N="1065" /> country, the very point at which the great bulk of social welfare recipients receive their social welfare benefits.  Is the Minister not already aware of the serious problems many people are having in trying to live on their social welfare payments?  Is he not aware of the awful temptations there are in peoples' way at the moment and would he not agree that it is wholly unsuitable that there should be these one armed bandits in post offices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the plans he has to overcome the widespread poverty which now exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Poverty has many dimensions.  It includes, for example, low or inadequate income, low quality or overcrowded housing, inadequate education and training, low health status and many other features which can isolate or separate people from the main activities of society.  The elimination of poverty in the community is one of the underlying objectives of all Government activity and is central to our <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> As the programme states, one of the four broad areas where progress is envisaged over the next three years is in diminishing or removing social inequities in our society.</P>
      <P>In the area of social welfare the services provided by my Department are directed to this purpose.  The policy of this Government is to devote whatever resources can be made available to maintaining and improving the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The extent to which additional resources can be made available will, to a large degree, be determined by the success of the Government's policies in achieving growth in the economy. However, I am determined that whatever progress can be made in reforming and developing the social welfare system within the financial constraints which exist, will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in social welfare payments, which were announced in the budget, are a major step in this direction, <Col N="1067" /> and are well in line with the Government's commitment to maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits and within the resources available at the same time consider special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>All social welfare recipients will receive a general increase of 3 per cent from July this year and this will more than protect the real value of payments given that the rate of inflation this year is expected to be 2.5 per cent.  Those on the lowest social welfare payments, namely unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, will receive special additional increases which will bring those payments even further above the current rate of inflation.  For example, the personal rates of these payments will be increased by 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, the rates of payments in respect of dependent children of social welfare recipients are being streamlined and improved.  Again, special increases are being given in the case of the lowest child rates.  These changes, which will cost some £101 million in a full year, will considerably improve the incomes of two of the categories of persons most at risk of poverty, namely, large families and recipients of unemployment assistance. This represents a concrete example of this Government's concern for the less well-off members of the community.</P>
    <P>For example, a family with three children in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term urban rate will receive an increase of £6.70 per week, giving a total payment of £98.80 per week from July next.  A widow with three children in receipt of a contributory pension will get an increase of £2.80 per week, giving her a new rate of £93.30 a week. A couple on retirement or old age pension will receive an increase of £2.90 per week, giving them a new rate of £99.10 per week.</P>
    <P>As the elimination of poverty involves so many areas of public policy, it has been singled out for special and positive attention.  To this end, the Combat Poverty Agency have been established.  The <Col N="1068" /> main functions of the agency are to advise me in relation to all aspects of poverty, to initiate and evaluate measures to overcome poverty, to examine the nature, causes and extent of poverty and to promote greater public understanding of this.</P>
    <P>The agency are currently involved in three inter-related areas of work &mdash; support for community development projects, research and public information. By encouraging a more co-ordinated and planned approach to combating poverty, the agency can act as a catalyst for change and can make an important contribution towards the elimination of poverty in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The agency are currently jointly funding a major survey of poverty in Ireland which is being carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute as part of the Second EC Poverty Programme.  One of the objectives of this study is to establish the extent of poverty in Ireland.  The study will make a substantial contribution to our understanding of the level, nature and determinants of poverty and will be of immense value for all policy makers involved in combating poverty.</P>

What tangible steps has he taken to increase the sum of £26 on which prescribed relatives are supposed to live?

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will discontinue the taking of PRSI from those women who contributed to national health insurance prior to 1953 who left employment in the mid-fifties in order to rear their children and have now returned to paid employment but will not apparently qualify for contributory pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to retirement or old age contributory pension is that the claimant has a minimum yearly average of contributions paid or credited from 1953 or from the date of entry into insurance, whichever is the later.  A person who leaves the workforce to rear children and who subsequently returns to insurable employment may fail to qualify for contributory old age or retirement pension because of the gap in their insurance record, depending on the number of years of absence from the workforce. However, the contributions paid by that person on resuming insurable employment provide cover for short term benefits such as unemployment and disability benefit and also for pensions such as invalidity and widows' pensions, for which a lifetime average of contributions is not required.  To discontinue the payment of contributions by people in this situation would be a serious disimprovement in their position and there are no plans to introduce such a provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position, and the Minister's response to my question, clearly indicate that the noble words in the Constitution regarding the role of women in the home is not being taken seriously.  I have dealt with a number of people, who have formed themselves into a small organisation, who paid national insurance between 1947 and 1953, left work to look after their children as the Constitution tells them they should and <Col N="1073" /> returned to work about 1982 or 1983. They learned that they will pay up to 13 years PRSI but because they worked between 1947 and 1953 their calculations will be based on the length of time since they first entered insurable employment with the result that they will not receive pay-related pensions.  The Ombudsman has reported on this gross anomaly in our social welfare system.  It is very unfair on the people who are affected.  I should like to ask the Minister to look at this question and ensure that those people are not victimised because they made contributions prior to the introduction of the present system of social insurance.  Will the Minister, if he cannot do that, take a lower level of PRSI from those people seeing that they will not qualify on the same basis as everybody else?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the progress made to date in providing dental treatment for spouses of insured persons; the reason it has not been provided for all spouses of insured persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 October 1987, I made regulations extending the benefits of the social insurance treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of qualified insured persons.  The newly qualified dependent spouses include the spouses of PAYE workers, of the unemployed who were insured, of disability <Col N="1075" /> benefit recipients and of invalidity, retirement and old age contributory pensioners.  The extension is primarily intended to provide the benefits of the scheme to wives working in the home. Those qualified are eligible for dental and optical benefits and for benefit towards the cost of hearing aids.</P>
      <P>To date approximately 24,500 claims for benefit under the treatment benefit scheme have been received in respect of dependent spouses.  The extension to the scheme as far as optical benefit and hearing aids are concerned is in full operation and is obviously very successful.</P>
      <P>The number of dentists who are operating the extension has been steadily growing and now stands at 150.  There are approximately 630 dentists active on the panel at present.  The balance of the dentists have not as yet agreed to provide dental treatment to dependent spouses under the extended scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the inconvenience caused by the present situation to some dependent spouses who may have to travel a distance to a participating dentist.  In order to assist them in obtaining benefit, I arranged some time ago that they will be supplied with the names of their nearest participating dentist if they contact their local social welfare office or telephone the Department.  This arrangement has been operating well.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may know the IDA have not supported the extension of the scheme to dependent spouses.  I met the Irish Dental Association twice in 1987 and explained the Government decision to extend the scheme.  When we last met, on 30 November 1987, we agreed to set up a joint working group, comprising representatives of the Department of Social Welfare and of the Irish Dental Association, to examine all aspects of the social insurance dental benefit scheme within the budgetary constraints and having regard to the Government's decision. The working group is to report to me by 30 May 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that such a large number of people have <Col N="1076" /> applied in such a short time, does the Minister agree that this is an indication that people were waiting for treatment which they did not have carried out previously because they could not afford to pay?  Will he take steps to ensure that those who are entitled to this benefit will receive it, if necessary by making appointments in areas where dentists are not carrying out the scheme?  Does the Minister agree that the dental health scheme operated by the health boards is practically non-existent?  No provision is being made to treat young children or adults, except perhaps some of those in institutional care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for the Minister for Health and I doubt that he would agree with the Deputy's statement.  In relation to the other supplementaries, I agree that the evidence of claims and the nature of the treatment requested clearly indicates that the demand for extractions, fillings, gum treatment and dentures is at least twice the demand from insured workers.  This indicates that the spouses in question needed a good deal of dental work carried out which had not previously been attended to.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I have been concerned for some time about the activities of moneylenders, particularly as they affect social welfare recipients.  I have, as I proposed during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill before Christmas, asked the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out a detailed study of moneylending and the problems associated with it.  The agency recently submitted their detailed proposals for the study, which were drawn up following consultations with a number of relevant organisations and these proposals have been approved. The agency expect that the results of the study will be available by next September.</P>
      <P>The question of whether changes in the social welfare system are required in response to the moneylending problem is one of the areas which the agency will be addressing in their research.  I am keeping this matter under review and will be guided by the outcome of the research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently announced the allocation of £100,000 from national lottery funds to the Society <Col N="1078" /> of St. Vincent de Paul for personal development and home management courses.  This will provide practical advice and assistance, including financial advice, to some 10,000 families this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response to the proposal I made in December.  While the Combat Poverty Agency are carrying out their study, will the Minister make provision on an exceptional basis for the supplementary welfare system to cope with urgent cases of extortionate moneylending?  Has he had or will he consider discussions with the league of credit unions to see what role they might have to play in alleviating this awful problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency will be consulting in the course of their study the credit unions, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Garda and various other people.  I will be having discussions at the same time so that I will be in a position to take action as early as possible.  The Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of discretion is given under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in relation to individual cases.  Some of these cases can be dealt with in that way.  The Deputy's proposal is much wider and will certainly have to be considered in the context of the study by the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that my proposal was prompted in the first place by the Department's refusal to sanction an initiative by community welfare officers in bailing out two women who were under incredible pressure from moneylenders, unknown to their husbands and families?  This brave and intelligent initiative did not succeed because the Department said there was no legislative backing for such a move. If that is so, will the Minister take the opportunity in the upcoming Social Welfare Bill to authorise such discretionary payments by social welfare officers?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will clarify the position of those who are assessed as being from 1 per cent to 19 per cent disabled for life and who normally receive a lump sum payment; and the social welfare services which they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme is payable in the form of a gratuity or a pension, as preferred by the claimant, where disablement is assessed as being between 1 per cent and 19 per cent for life.  Such a person would be entitled to the full range of social welfare benefits subject to fulfilling the normal conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 20 per cent upwards payment is invariably made by way of a pension and payment is also only made by way of pension in pneumoconiosis cases.  In addition to disablement benefit a person may also qualify for disability benefit or unemployability supplement and may also receive a constant attendance allowance.  These are payable in the more <Col N="1080" /> seriously disabled cases and would not normally arise in a case where the assessment is between 1 per cent and 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>A claimant, however, who accepts a gratuity and subsequently suffers a severe deterioration of his or her condition may apply for a review of the claim and where reassessed at a higher rate may then qualify for increase of disablement benefit. The cost of medical care under the occupational injuries scheme may be paid to a disablement beneficiary irrespective of whether the beneficiary is paid by gratuity or pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Many such people were in receipt of invalidity pensions which have now been removed from them.  If they are disabled to the extent of 15 per cent they lose their invalidity pension.  The Jobsearch programme is specifically designed to remove people from social welfare.  Here are people who have been assessed by medical referees from the Department as being disabled for life to an extent ranging from 1 per cent to 19 per cent.  To what are they now entitled? Many such people are being sent out on Jobsearch.  If they refuse Jobsearch because of their disablement, are they then deprived of social welfare payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who have lost invalidity pension as the Deputy suggested is very small and most of the people going from invalidity pension receive some other benefit such as old age pension.  Only a small number&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am quite certain that the figures will bear this out.  The position of a person who is assessed as being from 1 per cent to 19 per cent disabled for life, which is the case the Deputy mentioned, is that it would be open to him to receive any of the other social welfare benefits in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if any surveys have been conducted by his Department into the extent of over-claim of (a) unemployment assistance (b) unemployment benefit (c) disability benefit (d) unmarried mothers' allowance (e) deserted wife's allowance (f) free electricity allowance (g) free TV licence and (h) free telephone rental; if so, the general results of such surveys; the action he proposes to take; if any surveys have been conducted by his Department into the non-take-up of (a), (b), (c) and (d) above; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's system <Col N="1082" /> of accepting, processing and reviewing claims contains a large number of checks and controls designed to prevent abuse of the schemes.  When incidents of abuse are discovered, the lessons learned are used to tighten up whatever weaknesses there may be in the control procedures. Consultants were commissioned in August 1986 to examine the major payment systems in the Department with a view to advising where they were most at risk.  Arising out of the consultants' reports on these matters a formal survey of disability and unemployment payments was conducted by the Department in 1987.  Sampling based exercises where carried out to estimate the level of fraud. The exercise was very time consuming and for this reason was confined to the Dublin area.  The results indicated that 1 per cent of disability claims and 2 per cent of unemployment claims exhibited evidence of fraud the degree of which varied from claim to claim.  In money terms the loss involved was estimated at £3.66 million a year in Dublin for the two schemes.  It is the intention that the sampling technique will be used in the future as a control feature in the Department's ongoing monitoring of schemes.</P>
      <P>The consultants' reports on the disability benefit and unemployment benefit schemes also indicated that the schemes were at risk to fraudulent abuse at a number of points.  They made a large number of recommendations ranging from organisational matters to changes in particular controls and procedures.  I am having these reports examined and will shortly be making proposals to the Government.</P>
      <P>As to the other schemes mentioned there have been no formal surveys but the proposals I will be making will affect the whole way in which the Department administer their schemes and services and will be putting an emphasis on providing a comprehensive local service at all the Department's offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reorganised delivery system will play an integral role not only in allowing more effective control of all the schemes but will also make the whole range of the Department's services more accessible to <Col N="1083" /> everybody.  While no surveys have been conducted by the Department into the non-take-up of schemes, the plans I have for the Department will help considerably in meeting whatever problems there may be in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that his figure of 1 per cent fraud in DB is patently absurd particularly given that we know our level of absenteeism is twice that of the rate in Britain and our level of claim of disability benefit is almost twice that of the UK rate?  Would the Minister not agree, therefore, that there is ample evidence of over-claim and would he tell the House if he has any other explanation for the difference between the UK rate and ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important difference.  As the Deputy is aware, Great Britain and Northern Ireland have gone over to payment of disability and sickness benefit through employers for the first 28 weeks.  As the Deputy knows, the Government propose to introduce a 13 week period here.  This has been found to greatly reduce the level of absenteeism but the Deputy should be clear about the reply which I gave.  He asked me if any surveys have been conducted and I mentioned in my answer specific surveys.  It was not a question about what savings could be effected.  This is hard core fraud which has been discovered by consultants in surveys.  The question of wider scale abuse or misuse is a separate one and I think we have discussed it fairly often here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I asked the Minister about the degree of over-claim and he has now acknowledged that the rate of claim for disability benefit in the UK is half of what it is here.  Obviously, we are paying out twice as much disability benefit than we ought to by British standards.  The Minister has told us that a survey has produced evidence of abuse of 1 per cent.  Surely, the survey is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>

It was then in for oral reply today but it was disallowed subsequently <Col N="1217" /> after the Taoiseach had indicated that he would make a statement.

Originally I indicated that I thought the best way to facilitate the House was for me to take the questions and give something in the nature of a substantive reply to the questions.  Subsequently it was indicated that the House would prefer statements.  I accepted that suggestion by the parties but then it was suggested that statements were unsatisfactory in that they did not give me an opportunity to reply to points made by Leaders of the parties in their statements, so I went further again and on this occasion we are introducing a new provision whereby when all the Leaders make their statements I will have ten minutes in which to specifically reply to points made in Leaders' statements.

My dissatisfaction relates not to the fact that the Minister had refused to answer the question even though I know he had negotiations with the people mentioned in the question, but to the fact that the refusal was only conveyed to me yesterday despite the fact that the question was down since last Tuesday.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to report to Dáil Éireann on the circumstances surrounding the shooting dead of Mr. Aidan McAnespie at Aughnacloy and related matters, and on the action taken in this regard by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I would like to express on behalf of the Government our deepest <Col N="1221" /> sympathy to the family and friends of Mr. McAnespie.</P>
    <P>On the evening of Sunday, 21 February, Aidan McAnespie of Aughnacloy parked his car in that town and walked through the Aughnacloy checkpoint on his way to a GAA football game in a field close to the Border.  The Aughnacloy checkpoint is a permanent checkpoint on the main Dublin-Derry road where all through traffic is stopped and scrutinised. It consists of a number of heavily fortified buildings, including some elevated observation and firing posts, known as Sangars, and is manned by heavily armed British security forces.  The post is situated back about 1 kilometre on the Northern side of the Monaghan-Tyrone border.  Mr. McAnespie had walked about 400 metres past the checkpoint toward the Border and was about 600 metres from the Border when, at 2.50 p.m. he was killed by a bullet fired from the checkpoint.</P>
    <P>A soldier believed to have been involved was immediately taken off duty and placed in military custody pending the outcome of an investigation by the RUC.  The British Army have publicly expressed &ldquo;deep regret&rdquo;.  Subsequently, the RUC issued a statement to the effect that three bullets had ricocheted off the road, and that one had struck Mr. McAnespie.  On the Wednesday after the shooting a member of the British Army was charged with the unlawful killing of Mr. McAnespie.</P>
    <P>The Government expressed immediate concern on Sunday evening and sought a full report on this incident through the Secretariat in Belfast.  The concern of the Government was subsequently conveyed formally to Secretary of State King by the Tánaiste at last Wednesday's Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Local reaction has been vehement. Aidan McAnespie worked in Monaghan and passed through the Aughnacloy checkpoint very frequently, on his way to and from work and at other times. There are reports that he has, over a lengthy period, been subjected to continual severe harassment at this checkpoint &mdash; so much so that he and his family had fears for his safety.  The same fear is <Col N="1222" /> shared by others in the district.</P>
    <P>Following the incident the Garda, at the request of the RUC, closed the road for just over three hours, but then reopened it shortly after 6 o'clock.  Some four hours later at around 10 o'clock the road was closed again until 12 noon on the following day.  The first comparatively short initial closure of the road and the second closure later that night until noon the following day were both for the purposes of forensic examination.</P>
    <P>As soon as we were apprised of this shooting the representatives of this State in the Secretariat of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference took up the matter with the British authorities. The British explanation was that while a British soldier at the checkpoint was demonstrating, to the soldier who was replacing him on duty, that his weapon was &ldquo;clear&rdquo;, the weapon discharged three rounds accidentally.  There is other evidence that at the time in question there was a burst of fire, three or four rounds, from a machine gun in an elevated observation post which is part of the checkpoint.  A later British statement is to the effect that bullet marks on the road indicate that Mr. McAnespie was killed by a ricochet bullet.</P>
    <P>Given the background of harassment to which I have referred, I believe it is understandable that the suggestion of an accidental death caused by a ricochet bullet accidentally discharged is suspect to a great many of the victim's friends and neighbours, and indeed to a great many other people besides.  Where the death of a person towards whom there is known to be a history of hostility by the security forces is caused by the same security forces, it is inevitable that a suggestion that death was due to a freak accident of an extraordinary kind must give rise to disbelief.</P>
    <P>In view of the very deep and widespread public concern, the Government directed the Garda Commissioner to institute an inquiry immediately into the fatal shooting of Mr. McAnespie at Aughnacloy and the circumstances <Col N="1223" /> surrounding his death.  The Garda Commissioner appointed Deputy Commissioner Eugene Crowley to carry out this task, and to take statements and obtain information from all persons able and willing to assist.  I believe that the institution of this inquiry was widely welcomed by representatives of the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>Apart from the certain fact that a member of the public on his way to attend a football match was shot dead in circumstances that have not been satisfactorily explained, there are a number of issues that are cause for considerable concern.  As the shooting is now the subject of court proceedings, however, we must not prejudge the issue of responsibility for the killing but I can inform the Dáil that a number of concerns to which this incident gives rise about the handling of weapons by the security forces in Northern Ireland have been raised through the Secretariat in Maryfield.</P>
    <P>Much of the public disquiet about the observation towers and posts along the Border has arisen from fears that an accident of this kind could occur.  This anxiety was, indeed, expressed very recently to the Minister for Tourism and Transport by the parents and school authorities at Cloughoge primary school near Newry. The decision to establish these posts was taken without consultation with the Irish Government.  They are obviously intrusive and can provide a hazard to the lives and property of people living nearby.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Garda conduct an inquiry should not be taken as a reflection on any other inquiry undertaken.  It must be clear to everyone that the shooting dead of an unarmed civilian going about a normal and legitimate activity in broad daylight by a British soldier from an observation post along the Border is a matter of utmost gravity.  It must be thoroughly investigated and every effort made to have the full truth established.  If part of that truth can only be established from this side of the Border, and by the Garda, then it is obligatory for us to pursue that course of action.</P>
    <P>Incidents along the Border are and <Col N="1224" /> must be a matter of legitimate interest and concern to the Garda who have a special responsibility for Border security. In circumstances where many of the witnesses permanently reside on this side of or near the Border, it is entirely appropriate that the Garda should take statements from them.  If there are witnesses who for whatever reason which they consider valid are unwilling to give evidence to the RUC, then that evidence should be assembled by the Garda in order to establish the full truth as far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>During our recent debate here on the Stalker Sampson report, many Deputies made the point that the handling of that affair by the British authorities would cast a shadow over the credibility of future investigations of fatal incidents involving the security forces in Northern Ireland.  That was a perfectly valid argument.  In these circumstances does anyone expect Northern Nationalists to accept that their only knowledge of this killing should come from an internal inquiry in Northern Ireland?  Are they not entitled to expect that our security forces who are on the scene would attempt independently to find out as much as they possibly could about this happening which took place within yards of the Border?  Having regard to the feelings of anger and outrage that followed the decision by the British Attorney General in regard to the Stalker report, an inquiry by the Garda was obviously necessary.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised about the establishment of this inquiry when the matter could be pursued through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  In fact, full use was and is being made of the Secretariat since the incident occurred, and it has been the point of contact between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>No-one would claim that policing in areas of the North close to the Border, including the area where this killing took place, is policing as we know it here or as it is known, say, in England, Scotland or Wales or, indeed, in any normal democratic society.  For security reasons the RUC are, to a great extent, unable to <Col N="1225" /> patrol openly and with the same access to people and places as other police forces.  I know the dangers to which members of the RUC are subject in many areas but the fact is that policing along the Northern side of the Border is, of necessity, of a restricted nature.  In addition to that is the fact that the RUC in many areas, certainly along the Border and the area where this incident occurred, do not enjoy the confidence of many people in the Nationalist community.  Many people will not co-operate with the RUC even, possibly even particularly, when a matter which touches them so deeply as this, the McAnespie killing, is involved.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in relation to this killing there is much information available in this area which would not be properly reported and recorded were it not for the institution of the Garda inquiry.  We have an interest in knowing all the facts relevant to this case, so far as the Garda can ascertain them.  We know that there are certain vital matters that the inquiry will not be in a position to cover, but there may well be other facts, just as vital, that can be established by the Garda inquiry and that could be established in no other way.</P>
    <P>The Government statement establishing the inquiry made clear that the Deputy Commissioner would &ldquo;take statements and obtain information from all persons willing and able to assist&rdquo;. Deputy Commissioner Crowley is a very senior and most experienced Garda officer and no one is in a better position to decide who should or should not be interviewed for the purposes of the inquiry, and what weight should be given to each piece of evidence that is put before him.  In any Garda investigation information or evidence may come from many different sources.  If these sources were to be restricted in this or any other case according to the acceptability of the informant, then a full investigation would often be impossible.  I categorically reject as irresponsible, and indeed, detrimental, to our security interests the criticisms which have been made in this connection.</P>
    <P>No terms of reference other than those <Col N="1226" /> given for the Garda inquiry, would have been credible.  The Government could not possibly exclude from the scope of the inquiry any person or piece of evidence which might be relevant.  To have done so would have constituted political interference with the work of the inquiry. We would have been rightly and severely criticised by Dáil Éireann in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that Deputy Commissioner Crowley is getting a great deal of co-operation from the people of the locality and has taken a number of statements from the people who were in the vicinity at the time of the shooting or who have other relevant information to volunteer.  It is not possible at this stage to say when this inquiry will be completed.  Deputies will appreciate that it is proceeding carefully and methodically and that this takes time. It will be made available to the Government as soon as possible and the Government will then consider the report and decide on whatever further action is necessary.  An undertaking has already been given to private citizens who have made, or are prepared to make statements, that anything they say will be treated as confidential should they so wish.  I repeat that undertaking here.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that not only are the Garda absolutely entitled to conduct this inquiry, to provide information on the killing, but that they have the duty to do so.  The Garda inquiry was instituted for the purpose of constructing as complete a picture as possible of the event and to provide as much information relating to it, as quickly as possible, to the Government.</P>
    <P>At an early stage, the Deputy Commissioner conducting the Garda inquiry was approached by members of the McAnespie family with the request that the body, which had been buried in a cemetery on this side of the Border, should be exhumed and submitted to a further <i>post mortem</i> examination by a pathologist here.  The family had not been represented at the <i>post mortem</i> carried out by the British authorities and had been given to understand that they would <Col N="1227" /> not be supplied with a copy of the autopsy report until after all the legal proceedings had taken place &mdash; which could be expected to take several months at least. In these circumstances the Government felt that the family's request was reasonable and the relevant provisions of the Coroners Act, 1962, were put into effect. The Minister for Justice decided that the necessary exhumation order should be granted on the basis that it is in the interests, not of the family alone but in the public interest, that the nature of the injury sustained by the deceased should be established to everybody's satisfaction, so far as it is possible to do this. An exhumation of a body is a traumatic and extremely distressful event for all concerned.  I need hardly say that it is a matter that is never undertaken lightly.  I am satisfied that had the second independent <i>post mortem</i> not been allowed to take place, questions would continue to be asked and the nature of the cause of death would have remained one of controversy for a very long time.  There are two points I would like to emphasise. First, I wish to repeat that the question of exhumation was raised in the first instance by the family and that it was to the family's request that the Government acceded.  Secondly, our law provides for exhumation when the body is buried in our jurisdiction in circumstances of this kind.</P>
    <P>The examination has been carried out by the State Pathologist of this State in the presence of a medical practitioner nominated by the family.  His report has not yet been finalised.  It will of course be made available to the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The extraordinarily early release of Pirvate Thain and his return to duty in the British army naturally have raised the most serious concern in Northern Ireland and throughout this country.  Given the small number of prosecutions taken against members of the security forces &mdash; indeed, Private Thain is, I believe, the only British soldier ever to be convicted of murder while on duty in Northern Ireland &mdash; this concern is understandable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The shooting of unarmed civilians by the security forces cannot be tolerated. Nothing less than the fullest possible investigation and explanation of the circumstances, followed by appropriate legal action in each case can be accepted. It is regrettable to have to say it but it must be said, that a number of events and circumstances, the allegations of a &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; policy investigated by Mr. Stalker, the early release of Private Thain and the shooting at Aughnacloy, have combined to create the impression that the security forces are above the law. Any such impression among the public in Northern Ireland must have disastrous consequences on the community and impinge on every aspect of British policy for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the rule of law and in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland is necessary, if the cause of peace and reconciliation there is ever to be advanced.  This Government believe that in establishing an inquiry with the objective of helping to establish the truth, they have made an important contribution to that end.  I will, of course, listen with great care to what the party leaders may have to say on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been very useful for us to have the information the Taoiseach has given in his statement.  I would like to add that the innovation we have made in the course of providing for these statements, that the Taoiseach would have an opportunity to reply at the end, is a very useful one and one which we could bear in mind for other occasions also.  The first point I wish to make about the Taoiseach's statement is that I am very glad to note that use is being made of the channels and the structures that are set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement because, in a certain sense, they were designed with this kind of mutual exchange of information in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the reports we have had so far about this incident &mdash; the Taoiseach has indicated it a little more fully here today than it has been set out so far &mdash; are agreed on a certain number of points. <Col N="1229" /> Mr. McAnespie parked his car on the northern side of the Border; he walked past the checkpoint at Aughnacloy, apparently without any incident and he was struck and fatally injured by a bullet as he was walking towards the southern side of the Border.  There is no indication &mdash; and perhaps this is something the Taoiseach could confirm in reply to these statements &mdash; that he was challenged, requested to stop or asked to turn back. There is no indication that there was any objection or query raised in any way to his crossing the Border at that time.  He worked in Monaghan town and under our law he was a citizen of this State.  His death, in the circumstances that have been described here, is therefore a very legitimate matter of concern for this House, for our Government and for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The shooting did not happen in our jurisdiction but in the jurisdiction of a country which has signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement and which has accepted Article 2 and Article 7 (b) of that agreement. I think it would be useful to point out, not so much for people in this House but for people outside, what the provisions of Article 7 (b) of that agreement contain.  It states: &ldquo;The Conference shall consider the security situation at its regular meetings and thus provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events.&rdquo;  Apart from any other provision of the agreement, that provision clearly establishes the Irish Government's right to be informed about incidents of this kind and it establishes that right clearly within the framework of the agreement.  As I have said, that is something which people outside this House, who have been commenting in recent days on the involvement of the Garda in an inquiry, must bear in mind and it is something that must be borne in mind particularly by our counterparts in Westminster.  I hope all of us take advantage of whatever opportunities we have to make that point clear beyond any doubt.</P>
    <P>It is not the immediate or direct responsibility of our authorities to investigate <Col N="1230" /> this shooting to a conclusion; that responsibility lies in another jurisdiction and is to discover the full circumstances of the incident, to determine responsibility and to take any action which may appear justified in the light of those circumstances and that responsibility.  The process has begun and we must acknowledge that.  It must be followed up and the Government must keep insisting, through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that it be properly followed up and brought to a proper and full conclusion, whatever that conclusion might be.</P>
    <P>There is no record so far that I am aware as to how many other people were in the vicinity at the time of this shooting. Apart from any other aspect of this matter, Mr. McAnespie obviously was not the only person crossing the Border to go to the football match on the day in question.  I wonder if at this stage there is any information available to indicate how many other people were at risk on that occasion.  That does not in any way affect the gravity of the shooting dead of an unarmed person but we are entitled to know, and it is material to the whole investigation, how many other people might have been at risk as a result of that incident.</P>
    <P>I have raised a number of questions about the inquiry being carried out by the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Taoiseach has addressed a number of those questions today. The first question is what is the Deputy Commissioner's remit; secondly, what is to be done with his report and, thirdly, what role, if any, the Anglo-Irish Secretariat is playing in this affair?  In relation to the remit, I would have to ask why it was decided to put a Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána specifically in charge, on a day-to-day basis, of this inquiry.  There is an aspect to that which I will come back to later.  It seems it is fair to ask the question why it was not an officer at a lower level under the direct supervision of a Deputy Commissioner who was put in charge of the inquiry.  Any investigation of this kind <Col N="1231" /> would be carried out in any case under the supervision of a very senior officer.  I would like to know why it was decided in this case to put a Deputy Commissioner in charge and associate him so closely, directly and personally, with the inquiry. I ask that question not to discover anything about the Deputy Commissioner, a man worthy of the full confidence of this House, but to ask why an officer at that level was chosen to carry out the inquiry in this way.</P>
    <P>If the remit of the inquiry is to investigate the immediate circumstances of the shooting, then it is clear that the inquiry can only be incomplete since the Deputy Commissioner will be unable to get statements from members of the security forces in Northern Ireland and he can have no direct access, by his own efforts, to forensic evidence of any kind.  In that connection, it appears from reports in the media that the <i>post mortem</i> examination carried out on the remains of Mr. McAnespie by the Chief State Pathologist was not of any material assistance in elucidating the question of whether Mr. McAnespie was killed by a ricochet or a bullet fired directly at him.  There is, of course, only one channel through which the Deputy Commissioner or anyone else here can have access to that kind of information and that is through the structures set up by the agreement and through cross-Border security co-operation.  I want to emphasise again that those channels must be used to the full by the Government in this case.</P>
    <P>It is understandable and right that we should have reservations about the explanation that Mr. McAnespie was killed by a bullet which ricocheted off the road. We have a right to have serious reservations about the explanation that one member of the security forces was demonstrating to another that his weapon was clear.  Most of us will be familiar from the outside with those structures.  One of their features is that the field of fire is carefully selected but the apertures and sizes of the firing points are such as to make it, on the whole, unlikely that any accident or accidental discharge of a <Col N="1232" /> weapon taking place inside could home in and target on a person on the road some hundreds of yards away from the point it happened.  Until there is a good deal more information about that, we will all be entitled to have serious question marks in our minds about the suggestion that the death was caused by a ricochet.</P>
    <P>The Deputy Commissioner can get eye witness reports of the incident and statements about the general conduct of the British army at that checkpoint and the general conduct of the RUC in the area. I understand he has had a number of statements about such matters which may or may not provide useful background to an investigation that has access to the full facts of what happened inside the post. On the basis of media reports it seems the Deputy Commissioner had got a series of such statements but that they have not been of any great assistance in helping to determine whether the killing was deliberate or accidental.</P>
    <P>The question then arises, what is to be done with the results of the Deputy Commissioner's inquiry when he has satisfied himself that there is no further information to be gleaned from the kind of operation in which he is involved at the moment?  On this point the Taoiseach was not very forthcoming, limiting himself to saying that the results of the inquiry would be made available to the Government as soon as possible and that the Government would then consider the report and decide on whatever further action is necessary.  If the Deputy Commissioner's inquiry is to have any point, the results must be made available to those in charge of the investigation on the other side of the Border so that they can use any useful information in elucidating any aspects of the affair to bring it to its proper conclusion.  In that connection I am somewhat taken aback by a point made by the Taoiseach in his statement.  He said:</P>
    <P>An undertaking has already been given to private citizens who have made, or are prepared to make, statements that anything they say will be <Col N="1233" /> treated as confidential should they so wish.  I repeat that undertaking here.</P>
    <P>I can understand why a number of people who might make statements to the Garda Síochána would wish to be anonymous and I hope that is what the Taoiseach means, but if there are people who wish to remain anonymous I still would not be persuaded that any information they might anonymously give might be regarded as confidential and not to be used in the furtherance of this inquiry.  I would like to ask if the Taoiseach meant to convey that some information would not be passed on at the request of individuals or whether &mdash; and I think this would be understandable &mdash; persons who make statements would not be identified. The latter is the more useful and correct course of action.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said:</P>
    <P>If there are witnesses who for whatever reason, which they consider valid, are unwilling to give evidence to the RUC, then that evidence should be assembled by the Garda in order to establish the full truth as far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I understand that perfectly.  I can imagine numbers of people would be hesitant about going directly to the RUC, and if a Garda inquiry can help to bring out information which would otherwise not be made available, then the results can only be useful, subject to the qualification and the concern that any such information should be passed on, with due respect and regard to the anonymity of the sources, to the people who have to carry this inquiry because, as I said, the only jurisdiction where that inquiry can be fully carried out and the proper conclusions drawn is in Northern Ireland, not here.</P>
    <P>In the course of carrying out his inquiry the Deputy Commissioner has been put in the position of meeting two prominent members of Sinn Féin.  Again, I come back to my question why a Deputy Commissioner was asked to carry out this inquiry.  It is clear beyond any doubt that a Garda officer conducting an inquiry <Col N="1234" /> cannot refuse information from any source.  It would be a perversion of the role of the Garda to suggest that information should be refused.  The nature of any source is something that has to be evaluated by the officer carrying out the inquiry.  I take the view that it was undesirable and unnecessary to create a situation where a Deputy Commissioner, the second highest rank of the Garda Síochána, had to interview members of Sinn Féin, an interview which he could not refuse but which could potentially be used for propaganda purposes.  The propaganda value that might come from such an interview would be minimal if the inquiry were being carried by a superintendent or a chief superintendent.  The position of Deputy Commissioner should not be exposed to that kind of possible manipulation.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Deputy Commissioner's report will be inconclusive, and I say that without any reflection on the ability or dedication of the Deputy Commissioner but because, in the nature of things, there are certain key pieces of information to which he will not have access through the normal investigation process.  That information which he would need to make his inquiry complete can come from only one source and that is the Northern Ireland security authorities and those in Northern Ireland who are carrying out the investigation.  We need to have that information because the case concerned a person who, in our law, was a citizen of our State, walking across the Border, going about normal, legitimate business, apparently unchallenged at the time, not subject to any question, request to turn back, or request to be interviewed by the security authorities.  That is clearly a case in which we have the most direct and immediate interest.  It must be treated in that way.  It must be treated in that way by both sides to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  If the Deputy Commissioner's report is such that it adds useful elements to the overall inquiry then it must be passed on through the mechanisms set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>I must agree with the Taoiseach in his <Col N="1235" /> statement to the effect that the security forces cannot be regarded as being above the law.  Unfortunately, this is the second occasion in recent weeks on which we in this House have felt obliged to make that point.  In this case I am glad to see that the first steps have been taken in carrying out an inquiry.  As the Taoiseach has pointed out &mdash; and indeed it happened fairly quickly &mdash; a member of the British security forces has been detained and charged.  Our concern and the principal concern of our Government must be to ensure that that inquiry is fully and properly carried out.  Our Government must ensure that, on every occasion when it is appropriate to do so and when the Government are in a position to do so, they make that point forcibly.</P>

      <P>I should like, first, to protest most strongly on behalf of the Progressive Democrats about the form of the so-called debate in the House today on the serious shooting incident in Aughnacloy in which Aidan McAnespie was killed last Sunday week and the implications of events surrounding it for the administration of justice in the North and for the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave a specific commitment to Deputy Dukes on the Order of Business in the Dáil on Wednesday last that the Opposition parties would be entitled to and given time to examine aspects of the Garda inquiry into the shooting of Mr. McAnespie at Aughnacloy.  The Taoiseach said on Wednesday last:</P>
      <P>There are questions down to me which will be taken next Tuesday and I propose to make a fairly substantial statement in reply to those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had tabled questions to the Taoiseach which, if answered, would have allowed for a more informed debate in the House today.  Instead of a questions and answers session which we were promised &mdash; and which would have elicited some information from the Government &mdash; we are presented once again with statements to <Col N="1236" /> the House.  The decision to have this so-called debate in the form of statements rather than questions to and answers from the Taoiseach was taken unilaterally by the Government and outside of the Whips' meetings.  This statements procedure, which is creeping into the business of the House more and more each month, is a most unsatisfactory form of debate in that, in effect, it allows for no debate at all since the Government have to come forward with no immediate answers.  In the context of Anglo-Irish affairs alone this statements format was used twice in regard to the Stalker/Sampson affair recently and again here today.  Effectively it means that this House is not entitled to ask the Government direct questions about matters pertinent to their decisions.</P>
    <P>I hereby give notice, on behalf of the parliamentary party of the Progressive Democrats, that we will not agree to the Order of Business if this statements procedure is trotted out as the only method of posing questions to the Government on important issues of the day.  To a large extent the procedure is a charade.  Normally it produces no information because the Government are not obliged to answer any direct questions.</P>
    <P>I have mixed feelings about the Garda inquiry set up by the Government into the McAnespie incident.  I do not question for one moment &mdash; I want this to be absolutely clear &mdash; the right of our sovereign Government to set up a Garda inquiry into any incident.  I want to make that absolutely clear before continuing.  I want to raise serious questions on different related matters.</P>
    <P>Aidan McAnespie was shot in extremely suspicious circumstances on Sunday week last.  In the next day's papers the Government said they would be demanding a report on the shooting within the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  However, a day later, the Government decided to set up their own separate Garda inquiry into the shooting.</P>
    <P>The questions I want to put to the Taoiseach and the Government today are: first, did the Government fail to get <Col N="1237" /> a satisfactory response from the Anglo-Irish Secretariat to their legitimate inquiries about the shooting of an Irish citizen between Sunday and the establishment of the Garda inquiry on Monday, the following day?  Second, why did the Government decide within 30 or so hours of the shooting incident to send Deputy Commissioner Eugene Crowley &mdash; the man responsible for Border security and liaising with the RUC &mdash; to carry out his own investigation and inquiry? Third, was it because of the lack of co-operation from the Anglo-Irish Secretariat that the Government felt it necessary to send the Deputy Commissioner to conduct our inquiry into the incident or, another theory advanced by many people, were the Government merely playing a green card in the circumstances?</P>
    <P>The most important questions posed by the Government's sudden decision to set up a Garda inquiry are: first, what was the remit of the inquiry and what did the Government hope to achieve by it? Second, what were the precise terms of reference of the inquiry and, third, what will become of the result of the inquiry? This last is the most important question in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I hope that the results of the Garda inquiry, when completed, will be handed over to the RUC.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today the Government statement about week-end developments on the McAnespie incident stating that the Minister for Justice had acceded to the family's request to have the body of the deceased exhumed and examined by the State Pathologist, Dr. Harbison and that a report on the <i>post mortem</i> examination of the body by the State Pathologist will be supplied to the McAnespie family.  I notice that the Taoiseach said in the course of his remarks today that a report on the <i>post mortem</i> examination of the body will now be supplied to the Government and that a commitment is given to private citizens that their confidentiality will be respected.  I wonder, in respect of the Garda inquiry, in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, whether that is <Col N="1238" /> a wise decision.  I should like the Taoiseach to address this point when answering the debate.</P>
    <P>Given that the Government have embarked on a course of conducting a separate Garda inquiry I believe it is vital, in the current climate of Nationalist lack of confidence in the administration of justice, that the Government should be able to establish whether the fatal bullet which killed Aidan McAnespie was a ricochet or a direct hit.  What part of his body did it hit?  One must pose the question: did the Government seek to establish these facts at last Wednesday's full meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in Iveagh House in Dublin?  Did they fail to establish those facts?  Furthermore, are the results of the first <i>postmortem</i> carried out in the North available to the Government at this stage or will they be made available through the Anglo-Irish Conference?</P>
    <P>It is reported in today's papers that the findings of the week-end autopsy conducted by the State Pathologist, Dr. Harbison, are still inconclusive and that Dr. Harbison will be seeking access to the RUC photographs of the body taken immediately after the fatal shooting.  Is this the case?  Have the Government now sought access to RUC photographs and is such access to be granted within the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference or outside it?</P>
    <P>Once again there is clear evidence from the Government's handling of the McAnespie incident, that they are failing to make the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, now, the Anglo-Irish Conference Secretariat work to their full potential.  There is serious concern in many quarters that, by degrees, the Government are returning to the days of megaphone diplomacy when there was no Anglo-Irish Agreement in existence.  There is serious concern that the Government are, quite frankly, allowing the Anglo-Irish Agreement to wither away.  If any other conclusion should be reached by the onlooker at last week's events, the Taoiseach has a clear obligation to report to the Dáil on the nature of the impasse on <Col N="1239" /> administration of justice issues under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>There is concern in this House also about the decision of the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Mr. Eugene Crowley, to meet a deputation of Sinn Féin councillors, the Chairman of Fermanagh District Council and a Monaghan councillor.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Taoiseach had the following to say in the course of his remarks today:</P>
    <P>In circumstances where many of the witnesses permanently reside on this side of or near the Border, it is entirely appropriate that the gardaí should take statements from them.</P>
    <P>I agree with those remarks.  Most people's fear is that these Sinn Féin representatives were met by the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána as a Sinn Féin political deputation for their propaganda purposes but not as eye witnesses to the McAnespie shooting.  In replying I should like the Taoiseach to clarify and elaborate on the important questions I have posed.</P>
    <P>The statement format being followed today &mdash; despite the fact that the Taoiseach will reply later &mdash; is a most unsatisfactory method of having questions and answers in this House on important matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by expressing my sympathy to the family of Aidan McAnespie whose tragic death motivated this debate here today. Despite what others have said, there is, as yet, no way for us to know whether his death was murder or the result of a grotesque accident.  We cannot prejudge that.  We know that it was a tragedy for his grieving family and the community of which he was a member.  We must take the time to ensure that the community know they have our sympathy and solidarity here today.  It was a tragedy too for Anglo-Irish relations which had been tottering on the brink of calamity for some weeks now.  Those relations have been damaged further by this incident <Col N="1240" /> and by the stories of continued harassment which we are hearing in connection with this shooting.</P>
      <P>The question which has been in most minds ever since our Government announced they were setting up their own investigation into the shooting is why our Government felt that was necessary. Until the Taoiseach spoke in this debate no answer to that question was set out. We were left to draw our own conclusions.  Now that he has spoken, we are not a great deal wiser in relation to the reasons.  It remains the case that there are only two possible conclusions that can be drawn.</P>
      <P>The first possibility is that the investigation into this killing was initiated because the Irish Government felt that the British authorities or those in charge of the investigation in the North could not be trusted to make certain that the full truth came out.  It may or may not be the case that the lack of trust was warranted.  On the one hand it is certainly true to say that the experiences of the past few weeks, and especially the running sore of the Stalker affair, do not give rise to any degree of confidence that the British will prosecute in situations like this, whatever the odds might be.  It is clear too that the information which became available last week that a member of the security forces who had been convicted of murder had been released after a very short time and was back in the British army again illustrates the appalling insensitivity of which the British establishment are capable.  On the other hand, the fact that a person has already been charged may lead us to the conclusion that there were some lessons learned on the British side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to these factors, it is important that the full reason for initiating the investigation be spelt out to the House.  It is deeply regrettable that it has not been, because in the absence of any full reason, the second possible conclusion I mentioned must be considered, and it is this.  It is possible that the decision to initiate this investigation was no more than a gratuitous knee-jerk response to the situation, particularly <Col N="1241" /> given the statement that had proceeded it 24 hours earlier.  It is possible that the Irish Government thought there would be propaganda value in letting it be known or thought that the Irish people had no faith in the RUC and that they chose this mechanism for doing so.  If the latter is the case, then clearly relations between the two Governments are in even a worse state that we thought.  This kind of approach, if this is the motivation, bodes very ill indeed for future cross-Border co-operation at all levels.  I know full well that if the shoe was on the other foot and if the RUC announced that they were going to undertake an investigation into an accident on this side of the Border, we would need a great deal of convincing about the reasons for that decision if we were not to draw the inference that our security forces were being deliberately insulted.</P>
    <P>Given all of this, I must seriously question the wisdom of this kind of investigation without a full spelling out of the reasons for it.  I should not like anyone to infer from this that I am questioning the right of the Government to set up an investigation anywhere they see fit within our jurisdiction.  Clearly the Government do have that right but in situations like this they also have the obligation to spell out very clearly why it is being done.  We have the right to demand assurances in relation to this investigation.</P>
    <P>The first assurance we must seek here is that any and all the results of this investigation will be used to ensure that justice is done in this case.  The only way in which that can happen is that whatever information is gathered must so far as possible be given to those who are prosecuting this case in the courts.  The second assurance we must seek is that in the fullness of time a full report will be made to this House outlining the conclusions that the Government have reached as a result of this investigation. I am not asking that the Garda investigation <i>per se</i> be published, particularly as such publication might prove prejudicial to the notion of justice being done in the case, but I regard the statement <Col N="1242" /> made by the Taoiseach today as an interim one and I expect him to come back to the House when he and the Government have reached a conclusion in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is an additional point I have to make. Many of us were taken aback by the news that evidence had been given to this inquiry by members of Provisional Sinn Féin.  I do not here question the right of the Deputy Commissioner to take such evidence; he must gather information as he finds it.  I feel sure he will accord that evidence only the weight that is appropriate.  In this context perhaps we in this House should congratulate the Deputy Commissioner for persuading Sinn Féin to recognise for the first time the legitimacy of the Garda Síochána as an organ of this State.  Perhaps now that they have shown themselves willing to give evidence in this case we can expect them to come forward and tell us what they know about the shameful murders in Enniskillen.</P>
    <P>In general, relations between the two Governments and the two communities are now fraught with extreme danger. Therefore, I will conclude by calling on the Government to make every effort to ensure that some good comes out of this whole fiasco.  It is clear that there is a mood among the Unionist community for change and progress.  I applaud the sentiments of the Taoiseach in recent times in expressing a willingness to meet and talk with them in any form that can be organised.  If this is a serious offer he will have my full support in any initiative he takes to push such talks forward.  It is an objective worth taking risks for and it would make the troubles of recent times worthwhile if real dialogue were to begin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with the message of sympathy the other Deputies expressed to the McAnespie family.  The Dáil finds itself again discussing a series of incidents which have bedevilled Anglo-Irish relations since Christmas and which have made an already difficult situation in Northern Ireland even more complicated and confusing.  First we had the Stalker affair, <Col N="1243" /> then the Birmingham Six case and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and now the killing of Aidan McAnespie and the early release of Private Thain.</P>
      <P>The first thing that must be said is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept that these are a most unusual series of coincidences which happened to take place at around the same time.  After all, the Stalker-Sampson investigation and report and the decision not to publish and not to prosecute were all made and timed by the British Government.  Similarly, the decision to hold an appeal on the Birmingham Six, when to hold it, what the court should decide and when it should give its verdict were also decisions which were made and timed by the British Government, directly or indirectly. Lord Denning made it clear that the verdict was preordained.  It was also the British Government who decided that the Prevention of Terrorism Act should be made permanent.  They agreed on the release of Private Thain and they also, one assumes, agreed that he should be allowed back into the British Army and also, one thinks, they leaked the information at the most appropriate time to make the maximum impact on Anglo-Irish relations.  Only the killing of Aidan McAnespie was not planned and timed by the British Government.  We wonder what is next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole pattern is a grave cause for concern, especially when we see the enormous quantity of arms which are apparently being freely supplied to both Provos and Loyalist paramilitaries.  We have got to ask who is planning what, and why.  It is right that the Dáil and people should be concerned about the circumstances of the shooting of Aidan McAnespie at Aughnacloy on Sunday week.  We have quite rightly been concerned about the difficulty of Irish people getting fair trials in Britain due to the atmosphere of prejudice and intolerance that has been promoted there, especially by sections of the British media.  We must now be careful not to fall into the same trap of prejudice and intolerance of which we accuse the British.  A British soldier <Col N="1244" /> has now been charged with the unlawful killing of Mr. McAnespie and he is entitled to the same fair trial and hearing as any other person.  However, it is imperative that all the circumstances of the shooting are revealed at the trial and that there is no attempt at a cover-up on the part of the British security forces in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I presume that the decision of the Government to request the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda, Mr. Eugene Crowley, to conduct an investigation into the shooting of Mr. McAnespie was designed to reassure Nationalist opinion in the North of their concern at the shooting and also to gather whatever evidence they could in order to be in a position to check the veracity of the RUC investigation.  It was clear that Mr. Crowley's investigation would be necessarily incomplete and likely to be inconclusive. Mr. Crowley was clearly not going to have access to the sort of forensic evidence that is always crucial in determining the circumstances of a shooting like this.  He could not interview the person who had admitted to firing the weapon.  He could not inspect the weapon for defects nor could he even inspect the scene of the shooting.  It is possible however, that Deputy Commissioner Crowley may come across some evidence which, when taken in conjunction with the evidence gathered by the Authorities in Northern Ireland, may be helpful in disclosing the full details of the shooting.  If this is so I hope that, bearing the confidentiality of the sources in mind, as mentioned by the Taoiseach, any such evidence will be passed to the Authorities in Northern Ireland.  If this were done it would help to assure Unionists that the purpose of the inquiry is to arrive at the truth and not simply to annoy Unionists or the British.</P>
    <P>If this co-operation were shown we should expect a return of co-operation and to receive from the RUC photographic or forensic evidence which they have in the case so that the whole matter would be open and above board, the way it should be.  In cases such as this it is most important that both police forces co-operate in investigating the facts and <Col N="1245" /> then presenting these to the appropriate Authorities for prosecution if such is merited.</P>
    <P>The public concern about the shooting of Mr. McAnespie was exacerbated by the disclosure that Private Robert Thain had been released after serving just three years of a life sentence imposed for the murder of Thomas Reilly in Belfast in 1983.  The decision on early release was not in itself necessarily wrong.  Indeed the policy of early release of persons convicted of crimes of violence who show genuine remorse and a determination not to be involved again has much to recommend it.  However, there are very many people in jail in Northern Ireland and in Britain who have shown genuine remorse for their actions, who have cut all links with paramilitary groups but who have not been shown the same sympathetic treatment as Private Thain.</P>
    <P>There are many, particularly those who committed crimes when young and who were given indefinite sentences, who have served 15 years or more for crimes which were certainly no worse than that of Private Thain.  Whatever justification there may have been for the early release, there was absolutely none for the decision to take him back into the British Army as if nothing had happened.  This makes an absolute mockery of the law and shows the total contempt by both the British Government and the British Army for the decision of the court and for the feelings of Mr. O'Reilly's family.</P>
    <P>In considering individual instances like the Aughnacloy killing or the release of Private Thain, which remain matters of great concern, it is important that we should not lose sight of the overall problem in Northern Ireland and the need to vigorously pursue the search for peace. It is also important to remember that those who have been responsible for the overwhelming majority of death and destruction in Northern Ireland since 1971 have been the Provisional IRA. Only last week they claimed another two victims, two young Protestant workers, James Cummings and Frederick Starret, who were members of the UDR and two young members of their own yesterday <Col N="1246" /> in a bomb explosion.  Despite all the problems of the past few months there have been some indications of the possibility of political progress in Northern Ireland and the Unionist parties have in particular shown cautious signs that they are preparing to adopt a more flexible position, but there is need for a similar flexibility among other democratic parties in Northern Ireland and on the part of the Dublin Government.</P>
    <P>The immediate aim for those who want to see peace and progress in Northern Ireland must be the establishment of democratic devolved Government.  The building of democratic structures in Northern Ireland is a prerequisite for the establishment of peace and the elimination of terrorism.  The development and implementation of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland would put the onus on local political parties there to engage in real politics and would penalise those who continue to indulge in the sectarian shadow boxing that many are trying to pass off as politics in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is nearly three years since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, a main objective of which was the implementation of devolved government.  It is time that the Governments in Dublin and London recognised that there is a considerable groundswell of opinion in Northern Ireland in favour of devolved government and an end to violence and that democratic structures be established, guaranteeing equal rights and liberties to all citizens.  The longer Northern Ireland is denied some sort of democratic political structure the more terrorism will be allowed to divide the community.  The longer democracy is denied to Northern Ireland the louder the gunman and bombers will claim victory.  Democratic parties, North and South must support the demands for devolved government.  It is the only way to move forward to secure peace and bring an end to the violence and destruction which have been inflicted on the North for almost 20 years.  The Government should be playing a positive and constructive role in bringing this about.  If the Anglo-Irish Agreement is <Col N="1247" /> hindering progress in this direction it should be set aside, the priority must be peace and democracy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the House for the responsible &mdash; I might even say restrained &mdash; and helpful way in which the proceedings have been conducted.  Of particular importance is whether there is a perception that the security forces in the North of Ireland are above the law and, if that perception exists, whether it is justified and what we can do about it.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my opening statement that a combination of circumstances, unfortunately, gives rise to some grounds for such a perception and that is very much in the minds of Deputies who spoke seriously about these matters.  I want to deal with a number of points which were raised and the one about confidentiality was what most Deputies were concerned about.  It is too early to take a final decision on that aspect; we will have to wait to see the report, what it contains and what value it has.  This question could be looked at from two different aspects, one is the question of whether the information collected and assembled by the Deputy Commissioner should be conveyed to any other quarter anonymously, in other words that we would deal solely with the information as information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> I would particularly like to put to Deputy Dukes another side to it, that a person coming before the Deputy Commissioner giving evidence might not wish even the fact that they had come before the Deputy Commissioner to be known. A troubled and unfortunate situation prevails in the area and it is quite conceivable that a number of witnesses might not even wish it to be publicly known &mdash; or certainly known to the security forces in Northern Ireland &mdash; that they had given evidence.  There is a further consideration that, even though a person's identity might be kept confidential, they might also want the evidence they had given to be kept confidential lest it would implicate somebody they would not wish to implicate in the eyes of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  To sum up, I am trying to say that it is a sensitive matter and we want as many people as possible to feel free to come forward to give evidence to the Deputy Commissioner.  It is important, from that point of view, to make it clear to them that by doing so they will not be subject to any detrimental action afterwards from any particular source.</P>
    <P>The other question that Deputy Dukes raised was that of the rank of the officer we appointed.  I cannot see that there are grounds for complaint in that regard. First of all, we appointed a person of Deputy Commissioner rank in order to indicate how seriously we regarded the matter, how gravely we regarded the implications of the shooting, and we decided that the Deputy Commissioner, who had enormous experience of security, was the appropriate person.  He was the appropriate person, first, because of his high rank and, secondly, we were very much influenced &mdash; and the Commissioner in appointing the Deputy Commissioner was very much influenced &mdash; by the qualities and experience of the officer himself.  In this area, I do not think that there is any more experienced officer or any officer more capable of assessing information given and the sources from which it is provided.  I did not advert to the fact that the appointment of a person of Deputy Commissioner rank could be <Col N="1257" /> misinterpreted in any way.  It was not part of our intention that the high rank should have any particular significance, other than to indicate the importance we attributed to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I also know that Deputies were asking to what use the report will be put when it is available.  Deputy Spring suggested that we regard today as interim, and there is a lot in that.  I have given all the information at my disposal as fully as possible but I do not think the extent of the information I have been able to give to the House is adequate to finally dispose of this matter.  I certainly give the House an undertaking that when the Deputy Commissioner's report is available, the Government will give very careful and sensitive consideration to the report and to exactly what purposes it should be put. I know Deputies will agreee with me that we will have to take many considerations into account in deciding what should be done with the report or with the information contained in it.  At this stage, we cannot do any more than say that a lot will depend on what the report conveys, the quality of the information and what benefit might be gained from disclosing it in any particular direction.  Therefore, I do not rule out the question of coming back to the House again at a later date with more information when it is available.</P>
    <P>I am not sure, in reply to Deputy Dukes, whether the late Mr. McAnespie was, in fact, challenged.  The only thing I can say about it is that we have no information that he was and, if you were to ask me to give any sort of commitment, I would have to say I do not think that he was.  Deputies seemed to be reasonably satisfied about the <i>post mortem.</i> That examination is proceeding and has not been concluded.  The State pathologist is pursuing his inquiries further.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to talk about the question of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on the one side and the inquiry on the other.  I should like Deputies to see them as complementary, that the inquiry and pursuing these matters through the Anglo-Irish Conference and Secretariat are not mutually exclusive.  We have pursued <Col N="1258" /> this appalling incident under both headings.  We have been pursuing it very actively indeed through the Anglo-Irish Conference and I totally reject what Deputy Kennedy said about not using the Anglo-Irish Conference and the Secretariat.  From the moment this news broke we have been using the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference and the Secretariat to the fullest.  We have been using them on a daily basis and continue to do so.  As far as that is concerned the position is absolutely clear.  In addition to using the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference it is quite valid to have this inquiry.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that from the point of view of our own inquiries, and approaches through the Secretariat, it is important that we have as much information as we can from our sources. Our representatives in the Anglo-Irish Conference, and in the Secretariat, can discharge their functions there all the better if they have available to them the maximum possible amount of information from our own sources as a result of the Garda inquiry.</P>
    <P>I would sum up my reply by saying that these two things, the Deputy Commissioner's inquiry and the Anglo-Irish Conference, are complementary to each other in regard to this incident.  We intend to use both of them to the full to try to secure the maximum possible amount of information about this dreadful incident. Deputy Kennedy asked a number of questions but I would have to point out to her that practically all the questions she asked are dealt with and answered in the statement I made, in so far as I have information about them at this stage.  I should like to express my appreciation for the general responsible and helpful attitude taken by the party leaders in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put two quick questions to the Taoiseach and in doing so I want to make it clear that I do not disagree with the concern which he expressed, and which I am sure everybody feels, about this incident.  I agree with a lot of the content of his statement. <Col N="1259" /> I should like to ask the Taoiseach about an aspect of the matter which was adverted to by Deputies Spring and Mac Giolla.  Did the Government in deciding to hold the so publicly and, as somebody of another persuasion would say, so provocatively announced police inquiry on an incident which took place outside our legal jurisdiction consider the likely impact of that decision on ordinary Unionist opinion since, although, obviously, on a continuing basis we have the duty to do our best to uphold the rights of the Nationalist minority, in the long run a permanent settlement here will depend on concord between the Dublin Government and the Northern majority, as I thought the Taoiseach had at last begun to recognise?  Secondly, did the Government take into account in establishing this inquiry the precedent which they were creating in exposing themselves, and future Governments, to future demands in contexts which we cannot now foresee and which may be deeply embarrassing when they arrive for the establishment of further extra-territorial police inquiries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, the reply which I am sure the Deputy would expect me to give is that we took all aspects into account.  We naturally would take into account any sensitivities that there might be among the Unionist population or, indeed, in British Government circles but, as I tried to explain in my opening statement, I do not think anybody should resent this inquiry.  They should see it in the light that on our side of the Border we might be able to get information that would not otherwise be available and that would help to contribute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Kelly will recall that the Government of which he was a member had to take certain unprecedented actions in very difficult situations that arose.

My answer to everybody would be that they should see this in that light, that the Garda Síochána on the Border with all their experience and information could find out things that perhaps might not otherwise be ascertained.  In that regard I listened to one of the Unionist MP's for the area, Ken McGuinness, talking about the <i>post mortem</i> and the exhuming of the body, and it seemed to me that what he was saying was that if that exhuming of the body was at the request of the family he would have no objection to it.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As business adjourned last Tuesday on this Bill I was drawing attention to the different trend here compared to our main northern European competitors in the relative expenditure on agricultural research on the one hand and education and advisory services on the other as expressed as a percentage of agricultural output.  In 1960 northern Europe was spending more on advice than on research.  I do not have to remind the House that advice in Ireland is provided by ACOT and the research is carried out by AFT.  A decade later research expenditure had doubled while spending on advice had increased more slowly.  By 1980 Europe was spending the equivalent of 1.6 per cent of agricultural output on research with the advice costs levelling out at 0.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those figures are broadly the same today in the countries of northern Europe, our main competitors and our main market.  There is a very logical explanation for this.  Over those 20 years the number of farmers in most countries <Col N="1263" /> has halved and those remaining in the business are very aware of modern technological advances and the benefit of field research generally.  There has been a general sophistication in the area of agriculture and food production and a greater demand for information from current research.  That is the European story.  We might ask ourselves about our experience over the same time.  Our relative figures for expenditure on research and advice are quite different.  We still spend more on advice through the services of ACOT than on research through the service of AFT.  This is comparable to what Europe was spending in the sixties when real growth in agriculture began.  Our spending in this area today compares not to northern European but to Third World countries such as Algeria, Turkey and Nigeria.  I do not criticise the fact that we spend more than the rest of Europe on advice and educational services.  We still have relatively more farmers.  Given the primacy of agriculture acknowledged by us all, we still pay only lip service to value-added, post farm gate processing, marketing and our important natural resources.  The Minister in his speech stated:</P>
    <P>The farmer of tomorrow...must be a successful enterprise manager who can compete successfully with his best international counterparts.</P>
    <P>Considering this statement against the paltry resources devoted to research puts our farmers at a major disadvantage compared to the vague international counterparts to whom the Minister refers.</P>
    <P>Despite the handicaps under which farmers and the food industry generally are labouring, we must remember the relatively greater importance of agriculture to the Irish economy when compared with other countries.  This compounds the sin of neglect of research over the years.  There has been neglect from the point of view of the amount of resources invested in research.  It is particularly true this year, given the enormous cutbacks to the tune of 43 per cent for ACOT and AFT.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>It has been a priority for me as Minister for Agriculture and Food to make our partners in the EC sharply aware of the primacy of agriculture in our economy.</P>
    <P>This, in turn, filters through to the consumers of Europe so that quality products from a pure and natural environment must be universally associated with the name &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; on any level.</P>
    <P>There is nothing any of us can find fault with in that statement, except that our aspirations bear little relationship to the facts.</P>
    <P>In this year's Estimates the Fianna Fáil Government cut the funding of AFT and ACOT from £35 million to £20 million, putting the Irish farmer further out of line with his European counterpart.  This has been highlighted recently by the research staff from Oak Park in a communication which I am sure all Oireachtas Members received.  I acknowledge their interest and their contribution to the field of research by putting this statement on the record.  The document, to which seven or eight signatures are appended, states:</P>
    <P>Prior to this the State's investment in research was the second lowest in the European Community.  Now it will be the lowest of all.  We think that AFT has served the nation's farming industry very well over the last 25 years and it has played a key role in increasing agricultural production.</P>
    <P>They go on to give two reasons for claiming that the proposed reduction in funding is unwise.  The first is that investment in research is an investment in the future of the country for the benefit of the next generation.  State borrowing is mortgaging the future of the next generation. They continue:</P>
    <P>Must we cut back on investment to doubly deprive them?  With the world economy heading into recession the proposed cutback is very badly timed. The effect of the cutbacks will undoubtedly be deflationary.  AFT and ACOT are very much decentralised <Col N="1265" /> organisations.  Must the regions carry the brunt of the coming recession?</P>
    <P>There is much contained in those few sentences and I ask the Minister to turn his thoughts to them.</P>
    <P>Tragically the whole prospect of a successful outcome of a merger between ACOT and AFT is clouded by the budgetary crisis which will face the new organisation in its first year of operation. Voluntary redundancies apart, there are still not sufficient funds even to pay the wages, let alone deliver the efficient service so essential in 1988.  We await the Minister's response to the crisis.  The scientists, technicians, field workers, farm workers and the advisers all await the resolution of the budgetary crisis before them in 1988.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, stated in his contribution that the answer to the crisis was obvious.  He said what was needed was a transfer of additional funding from the £66.5 million administration budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food and additionally to integrate the functions and funding of the farm development services, Bord Glas and the research arm of the Department with the new farm authority.  I agree with that view, although Deputy O'Keeffe made the point that such measures would ruffle a few feathers in the Department. They would nevertheless ensure an efficient and cost effective service to the industry.  I agree that additional funding should be transferred from the £66.5 administration budget.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves that the initial decision to axe the workers on the ground was taken by this Administration. They can be expected to resist pressure to transfer moneys but if the Minister does not intend to resolve the funding crisis which faces the new organisation he should say to now.  He should put a stop to the charade and the aspirational speeches and be honest with those from whom we will all expect so much in the future, the staff of ACOT and AFT who will be staffing the new farm body.  The Minister either intends to shaft these organisations and the services they provide <Col N="1266" /> and so destroy the future for Irish agriculture and the food industry or he will fund the newly merged body adequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued his speech as follows:</P>
    <P>The test of success will be the same as in any other enterprise &mdash; knowledge and the confidence that comes with it.</P>
    <P>He went on to state:</P>
    <P>The main objective of this Bill is to set in place, by combining the considerable resources of the existing organisations, a strong unified organisational structure for the effective delivery of support services vital to the successful development of the agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>How can this be achieved?  We deserve detailed answers on Second Stage.  If effectively the organisation is bankrupt before it starts, all the aspirations and platitudes expressed in this Chamber are not worth a whit.  Are we all wasting our time in contributing to this debate?  Have we been wasting the administration's time and the parliamentary draftsman's time in requiring him to produce a Bill which broadly we support?  Without funding nothing in this Bill is possible or achievable.  The Minister spoke about combining the considerable resources.  I ask him to indicate what resources he is referring to.  Yes, we have expertise, assets and property and we could combine those resources but there would be no money there.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be congratulated when he talks about achieving the elimination of duplication and the overlapping of services but he did not achieve it as Fine Gael intended.  It appears he achieved the objective by eliminating the service altogether.  Without sufficient money to pay even the wages of those left in the new farm body he cannot deliver any service in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the Government intend to provide our farmers, and especially our young farmers, with at least as good an access to the <Col N="1267" /> knowledge and skills they will require as that available to their counterparts abroad but from my conclusions and analysis of the Yale survey I have pointed out that we are spending the least amount compared to our international counterparts on research and advice, and this despite the primacy of agriculture in our community.  How then can the Minister assure our young farmers especially and our farming community that they will have at least as good an access to the knowledge and skills that they will require as that available to their counterparts abroad?  There is a great economy of truth in that statement particularly when the facts are analysed and the statistics observed.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the priority to be given to entrants into farming will not mean the exclusion of the advisory services.  Coming from a Fianna Fáil Government who were hardly weeks in office when they abolished the installation aid grant for young farmers I find that very hard to take.  Yes, they reinstated it in the last budget and expected to be lauded by the agricultural community and hailed as the saviours of young farmers and farming in Ireland in the future but it does not take much reminding to realise that any applause which they received for reinstating the installation aid grant must be put against the background of the real scenario.  They abolished the installation aid grant a few months previously and the outcry, hassle and stick they received from Macra na Feirme, other farming organisations and young farmers in every constituency ensured that they reinstated the installation aid grant in the budget.</P>
    <P>We read of the Government's pious aspirations of what they will do for young farmers, yet the very first thing they did was to abolish the only grant aid which would help them to get established in rural Ireland.  We read about what they are going to do for them with a farm body who has not got a shilling to their name and who cannot pay the wages yet alone deliver a service.  Perhaps the key to unlock the Minister's mind in relation to <Col N="1268" /> his views on the future funding of this organisation lies in his speech, that an important thrust in Government policy is that bodies such as Teagasc should have a strong commercial orientation and receive a good measure of funding from the industry; that Teagasc will be expected to secure funding from the agricultural and food sector to the maximum degree possible through gearing its services to the essential commercial development needs of the industry and that section 6 of the Bill enables Teagasc to charge for any of its services though charges in the case of education, training or advice will require ministerial approval because of the wider policy implications such charges might have.  I should think so.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued that charges in appropriate circumstances should establish an effective and professional relationship between producer and adviser and should ensure that the services provided are of the highest professional standards. I have no difficulty with the principle of people paying a reasonable charge for any service providing it does not stand in the way of developing agriculture and advising and helping the very farmers who are least likely to be in a position to pay for such services.  I will be referring to this again later.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for income generating activities.  There are so many references to commercial exploitation in this sector that I want to check the most relevant ones to make my point.  The Minister in his speech told us that the allocation of £20 million in the Book of Estimates which, of course, was settled some months ago took account of a number of exceptional and new factors which would influence the situation after the merger of ACOT and AFT.  He now tries to justify the axing of 43 per cent of the budget of ACOT and the AFT by saying that he knew this Bill was coming. He went out and charged what he liked and thereby supplemented his funding. He said that the allocation in the Book of Estimates took account of a number of exceptional and new factors which would influence the situation after the merger <Col N="1269" /> of ACOT and AFT.  He was privy to this wisdom last September or October when drawing up the Estimates for the education sector.</P>
    <P>I suppose one of these exceptional and new factors is the increased commercial exploitation which he already mentioned. He went on to refer to the fact that the amalgamation will also make possible the rationalisation of the countrywide physical resources of the existing organisations.  I find that statement very ominous.  What he is trying to say, which is hidden behind some rather pleasant rhetoric, is that he already has in mind centres which are for axing and that basically he already has decided which of the services will stay and which will go.  The Minister should be frank and honest and name the centres he intends to close and he should not tell us that the new board when appointed will decide particularly if common membership will be an essential criterion for selection for the same board. One glance at the political map will then point out the vulnerable centres, vulnerable for all the wrong reasons.  Obviously the Minister knows the centres which he intends to close.  He said so effectively later in his speech.</P>
    <P>He said Teagasc will concentrate on the essential services and those of lower priority will be reduced or phased out. That, taken together with the possible rationalisation of the countrywide physical resources, says a lot and the Minister is not being frank with this House in what he has in mind for the different centres throughout the country.  As the Minister knows, morale is already extremely low. The research staff, technicians, field workers and advisers across the spectrum do not know what 1988 holds for them. They do not know if their particular centre will be there in the future.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is only voluntary redundancy which the Minister will accept, they do not know if they are going to be shifted from one part of the country to another.  It has taken a long time for the Minister to be honest and straight with what I like to call the coalface workers as far as the agricultural industry is concerned, the people who <Col N="1270" /> deliver the service to the farmer on the ground in the case of ACOT, and the people who deliver the service and give advice to ACOT advisers in the case of AFT.  The Minister allowed himself an escape from the tangled web in which he has been caught for the past number of months, since the Estimates were announced when he said:</P>
    <P>If there are temporary initial difficulties, it will be my purpose to ensure that the new body will not lack for the essential funds to enable them to become an efficient, cost-effective agency to service the agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there are major initial difficulties.  There is not sufficient money to pay the wages.  The normal way a Department work is that one-twelfth of the annual Estimate is spent each month for the 12 months of the year, and that is how control is kept over spending. Already this practice has been breached in relation to ACOT and AFT because one-twelfth of the 1988 Estimate is not sufficient to pay the salary in any one month.  The Minister obviously has something in mind.  Obviously he has far more planning in mind than he mentioned in his Second Stage speech in relation to what the future holds for the different centres in ACOT and AFT.  The Minister has decided that any initial temporary difficulties will be resolved in relation to funding.  There are major initial difficulties, so the Minister must have something in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not a fool and I hope he does not take me for one.  It is not a question of &ldquo;if there are initial difficulties&rdquo;.  The Minister is facing a crisis in the wages bill alone.  He is committed to no compulsory redundancies, so where do we go from here?  To go through the Bill stage by stage is irrelevant.  It is a waste of time if the funding is to be so inadequate that no services can be delivered.  If we do not have an answer to the major critical problem facing the new farm body, the problem of how it will be funded initially, and down the line, we are fooling ourselves and the agricultural <Col N="1271" /> community and we are wasting the time of this House by continuing to contribute. When replying, I would ask the Minister to level with us and to tell us what he has decided to do to resolve this critical problem, the resolution of which is basic to the successful outcome of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On this point I refer to an article published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> on 20 February last.  The title of the article is &ldquo;Audit may not be published&rdquo;.  Apparently an interim audit into the staffing levels of the Department of Agriculture and Food, ACOT and the Agriculture Institute is in the process of being completed and we are advised that this audit may not be published.  What is the reason for this?  Is it that it will make the Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Food and all the advisers look extremely foolish?  The Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food cut back the services from the Department, the administration in Kildare Street, by a mere 3 per cent or 4 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should make it 1.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am corrected.  It is even less than 3 per cent.  We will settle for 2 per cent as a round figure.  Yet, the people who are drawing up the very plans for spending in this area, the Department, have the gall to cut back the budget for the coalface workers, for the most critical people in the delivery of advice and research, by 43 per cent or 44 per cent.  It bears no comparison to reality. There is an audit into staffing levels between the relevant sections of the Department of Agriculture and Food, Administration in Dublin and ACOT and AFT on the ground, and now we are being told this audit may not be published, that it will be up to the Taoiseach to decide whether or not to publish the document.  This article says that:</P>
      <P>it is understood that his &mdash; the Taoiseach's &mdash; Department is already under civil service pressure not to release the document when it is finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> Need we say any more?  I would like the Minister to confirm to this House that there is no truth in this article.  If there is any question of Civil Service pressure on the Taoiseach or on anybody else not to publish the completed audit in relation to staffing levels in this most critical area, major questions need to be answered.  I have no reason to doubt that the information in this article is true but I am putting the question to the Minister to give him an opportunity to reply.  If this information in the article is true we could have a good and rather reasonable guess at why it is true.</P>
    <P>The decisions in relation to the Estimates for 1988 in the different sections in the Department of Agriculture and Food are probably a major source of embarrassment to the Fianna Fáil Government. I hope they at least have the grace to admit that they are a major source of embarrassment to the Government, because if they deny that at this stage they are compounding the injury being done to the agriculture and food industry in Ireland.  I wonder what this audit has turned up that we may or may not be allowed to know?</P>
    <P>The relevant resources for the three organisations have now been established according to this information, and the audit report has been written up in the Taoiseach's Department, perhaps so as to be independent of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The indications are that there will be scope for savings within the Department of Agriculture and Food administrative budget to soften the impact of the 44 per cent spending cuts to ACOT and AFT.  We await advice from the Minister as to how he will get out of the budgetary crisis in which the new farm body will be when and if this legislation comes through.  Perhaps the audit will allow an escape?  Perhaps it will indicate where Department of Agriculture and Food savings can be made and money transferred to ACOT and AFT.  Perhaps there could be some creative accounting along the lines of putting a proportion of the staff in ACOT and AFT onto the payroll of the Department of Agriculture and Food, for example, <Col N="1273" /> and this would relieve the pressure on the limited resources allowed to ACOT and AFT for 1988.  If there are extra resources in the Department of Agriculture and Food these staff could be paid through the Department of Agriculture and Food and they could then be seconded back onto the new farm body.  By a little bit of creative accounting the Government will not be seen to be giving more money to ACOT and AFT and yet the Government will have passed the crisis.  Perhaps the Minister will not use a device like that but we await being told by the Minister how the new farm body will have a future in 1988, let alone down the road.</P>
    <P>There have been several occasions on which the whole area of the importance of agricultural research, planning, value-added and food has been pointed out over the years.  The National Planning Board Report in their <i>Proposals for Plan 1984-1987</i> said:</P>
    <P>The Board believe that to enable the farmer improve productivity ... an adequately educated and trained agricultural labour force is a necessary prerequisite.</P>
    <P>It has pointed up the essential work being done and that will have to be done by ACOT in that area in future or by the new farm body when established.  The national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> recognised the situation where it said:</P>
    <P>Both ACOT and AFT have important roles in helping farmers to increase productivity through the adoption of cost-effective new technology devised and researched by AFT...</P>
    <P>the information being disseminated through ACOT to the farmers on the ground.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the Telesis report, the NESC report No. 64, 1982.  In their review of industrial policy the Telesis consultancy group point out that our grasslands are the natural resource with the strongest competitive strength.  They make the point that at present they are <Col N="1274" /> only partially developed.  I am conscious of the excellent work done and continuing to be done in Johnstown Castle Research Centre in Wexford on this very area.  There is, therefore, continued support for providing advisory and research services to farmers in Ireland from every sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us would have a slightly amusing side if the situation were not so serious.  I have two Bills in my hand.  This is the Bill we are discussing today, the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill, 1988.  It is very similar to the Bill that my former colleague the then Deputy Mark Clinton, guided through Dáil Éireann in 1977.  That Bill was called the National, Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Bill. It makes good reading to go back through the Official Reports of the Dáil and Seanad of the time and note what Fianna Fáil has to say on that Fine Gael Bill. Interestingly enough, the then Deputy Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture at the time and he particularly, if we are to be consistent, would have made nonsense of the Bill here before us today, a Bill now being promoted and proposed to the House by a Fianna Fáil Government.  In the past they have been known as the party of U turns.  I am afraid I would not be a politician if I let this occasion go by without saying the U turn of all U turns is being done this evening in relation to the support of the Fianna Fáil Government for and their promotion of the Bill before us.  It makes good after dinner reading to go through the contributions of the Minister's colleagues and former colleagues, some of who are no longer with us in this House today, to see what they had to say about virtually the same issue as we are talking about now.  If I may be so bold, many of the sections in this Bill are almost plagiarised from the old Bill.  There are differences too, but the very points and issues that incurred the wrath of the Fianna Fáil Deputies in 1977 are being lauded by the Fianna Fáil Deputies of the eighties in this House today.  Perhaps it is another area where they have come round to Fine Gael's way of thinking.  We welcome that, but we <Col N="1275" /> will not let it go unrecognised and unnoticed by this House.</P>

      <P>There are quite a number still in this House, and we wish them well, who were here in 1977 and who had most interesting things to say on effectively the very Bill we are discussing here today. You will allow me, Sir, the odd political point.  It is too major a U turn to go undocumented by this House.  It is essential for the record that we get the facts straight.  I welcome the road to Damasus conversion by the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this new merger Bill and the new farm body they are setting up.  I congratulate them for taking on board Fine Gael principles of the seventies which we consistently held right through the eighties, and I am sure we will be very constructive in our contribution consequently to the Bill and its passage in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again for the record, I would like to commend the tremendous contribution our former colleague now in Europe, Mark Clinton, made in relation to the very issue we debate here tonight.  His commitment to agriculture has been well documented.  It is an awful pity that through the obstruction of Fianna Fáil and their lack of willingness to support a Bill in 1977 that obviously had excellent merit the measures we are now trying to bring about today have been held up for almost 12 years.  We could have been 12 years further down the road with this new farm body if Fianna Fáil had chosen to support the Bill we were proposing at the time.  The Minister should recognise the goodwill and constructive support of the Fine Gael Party in relation to this Bill today.  Would that it had been otherwise <Col N="1276" /> in 1977 and those years behind us would not have been wasted years.</P>
    <P>Enough of that, as I can see from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's face.  Might I be forgiven if I became slightly parochial for a moment?  I have referred in passing to Johnstown Castle's immense contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Since their founding in 1958 AFT operated through a series of major research centres each of which had a number of satellite centres. Let me just describe one of these in detail because I am more familiar with this centre perhaps than with others though I am very aware of the excellent work that has been done in the others and detailed them briefly last week when I contributed to this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only neighbourly co-operation.  Johnstown Castle's contribution to agriculture predates considerably the establishment of AFT and on that basis I would like to be allowed <Col N="1277" /> some parochial reminiscences.  Johnstown Castle estate, four miles from Wexford town, was founded by the Esmonde family in early Norman times.  They were dispossessed by Oliver Cromwell after 1649.  Within a generation after Cromwell the estate passed in to the hands of the Grogans.  History repeated itself in 1798 when once more the family were on the Irish side.  The then owner, Cornelius Grogan, was hanged together with Bagenal Harvey and others on Wexford bridge for complicity in the rebellion. Grogan had been one of the main shareholders in the company which had built this first bridge over the Slaney in 1790.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the Grogan family managed to recover the estate after its forfeiture and by the middle of the eighteen hundreds are to be found actively involved again in the main developments in the Wexford area.  These included such projects as the reclamation of the sloblands in Wexford Harbour and at Kilmore Quay as well as the building of the first harbour at Kilmore Quay.  On their own estate the Grogans built schools as well as houses for their employees.  The great famine of the 1840s had little impact on the area because of the enlightened and broadly based agriculture in the Johnstown area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last private resident at Johnstown Castle was Lady Maurice Fitzgerald who died in 1942.  She gave a lifetime of service to the local community in the area of public health.  Her grandson, Mr. Victor Laken, and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Jefferies, presented the estate to the Irish nation for use as an agricultural college and research centre in 1945.  The reasons they had to present it would do little to enhance the story, so we will just make the point.  The Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945 contains the details of the gift.  Many of the staff who had worked for Lady Maurice were taken on to the staff of the new college.  The last of these, Mr. Thomas Kelly, retired only in 1987 after 51 years at Johnstown. The pride these staff had in the history and achievements of Johnstown as a private estate was carried over in the new role as a national soils and grassland <Col N="1278" /> research centre.  Many new research and technical staff were taken on and trained both at home and abroad and soon established Johnstown's reputation in soils research.</P>
    <P>When the Agricultural Institute was founded in 1958 Johnstown provided their first director, Dr. Tom Walsh, as well as many of the skilled staff who established the new research facilities at Oakpark, Grange, Kinsealy and Moore-park.  Another wave of young graduates was taken on in the early sixties who now form the backbone of the present research programme at Johnstown.  They are ably assisted by an excellent team of technicians.  Wexford and, indeed, the country can be well proud of the service the staff in Johnstown have given. Through attendance at conferences, publication of papers and participation in joint EC research programmes, they have made Johnstown known as a centre of excellence in the areas of land appraisal, soil fertility and trace elements, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>The study of soil types, soil fertility and the lime and fertiliser requirements of grassland and the main tillage crops has been the core activity at Johnstown in the last 20 years or so.  Parallel with this, methods for soil and plant analysis have been developed and tested and then put into practice on a routine basis.  The popularity of the analytical services which have been developed are now such that around 100,000 soil samples and 30,000 plant samples are received each year from farmers in agri-business.  Regular exchange of standard samples with other major European laboratories and continuous improvement of laboratory equipment has enabled Johnstown to compete with the best.  In fact a new block of laboratories was opened in the seventies.</P>
    <P>The staff at Johnstown are now justifiably concerned that lack of funds and staff may strangle future progress.  In these fast moving times information comes only to those research centres and researchers who have something to give in return.  A great deal of the exchange of scientific ideas and information takes <Col N="1279" /> place in contact at meetings and informal visits to research centres.</P>
    <P>Last year when I had the honour of being Minister of State at the Department of Finance with particular responsibility for the Office of Public Works, while on a visit to the Netherlands I met a young scientist who had worked at Johnstown for some months as a student botanist, Dr. Mattias Schouten.  He became interested in Irish bogs and their conservation and he raised tremendous support for this cause in Holland.  It was he who had organised the function that I was attending, namely, the handing over of the ownership of a number of intact Irish bogs to the Government.  The bogs had been bought with money raised mainly by Mattias's committee in Holland.  We may all recall the great pride and pleasure we experienced when our colleagues in the Netherlands, scientists and ordinary people with environmental concerns and general environmental interest, actually invested their own money to preserve some intact, raised and blanket bogs in this country.  The germ of that idea started through a young student scientist studying at Johnstown on an annual exchange and becoming interested in Irish bogs.  It is perhaps to date an undocumented area of Johnstown's involvement in this most worthwhile venture.</P>
    <P>Much of the research activity at Johnstown is neither glamorous nor photogenic.  I will be critical of the institute of AFT for a moment.  Much of the difficulty we are now experiencing, and which has been obvious for the last few months, has arisen because the public relations of An Foras Talúntais has not been what it should be.  We can accept that perhaps the scientists and the inner circle of those in the know knew what was going on and appreciated the enormous range of activities at the different centres but the average politician, the man in the street, people living in villages adjacent to these centres, had no appreciation or understanding of the contribution of these centres to the Irish economy, particularly to Irish agricultural output and indeed to <Col N="1280" /> environmental output and tourism also. I think AFT recognise that they were perhaps a little reticent in relation to pushing their own cause and highlighting it to the public.  I am afraid this awareness has come very late.  It has made our job and the job of impressing on the Minister and the Government the necessity for adequate funding and the importance of the research programme more difficult.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the research activity at Johnstown is neither glamorous nor photogenic.  The best ways of using animal manures, the study of different types of nitrogen fertiliser and the most suitable ways of correcting zinc deficiency in cereals are some of the matters currently under investigation.  Each one refers to the multi-million pound problem.  If we take the example of sulphur, Johnstown researchers found that as grassland productivity was increased in some areas of the country sulphur deficiencies were starting to show.  This was being compounded by a lowering of the sulphur content of fertilisers.  The correction of this sulphur deficiency is reckoned to be worth about £75 million to Irish farmers each year.  In other words, the results of this programme in Johnstown Castle &mdash; the knowledge of how to correct sulphur deficiency &mdash; is worth £75 million per annum to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Johnstown has played a major part in other areas concerning lime, fertilisers and animal manures.  The amounts of money involved in this area annually are very considerable.  For example, over £300 million is spent per annum by farmers on nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium fertilisers.  Animal manures &mdash; in this case we can only estimate the value in terms of increased production through their use &mdash; have cost the agricultural community £80 million.  In regard to lime, we are often criticised, particularly since the lime subsidy was removed, for not using sufficient lime but about £10 million a year is spent on lime by Irish farmers. Just under £400 million is spent per annum by Irish farmers in relation to corrective action through fertilisers of one kind or another.  Johnstown Castle's <Col N="1281" /> contribution to this area has been immense and indeed has been documented on many occasions through scientific publications both here and abroad. It is necessary not just to know what minerals or fertilisers are needed to correct deficiency but you must know, depending on the different types of soils and on weather conditions, when to spread; you must know how to spread without causing further health or environmental hazards to the community and you must know how to minimise leaching into water courses and into ground water supplies generally.  All of this research has been done in Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>Nitrogen fertilisers make up a major portion of these costs &mdash; as I have said, £300 million is spent on nitrogen fertilisers alone &mdash; and therefore it is most important that studies on nitrogen fixation and on the fate of nitrogen in the soil be continued.  I hope this most important aspect will be recognised by the new farm body for all our sakes, particularly for the sake of the agricultural community and for the sake of our exports to Europe.  There are also important public health aspects attached to nitrogen which need more study.  I have referred to them briefly &mdash; the threatened pollution of ground water and our water sources generally.</P>
    <P>In the last decade the number and variety of contract research projects have increased considerably at Johnstown. Some examples are: the forage map of Europe has been produced at Johnstown Castle for the EC; work has been done for the IDA on the agricultural implications of an electrolytic smelter at Ballylongford in County Kerry; a resource survey of the south-east coast of County Wexford was carried out for the ESB; a survey of stud farms at Tully and Barretstown Castle was carried out for the national stud and a study of the feasibility of using Italian ryegrass to produce sugars suitable for fermentation to ethanol was done for the EC.</P>
    <P>Grass dry matter is a real commodity worth at least £1,000 million annually.  It is the principal food for cattle, sheep and <Col N="1282" /> horses.  Down the years Johnstown Castle research has played a key role in improving the productivity and management of our grassland.  For the future it is certain that grass will continue to be the main source of feed for our livestock.  Nonetheless, research is also being broadened to include the possibility of using grass as a feedstock for ethanol production.</P>
    <P>Some years ago farmyard manures and slurries were considered to be a nuisance and of little value to farming.  Research at Johnstown has shown that this is not the case and that, if properly recycled, they can have an annual value to farming of about £100 million.  Their proper use also means that pollution of rivers, lakes and ground waters is prevented. Research work on the best ways of handling and using animal manures is still in its early stages and a lot of work is still required.  A new method of injecting slurry into the soil is at present under test at Johnstown and looks like a good solution to the problem of smell associated with conventional slurry spreading.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle staff have worked on various agricultural projects overseas. Projects of varying duration from two months to one year have been undertaken in Lesotho, the Sudan, the Azores, Trinidad and Zimbabwe.  Students from some of these countries have also received specialist training at Johnstown to enable them to undertake long term management of development projects in their home countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Johnstown Castle Research Centre is included for special mention in the Bill.  It is surely sensible to make full use of their excellent staff and facilities.  Down the years the staff, from the top to those working in the laboratories, the technicians and those on field work in the farms, have responded to the needs of farming and agri business and built up a respected role for Johnstown as a soil and grasslands research centre of excellence.</P>
    <P>I hope we can trust the future of Johnstown Castle which will be in the hands of this new farm Bill and the Fianna Fáil Government.  I honestly feel that if everybody <Col N="1283" /> could be privy to the information concerning the work being done, the broad scope of that work and its relevance not just to the agriculture and food industry but also to the environment, the marine world and the tourism sector, we should have no fear for the future of Johnstown Castle.  Until the Minister confirms that to be so, his ominous references to the rationalisation of countrywide physical resources for one, and the promise to concentrate on the essential services and those of lower priority secondly, make us all wonder what he has in mind, not just for Johnstown but the other centres of excellence which comprise AFT and ACOT.</P>
    <P>We cannot be sure what the future will hold for any centre until the Minister indicates exactly what he means by an essential service.  Surely the list I have outlined in terms of the achievements and research work at Johnstown must be an essential service.  Grassland is the basis of agricultural production in this country. One of the basic premises of the Treaty of Rome was that we should concentrate production in areas of greatest natural advantage.  The work at Johnstown Castle on soils and grasslands generally must, I contend, be classed as an essential service and I urge the Minister in replying to the Second Stage debate to confirm that this is so.  Will he please indicate what services being provided by either ACOT or AFT are &ldquo;of lower priority&rdquo; and which does he intend to reduce to phase out altogether?  Will he let us know what he has in mind?</P>
    <P>In Wexford we are lucky enough to have another research station at Clonroche, the National Soft Fruit and Beekeeping Research Station.  I do not have to remind the Minister that fruit growing technology is constantly changing.  If Irish growers are to remain competitive, it is essential that they have easy access to the most cost-effective growing management systems.  The results of the research programme at Clonroche are made know to growers through serving ACOT fruit advisers and by groups visiting the station.  Indeed, the programme <Col N="1284" /> at Clonroche and its liaison with ACOT shows how effectively ACOT and AFT have been disseminating to farmers information gleaned through research at AFT.</P>
    <P>Clonroche is the only station in the country servicing the soft fruit industry. There are approximately 900 soft fruit growers in the country, of whom about 420 are in County Wexford.  They employ between 10,000 and 12,000 casual employees during the picking season.  In addition, there would be another 150 employed seasonally at intake depots.  I do not have to remind the Minister that fruit growing fits in well with tilling activities and provides on-farm income consolidation.  In many cases fruit growing is capable of generating a second family farm income.  In County Wexford between 300 and 320 hectares of strawberries are grown annually yielding 2,400 tonnes per annum, of which 1,400 tonnes are exported.  We are extremely proud of our annual strawberry festival which takes place in Enniscorthy in the first week of July.  An additional 280 hectares are grown for the fresh and processing markets in other regions.</P>
    <P>Research results from abroad have to be modified and tailored to suit Irish soil and climatic conditions.  We cannot make a case for abandoning our own indigenous research in the soft fruit and beekeeping areas in this country, being an island with a temperate climate, because of the differences in our climate and soils.  To take on board the results of research done in other countries would not suffice as the results would not be directly applicable because many of the parts of the equation would be quite different when it comes to the Irish scene.</P>
    <P>Clonroche continues to act as a centre of excellence in soft fruit and beekeeping setting attainable production targets for the industry.  For strawberries, for example, the national average is 3.7 tonnes per acre and Clonroche yields 8.3 tonnes per acre &mdash; there is room for a lot of improvement in the national average &mdash; and for honey the national average is 17 lbs. per stock and in Clonroche they get 50 lbs. per stock.</P>
    <P>The practical benefits of research need <Col N="1285" /> to be highlighted.  I made this point in passing when I was talking about Johnstown and it can also be made about most of AFT: they have not sold properly to the general public what they have been doing.  Unfortunately, too many of us were unaware of the enormous and most important contribution they were making to our economy.  Results of trials in 1986 and 1987 producing strawberries for the April to June fresh market have clearly demonstrated that there is a growing system which will produce high quality cost effective yields capable of displacing the increasing volume of imported fruit. In addition, Clonroche has set new standards in presentation and packing for the soft fruit industry.  There is now renewed confidence in growers' ability to supply the Irish consumer with the type of fruit required and at prices comparable to those offered by importing agents.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act which, after a few hiccups, was passed by this House last May or June, confers direct responsibilities on us in this area.  The European Community plant health frontier directive for intra-community trade in strawberry, raspberry and blackcurrant plants will come into effect in 1992.  Plants moving in trade between member states must be accompanied by a plant health certificate.  AFT provide certified nuclear stock and diagnostic support services to enable the Irish plant producer to comply with these regulations.</P>
    <P>I could continue to emphasise the enormous contribution of Clonroche to the soft fruit industry in relation to fertilisers, pesticides and preservation generally. The station facilities at Clonroche are used for in-service training by ACOT advisers.  Close contact is also maintained with the IDA, Córas Trachtála, co-operatives and commercial interests.  I must ask the Minister to confirm his intentions for the future of Clonroche.  Does he consider that they provide an essential service?  I consider it to be an essential service, as do the soft fruit industry.  It is the only station in the country providing research and advice for the soft fruit industry.  Is it possible that the countrywide <Col N="1286" /> physical resources the Minister intends rationalising might conceivably include Clonroche?  I would ask the Minister, please, to be honest and frank with us, as I requested earlier.  The Minister knows exactly what he has in mind.  I would ask him, please, not to quote the new Authority to me.  Let us have the facts now so that we can get our act quite straight and be frank with the people on the ground on whom we depend to provide such important services for the future.</P>
    <P>Many of us have received information by way of publications, circulars and letters of one description or another from different interested parties since this Bill was mooted and indeed since the 1988 Estimate was announced in the House last autumn.  I might refer to some of them because there is tremendous merit in the information being disseminated to us as Deputies from the industry itself from, as it were, the top table to the people on the ground, to the different unions and so on; they have all rallied and promoted their causes.  Frankly it is my opinion they have done what is right because none of us was sufficiently aware of the work being done on the ground by ACOT and AFT.</P>
    <P>The views of the Agricultural Science Association were circulated in February of this year to all Members of the Oireachtas; I am sure I can assume that. They state that the position on the issue is very clear: to survive, farmers must now focus all of their expertise on efficiency, quality, marketing and good business management of their main enterprise and examine alternative income sources to supplement it.  There are 30,000 farmers only, or one in five, here capable of competing in the present hostile market environment.  That is quite a frightening statistic.  There are a further 55,000 farmers, one in three, capable of competing if adequate support services were available to them; in other words, if the Minister's commercial intentions for this new Bill are not such that the services are priced out of the reach of those 55,000 farmers who could compete had they adequate support services.  If, <Col N="1287" /> by commercialising all farm support structures, farm advice services, we will pitch the advice that will be coming through from our research teams to the top end of the farm market only, to the larger farmer, we will be doing the country an enormous disservice and will be writing the destiny and fate of the smaller, family farm which has been the backbone of farming here for the future.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Science Association go on to say that it is vital that advice and research are maintained and well funded to help farmers adjust and compete with their EC counterparts.  No matter to whom one talks, or which body is presenting their views, we come back to that basic research done by Yale University, which is well documented in the latest publication from AFT &mdash; which says basically that we are now spending the lowest on agricultural research as a percentage of our agricultural output of any of our European competitors.  The money we intend spending this year and in the future on agricultural research is the smallest amount of any of our European competitors.  Yet all the bodies tell us, including the ASA, that we must have the advice and research well funded to allow farmers adjust and compete with their EC counterparts.  The ASA say that these countries are less dependent on agriculture &mdash; we all agree there.  Yet their support services are being maintained and even increased.  Money spent to help farmers become self-sufficient makes better economic sense than money spent on income support when farms become non-viable.  Frankly, that is the bottom line for the smaller family farms. Perhaps there is a higher percentage of them west of the Shannon but there is not a county or constituency that does not have the family farm as the basis of its economy.  Perhaps we could exclude a few Dublin constituencies from that.  But there is no one, even in the Dublin constituencies, who is more than one generation removed from a family farm somewhere in the country.  Indeed they would be lucky if the distance they had to travel was to Dublin only or perhaps <Col N="1288" /> to Cork city.  Too many of them, because of the non-viable position of family farms, have had to leave the country altogether.  We must ensure that whatever steps we take here today, whatever measures we now put in place under the provisions of this merger Bill, will do nothing to increase that appalling problem of the number of family farms closing up shop, as it were, or of the numbers emigrating from the land.  At present the figure is in the thousands per decade.  If the provisions of this Bill drive more people from the land, particularly the smaller family farmer, we must re-examine them.  If the Minister is pitching advice services generally, which will now be on a commercial basis, to those who can afford to pay, then he will be neglecting those most in need of that same advice.  I repeat the views of the ASA: money spent to help farmers become more self-sufficient makes better economic sense that money spent on income support when farms become non-viable.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend increasing expenditure on farmers' dole because he will be charging the 55,000 farmers capable of competing but who cannot afford to pay for the equivalent of what was an ACOT service?  Is that what this Government intend for our family farms, the smaller farms, those on the border line of being able to compete?</P>
    <P>Incidentally I began my contribution last week on the less serious note of pleading with the Minister not to proceed with the name of this Authority.  That view is supported by the ASA and many others who have written to us.  I might reiterate that plea.  There are many alternatives being suggested.  I suggested two last week &mdash; AFDA, the Agricultural Food and Development Association, or ACOTT, with a second &ldquo;T&rdquo;, to allow for the inclusion of the Irish word for research &ldquo;Taighde&rdquo;.  Anything would be better than Teagasc.  Frankly, if Members of this House have difficulty in relation to that how will it be sold as an acceptable logo to the man in the street, to the public generally?  ACOT, the present body, have been very effective in selling their logo.  We are all now familiar with their <Col N="1289" /> radio advertisements which come on at 9 o'clock in the morning, at 6.30 in the evening after &ldquo;Farm Diary&rdquo; and the other suitable points at which they are slotted in on the media.  Their logo and so on has become acceptable in terms of the service they are endeavouring to deliver and indeed in terms of the excellence of what they have been doing. Whatever the Minister decides I would ask him: please, not the name of the Authority at present proposed in the Bill. That is all I ask.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Science Association state that all EC farm development schemes should be administered by the new Authority &mdash; I see they are even calling the new Authority AFDA &mdash; which would require the incorporation of the farm development service of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I have gone further, as my colleague and party spokesman, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe did.  Not only should the farm development service be included with the new farm Authority but so also should An Bord Glas and the research arm of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Science Association continue to say that the one-stop shop concept would ensure more cost-effective utilisation of scarce support services for farmers.  They also plead for the inclusion of the farm apprenticeship board in the new farm body.  That is worthy of consideration and its implications should be teased out.  Indeed we should have the benefit of the Minister's thinking in relation to it.  The ASA, and indeed many others, decry the undue Ministerial control of the day-to-day operational decisions and insist that this be removed. I join them in that plea.  Otherwise the Authority will not be dynamic and scarce resources will be used up in bureaucracy; that is self-evident.  AFT and ACOT have not suffered unnecessarily from interference from undue bureaucracy.  I would hate to see a layer of administration or interference now injected into these merged bodies which would mop up extremely scarce resources.</P>
    <P>They make the point that, in addition to food research, which must be market-led <Col N="1290" /> and funded by the industry, research in relevant production areas must be encouraged and intensified, otherwise we will be importing out-of-date technology from our competitors.  This basically comes back to what the Minister considers to be an &ldquo;essential service.&rdquo;  I take that expression from page 6 of the Minister's Second Stage speech.  Without the benefit of knowledge of what the Minister or the Department consider to be an essential service we really cannot debate the issue.  The Minister said that those services of lower priority will be reduced or phased out.  Can he please indicate to us how he gives priority to the present services both in ACOT and AFT so that we will know what type of judgment to make in relation to his proposals?</P>
    <P>A most interesting document has been circulated by ACOT.  It was compiled by Tom Arnold, a senior economist with ACOT and many of the points he makes are worthy of consideration and a response from the Minister.  Perhaps the most pertinent point comes back again to the budgetary issue of the new Bill.  Mr. Arnold insists that a question which must be asked is whether those responsible for this decision &mdash; and this refers to the severe cutbacks in the budget &mdash; seriously underestimated the contribution which agriculture can make to economic growth.  It appears that the Minister has, and to be fair it appears that he must have been, advised along these lines by the Department.</P>
    <P>Mr. Arnold goes on to remind us all of the contribution which agriculture and food are currently making to economic growth in this country.  We can agree with him when he says that it is by far our single most important industry in terms of the share of national income, exports and employment which it generates.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech referred to the primacy of agriculture in the economy.  Is that reference only aspirational?  That is all it can be unless the Minister is prepared, if I may use the vernacular, to put his money where his mouth is.  There is no point in talking about what you want for the Ireland of tomorrow, what is the best way to <Col N="1291" /> encourage eocnomic growth, what is the best way to stimulate GNP and which sector make the best contribution to GNP, if you choke the very body that the agricultural and food sectors will depend on for the future.  They should be advised on the market-led approach and the new technological advances they should be using.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to establish a bankrupt body who if they were the private sector today would be insolvent and gone long ago.  He is proposing to establish this body to help an industry that he and all of us agree has primacy on the Irish scene.  I do not have to remind the Minister that exports play a vital role in paying for essential imports and in earning the foreign currency needed to repay our massive foreign debt.  The £2.5 billion that this country earns from agricultural exports is in danger of being sacrificed by a bankrupt organisation which the Minister intends to establish.</P>
    <P>One billion pounds is earned in tourism revenue.  Tourists do not come to this country for the sun; they come for activity-based holidays or those who have gone abroad to earn a living come back to visit their families.  Let us take those who come here to enjoy our environment and activity-based special interest holidays based on our natural resources which we who have been born and bred in this country all too often take for granted &mdash; our green fields, clean air, clean waters, beaches and beautiful forests.  Perhaps we do not see these resources any longer.  We look at them but we do not see them because they have been around us for too long but those who visit Ireland every year to appreciate these natural amenities see them all too clearly.</P>
    <P>The research that is now needed in terms of the best way of maximising agricultural output and, at the same time, protecting our environment from the consequential waste disposal problems that result from intensive agriculture is perhaps one of the most essential services being given by AFT at present.  ACOT, based on the information and research <Col N="1292" /> of AFT, have a most important farm environment service in existence.  Will this be considered an essential service, to use the Minister's words?  Will the farm environment service be a service that will survive the merger?  Will there be room for it in the new Bill?  Are the services which advise and help farmers in relation to pollution, the difficulties associated with the intensification of farm practices and the added pressures on the environment in relation to waste disposal considered to be essential services?</P>
    <P>The Bill is but aspirational from beginning to end.  In fact, it is probably very like the Bill that Mark Clinton might have introduced in 1977, a Bill that the Fianna Fáil Minister of the day opposed.  Thank God for U-turns, at least we are all on the same lines on this occasion, if we have the money to see it through.  The Bill is aspirational.  There is nothing in it that anyone could possibly object to in terms of our hopes, wishes and aspirations for the future and, in particular, for the agricultural sector but there are no answers to the essential questions in relation to whether there is a future for this new body.</P>
    <P>ACOT, in one of their documents, say we should prevent silage pollution.  These are excellent documents and they provide excellent information.  I accept that basically farmers are only now awakening to the difficulties of managing their units and farms and, at the same time, protecting the environment.  In addition to what the food industry will demand, this will probably be one of the most essential research areas for the future.  Primary products have reached saturation level in Europe but the demands in terms of the protection of our environment, waterways, rivers, lakes, air quality, grasslands, a future quality of life for the Irish people, apart altogether from our visitors, and the protection of our natural heritage, which is the most important part of our physical environment, will probably to a large extent rest in the hands of this new body.  This is in addition to the advice they will give to farmers in relation to the type of practices and <Col N="1293" /> husbandry they should continue with over the years.</P>
    <P>In 1973 a very interesting document was published by Dr. Tom Walsh.  I mentioned earlier he was the first director of An Foras Talúntais, a Wexford man, from Piercestown in fact, the neighbouring parish to Johnstown Castle.  May I again state, to have it on the record, that the second and present director of An Foras Talúntais, Dr. Pierce Ryan, is also a Wexford man, from Taghmon, and his family were very proud of the contribution of Wexford to An Foras Talúntais as well as to ACOT.  It looks as if Dr. Pierce Ryan will be the last director of An Foras Talúntais.  Dr. Tom Walsh is known particularly for a number of publications and indeed research generally on soil and grassland management and that area.  He was also a good administrator.  He was the director of AFT, a most important body as we have come to appreciate perhaps a little late but nonetheless we now do.  I quote from a document entitled <i>Administering a Research Organisation in Changing Times</i> by T. Walsh, Director.  We have to remind ourselves that this document was written in 1973 just as we were about to go into the EC.  He says that the OECD has aptly summarised the place of agricultural research today as follows:</P>
    <P>Agricultural research needs to be seen in a wide and changing context, in relation to the structure of the agricultural industry, and to society as a whole, in relation to human needs for food, employment, and recreation in nature, and in the whole relation to the environment, as well as its relationships to science and technology.</P>
    <P>Indeed we could well dwell on those words and hope that they will be as relevant to the new farm body, the new merged body that we are discussing here today, as they have been to both AFT and ACOT's role over the past few years. Dr. Tom Walsh went on to say:</P>
    <P>In An Foras Talúntais we have always presented our activities in terms <Col N="1294" /> of well defined programmes and priorities.</P>
    <P>What are today's priorities?  The Minister says that he will concentrate on essential services and those of lower priority will be reduced or phased out.  Would the Minister let us know what his priorities are and what he considers an essential service?  I will continue to quote from Dr. Walsh's document:</P>
    <P>We have asked for finance to carry these out, no more and no less.</P>
    <P>This was in 1973.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling, however, that in some instances our funding has been on the basis of some notion of what agricultural research used to be rather than what it now is.</P>
    <P>Could I be impertinent and suggest that the 1988 Estimate of the Fianna Fáil Government for Agriculture has to be based on some notion of what agricultural research used to be rather than what it is now.  If we are prepared to accept a reduction of 43 per cent in the budget of AFT and ACOT, we can only assume, as Dr. Walsh had deduced in 1973, that the funding had been on the basis of some notion of what agricultural research used to be rather than what it is now.  Fifteen years later those words which relate to the Department of Agriculture's view of agricultural research and the basis of its funding are as relevant today.  That is an indictment, I am afraid, of how we have treated agricultural research down through the years and indeed substantiates the findings of Yale University with which I started my contribution today.</P>
    <P>We are still spending the lowest percentage of our agricultural output on research and advisory services in Europe, the main market for our £2.5 billion food exports.  Our farmers cannot be competitive and cannot have the same advantage as their international counterparts, to use the Minister's expression when we are not allowing them that advantage and denying them research and advice.  It further states in Dr. Walsh's document:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> It is now fully accepted that knowledge is a production resource as well as land, labour and capital...</P>
    <P>Planning in the modern economy is a complex matter and cannot be left to hunch.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a lot of hunches in the Minister's Second Stage speech: &ldquo;essential services&rdquo;&mdash; would the Minister name them?  &ldquo;Those of lower priority will be reduced&rdquo;&mdash; would the Minister please name them?  &ldquo;Rationalisation of countrywide physical resources&rdquo;&mdash; where has the Minister in mind to close down, because that is basically what that translates to when we use vernacular?</P>
    <P>Planning in the modern economy is a complex matter and cannot be left to hunch.  It cannot be done in a rational way without scientifically established data and information... Intelligent national programming and the development of public policy cannot exist to-day without research-based information as an essential input.</P>
    <P>The words ring so true even today.</P>
    <P>It is a function of research to generate the required information.  Only if we are equipped with such data can we hope to exert an influence on the rate and direction of development of the economy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take note of those words issued 15 years ago but more relevant than ever today.  Dr. Walsh further states:</P>
    <P>Entry to the EC now exposes us to external influences stronger than we have experienced in the past.</P>
    <P>Any Minister for Agriculture who has fought the Irish case into the night around the tables in Brussels will surely agree with Dr. Walsh's statement made in 1973.</P>
    <P>If we do not equip ourselves, both our route and our destination will be determined for us by influences beyond our understanding and outside our control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The application and utilisation of research-based information is therefore a major challenge...More effective mechanisms for information and technology transfer, that is basically disseminating the information that AFT gathered through research, through the ACOT services to the farmers, and the commercialisation of new products and processes can be accelerated.</P>
    <P>Dr. Tom Walsh outlines that in developing our research programmes the basic principles that would have to guide our approach is that the maximum use must be made of the results of research which are available to us from outside; hence our emphasis on the international context.  We must identify areas of need or potential where an indigenous research effort would be of benefit and undertake the necessary research.  We must try to see that the results of research are integrated and used in commercial practice as widely and as quickly as possible.  This could be the commandments for the bodies under the merger Bill 15 years later.  It is unbelievable we have wasted 12 years because Fianna Fáil would not support Fine Gael's Bill in 1977 when we were trying to achieve just that.</P>
    <P>The success of any research and advice programme, the success of any education based programme to young farmers will depend on the personnel.  Good research depends on good ideas.  Good ideas as Dr. Walsh says:</P>
    <P>...are the product of an imaginative, creative people.</P>
    <P>At present the imagination and creativity of most of the members of ACOT and AFT have been fairly well diluted, morale is on the ground.  Dr. Walsh further says:</P>
    <P>This can be achieved through a progressive personnel policy which provides an environment conducive to the development of creativity and innovation.</P>
    <P>I doubt that is what we have at present.</P>
    <P>It has been possible for us to attract <Col N="1297" /> staff of high quality both from home sources and from other countries.</P>
    <P>With the voluntary redundancy scheme creaming off the best we have at the moment and those who are left not knowing what their future holds, I am afraid the whole area of personnel needs immediate attention.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I outline the points of the Bill which I and my colleagues find unsatisfactory: the name, the board, the ministerial power, the Minister's proposals for the county committees of agriculture.  What will be left in their wake and what will replace them?  This is perhaps one of the most important issues we have discussed for a long time in this House.  We all agree on the importance of the agriculture and food industry and the contribution it has made and can make in the future to the GNP and the economy generally.  I ask the Government to please make what are now all the aspirations a reality and answer the most pertinent questions with regard to funding and what their priorities are, which centres will stay and which will go and what the role of the new merged farm body essentially will be.  I await the Minister's answers with interest.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies in their first report to this Dáil have recommended that the Government take an early decision on the submission to the Government made by the company, that is, Irish Life Assurance Company, in order to eliminate the present uncertainty.  A submission by the company to the Government seeks the restructuring of the capital base of the company in a manner which would effectively lead to their privatisation.</P>
      <P>The Government should make their decision immediately and I call on them to agree to restructure the capital of the company to enable the company to continue to grow and expand their business internationally and at the same time to realise some of the shareholding of the company for the benefit of the Irish Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Irish Life Assurance plc were incorporated on 15 March 1939 to carry on the business of life assurance.  The decision by the State to enter the life assurance business was not a ideological one.  The Taoiseach of the day was no Hugh Gaitskell capturing the commanding heights of the economy for the State sector.  The decision was pragmatic.  The private companies which were rolled together to form Irish Life were broke.  The State came in to rescue them and to protect the policyholders.  The State being in, stayed in, and the company prospered but the original decision was based on the same pragmatic criteria which involved the State in the other areas of the economy; those of rescue and protection of the savings of citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1939 the shares in the company were held as follows: British Life offices 72 per cent; Irish Life office 10 per cent; Minister for Finance 18 per cent.  In 1947 the Minister for Finance purchased the shares of the British Life offices for £110,000.  Since then there has been little change in the ownership of shares in the company.  The shares are currently held as follows: Minister for Finance 90.3 per <Col N="1299" /> cent; others 9.7 per cent.  The shares in Irish Life, of course, are not quoted on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister for Finance holds over 90 per cent of the shares, very little of the profit of the company accrues to the Exchequer.  This has been the case since the company were incorporated in 1939, but was exacerbated in 1971 when, to enable the company to compete more effectively in the area of life policy with profits, the company were virtually mutualised.</P>
    <P>The company's capital structure was reconstructed in 1971, whereby the shareholders' entitlement to profits was reduced from 20 per cent to 2 per cent. As a consequence, a sum of £1.6 million was paid to shareholders and the principal shareholder, the Minister for Finance, received the bulk of this.</P>
    <P>As a result of this restructuring the company were run to all intents and purposes for the benefit of the policy holders rather than the shareholders.  As the principal module of business at the time consisted of with-profit policies, the company were run for the benefit of these policyholders.</P>
    <P>Under the company's articles the with-profit policyholders have a &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; right to 98 per cent of all the surplus it is chosen to declare for policyholders and shareholders.  The shareholders and, as I say, the bulk of the shares are held by the Minister for Finance, get the remaining 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising those who made this decision in 1971.  When giving evidence before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies on 23 July 1986, Mr. David Kingston, Managing Director of Irish Life said:</P>
    <P>In this particular situation there was an actuary from the UK, an expert in this area, employed by the Government.  The position has shifted somewhat since 1971.  At that time the company was keen to become mutual because the with-profit business, giving bonuses to policyholders, seemed to be the core of the business.  The business <Col N="1300" /> has changed somewhat in the last 15 years and the bulk of our business now is unit linked business where the investment performance goes to the policyholder &mdash; what we call non-profit business.  In other words the policyholder puts in his £100, we invest it on his behalf, we take a proportion of that for expenses, mortality risks and so on and he gets the rest.  We make our profit out of hoping that we keep our expenses below what we are charging him and we hope that our death claims will be below what we are charging.  This is not just true of Irish Life, it is true of the life assurance industry generally.</P>
    <P>In a sense it has moved away from mutuality as a concept and more towards a business where policyholders have largely non-profit policies.  Obviously capital backing will be needed so that if one gets into difficulties there will be something to support that and to provide the sort of solvency margins which are required by the supervisory authorities.  In 1971 we would have said the ideal structure for Irish Life would have been mutual whereas in 1986 we might say the ideal structure would be one where shareholders were entitled to a much higher proportion of the profits than they are at present.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise that decision.  It was taken facing the circumstances of the company at the time and was probably a good decision at the time but circumstances have changed enormously in the type of business which the company transact in the intervening period and we must now face the changing circumstances and be as realistic as our predecessors were in 1971 and face the decision now again to restructure the company, to face the needs of the eighties and nineties.  The quotation from Mr. Kingston can also summarise the need now for restructuring the capital of the company.  This restructuring is necessary for two reasons and my case rests on these two reasons.  First, the present structure is now inhibiting the growth of the company.  Secondly, one of the largest <Col N="1301" /> and most successful multinational companies in Ireland is owned by the State, but the Exchequer does not benefit directly from the success of the company. Obviously, there are tax and PRSI payments accruing from the fact that the company employ 1,600 people, but there is no direct transfer of surpluses to the shareholder which, in effect, is the State.</P>
    <P>I now propose to discuss these two factors because it is on them that the case for privatising Irish Life rests.  Mr. J. P. Reihill, Chairman of Irish Life, as reported in the Minutes of Evidence of the sitting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, pages 1 and 2, said:</P>
    <P>We trade and compete as a commercial life insurance company and unlike other State controlled companies, do not fulfil any special role on behalf of Government.  Our principal job is to provide the best possible returns to our policyholders &mdash; our shareholders are entitled to a tiny proportion of our surpluses.  Shareholders have never been asked for money since the company was founded.</P>
    <P>I say these things at this stage so that you will appreciate that Irish life is run as a commercial concern.  Future planning and detailed running of the company in the competitive markets in which we operate in Ireland and the UK must be a matter for the board of the company and its management.</P>
    <P>One of the things which will be immediately obvious to you is that, because of its very success, Irish Life has an extremely large share of the Irish market.  While we expect the Irish Life assurance and savings market to continue to grow, it would be unwise for us to depend totally on that market for future growth.  There are two reasons for this.  First, it is unwise for any organisation, particularly a financial one, to have too many &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; in one basket.  Secondly, the way in which financial business is transacted worldwide is changing and becoming more international.  In this context, Irish Life <Col N="1302" /> has little option but to become more international itself.</P>
    <P>Irish Life entered the UK market almost 20 years ago, and it was run literally very much as part of the Irish business in terms of products, etc.  A major expansion in our activities there was initiated in 1978 and this area of our business now accounts for a significant proportion of our business. Necessarily, this has been achieved by the development of specific products to meet the local demands of that market and to comply with differing legislation, but it continues to be run as a branch operating with common senior management and firm control from the chief office.  It is important to note that the increased level of employment which this has created in the UK is well matched by increased employment throughout chief office to manage and service this business.</P>
    <P>As Irish Life looks further ahead, it will have to operate in a different fashion: the very close similarities between the UK and home markets will be absent.  Prudence dictates we establish the overseas business as a separate legal entity.  That way the financial progress can be monitored much more clearly and the interests and protection of policyholders and shareholders are maximised.  The subsidiary could be created by setting up a new company or by the purchase of an existing company.  Either way capital is necessarily required.</P>
    <P>It is essential that Irish Life expands abroad; indeed this is extremely desirable from a national point of view.  It is vital that some milti-nationals, particularly financial ones, should be Irish based.  In order to make it easier for Irish Life to expand overseas, some form of capital reorganisation may be necessary to allow new infusions of capital.  Such a reorganisation is desirable for other reasons such as the remuneration of shareholders.</P>
    <P>You may gather that Irish Life does not want to rest on its past progress. We believe that the clear definition of Irish Life's responsibilities in reporting <Col N="1303" /> has worked extremely well and has been a major factor in its success.</P>
    <P>One does not always have to agree with the statements or submissions of chairpersons of commercial State-sponsored bodies to committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas but that encapsulates the case for a restructuring of the capital base of the company so that the company can expand in its own interest, in the interests of the employees and in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It is clear from that submission I have quoted and indeed from any examination of the company, that Irish Life dominate the Irish market; that Irish Life can grow very little more if their activities are confined to Ireland; that if the company are to continue to grow they must further expand in the UK and establish a strong presence in the United States.  They must get ready to establish in Europe in advance of the completion of the internal market in 1992.  To achieve these objectives the capital base of the company must be restructured.  Expansion cannot continue if they depend entirely on the reinvestment of surplus funds.  It is clear that the main shareholder, the Minister for Finance, is not in a position to provide the capital necessary for expansion.  I do not think this House or the community at large would expect him to provide the kind of funds which would be necessary for the expansion of a multinational company the size of Irish Life.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the further growth of the company is not only in the company's interest, and in the interest of their employees, it is also in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Apart from the necessity to restructure the capital of the company, one further problem arises from the fact that the company are a State company.</P>
    <P>When the company representatives gave evidence to the former joint committee in July 1986 they advised that about half the states in the USA had an objection to companies owned by other Governments and that this might inhibit the expansion of the company in the <Col N="1304" /> USA.</P>
    <P>However, in the course of the subsequent hearing of oral evidence by the joint committee in October 1987, the company disclosed that they had established an office in the US, that a French company was using a procedure called a &ldquo;voting trust&rdquo; of which the majority of the trustees were US citizens, to hold an American company, and that this procedure might be a short term solution to the company's problem of expanding into the US.</P>
    <P>It is not fully clear from the evidence what the present position is but it seems that the fact that Irish Life are a State company inhibits the growth of the company in the United States of America and will continue to do so.  Elsewhere, in the evidence produced to the joint committee, it appears that similar difficulties could arise in Spain.  We are all aware of the American distaste for doing business with companies owned by foreign powers.  I do not know the basis of the problem in Spain but if Irish Life are to expand prior to 1992 and subsequently in continental Europe, I do not think they can compete with the great multinationals of France and Italy.  The market gap is in Spain and, if there is to be an acquisition in continental Europe, Spain should be the target market and the company have admitted this already.  The same inhibition applies because it is a State company and there is a problem in acquiring a subsidiary in Spain and for expanding into that country.  There is nothing special about Spain but the evidence suggests that if Irish Life are to establish a substantial niche outside this country or the UK in a mainland continental European country, Spain seems to be the place to go.  I understand, from the evidence to the joint committee, that the ASTMS which represent the majority of employees in Irish Life have certain fears about the privatisation of the company.</P>
    <P>First, there is the fear that many of their members may become redundant as a result of privatisation.  The ASTMS have many members in the United Kingdom and I am sure they are drawing on the <Col N="1305" /> experience of their members in privatised industry in the United Kingdom.  I do not believe their fears are well founded but the company have an obligation to allay these fears and they should do so.</P>
    <P>It is clear, from the evidence presented to the Oireachtas joint committee that the intention of the company is to expand and to seek to remove the spancels that tie them down and prevent growth.  In that growth process, at home or abroad, extra staff will be required at head office to service the overseas market.  Members of the ASTMS also felt that a privatised company could be taken over by a multinational of the insurance industry and that control of the company could pass out of Irish hands.  This is a fear which should also be met.  Paragraph 107 of the report of the joint committee states:</P>
    <P>Apropos of this reservation the Joint Committee was advised by Irish Life that what was referred to as a &ldquo;Golden Share&rdquo; had been retained by the British government in the case of a number of entities which had been privatised (these included British Gas, Jaguar, Rolls Royce, British Airport Authority) which enabled the British government to maintain a veto over major changes, thus ensuring that no change can go through over a number of key issues.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 108 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Additionally, the French proposals in regard to UAP and AGS, two insurance companies currently being privatised in France, will ensure that foreign ownership will be limited to 20 per cent of the issued shareholding. Irish Life management believe that either of these approaches could effectively be used by the company in the event of privatisation.</P>
    <P>I believe that some such mechanism should be put in place if Irish Life is privatised.  Obviously, there is a company interest, there is certainly a national interest, but there is also the interest of the employees and their families.  Fears, whether real or not soundly based, should be met squarely by the company and any <Col N="1306" /> proposition they are making to the Government should be accepted.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the second leg of my argument.  The total assets of Irish Life Assurance plc at 31 December 1986 was £2.461 billion.  The Minister for Finance, on behalf of the people of Ireland, holds 90.7 per cent but the benefit to the Irish Exchequer is minimal.  It is difficult to explain to our citizens how we, as their trustees through the Minister for Finance, hold 90 per cent of a company worth £2.461 billion and do not get anything out of it.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the financial problems facing this country it is reasonable to expect that some of the fruits of success of such a manifestly successful Irish company should accrue to the State. To achieve this would require a restructuring of the capital of the company.  We must have one of the most ironic systems in the world because as this is a State company we do not get anything out of it.  To achieve the restructuring of the capital of the company would mean that certain decisions would have to be made. According to paragraph 110 of the report of the joint committee the company believe that &ldquo;the public issue of shares would be necessary if the Government wish to realise a significant proportion of all of their investment in Irish Life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe that a public issue of the shares held by the Minister for Finance would yield up to £300 million to the Exchequer after allowing for an appropriate payment to with-profits policyholders whose rights must be protected.  A flotation of shares on a once-off basis or over a period of years, would provide a very welcome cash inflow to the Exchequer.  This, I believe, should be used to replace borrowing rather than to be squandered on some pump-priming exercise.  I said at the outset that the decision in 1939 to incorporate Irish Life was a pragmatic one.  The decision now facing the Government should be made on equally pragmatic grounds.  I am asking all Members to make their decision in an equally pragmatic fashion. As I informed the House earlier, I am sharing my time with Deputy Yates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for facilitating me.  It is a great pity the Government have allowed the uncertainty over Irish Life to drag on so long. Since a Dáil question was answered by the Taoiseach on 12 October last we have had a commitment by the Government that they would study the proposals submitted by the company.  I was, as had been heralded in the media, expecting an announcement on this in the budget.  The publication of the excellent report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and the debate on the motion tonight means that there is no further need for procrastination on this matter; a decision is urgently required.  A delay in making a decision will only succeed in dampening morale in Irish Life and in dampening important investor confidence both for policyholders and for potential equity investors and shareholders.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the circumstances under which Irish Life came into being in 1945, with the amalgamation of different life assurance companies under the 1936 Act, bears no relation to current market conditions of the life assurance sector and international competitiveness in that component of the financial sector.  It should be said that Irish Life are, effectively, the biggest financial organisation here.  When one looks at their holdings in the two largest banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, at their controlling share in important non-life insurance companies such as Church and General, at their building society involvement and their involvement in equities in the Irish Stock Exchange, one will see that we are dealing with a very important company.  When the top executives and board of that company say, as they have been saying for 18 months, that they are inhibited, that they cannot develop in the way they want because of their capital structure and because of the company's articles of association, the House must take note not only in the interests of Irish Life but because of the different ways Irish Life are involved in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have been watching Irish <Col N="1308" /> Life closely will admit that even people who are opposed to privatisation as a point of principle, such as the unions involved, have a different view in regard to the privatisation of this company. When the unions put that question to employees at the time Irish Life were lobbying they learned that the staff were strongly in favour of management's proposals. It is clear there is not any argument in regard to that in the company. In relation to the overall debate on privatisation, it has to be said &mdash; I have studied this whole area when investigating 19 different State companies &mdash; that if we wish to pick any example of an easy State company to privatise Irish Life is the simplest because it is a plc, because it has already a shareholding structure. There are many statutory companies and statutory corporations set up under Acts of the Oireachtas that would be difficult to privatise and float on the Stock Exchange.  That is not the case with Irish Life.</P>
    <P>It strikes me as extraordinary that as a small country with a national debt of £27 billion we have not given consideration to realising how we can meet that debt. There are many different ways this can be handled.  It can be done by private placement, by flotation with a dual listing on the London and Dublin Stock Exchanges or by looking for a direct facility with some of the banks.  I have no doubt that the best way to proceed is to get the merchant bank which the State owns, ICC, to prepare an evaluation of the market conditions, of the price that would be correct for a public flotation and to control and plan the delivery to the potential investors.</P>
    <P>On a political point, it strikes me as extraordinary, judging by the amendment tabled by The Workers' Party, that one cannot talk about this whole area of privatisation without getting involved in emotional rhetoric.  It is interesting to note that Fianna Fáil, when in Opposition, made specific commitments in the area of State companies and public enterprise. It is perceived that if one is in favour of privatisation here one is Thatcherite but I do not accept that.  I agree <Col N="1309" /> wholeheartedly with what Deputy Noonan said, that this decision should be made in a pragmatic fashion given the liabilities and assets that the country has and the importance for Irish Life that they should develop.</P>
    <P>It strikes me as extraordinary that the shareholders of Irish Life should be limited to a 2 per cent return on investment for the profits under the existing Articles of Association.  The report of the joint committee was an excellent one although some of the final recommendations were less than trenchant.  However, we must commend the committee for the professional way they carried out their work. I accept that the committee had to meet different political views.  There is no doubt that the return to shareholders is entirely unsatisfactory.  If we were to change that and increase it from 2 per cent to 20 per cent, as recognition of the way the shareholder, namely the taxpayer, has been poorly represented in the past, we would go down the way of a legal minefield.  Any change in the articles of association to do that would leave the company open to several different types of litigation which could result in the company not achieving their initial goal. Changing the Articles of Association is not a realistic way forward.</P>
    <P>Another way forward suggested by many people who are <i>au fait</i> with the insurance industry, particularly the non-life insurance industry, is mutualisation. For example, Canada Life has been mutualised quite successfully.  Mutualisation is a bit of a scam in one respect. It operates on the basis of ultimate democracy.  The building societies are fully mutualised and operate on that basis but if one looks at the way they have operated and at the way they elect their management to the boards, and if one looks at the real chances of the outside punter, Muriel Scorer and others, one will see that they are not democratic institutions and are, in fact, closed shops.  I do not believe that mutualisation would bring the desired objectives.  I also believe that in a time of increasing competitiveness in the financial services sector it would be extremely cumbersome <Col N="1310" /> and undesirable.</P>
    <P>The critical questions for Irish Life are access to future funds, whether the existing revaluation system and reserves of capital are adequate to meet this and whether it is the best legal and actuarial way to finance future growth and expansion. I have no doubt that it is not and that there is an urgent need to get a new dynamic into Irish Life which should, of course, be outside shareholding.  People will put forward reasonable objections regarding the ultimate fate of Irish Life, whether it will be brought by some multinational conglomerate which will swallow it up or whether it will be eroded over a period of time and go outside the control of this House.  There are many different ways in which this House can retain control.  However, the means by which this should be done should be recommended in a professional way by a merchant bank.  It should not be done in a political way.  We must not have a botched solution whereby we would have political hacks on the board, the Devlin Report stifling recruitment of new staff and an overall departmental structure of supervision.  While all that is good for accountability, it strifles dynamism and growth.  Irish Life could have exceeded their own growth record if they had been released from such constraints as Devlin. The Government's decision not to award a 33 per cent pay increase to the Judiciary, higher civil servants and Members of this House is politically justifiable but is it right commercially?  Is it in the best interests of Irish Life?  Ways have been found of getting around the system, such as the Zeus contract for the B &amp; I.  This is one example of constraint imposed by the public sector on the commercial area.</P>
    <P>Surely we as elected representatives have an obligation to provide for economic development, welfare, education and health.  Do we have an obligation to be in the insurance business?  I do not believe so.  At a time when there are great constraints on public money we have not the opportunity to meet our debt requirements and our social obligations while at the same time running an insurance <Col N="1311" /> company.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of management expenses in the industrial branch of Irish Life which run at 50 per cent.  This compares with management expenses of 16 per cent or 19 per cent in a similar area in the UK.  I know that some of the figure can be offset by group sales but it is still too high.  This is an area in which the rigours of competition and privatisation would clear out the cobwebs.</P>
    <P>Another great advantage to the Irish taxpayer accruing from privatisation is that we would get more money in profits tax and corporation tax from the revised Irish Life than we are now getting as a shareholder.  There would be a strong profit motive in any person who invested in Irish Life looking for a rate of return. That would generate corporation profits alone which would make the present yield from our shareholding look totally disproportionate.  There is an obvious case for saying we would get more than the £2 million which is the total we have received in the 30 years from 1936 to 1986.  It is evident from a simple perusal of the accounts of Irish Life that they cannot fund any of their developments out of their shareholding.  It is the case that 0.12 per cent of shareholders' funds are of policy funds.</P>
    <P>Future growth must be overseas.  A number of factors are coming into play which put the privatisation of Irish Life well beyond any emotional or political considerations.  Technological developments which have no frontiers will mean that within a few years we will be able to see on our VDUs anything from our shopping list to our insurance requirements.  Such developments, together with the Single European Market from 1992, will revolutionise the current competitive situation in the non-life insurance sector. Any Irish company who want to develop beyond a certain stage must go overseas. Companies such as Smurfits and Cement Roadstone have done so and I have no doubt that this is a very good thing.  Some people have a backward and misguided attitude in these matters.  Last Friday at <Col N="1312" /> the CII annual conference I had the pleasure of listening to Martin Naughton. owner and chairman of Glen Dimplex. They started as a very small company employing 50 people.  Now they have Morphy Richards and Hamilton Beach in the USA.  Although Ireland accounts for a small percentage of their sales, 30 per cent of their workforce is in Ireland. Irish companies have a lot to give to the Exchequer and to the economy in terms of employment by overseas development. We should be very supportive of such development.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that if an overseas giant in the insurance sector wants to hurt Irish Life on the Irish market, all they have to do is set up an overseas branch in Dublin, subsidise that office and erode the market share of Irish Life.  That is being done at present.  Irish Life's market share varies from a half to a quarter, depending on which portfolio or market segment one examines.  Even though we are a small market of 3.5 million people there is no doubt that some of the giants will strike at Irish Life's market share.  Unless we allow Irish Life to do the same unto them we will not be playing fair.  Deputy Noonan has already said that in 31 American states there are legal prohibitions on a State-owned insurance company setting up.  Some loopholes have been found but it is entirely unsatisfactory that a major life assurance corporation should be dependent on backdoor deals to get into important markets.  There is no doubt that we could trade successfully in the ethnic market in the USA.  Travelling on someone else's coat tails is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, set up a review committee in conjunction with Irish Life to report on this matter.  That report is gathering dust in the office of the largest shareholder, the Minister for Finance.  It is imperative that the Government should make a decision to ask ICC, as the State merchant bank, to set about the best and most professional way of floating Irish Life.  We should put behind us the debacle of the Mid-Western United Life Assurance Company in November 1987 <Col N="1313" /> and look to the future.  We must look unemotionally, pragmatically and fairly at the interests of the Irish taxpayers who would get a much better return through corporation tax alone, not to speak of realising the profits which have accrued over the years.  There would be a much better return to the staff who would have one of the first options on shares, as in the case of privatisations abroad.  This would strengthen their employment and boost confidence in Irish enterprise.  To date we have had the wrong balance between the interests of taxpayers and the interests of policyholders of Irish Life.  We should change that balance and follow the ambitious plans set out by David Kingston and his colleagues to make Irish Life an international flagship business for Ireland that will improve its trading, improve its profits and repatriate them back home so that everybody in this community can share in the benefits and successes of Irish Life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Noonan and his party for providing an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House. The motion before the House this evening calls on the Government to make a very far-reaching decision.  Irish Life is one of the largest and most successful companies not just in the public sector but in the State.  It is our fifth largest financial institution with investments of the order of £2.5 billion at end 1986.  It has very substantial holdings of land and buildings, Government securities, equities and other assets and, by the nature of its investments, its position is probably more sensitive than certain other larger institutions.  Indeed in its 50th year of operation I congratulate the company on its notable success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret any suggestion made by Deputy Yates that the Irish Life board is composed of political hacks.  It must be said and agreed that the membership of the board is well respected no matter which side appointed them.  Some facts about the company bear repeating.  Irish Life, a public liability company, is the largest life assurance company in Ireland. <Col N="1314" /> The company markets life assurance business and industrial assurance business in Ireland and life business in the United Kingdom.  The company commanded 43 per cent of the life assurance market measured by net revenue premiums in this country at year end 1986. Total funds amounted to £2.46 billion including overseas business of £142 million.  Premium income for 1986 was £450 million net of reinsurance of which £58 million was in respect of overseas business.  New business for 1986 amounted to £296 million gross of which £43 million represented overseas business.  The company employs in excess of 1,600 people with almost 200 of these located in the UK.  In 1986 the company opened an office in the USA to examine opportunities in that market.</P>
    <P>On the other side of its balance sheet Irish Life has over £2 billion of liabilities to policyholders whose funds represent the main source of the considerable investment built up over the past 50 years.  The company has over one million policyholders, whose life assurance, permanent health and pension cover are underwritten by the company.  These policies extend far into the future, for perhaps over 40 years in some cases.  The company's liabilities to individual policyholders, and the latters' dependence on being paid, increases as the policy approaches maturity.  The amount shown in the balance sheet merely reflects the present value of these future liabilities.</P>
    <P>Because of the long term nature of life assurance business and of the scale of the liabilities that can arise, it is vital that life assurance companies have adequate capital resources.  If Deputies will bear with me I will illustrate this point with a rather simplistic example.  When a life company issues a policy with life cover of £5,000 and a guaranteed benefit of the same amount on maturity after 20 years, it must be in a position to pay immediately on the death of the policyholder.  If the premium payable is, say, £10 per month then the earlier the policyholder dies the more of the payment would have to come from the company's own resources, rather than from the accumulated <Col N="1315" /> investment of the premium.</P>
    <P>Similar problems could arise at maturity of the policy from poor investment performance.  Obviously, with a large pool of policyholders the incidence of claims is more predictable and the impact of individual claims on the funding of the company will be less.  In the case of all life assurance companies, however, prudent management ensures a substantial capital reserve to cover these eventualities.  Prudential regulation and supervision of life assurance also reinforces this arrangement.</P>
    <P>This problem comes to the fore when a company proposes to establish a new business, for instance a subsidiary in a new market.  Given the completion of the European Community internal market by 1992 this is a basic and important issue in all companies' corporate strategy, not just Irish Life's.  In this case the company must have sufficient resources to cushion its liability to present and future policyholders and to establish the new entity on a similar prudential basis.  These resources have to come from somewhere other than policyholders.  The two obvious sources are shareholders and retained profits.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the completion of the European Community internal market I think it is vital that all financial institutions should be building this factor into their corporate programme.  I note that this is the case with many of our Continental counterparts. We have seen well-published moves to build up European financial conglomerates.  We cannot afford to be left behind or marginalised in such developments.  A strong indigenous financial sector will be vital in the nineties.  The value which export of services can provide to an economy is well recognised.  It will be the Government's aim in bringing forward legislative proposals to the House this year on financial institutions to do what can reasonably be done to foster or, at least, to remove unwarranted inhibitions on developments in this direction.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish Life, as has rightly <Col N="1316" /> been pointed out already, the level of shareholders' funds is relatively low.  An increase in those funds through the sale of additional shares would not be a practical proposition in view of the restrictions on the distribution of the surplus of the company.  The company, therefore, has relied on retained profits, partially represented by the investment and valuation reserve, to build up its resources.  One of the questions that must be addressed is whether this structure is adequate to ensure a future for the company and to meet the requirements implicit in its development plans.  The company, in examining these matters, came to the conclusion that its interest might be better served by greater reliance on and access to share capital as a source of finance for its future.  Constructive proposals as to how this might be brought about were put forward and are at present being examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>The recently published report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies gives considerable detail on the present structure and operations of Irish Life, its capitalisation, profit distribution and plans for the future.  I would like to pay tribute to the substantial work of the committee and the fairness and accuracy of the report. It is of considerable assistance in the examination of the proposal for the restructuring of the company.  As I am sure Deputies are familiar with the contents of the report I will try to avoid duplicating its contents and concentrate instead on certain other issues which are of relevance to the Government, both in their role as shareholder and in the much broader context of their responsibilities to the nation.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee report does, however, touch on several of the issues involved.  It provides a balanced examination of the processes to be gone through in giving practical effect to any change in the company's status.  I know Deputies will find the report a clear and useful exposition of what is a difficult subject.  It will be clear from what the committee say that it is no simple matter to change Irish Life's basic charter and <Col N="1317" /> that assessments will be needed at several stages in the process on how best to proceed.  The committee's report also make it clear just how successful the company has been, starting from humble origins in the forties when some of the principal former shareholders had so little faith that they were only too willing to be rid of their holdings.  Too often we do not give ourselves credit for what we, as Irish people, can do even in skill intensive areas like life assurance.  The Government do not share this lack of faith and have shown their commitment by the important and successful initiative in the Irish financial services sector.  I am glad to say that Irish Life too has given its vote of confidence, in the most important way, that is, by investing in one of the projects already announced.</P>
    <P>As shareholder, the State has an interest in ensuring that the company is properly capitalised and pays a dividend on its investment.  Because of the arrangements dating from 1971 whereby the declared surplus of the company on with-profits policies is divided in the proportion 98:2 between with-profits policyholders and shareholders there is, as the joint committee pointed out, a restriction on the amount of dividend paid by the company.  The shareholders were paid a capital sum for their agreement to this arrangement.  They have continued to receive a dividend on their shares in the intervening years.  This arrangement has also enabled the company to retain within its own resources much of the accumulated surplus from business other than with-profits business.  To this extent, shareholders have been absolved from a need to inject further capital.</P>
    <P>Because with-profits business is no longer the mainstay of the company's activities, the restriction on distribution of the surplus effectively puts a cap on the shareholders' dividend.  Consequently, its ability to attract or remunerate new share capital is impeded.  A capital reorganisation of the company would be required so as to increase the scope for shareholder participation.  This reorganisation would clearly have to be carried out in a way which safeguards the <Col N="1318" /> interests of the policyholders, to whom specific commitments have been given about their participation in the profits on their investment.  This is a far from simple undertaking in the light of the number of policyholders and the variety of policies. Quite apart from the contractual commitments implicit in the articles of association of the company and in individual policy documents, it must also be borne in mind that insurance legislation generally is designed to protect the interests of policyholders.  This principle applies not just in the case of Irish legislation but in that of other countries where Irish Life operates.  The State and other shareholders, therefore, cannot act without proper regard to the interests of policyholders.  Any restructuring would have to be carried out in such a way as to protect policyholders' interests.  Because of the extremely narrow base of the present share structure it would obviously be necessary to carry out a successful restructuring of the company before the question of disposing of the State's shareholding could be considered.  The broader issues of the principle of the State reducing its holding and its merits in this case have also to be considered.</P>
    <P>Many of the general arguments for and against State divestment do not apply in the case of Irish Life.  The company has operated successfully and commercially without placing demands on the State for additional funds and with a minimum of input from official quarters.  It has proved itself not just in the home market but with success in the much more competitive UK market as well.  While Irish Life has built up a dominant position in the market it is far from enjoying a monopoly and faces increasing competition.  There is no apparent reluctance on the part of private investors to become involved in the provision of life assurance services and it is difficult to claim specific social or strategic interests which would justify retention of the holding.  In practice, therefore, the arguments to be considered are those specific to Irish Life. The origins of the State's ownership, of course, are also due to a set of specific circumstances arising from the insolvency <Col N="1319" /> of certain life assurers in the thirties which I have referred to already.  We got into this because we had to, not necessarily because it was felt that State ownership of life assurance was best.</P>
    <P>We must in deciding these questions look further than the Irish context.  The small size of the Irish insurance market and likely competition from foreign insurers limits the potential for growth. Irish Life has expanded successfully into the UK and has maintained and increased its employment.  For the reasons I described earlier, to continue this expansion and to consolidate employment prospects requires access to further capital funds.  The funding of this expansion out of the reserves of the company is not satisfactory.  Reserves can only be accumulated slowly from profits and adequate provision must first be made for prudential requirements.</P>
    <P>The State's majority shareholding may present an impediment to expansion in some markets, including certain parts of the US market.  This is more so in the rich and populous states which maintain a legislative ban on trading by State-owned entities.  Short term solutions may be available to remove this impediment but this is not the best way to proceed in a long term market.  The State-owned tag may also be a more general disadvantage in selling the company's products, particularly where competitors may try to represent State ownership as having a sinister implication.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed for employment levels in the company should its status change.  This is an important consideration.  I would not like to see any negative effects.  Irish Life, however, is an efficient team working in a very competitive sector.  It has, as I said earlier, managed to maintain and increase employment in such an environment. Some would see the potential for access to wider capital funding as contributing to, not detracting from, the prospects of the staff.</P>
    <P>Under the present structure the returns which the State can earn by way of dividends from the company are severely <Col N="1320" /> restricted.  Since 1971 the dividends received by the State amount to £1.8 million, £2.8 million gross.  The assets of the company grew from £111 million to £2,461 million in that time.  A capital restructuring and sale of the shareholding could yield a significant capital gain which can be used to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  However, it could be argued that a restructuring without disposal of the shares would yield an adequate return to the State and, at least in the short term, meet the interests and requirements of the company.</P>
    <P>A common argument against a sale of part or all of the State's holding is that it would transfer to the private sector resources which have been built up and developed by the State.  In practice, however, these resources were built up from the trading activities of the company.  To the extent that they are transferred to the private sector their value would be recouped through obtaining the market price for the shares.  I will return to the question of market price later.</P>
    <P>It may also be felt that the State shareholding provides for the exercise in the public interest of important control over the company's operations and investments which are very significant in almost all areas of economic activity.  In practice, the State has had no specific influence on the day-to-day management of Irish Life, or indeed of any other comparable investment institution.  In any event the company and all other life offices are obliged under insurance law to manage their investments in the interests of policyholders.  Any attempt to alter this position to serve the interests of the State would affect sales of insurance policies at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Similarly, concern has been expressed that a change in ownership could result in a switching abroad of all or part of its investments, with a consequent capital outflow.  However, Irish Life and indeed all life insurers are required under supervision rules to maintain within the State not less than 80 per cent of the assets representing liabilities to Irish policyholders. The current operation of exchange control provisions also restricts <Col N="1321" /> the company's capacity to switch its asset holdings abroad.  However, these are substantial issues.  One would wish to see the company retain its essentially Irish nature.  Very few domestic life insurance companies are now Irish-owned and the number has been getting smaller.</P>
    <P>The main concern arising from a sale of the State shareholding would appear to be the prospect that the company could fall into unsuitable hands or would pass into foreign control.  There are several options available which might assuage these dangers.  Briefly, these involve the inclusion in the memorandum and articles of association of the company of provisions designed to prevent unacceptable transactions.  The type of transaction could include the transfer of establishment, or of control over important assets.</P>
    <P>The most significant of these is the &ldquo;Golden share&rdquo; arrangement which has been mentioned already. Under this the State could retain a special share effectively enabling it to veto any fundamental changes to the company's structure. Restrictions might also be placed on the size of individual or foreign holdings or both.  These arrangements have to be considered carefully in the context of company law, both domestic and EC. Their practicality and suitability to the future needs of the company and the State need to be assessed.  They have been used elsewhere in the privatisation of State companies with some success and it is claimed that they have no significant impact on the share price.</P>
    <P>There are also, of course, various other mechanisms generically referred to as &ldquo;poison pills&rdquo; which have been used to protect certain quoted companies, particularly in the USA.  In practice it has been found that some of these have rebounded at a later stage against the best interests of the company they were designed to protect.  We would have to proceed very cautiously in this area to avoid storing up troubles for the future.</P>
    <P>This term &ldquo;poison pills&rdquo; is a new one for me and may be for Deputies generally. <Col N="1322" />  I am told that &ldquo;poison pills&rdquo; basically operate through special clauses in the constitution of the company or in binding agreements or covenants on that company.  These clauses are designed so that anyone gaining control of the company's share capital through a takeover would have to spend additional large sums of money before taking over its management and direction.  The more usual forms are requirement that the contracts of existing directors, executors or perhaps even shareholders would have to be bought out at very inflated prices, a requirement to inject substantial additional share capital into the company within a short period of the takeover, or a restriction on the disposal or use of assets of the company.  Greater ingenuity has been displayed in the devising of such packages and some takeover advisers specialised in their creation and dismantling.  It has been found in some cases that such packages inserted originally as a protection against fraudulent takeovers subsequently turned out to the disadvantage of the company when they sought to engage in an agreed merger.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable speculation about the possible value of the company on disposal.  At this stage I would merely like to say that there is no scope for a definitive valuation.  The value of shares would be determined by the net worth of the company, its present and future profitability and the mechanism of distribution of profits to shareholders, all of which would influence the amount investors are willing to pay.</P>
    <P>Under the present structure of the company many of these items are not at all transparent.  Accordingly, it would be necessary to re-organise the capital structure of the company before any serious attempt could be made to value the shares accurately.  As I pointed out earlier this process will be complicated.  It could take some time to carry out.  In the meantime the ongoing trading of the company will result in substantial changes in its balance sheet and in its spread of business and profitability.  While these items would hopefully be reflected clearly under the revised structure, there is no <Col N="1323" /> prospect of predicting what the final figures would be at that stage.  The state of the equity market at that time could also have a very significant influence on the proceeds.  I need only refer to the events of last October to illustrate this point.</P>
    <P>I have carefully rehearsed the arguments for and against a change in the company's status.  The range of issues involved shows the care and attention needed in reaching a decision, and the danger of a snap response.  I know Deputies will appreciate that.  I know they will also acknowledge that the Government have been frank on this matter.  I have outlined the position quite plainly in response to several questions in the House.  I indicated the discussions that were going on.</P>
    <P>The company in their annual report last May adverted to these discussions. The Taoiseach in an address at an Irish Life function last October set out candidly what was happening.  The Taoiseach indicated that particular proposals put by the company were being examined and that the Government would make their decisions on the basis of what is in the public interest.  This is the parameter within which such an important decision must be made.  The House has been kept well informed and that is what I am doing here tonight.</P>
    <P>It is important also to realise that what we are talking about is a decision whether or not to begin a process.  Even if a particular decision were made now, the process of restructuring, forming new entities, seeking necessary court and other approvals, preparing of prospectuses, establishing a track record etc. will take time to put into effect.  I am not putting this forward as an excuse for procrastination but it is a point that might be well borne in mind.  A decision has been called for to allay uncertainty over the company's future.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to find Deputy Yates in his address talking about the confidence of investors being damaged by lack of decision.  This is not helpful when one is talking about financing institutions.  With all the contributions <Col N="1324" /> Deputy Yates has made with regard to financial institutions, he above all Deputies should know that.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House and the public at large that irrespective of the decision, the company's financial health is unaffected.  It is a strong profitable secure and efficient company &mdash; a credit to Irish financial expertise.  Policyholders can rest with certainty on that assurance.  Whether the company is state owned or not does not affect this position.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the interest of the House in this subject.  I am accepting the motion that the Government should make an early decision on this issue.  With this in view the Government are considering the best advice on where the balance of advantage lies, and on what practical steps are necessary to resolve the complex issues involved in settling the future of the company.  Such advice would be ongoing as there are many basic issues to address to ensure a fair return for the State, the company and its policyholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion here tonight is too narrowly cast.  I would have preferred it if the motion had been wider. The Progressive Democrats would have preferred a motion which called on the Government to issue and publish a White Paper examining the prospects for privatisation of all appropriate commercial semi-State companies and bodies for existing functions within the public service and municipal services which are capable of being carried out by the private sector.  In the short term we would have preferred to proceed with a programme to prepare Irish Life Assurance for the sale of its shares to members of the public, including its employees.  The motion should have been cast in a manner which indicated a positive commitment to embark on the process the Minister for <Col N="1325" /> Finance has so carefully described here this evening.</P>
      <P>The answer should be in the simple terms posed by Deputy Yates, either yes or no.  We believe the answer should be yes, that Irish Life should be privatised. Tonight's motion from the Fine Gael Party offers a very useful opportunity to consider not simply this company and its affairs but also the whole purpose of privatising and the philosophy that lies behind it.  The wider amendment to which I have just referred would have been desirable to gather and ascertain the support of this House, not merely to hasten a decision in relation to Irish Life, but also to oblige the Government to assess critically the entirety of the public sector, including the public service, semi-State sector and local government sector with a view to privatising those aspects of the public sector which seem most appropriate.  Listening to the Minister describing, in this case, the sequence of events that would be necessary to privatise Irish Life, it occurs to me that the various steps in terms of restructuring the company's capital basis and share structure, renegotiating perhaps with some of the affected parties an alteration of their interest and applying to the courts, will not happen in a matter of weeks once a decision is made this way or that on the issue.  It follows from that that if privatisation of Irish Life is to be the flagship of privatisation and the project which is to be to the fore in considering the success or desirability of privatisation generally, we will be a long time awaiting any positive indication of whether it was a good or bad idea or of how easy it was to implement the whole privatisation process.  That is why it is important not simply to await the sequence &mdash; which will be protracted &mdash; to which the Minister refers in making decisions about other analagous companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose a blanket policy of privatisation for its own sake but I am seeking critically to examine each aspect of the public sector so that it can be decided on a rational economic and social basis whether each function or institution we find there would not be better carried <Col N="1326" /> out by a non-State body or as a non-State service.  There is a danger that the recent adjustment in the Stock Exchange to which the Minister for Finance referred would create a lack of confidence and a mood of pessimism which would make us shy away from taking any political risks on the whole privatisation matter.  It is desirable that this House be not frightened off by the instability of the Stock Exchange last October from taking a long, hard look at the whole concept of privatisation.  Without being narrowly ideological on the issue, I think there are certain principles which the House should be guided by in the matter.</P>
    <P>First, the State should concentrate its efforts and resources in areas where it is likely to be most successful.  It follows from that as a corollary that it should avoid diluting the time and resources of Government itself in fields where it has no prospect of success.  In the case of Irish Life the State did not enter into the life assurance market, as the Minister has pointed out, as a matter of choice.  It found itself confronted with a situation which demanded its intervention, but the argument still applies that the State should concentrate its efforts and the limited political resources which any Cabinet &mdash; even one as illustrious as this &mdash; has on issues it is best qualified to deal with. Resources and time of Departments of State, it seems, are taken up by semi-State bodies or commercial activities under their control and it detracts from the capacity of Government to deal with the other more pressing, urgent issues of the day if the time of Ministers is spent running radio stations, insurance companies, turf production companies and the like.</P>
    <P>The second principle I would like to suggest is that the State should, wherever possible, leave to others to do that which can be properly carried out by them. Against that second principle the decision should be if at all possible to privatise Irish Life.  Thirdly, the State should deploy its legislative and executive powers in efforts to free up and encour- <Col N="1327" /> age competitive market forces in the provision of services and the allocation of social resources.  Again in the context of Irish Life I make the point that there are definite inhibiting consequences to the State's involvement in Irish Life, and the Minister, Deputy Yates, and Deputy Noonan have dealt with them.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the State as a net borrower, which it is likely to be for a considerable time in a developing economy, should marshal its assets with a view to minimising interest payments.  If the State is receiving a negligible or zero return on hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of assets but has to pay 10 per cent interest on annual borrowings of the same amount, it makes sense to realise those unproductive assets and apply the proceeds in lieu of fresh borrowing and fresh interest liabilities.  Last, and perhaps most important, the concept of privatisation of State functions should not be seen merely as a public placing of shares in State run industries.  My and my party's view is that from house building, maintenance and sanitary services of local authorities to production of metal ores, energy, transport, printing, scientific and information services and publishing, the entire State sector has to be gone over with a fine comb to see whether those activities now carried out by the State might not be better or more efficiently done by others.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to approach the whole issue of privatisation with one single <i>modus operandi.</i> The complexity even of this individual case before us, the Irish Life Assurance Company, shows that a simple, broad thrust towards privatisation must be sensitively measured in respect of each industry to which it is applied.  For instance, the complexity of this issue was well examined by the committee of which Deputy Lawlor is chairman, and I wish to pay tribute to their work and the clarity of their analysis of the issues involved.  It is the most clear minded report on the issues I have seen in recent times and the Deputy and other members of the committee are to be congratulated on it.  However, if that is the <Col N="1328" /> degree of complexity which attends this privatisation, if we were ever to seek to establish a programme of divestment of other State assets and if this is to be the first, then the amount of preparation, preliminary thought and preliminary examination of the issues involved cannot just be allowed to be postponed indefinitely.  This process of privatisation in relation to Irish Life is so monumentally complex that it behoves us, if we are in any way motivated to do privatisation on a wider basis, even if our ideological convictions vary from one party to another in this House, to get on with the job of examining other institutions with a similar aim in mind.</P>
    <P>Some State bodies which I believe should be privatised have no balance sheet value at all and thus in their case a sale to the private sector would be entirely useless, but many of their activities are being carried out at a loss which is unjustifiable by any social standards. These activities may in some cases have to be handed over to others and in other cases discontinued completely.  I will give one example.  We are being asked in the near future to invest another £11 million of taxpayers' money in the B &amp; I shipping company.  In that context it is sad that the State ever ventured into running a fleet of ships and what is now being described as investment in a Bill presented before this Dáil is money being thrown away to shore up loss-making operations by an inefficient company in which the State would not have had an interest and what interest it had should have been the subject of divestment and privatisation a long time ago.  It is also sad to reflect that a competing company &mdash; Sealink &mdash; could have been bought for a small fraction of its value compared with the amount of money we are investing in equivalent services under the B &amp; I.  That is an example of the State making a commercial blunder which could have been avoided.  It is sad to see more money being poured in that direction now under the guise of share capital when it is merely paying off debts which the company's management, because of their mandate in particular circumstances, have been obliged to <Col N="1329" /> incur in the operation of a company in the interest of the State.</P>
    <P>Other activities require just as much thought and consideration as this privatisation procedure in relation to Irish Life would require.  In the health area there is plenty of opportunity for the basic thinking to go into privatisation.  There is good reason to believe, for instance, that the health insurance area could be deregulated, competition could be encouraged and insurance companies, including the Voluntary Health Insurance Company, could acquire and run hospitals on a commercial basis in order to bring down costs and to increase the allocation of resources to health.  Doubtless we will hear from the commission suggestions to that effect for funding of the health service.  I suggest that when we are talking about privatisation we should be doing the basic thinking which is necessary to set in train a programme of privatisation which is capable of being realised within the political horizon as we see it.  If we make the mistake of thinking that we will try out privatisation as a concept in the case of the Irish Life Assurance Company and when we see whether it is a success we will do the same with some other body, in my view, and I think most Deputies will accept this, it means we will not tackle anything else for a long time to come.  It means there will be no programme of privatisation.</P>
    <P>I do not think &mdash; to use the phrase Deputy Yates used &mdash; you have to be a Thatcherite or a monetarist to believe in privatisation.  I do not believe anybody in this House, least of all the Government, is going to be guided by anything other than pragmatic concerns.  That is why I felt it was unfortunate, in the context of the last general election, that for some political reason the Government party thought it necessary to assure the electorate that there would be no privatisation.  The majority of electors believe in privatisation, if opinion polls at the time are to be believed.  The Government's action did no good.  I ask the Minister and his colleagues in Government to accept that we at any rate will not crow or jeer if they decide to <Col N="1330" /> depart from the stance which was adopted in the context of that general election.  We will not mock them for that. It is desirable that they move in the direction of privatisation.  We will encourage them to do so and will not score points at them if they change tack on that issue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance, in particular, since he is a member of Government who sees on a daily basis the cost of our borrowings, to consider whether a White Paper on every aspect of the State's asset base is necessary, examining every operation of the State, whether through semi-State companies, wholly-owned companies or partly-owned companies as in the case of the Irish Life Assurance Company.  Is it not time for the Government to go through each one of those companies with a view to seeing whether they can be disposed of by the State and their value put towards reducing borrowings?  In relation to the ones which have no value, is it not time to go through each one of them to see whether the losses which they force the State to bear should not be curtailed by divesting the State of the obligation to run these services and to fund them, whether by capital or loan guarantees?</P>
    <P>It strikes me that from map-making to meteorology, from building homes to maintaining local parks, from telecommunications to road transport, from air transport to sea transport, from running radio stations to running television stations, from printing and publishing State documents to providing furniture, heating, lighting, wiring and services even to the State apparatus itself, there is immense scope for saying, why should the State be involved and why should they not seek to get out of involvement in these areas, as in the case of Irish Life? I suggest that a considerable amount of the Minister's energy and that of his Department is absorbed by the fact that he has some ministerial responsibility for Irish Life, that he is in negotiation now, that this is a weighty issue and that Government time will be taken up on restructuring Irish Life.  All those issues show how unwise it is for the State to be involved in areas where it can avoid <Col N="1331" /> involvement.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is Thatcherite or ideologically Right-wing to take the view that the State should concentrate on some of the matters which are most important such as redistributing from the haves to the have-nots in society, providing a climate for enterprise and applying its legislative efforts to matters such as reforming the tax system, rather than being tied down to providing an extra £11 million, and using up parliamentary time in the process for B &amp; I.  The whole problem with the State's involvement in industry and in the service sector, as in the case of Irish Life, is that it takes time and commitment.  Supervising the State's assets and making sure that nothing goes wrong with them is a huge constraint on Government activity.  It takes up Parliament's time.  This Parliament should be doing other than managing insurance companies or turf development companies at a distance.  This Parliament has more important work to do and is not, on its record, the best board of directors, of last resort, of industry.  Surely, therefore, the time has come to look at privatisation not on a one-off basis, as the Government appear to be doing here, but as an opportunity to escape from some of the constraints and shackles which are debilitating the whole process of democracy and the exercise of the executive power of the State.</P>
    <P>Privatisation is an opportunity.  It is not something to be feared.  It does not create unemployment.  It creates a freedom of action for Government and for the Legislature.  It is from that point of view that I feel it should be acceptable to the members of the Government party.  I do not believe the average Fianna Fáil Deputy &mdash; if I may use that phrase &mdash; has in his heart a strong antipathy towards privatisation.  I do not believe there is anything ideological about the Fianna Fáil Party which sets them irrevocably against a general policy of focusing the State's resources and the Government's time in areas where there is a return to political activity and avoiding areas <Col N="1332" /> where there is an opportunity to make disastrous mistakes.</P>
    <P>If the unfortunate stance adopted by the Taoiseach in relation to privatisation at the time of the last election had been the diametric opposite, if he had said that he would go along on a pragmatic basis with any privatisation proposals and assess them all in a positive frame of mind, I believe he would have had wholehearted and enthusiastic support, even from the Fianna Fáil section of the electorate.  His stance was a sad, political mistake designed to keep the Fianna Fáil Party's appeal to the electorate of a particular persuasion, what we call the Left segment of the electorate, as great as possible.  That was not necessary and the consensus that has emerged in the Dáil post that election does not really justify it.  I appeal to the Fianna Fáil Party in particular to rethink their stance on privatisation.  It should not be something against which they have a knee-jerk, hostile reaction.  In every individual case and every field of government it should be an option which will be positively considered and not just an option of last resort.  In that context we cannot, as a Legislature, just permit one project, such as the Irish Life privatisation, to be tinkered around with to see if that is going to be the flagship which will decide the outcome of others.  It seems to me that is too hesitant, too backward-looking and too frightened an attitude to adopt.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to the Fine Gael Party, I believe the wording of this motion was a little pussyfooted.  Sporting analogies are in vogue among some Members of this House and my party have been accused of throwing litter on the pitch, and I say that without rancour, but asking the Government to come to an early decision is the political equivalent of the sporting activity of kicking the ball around in your own penalty area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must thank you, Sir, <Col N="1333" /> for affording me the opportunity to comment on the suggestion made by Archbishop Dermot Clifford, Archbishop of Cashel and Emly, at the recent seminar in Cork and the response to that suggestion by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
      <P>Briefly, what the Archbishop suggested was that the State should be prepared to pay four weeks' dole to young people who are about to emigrate to assist them in settling into a new community. The Minister's response was that he would be prepared to consider this suggestion seriously.  Added to that, on Saturday last we had editorial comment in <i>The Irish Press</i> which complimented the Minister for giving this suggestion consideration.  That is their entitlement, but we have come a long way when a Minister in the party of Eamon de Valera, in a newspaper founded by Eamon de Valera, should condone this approach.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk lately about the need for an emigration incentive scheme.  Most of the talk has been dismissed, and rightly so, as irresponsible, and even as crazy.  It is all the more frightening, therefore, to hear a senior member of Catholic clergy suggesting such a scheme which would have the effect of sundering the family unit, the cornerstone of the Church &mdash; my Church &mdash; and the foundation on which the Church was built.  Yet, we have a Prince of the Church suggesting that we should encourage young people to emigrate.  It is even more disturbing when a Government Minister lends his voice to such a suggestion, or is even condoning it and prepared to give it serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us make no mistake about it.  The introduction of any scheme like this could be seen as nothing less than encouraging our young people to leave.  I can think of no more tragic and savage reflection on the kind of society Fianna Fáil are trying to create here than the notion of paying people to leave.  For some time I have heard the leader of my party, Deputy Spring, enunciate his philosophy as to how this country should develop.  Here we have a senior member of the Catholic <Col N="1334" /> Church suggesting that we should pay our young people to emigrate.  I suggest this is nothing more than the end product of the policy being pursued by the three major parties in this House.</P>
    <P>It has been bad enough, and sad enough, to witness the spectacle of Ministers of this Government telling young people that this is a small island and that there is no room for them, but it would be the final insult if they were to be offered £100 of £200 to go.  In some cases four weeks' dole would not even amount to that sum because in many cases social welfare payments are based on the income of the house.  I have known young people to get £7.50 a week social welfare and others to get as little as £5 a week. Such a person would end up with the princely sum of £20 from the Department of Social Welfare to emigrate.  He could not even travel steerage for £20.  To me the whole idea is unacceptable because the paltry sum suggested would be so trivial as to add insult to injury.  I would hesitate to suggest that the Reverend Archbishop is out of touch with reality. Four weeks' dole for any single person on long term assistance is just over £150 maximum.  How any one is going to settle into an alien environment with that amount of money is beyond me, and, I suspect, beyond the great majority of unemployed young people.  This is especially the case since there is no doubt in my mind that if this Government were to embark on such a scheme, the money for it would undoubtedly come out of the social welfare budget, in other words, it would be paid for in cutbacks in some other area of support for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have to say this: it is an insult to society, and to our young people particularly, to accept forced emigration as a fact of life.  I do not care whether Archbishops or Ministers see involuntary emigration as a necessary evil.  I see it only as an evil.  It is twice the insult when the acceptance of emigration comes from a Government that have not taken a single concrete step to create jobs since they came into office.  The two budgets this Government have introduced have <Col N="1335" /> contributed greatly to the number of people on the live register, as well as cutting back sharply on the services available to help those on the live register to find a way back to work.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing something about jobs, they have talked and talked and talked. They have talked about 5,000 jobs in the food sector.  I welcome the attempt by the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, to get An Bord Glas going and I wish him luck.  If he is successful I hope we do not have a repeat of what happened to Erin Foods.  Erin Foods joined with Heinz and this venture led to the demise of Erin Foods.  Had that not happened, I suggest there would be many jobs available in the food sector today.  We have the technology and expertise and farmers had accepted that they would have to diversify into vegetable growing.  Why did we squander this opportunity?  We should never allow a similar thing to happen again.</P>
    <P>This Government have talked about jobs in manufacturing, tourism and electronics, but where are they?  Even commentators who have praised the Government's performance in other areas have been critical of their lack of activity on the jobs front.  The CII report on the Irish economy published last month says, for instance, that &ldquo;manufacturing industry is not suffering from over-investment &mdash; quite the contrary, in fact, it has been in decline since 1980&rdquo;. It can be said that we were part of a Government since 1980 but we have had to listen again tonight to the sacred cow, privatisation, being trotted across the floor of this House.  That has not provided jobs.</P>
    <P>If I may be parochial for a moment, I see the greatest indictment of the private sector in my constituency.  We have in the Verolme (Cork) Dockyard the largest engineering facility in the country lying idle simply because the Irish entrepreneur is not prepared to take a risk.  If I could see people willing to risk their money in an Irish venture rather than investing it in safe areas at 1 per cent or 2 per cent more in Britain or the United <Col N="1336" /> States, I would be prepared to listen to Deputy McDowell and his equals.</P>
    <P>These are some of the facts of life that need to be faced up to.  It is dishonest in the extreme to pretend to young people that far away pastures are green.  We have all heard of the difficulties and problems young emigrants face, especially when they have to live illegally.  It is tragic when we go abroad and meet some of our young people in Irish centres, as I have done.  They are away from home, they are lost, they have few friends and in many cases they do not make a success of any venture in which they become involved.  They are open to every evil one can imagine, yet we cannot offer them a place in Irish society.</P>
    <P>If they have to go abroad, then it is not the dole we should be giving them.  We should be giving them skills instead.  We should be investing in training, education and decent work experience programmes to ensure that wherever they go they will find openings.  Above all, we should be investing in the creation of wealth producing jobs so that they are not forced to go abroad at all.</P>
    <P>Too many kites have been flown over this issue.  It is as clear as can be that this Government have a vested interest in emigration.  Each month when the unemployment figures are published they hide behind the fact that another 1,000 or more people have left the country altogether.  If they were not leaving Ireland they would be on our streets by now demanding action.  We demand action instead.  We demand that the Government stop hiding behind our emigrants and start making sure that they do not have to leave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to thank Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan for having given me this opportunity to say what I and my Department have been endeavouring to do to assist young emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the point he raised in the House I should say I was present on the occasion the Archbishop put forward his suggestion.  I have indicated already that I believe it merits consideration.  Indeed, <Col N="1337" /> the Deputy might have acknowledged that I went to one of the largest meetings in his constituency in recent years attended by over 800 people.  Had he been there on that evening he would have heard me speak for 40 minutes on my views on the sadness of emigration, the appalling family problems it causes and so on.  Indeed the Deputy would have heard his constituents say that was an outdated notion &mdash; contending that young people were emigrating because we were now part of the EC, that we are all working towards the objectives of the Single European Act.  They said they wanted to hear politicians speak about realities.  I stress that these were the views of the Deputy's constituents.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Archbishop's proposal was intended to address an issue which goes to the root of the problems experienced by some emigrants who fare badly, particularly in England and elsewhere.  Here I am thinking of the accommodation problem in particular.  At Rochestown College I stated that I had learned, in the course of my recent visits to London, that accommodation is the most difficult problem facing many new arrivals.  That view was endorsed by those directly involved in running advice centres and hostels and by representatives of the Federation of Irish Societies.</P>
    <P>I should point out that financial assistance is currently provided by my Department &mdash; and amounts to £250,000 this year &mdash; for emigrant welfare services at the point of arrival.  A distinction needs to be drawn between forms of assistance that can be devised and applied at home in response to rising emigration and the provision of financial assistance to support a network of voluntary services in centres where Irish people try to find work in Britain.  This financial assistance is made available on the recommendations of an advisory committee &mdash; Díon &mdash; which is working to co-ordinating the activities of voluntary agencies and local authorities in Britain.  I should acknowledge that it was my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, who as Minister set up that Díon committee which is excellently structured and organised.  I hope I have <Col N="1338" /> continued his good work in this area.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Societies are represented on the Díon committee and provide an important link with the settled Irish community in Britain.  I should like to commend the federation on their recent initiative to ease the problems of accommodation encountered by new arrivals by trying to maximise the number of rooms available in major cities in Britain to cater for those seeking help at the doors of the Irish welfare centre.  This appeal launched by the federation reflects an encouraging and practical response on the part of the settled Irish community to an urgent need.</P>
    <P>FÁS are also providing a unique form of practical assistance to the Irish centre. Work commenced recently on the Irish Centre, Camden Town, London, to renovate the premises to provide a drop-in centre for elderly disadvantaged Irish people in the area and meeting rooms for young people.  Through their community youth programme FÁS ar providing a number of trainees to work on the project.  The redevelopment of the centre is proceeding on the basis of support made available by FÁS and the Camden Borough Council.  This reflects the kind of partnership which Díon have been working to develop.</P>
    <P>Many proposals were made by the Archbishop of Cashel on the night in question.  This was the one picked up by the media.  They may not all be practical suggestions.  He suggested on that evening that the matter of counselling prior to departure should at least be examined. He was speaking as chairman of the advisory committee on behalf of the Churches in respect of requests he had received from Irish clergy and people on the ground in the various centres in London and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop's proposal related primarily to how social assistance might be paid to individuals prior to departure so as to encourage people to make prior arrangements about accommodation and in order to help them with their initial expenses on arrival.  The possibility of introducing a financial inducement to encourage people to check out the availability <Col N="1339" /> of accommodation is certainly worth looking at.  However, it is an issue concerned primarily with social assistance.  Accordingly I have taken up the matter &mdash; on my return last Friday morning &mdash; with my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare who, I understand, has indicated his willingness to examine Dr. Clifford's proposal.  Some other suggestions made on that evening related more to my area of responsibility and others still more to that of my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>My approach to emigration is twofold: first, to provide, on a national basis, a proper pre-departure advisory service for persons contemplating seeking work abroad by helping them to make an informed decision and to counter and discourage precipitate and ill-planned emigration.  I agree totally with Deputy O'Sullivan that people should not emigrate if they are ill-informed of what lies ahead of them.  What happens is that they arrive in London and discover they are not entitled to any benefit because they have no accommodation address.  That difficulty should be addressed.  My second objective is to provide financial assistance to voluntary organisations offering reception facilities for newly-arrived emigrants, particularly those who experience difficulty coping with their new surroundings.</P>
    <P>At home the National Manpower Service &mdash; now part of FÁS &mdash; have developed a comprehensive information and counselling service for people contemplating employment abroad.  They have produced a very useful pre-departure information pack entitled &ldquo;Working Abroad&rdquo; for those people seeking information on conditions in other countries. They also operate a poster campaign publicising their services.  Because of their role in the labour market FÁS are best equipped, through their national network of offices, to advise on job opportunities, training and employment schemes available at home as well as job opportunities arising in the EC through their contacts with the employment services or other <Col N="1340" /> member states.  They also arrange periodic briefing sessions on emigration problems for their staff.  They keep in touch with happenings in second level schools.</P>
    <P>Of course I recognise that, despite the best efforts of FÁS in discouraging people from travelling who are obviously inadequately prepared or ill-equipped for conditions abroad, some people will still exercise their right to emigrate.  Unfortunately a proportion of them get into difficulties.  But it must be stressed that it is a very small proportion only.  It was to help such people that the Díon committee were established in June 1984 by the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, replacing the larger Irish-based Committee on Welfare Services Abroad, known as COWSA, which had been responsible up to then for advising on the distribution of Government grant-aid.</P>
    <P>Díon are an independent voluntary committee based in Britain who make recommendations on the allocation of financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare problems of Irish workers.  The bulk of State grants, amounting to £250,000 this year, paid on the recommendation of Díon, goes mainly towards improving and developing reception services in Britain for newly-arrived emigrants.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, if more intending emigrants sought information and advice and were better prepared before leaving this country, there would be fewer problem cases turning up in Britain and elsewhere.  All of those involved in this area agree with that view.  There are still too many people leaving the country who do not make contact with any advisory source beforehand.  I am confident that the position will improve significantly under the more integrated FÁS structure now being developed nationwide.</P>
    <P>Given this background Government aid should be directed mainly at organisations in Britain at the receiving end of crises and which have to provide emergency services.  At home our efforts should be directed towards developing the information and counselling services <Col N="1341" /> provided by FÁS, ensuring that all intending emigrants use their services.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy O'Sullivan, that as far as it comes within my portfolio, I will continue to endeavour to develop schemes at home through the National Manpower Service network, <Col N="1342" /> under FÁS, and as far as possible within the resources available to me, to help the Díon advisory committee.</P>

    <P>I presume that Deputy Mac Giolla is referring to my statement in January last in which I indicated that, arising from the operation of the national Jobsearch programme in 1987, 4,239 were placed in <Col N="1086" /> employment, 12,724 left the live register voluntarily and a further 1,951 had their cases reviewed resulting in disallowances.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures indicate that a total of 598 applications for disability benefit were processed from among the 14,675 who either signed off or were disallowed during 1987 and that 319 of these claims were still in payment at the beginning of 1988.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have complete returns from health boards in relation to the number of persons who applied for and were refused or were granted supplementary welfare allowance as a result of having either signed off the live register or been disallowed unemployment payments because of the Jobsearch programme.

      <P>Part time workers who work for less than 18 hours a week and are not mainly dependent on their earnings from part time employment are not covered by the social insurance system for unemployment benefit.  If the employment is for more than 18 hours a week it is fully insurable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> To qualify for unemployment benefit a person must now have at least 39 contributions paid and 39 paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Prior to April 1987 the requirement was 26 and the increase, which was included in the budget of the previous Government, was designed to ensure that scarce resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>I have had representations on behalf of certain employees working part time in the hotel industry who were able, in previous years, to maintain their entitlement to unemployment benefit by virtue of having 26 weeks of fully insurable employment during the summer season, but who do not qualify for benefit under the revised conditions.  I am at present examining the whole position of part-time workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> social insurance coverage with a view to seeing how they might be provided for within the system while ensuring that entitlement to benefits is not obtained on the basis of minimal contributions to the system.  This, however is a complex area and one where there could be considerable financial implications depending on the course of action which is taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 34, 52 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement which was introduced in September 1984, is <Col N="1091" /> designed to lessen the disincentive to work caused by the narrow gap which can arise between low take-home pay and social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure on family income supplement was £4.4 million in 1987 and the Estimates provision for this year is £5.3 million.</P>
    <P>The income limits for family income supplement are calculated in such a way as to meet this objective.  This calculation is based on the current rates of unemployment benefit and supplementary welfare allowance which are grossed up to take account of taxation and social insurance liabilities.  Therefore, the structure of the scheme at present is such that gross earnings, as distinct from net are used.  It is not possible to estimate the cost of using net income for establishing entitlement to family income supplement, as this data is not available for claimants.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was originally designed, it was decided that the payment should be limited to five children so as to ensure that the scheme would not be supplementing incomes in excess of average earnings.  The payment of additional allowances in respect of the sixth and subsequent children would imply a major change to the structure of the scheme. The cost of the proposal is estimated at £250,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>While my Department reviews the relationship between benefit levels and earnings no specific studies of the type raised by Deputy Kenny have been carried out recently.  The Deputy will probably be aware that the whole issue of incentive effects in the Irish context was examined in detail in a background paper prepared for the Commission on Social Welfare and this paper contains references to other relevant studies.</P>
    <P>One of the commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was that a detailed study of the workings of the family income supplement scheme would be carried out in order to identify what adjustments might be necessary.  This review is currently being undertaken and I consider it best to await the report <Col N="1092" /> before making any fundamental changes to the scheme.  When considering the report, I will, of course, bear in mind the issues raised by the Deputies in their questions.</P>

      <P>The medical referee system is a key element of control in the administration of the Department's disability and injury benefit schemes.  Medical referees provide a second opinion to that of the claimant's own doctor as to the incapacity of persons claiming benefit.  In selecting claimants for medical referee examination regard is had to the nature of the certified incapacity and the duration of the claim and computerised facilities are used in the selection procedures.  The cases selected are then reviewed by the medical adviser who <Col N="1093" /> decides if a case should proceed for examination by a medical referee.</P>
      <P>Cases listed for examination are first notified to the claimants' medical certifiers who are invited to furnish any further medical details including any specialists reports and to confirm that the claimants are fit to attend.  The medical certifier in each case is also invited to attend the examination if he or she so wishes.  Certifiers' reports where received, are considered by the medical referee and taken into account in conducting the examination.</P>
      <P>After all examinations, the medical referee reports and all relevant medical papers are reviewed by the medical adviser.  Where the claimant is deemed to be capable of work he may appeal against the decision and the appellant will normally be re-examined by a different medical referee before the appeal is considered by an independent statutorily appointed appeals officer.</P>
      <P>All medical referees must have been registered medical practitioners for at least six years.  The medical referee cadre has a wide range of experience and has qualifications in all the relevant branches of medicine.  However, if it is considered necessary in any case, independent specialist advice is obtained by the Department.  Also it is open to any claimant to submit a specialist report in support of his claim.</P>

      <P>To qualify for short term benefits <Col N="1096" /> under the social insurance system two conditions must be fulfilled.  The claimant must have a minimum of 39 contributions paid since entry into insurance and must have a minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  To qualify for maximum rate of benefit a claimant must have at least 48 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>The contribution conditions are designed to ensure that claimants of short term benefits have a recent attachment to the workforce.  In the case of a person entering the workforce for the first time pre-entry credited contributions are awarded in order to ensure that he or she can qualify for benefit as soon as the first contribution condition is satisfied.  Where a person leaves the workforce entitlement to short term benefits is retained only as long as the contributions paid prior to leaving the workforce retain their currency.  This can be for up to two years.</P>
      <P>Credited contributions to maintain social insurance cover may be awarded in certain circumstances.  Where a person leaves the workforce to take care of their family they do not in the normal course qualify for credited contributions except in circumstances where they are looking after an incapacitated pensioner and a prescribed relative allowance is being paid.</P>
      <P>The present conditions for entitlement to benefits are reasonable.  They apply equally to men and women and, therefore, no discrimination is involved.  To award automatic credits to persons who have left the workforce for long periods and thereby qualify them for short-term payments would have major financial implications.  There are no plans for extending the system in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as pensions are concerned a person who ceases to be compulsorily insured can, provided he has at least 156 contributions paid, maintain his entitlement through payment of voluntary contributions.  All aspects of pensions provision are being examined by the National Pensions Board at present and <Col N="1097" /> the question of pension coverage for people working in the home will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I extended the treatment benefit scheme to dependent spouses of insured workers, mainly women working in the house, with effect from October last.</P>

      <P>It is a statutory condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The question of whether a claimant satisfies this condition is a matter for determination by a statutorily appointed deciding officer having regard to the circumstances of each case.  When determining a case the deciding officer must be satisfied that there are no constraints on the claimant which prevent him or her being free to take up full-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining whether or not a claimant with young children is available for and genuinely seeking work, one of the areas which must be examined is that of <Col N="1098" /> child care responsibilities.  Each such case is considered on its merits, the basic criterion being whether or not the person is free to go to work.  Before deciding such claims the deciding officer must be satisfied that suitable arrangements can be made for the care of the children in the event of a job offer arising.  When questioning the claimant he or she is asked for the name and address of the person who will mind the children and also the distance that person resides from the claimant's home.  These questions are necessary in order to make a decision on the claim.</P>
    <P>Many married persons with young children are able to make child minding arrangements which allow both spouses to take up employment and such persons would satisfy the condition of being available for work.  However, there are other cases where one or other spouse may not be available for work because he or she had decided to remain at home to look after the children.  It is by no means uncommon for a parent to give up employment for the purpose of minding a child.  In these circumstances, questions about the claimant's child minding arrangements are directly relevant in determining his or her entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>All claimants, both male and female, are subject to the same line of inquiry. For instance, a male claimant with young children would have to be queried about child care arrangements where his wife was working in exactly the same way as would be the case if it were she who was claiming instead.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive guidelines regarding the questioning of claimants in relation to the condition of being available for and genuinely seeking work were issued to all local offices in July 1986.  Those guidelines were designed to assist officers of my Department in ensuring that, in investigating whether claimants for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance are available for and genuinely seeking work they do not discriminate between claimants either directly or indirectly on grounds of sex, family or marital status.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The questions asked about child care arrangements are not in breach of the EC Directive on Equality of Treatment in that they are necessary and are applied in a non-discriminatory manner to both male and female claimants.  Consequently there can be no question of instructing officers of my Department to cease asking them.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance I place on ensuring that all staff at my Department's local offices are fully aware of the proper practices and procedures to be followed in questioning claimants, I arranged for the guidelines which first issued in 1986 to be re-issued.</P>

      <P>Where a person is receiving a basic weekly payment of supplementary welfare allowance the payment may be increased by a supplement in respect of rent.  The amount of the rent supplement is determined by the health board. However, the maximum rent supplement payable in this case is the amount of the rent less £3, leaving the person with a net income after rent of the basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family circumstances, less £3.  The amount of rent supplement is not affected by increases in the basic supplementary welfare allowance payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rent supplement may also be paid where a person is in receipt of a higher basic payment than supplementary welfare allowance.  The maximum supplement in this case is the amount which would leave the person with the same net income as in the other case, namely, the basic level of supplementary welfare <Col N="1100" /> allowance appropriate to the family circumstances, less £3.</P>
    <P>Under these arrangements a person who changes from a lower basic payment such as supplementary welfare allowance to a higher payment would be entitled to a lower rent supplement.  The net income in each case would however be the same. These arrangements ensure that all applicants for rent supplements are treated fairly.</P>

      <P>Where applicants have already got telephone service, Telecom Éireann are notified of the award at the same time as the applicant so that the allowance may be credited to the next telephone account.  Where applicants have not already got telephone service, Telecom Éireann are not in a position to accept notifications of the award of the allowance from my Department.  This is on account of the fact that no account is initiated for telephone service by Telecom Éireann until the telephone is actually installed.  In these cases, the pensioners are asked to notify my Department when the telephone is installed.  My Department then notifies Telecom Éireann that the allowance has been awarded against the rental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 17,000 free telephone rental allowances were awarded in 1987, of which some 9,500 related to people who already had telephones installed and <Col N="1102" /> 7,500 to people who had not yet got telephones installed.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in contact with Telecom Éireann regarding the problem and it is understood that Bord Telecom have approximately 8,000 notifications from my Department on hand at present.  They have, however, given assurances that additional resources are being devoted to clearing the backlog as soon as possible.

It is understood that this is occurring in most cases at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund is the amount by which the income of the fund for any financial year is less than its expenditure. While there has been a considerable increase in the real income of the fund from PRSI contributions between 1977 and 1987, the increase in the fund's expenditure has been more significant. The expenditure increase is accounted for by an upward trend in the numbers of recipients of social insurance benefits and by a substantial increase in the rates of benefit paid over the years.  The increase in expenditure, ahead of income increases, is the main factor underlying <Col N="1105" /> the growth of the Exchequer contribution.</P>
      <P>In the mid-seventies policy was directed towards reducing the Exchequer contribution to the fund <i>vis-à-vis</i> the contribution by employers and employees. The higher expenditure to which I have referred, at a time when it was generally recognised that further taxation burdens could not be imposed on employers or employees, resulted in the Exchequer contribution to the fund increasing subsequently.  If the 1977 level of State subvention to the fund was applied in 1987, the combined employer and employee contribution would be 21.8 per cent rather than the present rate of 16.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>The deficit on the fund in the current year at post-budget rates is estimated at £388 million which will result in an Exchequer contribution of 28 per cent to income.</P>

      <P>The arrangements applying in the current heating season are the result of an in depth review of the fuel schemes in operation.  In the light of this I decided to proceed with rationalisation and the introduction of one national scheme on a <Col N="1106" /> phased basis.  As part of this process I extended the payment of fuel allowances for the first time, to the long-term unemployed, bringing an estimated 30,000 additional beneficiaries into the schemes. The funds available for fuel allowances (£28.2 million) meant that the inclusion of the long term unemployed could only be accomplished by a heating season of 26 weeks.

      <P>Unlike a number of other countries there is no country-wide national identification system here and consideration of such a system would obviously raise broader issues which would go beyond my immediate responsibilities as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Social Insurance number, known as the RSI number, is allocated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and is used by both my Department and that office.

      <P>The extension of social insurance coverage to the self-employed this year will considerably broaden the scope of the RSI numbering system.

My Department are having on-going discussions with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to developing a more secure numbering system.</P>
      <P>With regard to identification in the case of recipients of unemployment payments, I am examining ways of improving the signing card already in use.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will change the present system of allocation of 1,500 units under the free electricity allowance which is 200 units at present for the three summer periods and 300 units for the three winter periods to 1,500 units spread over the year regardless of when they <Col N="1108" /> are used; and if he will outline the extra charge to the Exchequer that this proposed change would cost.</P>

      <P>The free electricity scheme meets the cost of the normal standing charge on the ESB's domestic consumer tariff and allows 1,500 free units of electricity each year, that is, up to 200 and 300 free electricity units per two-monthly billing period in summer and winter respectively.</P>
      <P>The scheme on the whole has proved very useful and in its present format meets the objectives for which it was designed, which was to help with actual costs incurred from billing period to billing period.  I am, however, having the scheme reviewed and as part of the review the proposal made by the Deputy as well as variations on the proposal will be considered.</P>
      <P>At present levels the ESB charges the potential additional annual cost to the Exchequer of the Deputy's proposal would be about £2.6 million.  It is estimated that the cost of the scheme in 1988 to the Exchequer will be £20.74 million in respect of about 170,000 persons.</P>

      <P>The change in the conditions for receipt of disability benefit and unemployment benefit included in last year's budget came into effect from April 1987. Those changes were designed to ensure that those establishing entitlement to these payments have had a reasonable history of attachment to the workforce. It was estimated that some 6,000 people <Col N="1109" /> would be affected in 1987 by these changes yielding a saving of £8.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>All recipients of weekly social welfare payments, including those who receive the temporary alleviating payments, will receive the full budget increase in their basic payments in July next.</P>
      <P>The temporary alleviating payments, which were introduced in November 1986, following the introduction of the second phase of the equality legislation, for families who were adversely affected by this, are being continued this year. The current level of these payments is £20 per week where both spouses are on a social welfare payment, and £10 plus an amount for each child dependant per week where the spouse of the social welfare recipient is earning over £50 per week.  There are currently some 10,500 persons in receipt of the £20 payment and some 8,500 in receipt of the £10 payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government proposed that these payments would cease on November 17 last year.  However, in view of the hardship that would have resulted from the sudden withdrawal of these temporary payments the Government decided that these payments should continue for a further period until the end of March this year.  In the context of this year's budget it was decided that these payments should continue for the rest of the year and I announced to the House previously that they should be phased out over a longer period starting this year.  To minimise the impact this will have on social welfare recipients it has been decided to reduce the £20 and £10 payments by £2 and £1 respectively.  The additional amounts paid for dependent children will continue <Col N="1111" /> at their present levels.  These measures will result in an estimated saving of about £1 million in the cost of the alleviating payments this year.  The increases in social welfare payments for households from July next, and in particular the increases for those on the lowest payments, will be more than sufficient to offset these reductions.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a statutory sick pay scheme under which employers would be responsible for payments to their employees for an initial period of illness is under consideration in my Department.  The Government are committed to the introduction of such a scheme as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the major development in the social welfare system which will be coming into effect in April, namely, the extension of social insurance to the self-employed, it has been decided to defer the introduction of new disability benefit arrangements.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring forward proposals for the introduction of statutory sick pay arrangements later this year.  There are no plans for any other changes in the disability benefit scheme at present.</P>

      <P>Among the common measures against South Africa taken by the Twelve are a ban on new investment in South Africa and a revision and expansion of the European Code of Conduct for European firms with subsidiaries in South Africa.  The aim of the first is to apply pressure on the South African Government, the aim of the second is to effect practical improvements in the living standards and conditions of those South Africans of all races employed by European firms in South Africa.</P>
      <P>While I will continue to press for the strengthening of the Twelve's common measures against South Africa by the addition of items such as a ban on coal imports and a ban on imports of fruit and vegetables from South Africa, I have no plans to call for progressive disinvestment from South Africa at this time.</P>

      <P>Ireland remains convinced that the basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Kampuchea is contained in the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea which calls for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops <Col N="1116" /> and the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to determine their own future.  Ireland supports the annual resolution presented to the UN General Assembly which also calls for these objectives.  In view of the fact that Ireland is on record in support of this position, it would not be appropriate for us to take the matter up on any other basis.</P>
      <P>We have noted that the Kampuchean conflict has been the subject of discussions in France in recent months between Prince Sihanouk and a representative of the Heng Samrin regime in which each side has put forward proposals.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been guardians of Donegal Castle since 1898.  Between 1930 and 1932 major structural works were carried out to support <Col N="1130" /> the foundations of the part of the tower house founded on soft mud-slate. In recent years further major works have been undertaken.  The walls of the gatehouse have been repaired and it has been re-roofed and re-floored.  The front of the manor house was taken down and rebuilt for safety reasons.  New stone barges were cut and fitted on all the gables of the manor house and stone lintels were cut and fitted to all the windows.  Iron railings were erected at the front of the castle.  All of the castle buildings have now been pointed and flaunched.  Landscaping works and external and internal stone paving have also been carried out. Over the years routine maintenance and conservation works have been carried out e.g., the removal of trees and ivy from the walls, flaunching of wall tops, repairing and replacing stonework, repointing and fitting of railings and grids.</P>
      <P>Supplies of oak timber were purchased in 1984 and 1985 in order to roof and floor the gatehouse of the Castle and to provide an appropriate protective canopy over the ornate fireplace in the castle. More than half of the timber purchased was used to roof, floor and secure the gatehouse.  The remainder is in store in the Commissioners' depot in Dromahair and is intended to be used to provide stairs and reception furniture for the gatehouse and for the above mentioned canopy when appropriate staffing resources permit.  Having regard to present commitments, it is not expected that this will be before 1990.  The entire restoration of the castle is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986 the greatgrandchild of an Irish born person may be registered in the foreign births register only if he or she were born after the date of registration of the parent.  The 1986 Act provided a grace period of six months from 1 July 1986 within which persons <Col N="1132" /> previously entitled to register could do so.  I have no proposal to change the relevant provisions nor could I advise as to how individuals are affected by the law.</P>

The records available locally and in Dublin do not indicate why an exception was made in respect of the Aeroflot flights or why the practice continued to be applied.

      <P>The relevant statutory provision is at section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, one effect of which is that an occasional licence cannot be granted for a dance unless:</P>

      <P>(ii)  it is held on a day of special festivity (subject to a maximum of six occasional licences a year for any premises).</P>

      <P>The proposals made by the EC Commission for a revision of the western package provide for aid for basic animal housing and associated fodder and effluent storage, outside a farm plan.  The proposals, if adopted, will be more attractive than the orientation of production scheme which they would replace.  The latter would apply only to plans approved before 1 March 1988. Accordingly, grants under the present scheme can be paid only on foot of improvement plans approved prior to that date.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Commission's proposals will be considered by the Council of Ministers at an early date.  Meanwhile, of course, grants for livestock housing are available to eligible applicants under the farm improvement programme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food in view of the serious financial arrears affecting up to 900 Land Commission holdings, if he has any plans for dealing with this problem on a national basis; and whether he accepts that adjustment of rents and annuities may be necessary where the circumstances of the landholder's house deteriorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general practice in <Col N="1145" /> dealing with annuity arrears due by landholders whose circumstances have deteriorated is to offer them an arrangement whereby they repay their arrears together with their current annuity payments over a number of years.  Since the Land Commission charges no interest on arrears, this is a particularly generous concession and, in fact, 250 annuitants with arrears of over £1,000 each, are at present clearing off arrears of almost £1 million on a graduated basis under this type of arrangement.</P>
      <P>Where, however, an annuitant fails to honour the terms of such an arrangement or where he ignores all correspondence and approaches, the Land Commission is left with no alternative but to issue a warrant for collection of the arrears to the county registrar for execution.  Some 600 warrants to the value of £2 million were issued in 1987 and some £400,000 has been collected on foot of those warrants so far.</P>
      <P>The arrears referred to are not new but have been growing for a number of years now under different administrations. While the arrears situation is kept under constant review to see what new measures, if any, may need to be taken, I would point out to the Deputy that any permanent downward adjustment in the amounts collectable would involve losses to the Exchequer which could only be made good by transferring the burden from the farmers who were allotted land to the general body of taxpayers.  This could not be justified particularly in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>A living alone allowance is an increase in a pension from the Department of Social Welfare payable to a person who is 66 years of age or over and living alone.  It is not payable in respect of pensions from other countries.</P>
      <P>If the British pension mentioned is the only source of income of the person concerned, it is possible that she would be entitled to a reduced-rate non-contributory old age pension and, in turn, to a living alone allowance as an increase on the latter pension.  An application form is being sent to her and if she wishes her potential pension entitlement to be investigated she should complete this form and return it to the Department.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if the person was insurably employed in Ireland since January 1953 it would be open to her to apply for a contributory old age pension or retirement pension &mdash; a form is also being sent to her for this.  Qualification for either of these pensions would also enable consideration to be given to granting her a living alone allowance.</P>

      <P>Up to 1974 coverage for social insurance purposes was subject to a remuneration limit and non-manual workers were not compulsorily insurable whenever their income went over that limit.  When the limit was abolished in 1974 many such people came back into insurance.  In a number of cases, the breaks in insurance cover were such that certain persons did not have sufficient contributions to satisfy the yearly average qualifying condition for Old Age Contributory Pension.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing old age contributory pension at the minimum current rated this group would be of the order of £45 million over a 30 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that people in this category should be paid <i>pro-rata</i> pensions based on their average number of contributions since entering insurance.  The <Col N="1148" /> cost of the Commission's proposal is estimated at some £23 million over a 30 year period.</P>

      <P>One of the contribution conditions for invalidity pension is that a claimant must have qualifying contributions in respect of not less than 156 contribution weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records there are only 21 such weeks of insurable employment registered in respect of the person concerned.  Therefore, he is not entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is not eligible for disability benefit either as he does not satisfy the contributions for that benefit.</P>
      <P>Contributions were paid by him in respect of the period from 1969 to 1979 but as he was self-employed during this time these contributions were deemed not insurably paid under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Unemployed benefit and unemployment assistance claimants would not be regarded as satisfying this condition during periods when they are absent from the State.</P>
      <P>The only exception to this arises in the application of EC Regulations 1408/71 for Migrant Workers which allow payment of unemployment benefit for up to three months to recipients who travel to another member state to seek employment.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned requested a transfer from disability benefit to invalidity pension on 6 December 1985.  He was examined by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work.  A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned was dissatisfied with this decision arrangements were made to have him examined by a different medical referee who was also of the opinion that he was not permanently incapable of work.  He was then invited to have his case referred to an appeals officer for determination.

He appealed against the decision on 7 October 1986.</P>
      <P>Due to an administrative error the decision to disallow and the appeal against that decision were overlooked and the person concerned has continued to be paid on the basis of an earlier means assessment of £38.45 a week.</P>

      <P>Prior to January 1988, where a person had less than 208 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit was limited to 52 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appeared from the records of the Department that the person concerned had only 109 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurance.  Therefore, she was only paid disability benefit from 7 April 1986 to 8 April 1987 after <Col N="1161" /> which date she was considered to have exhausted her 52 week entitlement.</P>
    <P>It subsequently transpired that the person concerned had more contributions paid under her old insurance number and that she therefore had more than 208 contributions paid.  Accordingly, she is qualified for payment of benefit beyond 8 April 1987 and arrears of disability benefit payable from 9 April 1987 to 18 January 1988, the date of the latest medical certificate received in the Department, have been issued.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit will continue to issue to the person concerned on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity for work for as long as she remains incapable of work.</P>

      <P>The claim to disability benefit of the person concerned was originally disallowed from 19 July 1987 following an examination by a medical referee who considered him to be capable of work. The claimant appealed against the disallowance of benefit and was examined again on 1 October 1987 by a different medical referee who considered him to be incapable of work.</P>
      <P>However, it had been ascertained that the person concerned is self-employed and does not appear to be complying with the rules of behaviour for a person claiming or in receipt of disability benefit. One of these rules is that a claimant must not do any work unless it is work which he is allowed do under the Department's regulations.</P>
      <P>The claim to disability benefit of the person concerned was, therefore, suspended from 19 July 1987 on these grounds pending investigations into his entitlement to this benefit.

Convictions were obtained in eight of these cases.  The remaining three cases were dismissed, one without prejudice.</P>
      <P>The main reason two prosecutions failed was that the courts construed Article 12(1) of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981, as requiring that the advertisement indicate that the goods were being sold below the net invoice price.  The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, overcomes this difficulty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>

      <P>The tender submission for the scheme at Ballivor, County Meath, was received in my Department in January 1987.  It was not possible to sanction this scheme in 1987 as it could not be funded within the allocation for local authority housing for that year.</P>

    <P>In relation to the approval of housing <Col N="1175" /> schemes in 1988, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions No. 95 on 23 February 1988 and No. 61 on 24 February 1988.</P>

      <P>Activities for European Year of the Environment (EYE) were co-ordinated, at the request of my Department, by the Environment Awareness Bureau which was designated as the Irish National Committee for the year. Government Departments and local authorities were asked to draw up programmes consistent with the objectives of EYE and details of these programmes were set out in the booklet published by the National Committee entitled <i>A Strategy for the European Year of the Environment.</i> I and officials of my Department have participated to the fullest extent possible in the many campaigns and events held during the year and the President of Ireland, as Patron for the Year, as well as an Taoiseach and Government Ministers have participated where appropriate.  Activities for EYE have included: Official launch of the Year; Environment Awards for non-Government Organisations; Environmental Roadshow; Clean-up-Ireland Week (4-10 May, 1987); National Washday (11 May 1987); Local Authority Environment Awards; Better Environment Awards for Industry; Environmental Press Photographer Awards; European Conservation Awards; Community Games Environmental Project Competition; Blue Flag for Beaches and Ports; Birdwatch Europe (18-24 May 1987); Water Management Week (20-27 <Col N="1176" /> September 1987); Protection of the Marine Environment Campaign by the Italian sail training vessel <i>Amerigo Vespucci</i> (15-18 September 1987); Recycling Week (11-17 October 1987); EYE exhibition in the Dublin offices of the Commission of the European Committee September/October 1987; School Environmental Magazine; Publication of Information Packs for Community Groups and Farmers.</P>
      <P>Other relevant activities of my Department included the urban renewal programme, the Custom House Docks project, the Amenity Grants scheme including grants towards major parks and the improvement of Grafton Street, Dublin, enactment and implementation of the Air Pollution Act, the adoption of a major programme for the prevention of water pollution and other environmental protection measures.</P>
      <P>I do not have the detailed information for local authorities required by the Deputy.  I understand, however, that the National Committee are preparing a comprehensive report on the year's activities so as to assist in the conduct of future environment awareness campaigns.  The report will be published in due course and a copy will be made available to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>*Period 1 January-30 September 1987.</P>
    <P>My Department has no details of the number of these prosecutions which were successful or of the fines imposed in each case.  Information of this nature has been requested from local authorities for 1987 and I will arrange for this to be forwarded to the Deputy when available.</P>
    <P>The low number of prosecutions taken by local authorities is a reflection of the range of other powers available to them under the Water Pollution Act to deal with pollution and to ensure that it does not recur.  In 1986, local authorities issued over 350 notices under section 12 of the Act requiring specified measures to be taken to prevent or control pollution of waters.  In addition, authorities issued more than 2,200 advice/warning letters.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in the number of prosecutions initiated up to the end <Col N="1178" /> of September 1987 indicates a positive response by the local authorities to my request last year that they make full use of their powers to prosecute pollution offenders and to have remedial measures taken at the polluters' expense.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that recourse to prosecutions alone will not overcome the problem of pollution.  Accordingly, the programme of measures approved by the Government to deal with pollution provides for initiatives in the promotion of environmental awareness, and the availability of advice for farmers on practices which entail a risk of pollution, in addition to legislative changes which will strengthen the powers of local authorities to prevent pollution and will increase the penalties for offences.</P>

      <P>The hazardous waste disposal services at present available in the private sector did not exist when the national waste strategy, based on a central public facility, was first announced nearly eight years ago.  While these services are coping reasonably well with present requirements, I am satisfied that some further development and expansion of treatment and disposal facilities are required, particularly since there is no guarantee that export outlets for hazardous wastes will continue to be available indefinitely.  I have recently announced the introduction of a scheme of capital grant assistance to encourage the waste disposal sector to provide an appropriate range of treatment and disposal facilities in this country.  I am not in a position as yet to indicate what facilities will be provided in the Greater Dublin area under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The information available in the Department in relation to the number of local authority dwellings in each area is being compiled and will be forwarded to Deputy Quinn as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As in previous tenant purchase schemes, dwellings provided for and occupied by elderly persons are excluded from the terms of the 1988 scheme, details of which have issued to housing authorities.  They may include flats and maisonettes in the scheme.  However, there are certain practical difficulties in such sales.  A working group, representative of the Department and local authorities, which has been examining the matter, is awaiting the completion of a survey of tenant attitudes to the purchase of flats.  When their report is available, the steps which can be taken to encourage sales of flats will be considered further.  Flats and maisonettes are exempt from the requirement that local authority dwellings be sold in fee simple and such sale would normally be by way of lease.</P>
      <P>Repayments under the new scheme are at a fixed interest rate of 9.25 per cent for the duration of the repayment period and the interest content of repayments may qualify for income tax relief.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in this case.  The proposal was received in my Department on 14 December 1987.  It is normal practice to allow some weeks to elapse before processing the order so as to give time for the submission of any objections.  An inspector from my Department will inspect the site in the near future and I will make my decision as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the financial circumstances of this school.  The capitation grant is paid by the Department to assist in the payment of the day to day running costs of a national school.  The payment of this grant is regulated by the published conditions which are of general application and this school has received its appropriate entitlement of grant this year.</P>
      <P>Apart from the capitation grant my Department has in recent years, made certain funds available to the diocesan authorities for distribution to national schools in severely disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Because of falling enrolments at the school resulting in under-utilisation of the accommondation and increased maintenance costs, the question of the school being included in a re-organisation of schools in the area is under investigation.</P>

      <P>1. Circular Letter M57/87 which issued to post-primary schools in <Col N="1210" /> August 1987 stated that pupils who have sat the leaving certificate examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils to repeat the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1987-88 subject to the payment of a repeat course fee of £100. In addition, an examination entry fee of £100 applies, in those cases, instead of the ordinary entry fee.  Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card are exempted from these fees; 2. Except as provided for in paragraph 1 above a pupil may not repeat any year of the second-level course, save in exceptional cases such as prolonged absence due to ill health.  Applications for such exemption should be made in writing by the manager-principal of the school concerned.  Alleged immaturity is not of itself accepted as sufficient grounds for repeating.  Pupils repeating a year without the approval of the Department are not counted for capitation grant or quota purposes.</P>

      <P>My Department have under consideration at present, a report from their professional advisers regarding a recent meeting with the authorities of the Church of Ireland national school, Naas, County Kildare, to discuss their application for grant-aid towards the cost of providing a new school building to replace their existing unsuitable school. On the basis of that report it is expected that a sketch scheme for a suitable replacement building to serve the long term needs will be prepared by my Department for the consideration of the school authorities.  I am not in a position at this stage to give a timescale for the completion of the architectural planning of the development, but I can assure the Deputy that the matter will be handled as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local contribution will in due course be a matter for negotiation with the school authorities.  It is not the practice of my Department, however, to disclose the financial details of individual projects the subject of grant applications, as such <Col N="1215" /> information is considered to be confidential as between the school authorities and my Department.</P>
