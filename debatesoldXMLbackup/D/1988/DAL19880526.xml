      <Col N="284" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about competing with imports we must strive for the highest possible quality of native timber.  Because of the high moisture content it must be properly dried before being put on sale.  Only four or five of our sawmills are equipped with proper kiln drying facilities.  The IDA should co-operate with the ten principal sawmills in the development of proper drying facilities. Over 85 per cent of our timber is processed by ten sawmills and it would be very easy to raise standards if we were to ensure they had the proper equipment. We could then work down to the smaller sawmills.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the importance of the pulpwood industry and the necessity to have our own pulpwood mill.  I realise that we have not enough residue at present to sustain such a mill, but by 1993 the output from our forests will be increased by about 80 per cent and we should plan to have a pulpwood mill at that stage.  Private investors would probably be interested if the supply was assured.  At present over 50 per cent of each tree is not being utilised and we are losing much of the value added of our forests.  Chips are being exported to Sweden and the Continent for about £15 per tonne and being brought back in a converted form at about ten times that price.  I hope the new board will address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the pruning programme has been more or less suspended due to the lack of manpower.  Pruning is most important in ensuring the highest quality timber at a later stage.  After the first thinnings there must be selected pruning in order to identify the final crop.  This is to ensure knot-free timber which is essential if it is to reach the highest standard. I urge that the new board should concentrate resources on the extension of the pruning service, either by private <Col N="285" /> contractors or by employees of the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>Problems often arise due to uncertainty of supply caused by the tendering system as a result of which many processors cannot plan ahead.  There is no guarantee they will have the necessary amount of timber to reach certain targets. The whole tendering system should be renewed by the new board and the possibility of substitution a contracting system might be considered.  Sometimes processors have to travel considerable distances to get timber.  It would be better if they could get their supplies locally and avoid the cost of transport and so on.</P>
    <P>We must have proper standards of grading to ensure top quality timber.  The lack of such standards means that our timber is not presented as it should be and it is very easy to get a name for bad quality.  All timber must be graded before it is put on the market.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the problem of land acquisition and the delay in transferring land from the farmer to the Forest and Wildlife Service.  This process has been very cumbersome and prolonged and I hope the new board will speed it up by removing the bureaucratic delays.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have expressed concern about the composition of the proposed board.  I urge the Minister to ensure that it will be broadly based and include representatives of growers, processors and users, as well as people involved in technological and developmental aspects of the industry.  It should also include somebody to deal with the environmental aspect of growing trees.  There has been widespread opposition to forestry plantations in the north of Scotland which have damaged the local wildlife habitat.  I hope this will not happen here and that the board will be representative of all viewpoints across a broad spectrum.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no mention of research and development, but nevertheless I am sure the board will be concerned with this important matter.  I would envisage a role here for Eolas. The Bill has not provided for the specific inclusion of a wood technology unit which <Col N="286" /> is essential to the optimum utilisation of the timber produced by the State forests and the development of the timber industry. I am sure provision can be made for the forest products department on the new board.  If we are to improve the quality of our timber it is very important that we have continuous research and development into new plant species, new methods of growing, planting and so on. Progress has been made but we can learn a lot from other countries regarding the future quality of our timber.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to what has happened at ground level, especially in Kerry.  The Minister mentioned in his Second Stage speech that he had succeeded in getting an increase in the allocation for rural development for forestry. In Kerry the budget for rural development this year has been cut back by 30 per cent and that will restrict the future development of forests in Kerry.  The success of the Western Package as regards forestry has resulted in a proliferation of applications for grants and schemes. Unfortunately, there are not enough people to go out and investigate many of the applications and as a result people are becoming sceptical about the scheme. I know people who had intended to plant parts of their land but have changed their minds now because the service was not immediately available to them.  I can see this becoming an increasing problem because of the cutbacks.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the staffing arrangements on the new board will be such as to provide that applications are looked at as soon as possible and that there is no undue delay.  I appreciate that the reason inspectors cannot get out and investigate private applications is because of the success of the scheme and the growing awareness of it.  Nevertheless, it is important in order to keep confidence in the scheme that inspectors reach the farmer or the private individual as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the whole aspect of wildlife.  I asked the Minister what role the new board will play as regards wildlife.  I understand that this aspect was taken from the Forest and <Col N="287" /> Wildlife Service two years ago and is now under the Office of Public Works.  I am sure this new board will have to play some role in the whole wildlife service. In a recent study in Scotland &mdash; I refer to that country because of the extensive planting that has been carried out there in the past ten years from which we can learn a lot &mdash; it was shown that there was a five-fold increase in the number and diversity of some bird species as a result of forestry development.  Many species also vanished from the vast areas that were planted.  We will have to look at the whole planting programme in the context of the damage that could be done to the flora and fauna of an area.  We have to strive to strike the proper balance.  Ecosystems that have been developing for millions of years could be destroyed by irresponsible planting, and this must be considered.  The board will have to have responsibility to ensure that a proper balance is maintained.  Forestry also provides refuge for various types of animal life.  We must ensure that no form of animal life is interfered with because of extensive forestry planting.  Forestry facilitates animal life probably more than bird life or even plant life.</P>
    <P>There is much concentration now on activity holidays and this is an area that the new board can address.  Forests should be developed with a view to providing future recreational facilities, especially for the tourist industry.  Forests could be used for schools and for the use of joggers, orienteering, hunting, camping and several other purposes.  In the context of tourism this new board will have to take this whole aspect into consideration.</P>

      <P>There is vast potential in our forests for the types of activities I have mentioned.  As I have said, when forests are being planned the accessibility <Col N="288" /> of them for joggers, orienteering, hunting and other purposes should be takem into consideration.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  There is a great future for this board because of the scarcity of timber in Europe and England and because of the vast amount of land that can be planted in this country.  The board face a great challenge and I am sure they will succeed.  However, certain improvements can be made in the Bill and I am sure the Minister and the spokespersons from each party will be considering this when we come to Committee Stage.  I compliment the Minister on his initiative in this respect.  I know from speaking to people in the timber industry that he has their respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>As an adjunct to my comments on the detail of this Bill, firstly let me offer a word of welcome for it and a word of praise for the Minister, Deputy Smith, on its introduction.  It is seldom I get the opportunity to praise him, particularly in Dublin.  The Bill has as its objective the establishment of a State company for forestry which takes its development and commercial exploitation out of the hands of the Civil Service, a welcome pronouncement in the forestry debate. The Government have by the publication of this Bill recognised and followed through the major preparatory tasks in this regard, which were undertaken by my party in 1984, with the establishment of the Forestry Review Body, following the very genuine initiative taken by the forester staff in opening the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My most major criticism of the Bill is its failure to identify in its objectives a requirement for acquisition and planting of land.  This is indeed very peculiar and totally regrettable.  I join with my colleagues in condemning this grevious omission.  Surely a new company to deal with forestry should have plantation establishment listed as one of its main objectives.  Not alone that, but the Government should ensure the adherence to a national planting target of not less than 10,000 hectares per annum as a priority for this country, which at present, with only 6 per cent of its land <Col N="289" /> under trees, languishes far behind its European neighbours.  I hope the recent upsurge in private planting will continue; but hopeful aspirations are, on their own, of no value when one is faced with planning Ireland's future in a forestry development programme.  The omission of even the mention of a national planting target is a serious indictment of the Government's lack of a planning strategy.</P>
    <P>How are we expected to increase from our current level of plantations at 340,000 hectares to a more realistic figure of 1.2 million hectares suggested by many in the past, including Government agencies such as An Foras Talúntais, as an immediate target in line with a realistic land use policy?  In order to sustain our wood based industries and to provide guaranteed employment in all aspects of forestry, including downstream employment, to expand these industries in a planned manner and to reverse our balance of payments deficit, we must guarantee a sustained yield from our forests. This can only happen with the establishment and maintenance of a national planting target.</P>
    <P>Running parallel with the publishing of this Bill is a very disturbing rumour that at present a committee under the aegis of the Department of Finance are working on the analysis of a proposal which would suggest that the State and consequently the new company, would abandon their planting programme entirely and hope that the private sector would take up the slack.  The suggestion is that the Government are awaiting a final report from this group.  Could it be that Fianna Fáil would be about to give the kiss of death to Coillte Teoranta even before it is established? The chief executive, the directors and staff of Coillte Teoranta, the forest industries sector and Dáil Éireann are entitled to know what is going on and I ask the Minister to clarify this in his response.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the question of directors of the board and a chairman.  It is unusual in this day and age that the Minister was not specific in his wording <Col N="290" /> with regard to the appointment of worker directors.  Surely he is well aware of this concept as a very valuable contributor to the question of harmonious relationships between management and staff, and is aware that it is now well established practice in other companies to have this sort of worker participation at the highest level of company management.</P>
    <P>I hope also that the appointment of the chairman and directors will be in accordance with what is considered best for the company in terms of experience, expertise, forestry know-how and good commercial thinking and not, as too often happens, to the serious detriment of success because of political considerations. It is at a time like this that the national interest must take precedence over shortterm political gain.</P>
    <P>One of my chief misgivings on the question of appointments to the new company is that much of what is contained in the Bill by way of reference back to the Minister and much of what is omitted from the proposed legislation militates seriously against attracting the type of person with the required entrepreneurial skills for the position.  Not alone that, but because of the restrictive clause which limits the first term of appointment of a chief executive to three years, the legislation almost argues against the feasibility of such a post to a person who is already gainfully employed in a similar capacity.</P>
    <P>Finally on this point, because of the non-implementation by the Government of the higher civil service pay award, it stands to reason that as the general trend is towards a move away from posts in this area to the private sector that the Government are swimming against the tide with regard to this key post.  Seldom have I seen a position with such challenge and potential fraught with so many pitfalls, interference and lack of reward.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the legislation what functions will be ascribed to Coillte Teoranta. For instance, the Forestry Department have been very successful in their creation of natural amenities and public facilities.  One need only mention Lough Key Forest Park in Boyle, County <Col N="291" /> Roscommon, the Killykeen development in County Cavan or the John F. Kennedy arboretum in County Wexford as examples.  How will Coillte Teoranta be expected to handle these developments? Will they be expected to run them on strictly commercial lines, or will there be some degree of public utility provided without charge?  Will the company be expected, or maybe I should ask permitted, to involve themselves in further developments along those lines?  Having regard to the many fine waterways, lakes and rivers which will be under the company's control, will they be expected or permitted to develop their obvious fishing potential, that is, of course, hoping we will have any fishermen left in the country after the rod licence debacle?  What about shooting rights and hunting rights?  All those are matters of staff interest and public interest and require clarification.</P>
    <P>Obviously the functions ascribed to the new company as well as their specific authority with regard to grant administration, training, research and development, felling licences and so on, will determine the staff that will be transferred from the present Department of Energy to the company, and I note that the Minister is rather coy in stating that the staff to be transferred to the company will be those who are designated by him for transfer.  The sooner the Minister clarifies these very important matters the better are the chances of establishing a successful company.</P>
    <P>Following on this question of functions and authority of Coillte Teoranta, there are two very crucial questions that need to be addressed.  First, in the terms of Irish forestry, will Coillte Teoranta be the forest authority of this country from the perspective of their position in the international scheme of things?  Secondly, what will be the company's relationship with the EC in terms of their entitlement to grants?  I trust that it will be the forest authority for the country and on the question of EC grants, I presume that the company should not have to operate at a disadvantage to the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> While reading through the Bill and referring back to other earlier pronouncements by the Fianna Fáil Party in their last election manifesto and later having regard to the various comments they have made since coming into Government, particularly those listed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> into which they entered as a peace plan with the other social partners, it is quite interesting now to make comparisons. For instance, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government said, and I quote &ldquo;The new company should be launched early in the New Year (an interim board will be announced shortly).&rdquo;  What has happened since October 1987?  We are now well into the new year, and while this legislation is before us the actual launching of the company which can only take place on vesting day is still unknown.  More peculiar than that is the failure of the Government to announce the promised interim board. Can the Minister explain why this decision was reneged on?</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> also talked about employment creation in forestry.  What has happened since? About 40 of their permanent Civil Service staff have opted for early retirement, and while I talk to you, I understand about 450 letters are about to issue to members of the industrial work force containing completed redundancy agreements. Therefore the Government would have to be in a position to identify at least 500 jobs to even prove that they had sustained employment at the October 1987 level.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can talk about increased planting in 1987 and 1988 and refer to an increase of 50,000 cubic metres of timber from our State forests, an increase, let me quickly point out that came about solely by way of annual increment increase in our crops and not because of any magic wand performance from the Government.  Where are the newly created jobs?  Can we have specific examples of the numbers and where they have been created?  Any jobs created in additional planting are temporary and <Col N="293" /> cannot be referred to as sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>Also entered in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> page 22, clause 22, is the following:</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be put into place to ensure that new jobs arising from the State's planting programme will not arise in the black economy.</P>
    <P>And what might I ask has been done to put such arrangements in place?  To my knowledge, absolutely nothing and despite this the matter does not even get a hint of acknowledgement in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of the black economy operating in Irish forestry is obviously a matter of national concern.  This is acknowledged by the inclusion I referred to in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> To have merited such status, the matter must be out of hand, otherwise it could be dealt with in the normal course of events.  My information is that it most certainly is out of hand.  In fact, since the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was published, the matter appears to have worsened.</P>
    <P>It gives me no joy whatsoever to place on the record of this House my certain contention that the black economy thrives in Ireland's forestry programme.  Not alone that, but our own Forestry Service is an unwitting employer of black economy labour because their contracts for much of their work do not facilitate a proper check on the tax regime of those employed.  How much worse that matter is in the private sector forestry one can gauge for oneself.  It is true that contracts will state that the work must be carried out subject to the legitimate tax code of the State, but have the Government become so naive as to think that because they say something or write it down, that this provided instant solutions?</P>
    <P>The losses accruing to the State from this reprehensible practice are a serious drain on our over-burdened economy. While it is difficult to gauge their true extent, we have the Forestry officials admitting it can happen under their very <Col N="294" /> noses, while one private forestry contractor who operates in the legitimate economy, concedes that he cannot compete for jobs on a competitive basis with other outfits of the same size and scale who are able to take on contract jobs at 60 per cent of his price and still make a profit.</P>
    <P>There is only one obvious way in which this can be done.  The losses are enormous. Some of those people draw the dole while still working.  They evade tax and social insurance payments and in the final analysis they keep legitimate operators out of jobs.  At a time when work opportunities are scarce there is an evergrowing temptation to increase your competitiveness by any means possible and I fear that our growing forestry industry could become the growth area of Ireland's black economy.  Why have the Government not moved to stop it?  Why have they not made tax-paid receipts a mandatory stipulation for grant payments to the private sector?  Why, having included a reference to this in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have they not followed through with this in the Forestry Bill?</P>
    <P>The general tone of this Bill has an amazing tendency to state that many of its major decisions can only be made following approval from the Minister and in many instances also the decisions require the prior approval of the Minister for Finance.  The examples are so numerous, if one studies the proposed legislation, that it is obvious that the inclusion of any glaring examples would only serve to give the wrong idea because of the omission of other glaring examples.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing against Government interest in matters of national concern, but I am most definitely arguing against Government interference.  Surely the Government must be able to make up their mind about whether or not they wish to take forestry out of the hands of the Civil Service.  Having agreed to do this, why then does the Minister have to introduce such debilitating restrictions in the operating of the company.</P>
    <P>No one has spoken more often or more <Col N="295" /> convincingly of the need to establish forestry as a commercial orientated, market-driven industry than our present Minister; and, while I must say I admired his conviction in this regard, I feel that the Bill does not reflect his enthusiasm in this respect.  Could it be that he fell victim at the final hurdle to the bureaucratic overlords of the Civil Service who have more of a vested interest in the preservation of their own control over what happens than they have in commercial viability.  Why could the Minister not act according to his own wishes and commitments and cut the strings and trappings to float a company with the freedom to take decisions as they saw appropriate?</P>
    <P>This is not to say that there would not be accountability.  Of course, there should be.  Indeed, I would argue that section 31 of the proposed legislation should have been more specific in its requirement for an annual report.  I feel that if such a report is to be relevant it should be specified that it be presented not later than three months after end of year.  Also, the need for accountability could not be ignored, having regard to the requirement for central Exchequer funding which is so necessary.  It is difficult to equate the funding provisions of the Bill with the most up-to-date Forestry Department figures; and I sincerely hope that what is a good decision in principle, that is, the establishment of Coillte Teoranta is not used as a money saving device for the Exchequer dressed in a deceptive respectable garb.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that investment in forestry is not alone worthwhile, but essential for our economy, especially at a time when alternative farm enterprises are so important and when the EC looks so benignly on forestry development?  The figures speak for themselves.  Ireland imports over £300 million worth of timber and timber products annually.  The EC is a net importer of timber to a degree that it is second only in scale to its energy bill.  Surely nobody could quibble with continuing funding to build up our hectarage of forestry plantations to an acceptable national level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> My opening comments on this debate were ones of welcome.  I have referred to what I perceive to be serious shortcomings. They can be rectified.  My party are committed to positive, constructive opposition.  We have already stated our intention to put down amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope that the Government will be magnanimous enough to acknowledge our genuine interest in the development of the forestry industry by showing their appreciation for our proposals.  Let me conclude on a parochial note.  The Minister, my esteemed Oireachtas colleague from North Tipperary, will be aware of the lack of investment leading to industrial stagnation and a severe lack of job opportunities in Thurles town and environs.  I would formally request that, in line with Government policy on decentralisation, the administration headquarters of Coillte Teoranta be established in Thurles. There are a number of ideal locations within the town suitable for immediate start-up.  Thurles is geographically well situated, with an excellent primary road and rail network.  Regarding staffing, it has an abundance of accommodation and provides outstanding recreational and amenity facilities.  As Minister with responsibility for the location of these offices, I earnestly, appeal to him and his Government to give some little recognition to Thurles, which to date has suffered seriously from the Government's adverse decisions and total neglect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, as my colleagues are very anxious to avail of the time allowed.  First, let me congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  We are entitled to be critical of any proposal, but certainly I would be inclined to adopt the attitude of giving time to see how the legislation works. The move is generally in the right direction. I would hope that, perhaps on Committee Stage, we could examine some worrying aspects &mdash; for instance, with regard to the appointment of the chief executive.  I wonder why the three year element is there.  The whole funding is quite vague, also the time factor.  The <Col N="297" /> Forestry Review Body were quite clear about the urgency of this matter.  In a few short years we have come a long way.  It is not so long since our entire forestry output was being shipped out for peanuts, as pit props and such like.  We now have a very viable timber industry.  Irish timber is now regarded as first class material for housing and general utilisation, something that was not heard of a few short years ago.  It is not so long since a forester in my own area was the first person to use Irish timber in the construction of his bungalow.  I think that everybody was expecting it to fall down overnight.  For many hundreds of years all the stately mansions were built with native timber. Great credit is due to people like Woodfab who have survived many difficult periods and very tough competition on the timber scene.  They have built up a reputation for themselves, not only for good quality but for price competitiveness and continuity of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we still have only about 6 per cent of our country under trees, and certainly that must worry us.  This whole business of acquisition should be speeded up.  It seems very strange that there are imports into the EC worth many billions of pounds &mdash; a figure here has been mentioned of £200 million or £300 million. There are many areas in the country which are marginally suitable for cattle production because of the wet nature of the land and we are spending massive sums in trying to get that land into production. But if we are to have a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; policy, I would have thought that this would have been an obvious area for the EC to consider with regard to such a policy, purely and simply because one of the great problems of a family going about afforestation is the question of survival in the meantime.  It takes between 25 and 30 years for timber to mature, so how are they going to survive in the meantime?  One way would be for the EC to agree to allow a farmer to plant 100 acres with the aid of EC grants and to receive a regular income of £70 per acre from the set-aside funds.  I have already made that suggestion to the Minister for <Col N="298" /> Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy. There is so much marginal land in this country that many people would go into the planting of trees if such an incentive was provided.  After all, we have the most suitable climate in the world for the growing of trees and to my mind we are not making full use of it.</P>
    <P>We have been appealing to pension funds and the banks to get involved in the planting of trees.  Small projects have been undertaken in some areas but in other areas they have been resisted. Appealing to the pension funds has not produced the desired result which is strange because I am told the returns from timber would be well up to the returns from most tillage operations which would not be saying much for some of them.  After all, if a Dutch company can build Trabolgan at a cost of between £20 million and £30 million and can afford to wait for a return, surely, Irish insurance companies and Irish banks who have been investing abroad should hold consultations with Coillte Teoranta and get on with the task of planting in the vast acreages of marginal land?</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister visited a nursery of young forest trees in my own area of Cork.  Such a small industry holds opportunities for a limited number of people.  This is an entrepreneur who decided there was a profit to be made from such a project and instead of importing these young trees he decided to grow them himself.  The Minister was very impressed by this project.  However, what is crippling him and others like him &mdash; this goes for garden centres also &mdash; is the high rate of VAT on the seeds they import.  It is ridiculous in a country where people are crying out for the planting of trees that another Department should clap on a very high rate of VAT on the seeds which are being imported to grow these young trees.  I would like the Minister to take up this matter.  I have already raised it with the Minister for Finance but it appears he has not listened to me and, therefore, I hope he will listen to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for agreeing to visit Cork recently even <Col N="299" /> though he had no great news to tell us with regard to Glenbower Lake which is one of the two lakes in east Cork.  He pointed out that a lot of money would have to be spent but I would like to reassure him, as I did on that occasion, that in restoring the lake he would have the full support of the people of the area and they would do everything possible to help him in that project.  We would co-operate with his Department in every way.  Now that Coillte Teoranta have been established I hope it will be intermingled with the Forest and Wildlife Service. I do not see how the two can be separated.  Glenbower Wood, with its wildlife, flora and fauna, combined with the lake, forms a major amenity in the area and I think that with goodwill on all sides we could restore that amenity fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>I hope this new body will prove to be successful and that in the initial stages the priming funds will be made available. I hope also that they will liaise with other Departments and landowners to get the planting programme which is so badly needed underway fairly quickly.  I have always believed that in areas where there is a demand for timber from farmers that we should set up auctions at specific locations in order to facilitate these farmers. Finally I thank the Minister for bringing this important legislation before the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to say it struck me that it was very ungenerous of the Minister in his Second Stage speech not to put on record the enormous contribution which was made by the former Minister, Paddy O'Toole, in the formulation of this Bill before the House today. This Bill arose out of the recommendations of the Forestry Review Group which was set up by Paddy O'Toole when he was Minister in 1985. If others are not prepared to lay credit where it is due I certainly am.  It behoves us all to look back and consider the contribution which was made by the former Minister during those years in bringing us to the present position where a full <Col N="300" /> investigation into the commercial potential and the rational commercial exploitation of forestry has been set underway.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and what it intends to achieve.  No one can be satisfied with the rate of progress in afforestation, both in the private and public sectors.  We have fallen behind our counterparts in other European countries despite the fact that we have an eminently suitable climate and soil for the growing of trees.  All of the various factors and functions of the equation for a healthy industry appear to be in place but somehow the catalyst has not been provided and we did not get the end product.  Previous speakers have outlined the statistics in terms of what we import and how deficient the European Community is in timber production and in the production of timber products.  I will not cover that ground but I accept that the Bill should seek to redress the gaps and difficulties in those areas.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the Bill which concern me greatly and I think I am right in saying that no other contributor has addressed himself to these points.  Let me briefly highlight the environmental considerations and the concerns of the scientific community in relation to what is being proposed.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister devoted half a sentence to the environment.  I think that calls for an explanation from the Minister. It was an appalling omission on his part.  I appreciate we are on Second Stage of this Bill but as I am addressing myself to an area which has not heretofore been addressed by the other contributors.  I would like specifically to deal with section 13 of the Bill which relates to the general duties of Coillte Teoranta.  Section 13 (1) (c) reads:</P>
      <P>(c) to have due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of its operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only reference in the Bill to the environment and I think the Minister paraphrased that in the course of his remarks, also as his only reference to the environment.  On this side of the House we will be circulating an amendment for Committee Stage asking that there be <Col N="301" /> included in this section provision for consultation with the Minister for Finance in areas of scientific interest.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of an excellent document produced recently by the UPTCS entitled <i>Our National Heritage, A Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland.</i> If the Minister is not familiar with it I should like to draw his attention to it in some detail.  It deals with various aspects of conservation.  In particular the Land-Use Policy section, on page 5, explains the difficulties that have arisen through the mismatching of land and its use in this country.  We need as much land planted and under trees as we possibly can.  We have millions of hectares suitable for the planting of trees.  We must be quite sure that we direct the attentions of the public and private sectors to land suitable for afforestation, so that in no way will the provisions of this Bill be a threat to any areas of scientific interest, from a flora and fauna point of view and their habitats, or indeed of geomorphological interest, or areas of high amenity value from the built heritage point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address any of these aspects.  I do not perceive development as a threat to conservation; nor should conservationists or those concerned with conservation be seen as the enemy of development.  This is a developmental Bill.  I welcome it wholeheartedly.  In fact, I will go so far as to say we have been waiting far too long for this type of Bill and process to be debated in the House and implemented.  But in doing so I must point out that the enormous omission of a reference to our environment, or of even a reference to protecting areas of scientific interest, cannot be let go unheeded.  We will be pressing that aspect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In Ireland alone there are 80 sites which the International Union for the Conservation of Nature consider of international importance from the scientific point of view.  We have hundreds of other sites classified of lesser importance but nonetheless vitally important from the local and national points of view.</P>
    <P>In theory the provisions of this Bill <Col N="302" /> could allow those who wish to plant to plant on all these essential scientific areas.  Tree planting does not require planning permission in this country. There is no procedure in any law in this country whereby people can be prevented, or even dissuaded, from planting in areas of vital amenity or scientific value to the country.  It may seem a small consideration in the overall scheme of things. The Minister may be viewing the provisions of this Bill from a purely developmental point of view.  I welcome its provisions from a developmental point of view, but I cannot accept its provisions with this omission.  We must resolve this problem and allow the disquiet that the provisions of this Bill have aroused in the environmental and conservation areas to be appeased.</P>
    <P>This document of the UPTCS to which I have referred states at paragraph 2.4, Land-Use Policies:</P>
    <P>At present we continue to plant trees on low-yielding blanket bogs of great conservation value in their natural state, to use drumlins for cattle-grazing for which they are ill-suited, and to develop land on the outskirts of towns and cities without regard to its agricultural or amenity value.</P>
    <P>One of the great tragedies is the fact that we do not recognise the tourist, amenity and environmental values of our wetlands. Indeed, the bog in Ireland always has been synonymous with poverty and a hard way of life.  It has taken Dutch concern to point up to us the enormous environmental and amenity value of some of our bogs, particularly our blanket bogs.  There is no way, under the provisions of this Bill as they stand, that people can be prevented from developing our intact blanket bogs for afforestation. We cannot stand by and allow that to happen.  At least we must decide selectively where we will and will not allow it to happen.</P>
    <P>My concerns, if you like, to put brakes on certain areas of development for forestry must not be interpreted in any way as not supporting fully the ideals of this Bill.  I and the Fine Gael Party recognise <Col N="303" /> how important it is to get as much suitable land as possible under timber as quickly as possible.  On Committee Stage, apart from the brief reference to the environment, I will be asking the Minister to pad that out and to ensure that there will be consultation with the relevant Ministers on different aspects.  For example, when it comes to the National Monuments Acts it is the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works who must be consulted if there is any threat to our built heritage from afforestation.  When it comes to areas of scientific interest I understand that we must consult the Minister for Finance himself.  I will leave that to the present Minister and his advisers to detail that, if necessary.  Of course, the Minister for the Environment would have an input on other aspects.</P>
    <P>On 1 July next Ireland will have to implement the Environmental Impact Analysis Directive of the EC.  I welcome the response I got yesterday from the Taoiseach, having raised the matter on the Order of Business on three occasions over the last three weeks.  The Environmental Impact Analysis Directive will be a European watchdog on how we treat our environment in the future, particularly in relation to major construction projects or to any development in a green field area.  In fact, afforestation on virgin land comes into Annex II of this directive. Annex I is mandatory.  Annex II will be non-mandatory after 1 July.  I very much welcome the fact that the Taoiseach assured me in a letter yesterday from which I might quote:</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify that no indication has been given that Ireland intends to implement the Directive in respect of Annex I projects only.  In fact, you will see from what I have said above that such an option is not open to us; the Directive requires us to have environmental impact assessments for those Annex II projects which we believe likely to significantly affect the environment.</P>
    <P>This is most important in regard to what <Col N="304" /> we are talking about here today.  That is why on Committee Stage we will be tabling amendments to ensure consultation with the relevant Ministers in areas where there may be sensitivity from an environmental or scientific point of view or from the point of view of our built heritage.</P>
    <P>We are talking about limited sites in our country which would not be suitable for afforestation.  There is an enormous range of marginal land in this country crying out for afforestation which will be designated as a set aside consideration when it comes to European agricultural grants in the future.  The question of whether we will be designating environmentally sensitive areas for particular protection and farming methods comes into this also.  There are certain areas in the country we must protect in the future. We must insist that we do not mismatch land use with what we are intending under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his remarks that he welcomed the fact that the Forestry Commissioner would visit Ireland in July next because it would give him a greater appreciation of our country, so that hopefully he would rattle the purse somewhat more generously as far as Ireland is concerned.  I hate to tell the Minister that that has not been the experience in the fisheries sector when the Fisheries Commissioner, Cardosa E Cunha, came and was welcomed by me, the Minister and everyone else in July of last year.  In fact, following his visit, for the first time ever, we got the lowest percentage funding from the FEOGA grants for aquaculture and marine projects generally.  I do not want to wish the same on the Minister in the forestry area. I would ask him to please watch this space carefully.  It does not follow, when one hosts a Commissioner to Ireland and shows him what we need, that he will deliver.  In fact, the reverse happened in the fisheries area.  We have been fighting an ongoing battle in relation to FEOGA grants ever since.  I merely draw the Minister's attention to that fact.  He made the statement as if having the Commissioner and hosting him to our lovely country <Col N="305" /> would automatically indicate that matters had to improve.  I would ask the Minister to please watch it carefully.  He will have my support all the way in ensuring that the same does not happen in his portfolio as happened in fisheries.  I know I am being slightly facetious in saying that. Nevertheless, I am making the point to the Minister for his careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think we should welcome him but watch him carefully and how he responds afterwards.  The Bill before us uses the same template as was used to set up An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann with perhaps an anomaly or a difference that I do not understand and about which I would welcome an explanation from the Minister when he responds on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 17 allows the Minister for Finance to have the controlling interest in this company and the Minister for Forestry or Energy to have a minor shareholding. In An Post and Telecom Éireann it was the other way round; the Minister for Finance had a minority interest. Would the Minister please explain why he feels it necessary for the Minister for Finance to clutch to his bosom this particular bit of legislation and hold it there tightly rather than allowing the area concerned to have the major controlling interest?  I await the Minister's explanation of that.</P>
      <P>Generally my contribution in wholeheartedly welcoming the thrust of the Bill has been to bring to the Minister's attention my deep concerns about the lack of provision for protecting certain sensitive environmental amenity and scientific areas.  I trust the Minister will suport our amendments or bring forward amendments of his own on Committee Stage to rectify this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that concerns me also.  When we questioned many of the aspects of this Bill we were told that they would be taken care of in the memorandum of association or articles of association.  I would like the Minister to <Col N="306" /> indicate before final acceptance of this Bill how different matters will be taken care of in the memorandum of association or the articles of association, as the Minister refers to them.  For example, will this body be empowered to gift land that they perhaps do not need or have decided should not be planted on to other State or semi-State agencies for protection? For example, the management of forestry from a conservation point of view is quite different from the management of forestry from a developmental point of view.  We need only look towards the beautiful oaklands of Glendalough which the forestry have now given back to the Office of Public Works for conservation.  I welcome that as farsighted and in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve here this morning.  But the two different types of management mean that this new body may find on their hands forestry developments of one kind or another which should be maintained for conservation and which they might want to gift to the wildlife section of the Office of Public Works or indeed any other State body.  Will this Bill, or the heretofore unseen articles of association, allow this body to gift land for conservation or any other use when they deem it not necessary to their particular needs?  I would like to know what the Minister intends to put in the articles of association before finally accepting this Bill, because that apparently can direct an awful lot in terms of the purchase and sale of land, the price that would be requested, whether land can be gifted etc.  There is probably an awful lot in there that I am not aware of and would be concerned about if I were.  Could we see or at least be told the bones of what the Minister intends to include in his articles of association before finally accepting this Bill?</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say generally that afforestation cannot be in conflict with good conservation strategy and that public funds should never be applied for afforestation of sites or areas of scientific or conservation interest, especially in our blanket bogs, and I will not delay the House by going through all the many <Col N="307" /> other areas.  Will the Minister please assure us, before we wind up on Second Stage, that he accepts my views in this area and that he will be amenable to amendments putting in safeguards for these areas?</P>
    <P>The integration of conservation and development policy must be right through all the legislation we pass in this House, from the planning Acts to the water, the air and the pollution Acts.  All of this area, when we are touching on our environment and development, we must integrate right from scratch, right from the time the parliamentary draftsman starts off on a new Bill.  We must integrate conservation strategy, into any development policy such as we have here today, and then we will be looking towards the long term economic benefit of our country and not just settling for short term monetary gain.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity now that we must not miss.  I do not want to see us back in this House arguing and fighting across the House in the future about what Coillte Teoranta are doing or what areas they intend to plant, with the planning Acts not being able to prevent them.  We may call for an environmental impact analysis, as we will be entitled to do at the time, but I would like these provisions in the Act so that there will be a procedure for consultation with the relevant Minister to ensure that difficulty and acrimony do not arise.</P>
    <P>This Bill, thankfully, is about money growing on trees.  We welcome it wholeheartedly with the few provisos I have mentioned.  Forestry is indeed an excellent long term investment with low risk and generous tax advantages.  The incentives in Ireland for tree planting at the moment include grants for planting and maintenance, free technological advisory service and a tax regime which is adapted to the needs of woodland ownership generally.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  We have the <Col N="308" /> advantages which I outlined initially, in our climate, soil type, technical expertise and availability of land.  The Minister has our general support on a Bill that was initiated by the former Minister, Mr. Paddy O'Toole.  We are delighted with what it is trying to achieve.  We will in no way hinder its objectives.  The one area on which I am looking forward to a positive response from the Minister is in relation to provisions to protect our environment and to ensure there will be no mismatch of land use with afforestation. We have plenty of land and we want it planted.  We do not want our sicentific areas of international, national and local importance interfered with by tree planting.  We want the proper type of tree planting in the different areas.  I would like to encourage broadleaf planting and I look forward to a very successful implementation of Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make three very quick points.  There are about 20 staff employed in Eolas in the forest products division of what was formerly the IIRS.  At present these people are mostly engaged in selling their services to the present forestry division of the Department of Forestry.  Those people feel, and I think their management agrees with them, that they would be best located within the new company in that it is likely that if they are not brought into the company the company will develop its own in-house capacity to provide the sort of service that it is now buying from the forest products division of Eolas.</P>
      <P>They certainly are worried that if that were to happen the relevance of their work in Eolas would diminish and the body of expertise that has been built up in forestry within Eolas would be dispersed and used perhaps for other purposes for which the people concerned have not been trained.  I would like the Minister, when he replies, to give us some assurance in regard to the role of the forestry division of Eolas and I would hope he would be able to agree to the suggestion I am making that this division would be shifted from Eolas to the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two other points.  One concerns <Col N="309" /> the objects of the company.  I notice that in addition to carrying on the business of forestry and forest-related activities the company will be able to establish and carry on woodland industries.  I would like to know what is the difference between forest-related activities and woodland activities, or is that just tautology?  That is not a facetious question because it is important to know what the company may and may not do, and the interpretation is therefore important. However, it would appear that the new company will be able to extend themselves into areas that are quite a distance from the simple growing of trees.  In so doing, as they will in their main activity, they will be entering into direct competition with private operators trying to do the same thing, with the advantage however that they will be selling the raw material to themselves or to their own subsidiaries and there is the possibility of preferential terms <i>vis-à-vis</i> the competitors operating woodland industries privately who would also have to buy from them.</P>
    <P>It might make sense to have some system of fair trade practice rules laid down by the Fair Trade Commission to ensure that the forestry company do not compete unfairly or offer discriminatory terms or relatively more favourable provisions as to supply to its own subsidiaries engaged in the woodland industry against another company in the private sector engaging in the same type of woodland industry.  With respect, assurances from the Minister on this point are not worth much.  That is not a reflection on the present Minister, but ministerial assurances here in the Dáil carry no legal effect in a competitive situation.  What is now needed is that the Minister and the Fair Trade Commission would agree under the powers which they have a set of fair practice rules which would govern both the new company and its private sector competitors.  It is possible to have private and public sector activities operating side by side in an area such as this but it is important that they should do so on &mdash; to use the cliché &mdash; a level playing field.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I was allowed to speak <Col N="310" /> out of turn by Deputy Jim Higgins.  The final point which I wish to make, and I am sure it has been made by others, is the need to ensure &mdash; and this is certainly a public sector role &mdash; that broadleaf trees have a reasonable share of the overall plan in the country and that we do not go for quick growing Sitka or other type trees which are not the natural historic trees which are most prevalent in this country and that we preserve a reasonable mix of oak trees and other trees which have a much lower commercial return.  I am sure the Minister will give attention to that matter.  I am aware that grants are offered for the purpose; but, given the length of time in which it takes to get the money back, it requires very long sighted people to accept grants for the planting of oak trees.  I am open to correction on that, as there may be some people who can see that far into the future.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that when replying.  If this company are to be completely commercial in their activities they may well see that there is not any great commercial value, even for them, with their longer perspective than any individual, in becoming involved in this long range planting.  Perhaps, the Minister would refer to that also in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because at this stage of the debate one notices that the arguments by and large, apart from rare exceptions are a regurgitation of previous arguments made on both sides of the House, or should I say on one side of the House?  One of the strangest aspects of this debate is that for the past few hours nobody has offered from the Minister's side of the House. Are we to interpret this as a lack of interest on the Minister's side, that there is a lack of support for the legislation or that there is a bland acceptance of the legislation?  No matter what interpretation you wish to put on the lack of offers by way of verbiage from the other side of the House, I think there is an obligation on both sides to contribute. No measure, irrespective of how well <Col N="311" /> intentioned it may be or how meticulous the draftmanship may be, can be so perfect that it can gain the passive, bland, docile acceptance of each side of the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure but in doing so I want to stitch into the record of the House the point made by the two previous speakers, Deputy Avril Doyle and Deputy John Bruton, in relation to the contribution of our predecessors and in particular my predecessor in my constituency, former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and Defence and the Gaeltacht, Deputy O'Toole, who together with his Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, took the initial steps for the legislation which is before the House today.  He is somebody who did a lot of work and I can assure Deputy McCoy it is not just magnanimous for magnanimity sake.  His ideals were good but, unfortunately, they did not bear fruition.  Had they borne fruition perhaps Deputy O'Toole would be in this bench today and not I.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the people over the years who got the forestry service under way from very small beginnings.  They were pitifully slow at the outset because of lack of research, lack of confidence and lack of finance.  In 1904 the State forest service was founded from very modest beginnings.  From the year 1904 to 1922 a total of 1,300 hectares were planted.  From 1922-34 the target was 1,200 hectacres per annum; from 1934-50 it was 2,800 hectacres per annum.  The real growth and the real dynamism in relation to forestry &mdash; if it could be called such, because we never reached the level of achievement that was merited in this area &mdash; was in the period 1949-53 when we brought in the European recovery programme of Ireland's long term programme for strategy and development.  This succeeded in bringing on stream an annual planting target of 10,000 hectacres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Coillte Teoranta, but like many other people I bemoan the wasted years when we languished and wondered <Col N="312" /> and planned and did not do much about it, the years when we looked to other resources, when we took the geography books as being a chapter in our past in terms of mineral exploitation and availability. Tynagh Mines came on stream and the whole concept, ideas and philosophy that we had no mine resources in this country were suddenly shattered.  We had the oil crisis in 1974 when there was a massive growth and speculation in onshore development and everybody speculated and wondered about licensing terms.  Everybody was hung up by ideologies as to what the State share should be and what the private investors cut of the loot should be.  At the end of the day we still do not have a commercial oil field and still the speculation continues.  We are now on the brink of another silly season in relation to licensing terms, exploration terms, tax revenue cuts etc. Every ideological hitch-hiker has his own idea of what each respective share should be.</P>
    <P>During all this period we have been sitting on a blatantly obvious revenue source that has been lain wasted, underutilised and untapped.  That is why I sincerely welcome this measure.  I welcome the intention of the Minister, Deputy Smith, in this regard and the manner in which he has grasped the nettle and brought something tangible, realistic and feasible on stream &mdash; a proposal which, I hope, will provide the dynamics for the growth needed in this much neglected source of revenue over the years.  There is no need for me to spell out the role of forestry as a resource to the economy. As has been said time and again, and when if anything has been over reported &mdash; the Minister was aware of this when we sat on the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities for four years, while we were in the Seanad and when we presided over a very worthwhile report &mdash; we all arrived at the conclusion that we had a cinderella growth area which badly needed exploitation, utilisation and development.  In 1973-77 the time when we entered the European Community <Col N="313" /> and the inception of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; we ran madly down the field of agricultural development in terms of creating mountains of beef, milk and other food resources.  We created embarrassing gluts which we are now trying to redress by giving them away or by devising some disingenuous schemes for taking the top off those mountains.</P>
    <P>We have neglected this massive indigenous resource which we have in Ireland.  When one looks at the figures one will see that they are a stark reminder and indictment of our neglect of this particular area.  At present Ireland has a mere 6 per cent of its land mass under afforestation.  Britain has 9 per cent, France 27 per cent, Germany 29 per cent and Finland 71 per cent whereas it has been scientifically proven that in terms of productivity capacity we have the highest possible yield in the entire European land mass particularly for Sitka spruce and Lodgepole pine.  I reiterate the point made by Deputy Bruton that we should not go away from the deciduous trees that are native and indigenous to this country, and I welcome the Minister's recent announcement about giving a higher element of grant for the promotion and encouragement of incentives in this area.  The incentives of late have been excellent particularly for private afforestation. Under the western package we have a grant level of 85 per cent to a farmer to plant his land to give him a yield or crop that will be for his benefit as well as for the nation's benefit, and 70 per cent for others.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and we have a consensus on this, the take-up has not been good.  I welcomed the Minister's announcement some time ago of the introduction of headage payments by way of <i>ad hoc</i> payments while the crop is coming on-stream.  The minimum wait period is 15 to 20 years before the thinnings come onstream and yield an income.  While the concept is good, unfortunately I do not think it offers the level of income support either to small or big farmers to encourage them to devote <Col N="314" /> their land to this type of crop investment. It is too long coming onstream and the amount of headage yield is negligible. Where you are talking about an exact <i>quid pro quo</i>, replacing a farmer's income that he got initially from headage payment by an equivalent amount for poor quality land, it is quite obvious that the amount of headage for cattle or sheep on poor quality land will have been minimal indeed.  The Minister will have to look at some additional top-up mechanism or form of income support if we are to get the area of forestry we are seeking.</P>
    <P>The grants are a considerable inducement in terms of capital investment but the unsolved problem is where we get an adequate support income for a farmer, his wife and family while they are waiting for the thinnings and for the crop to yield and bear fruit.  As I have said, I bemoan the fact that we have not plugged into this sort of income earlier.  Over the years we could have enhanced many a small farmer's income in the west in marginal land areas had we brought in a dynamic afforestation policy earlier.  I ask the Minister what is going to happen to &mdash; on my estimation &mdash; the 40,000 acres of Land Commission land which was unallocated at the time of the decision to abolish the Land Commission.  It would be well worth the Minister's while to look at the possibility of again having this land devoted to the new Coillte Teoranta concept.</P>
    <P>The great fallacy that has helped to militate against afforestation up to now is that you had to think big, that unless a farmer was in a position to devote huge stretches or tracts of land to afforestation, there was no point in it.  From the point of view of private afforestation, particularly where we have a land mix, rather than farmers being given considerable amounts of money to continue draining land which nature never intended for agricultural purposes, these farmers should be encouraged to devote small tracts of land &mdash; I know there is a threshold below which the new agency or the Minister cannot draw down or allocate grants for afforestation and that <Col N="315" /> threshold is reasonable &mdash; called bottom land to afforestation rather than encourage them to use it for agricultural purposes thereby exacerbating the glut and the food mountains resulting from the oversupply of various foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The yield is considerable.  We are talking about a minimum of £12,000 worth of timber per hectare, but we must get across to people the idea that in terms of income yield this is the figure, that it is a realistic and achievable target and that in yield forestry can now more than compete with other forms of land diversification and uses.  We need a massive publicity drive initially to ensure that the scheme is launched on a positive note so that the level of take-up not alone anticipates but exceeds the targets.  A massive advertising campaign is very important in this area.</P>
    <P>Research has been referred to, particularly by Deputy Carey from this side of the House.  Here there seem to be some omissions from the Bill, although the Minister may intend to fill in details or provide the necessary back-up service in this regard.  Research is vital.  It is a multifaceted area.  We are talking about research in genetics, ground preparation, nutrition, weed control, thinning, spacing, entomology, conservation etc.  It is a vast area and up to now, even though we have achieved a figure of 10,000 to 14,000 hectares per annum of late, operational research has been grossly neglected.  Our commitment &mdash; or lack of it &mdash; in the area of wood technology was well underlined when in 1980 the grant for research in wood technology was withdrawn completely, thereby setting us into arrears in this area and underlining again our lack of commitment to the whole afforestation area.</P>
    <P>Irish timber has the potential to be as good as the best but only provided we commit ourselves to its preparation, grading, drying and presentation.  We will not push the importers off the market or elbow them aside or gain our import substitution segment of the market unless our timber is of quality.  Bad presentation <Col N="316" /> has ruined us and our reputation with people in the construction industry and the industrial field in general has suffered. Of all the areas of presentation nothing could be more important than grading.  Marketing is enormously important. Up to now the Forestry and Wildlife Service have been involved in selling rather than marketing timber.  In fairness to the people in the FWS they have not been trained in this.  They have no experience or particular skill in it and no market research has been properly undertaken.</P>
    <P>The matter of where the headquarters should be based has been well put for various parts of the country.  I understand that Deputy Lowry had a strong case, of which the Minister of State would be very conscious, of the need to locate it in North Tipperary, and the Tipperary lobby who now have a Minister and two Ministers of State from the county will be making a very strong bid.  I submit that some area that has a high element of marginal land, that has been proven as having a potential higher yield than even Finland, Norway and Sweden, a high incidence of marginal land which is of no benefit whatever for anything other than trees and can produce a higher level and quality of tree than anywhere else in northern Europe, should be considered. That is why I am convinced that had my predecessor, the man who initiated this measure, Paddy O'Toole&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;retained his seat and continued as Minister and had he managed to bring to fruition the legislative proposals from the review committee, Ballina would have been the headquarters of the new Coillte Teoranta. I cannot think of an area more central to Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and the entire coast, with excellent port facilities.  I cannot think of an area that would better merit recognition as the ideal location for a headquarters than the town of Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure is good and positive and I commend the Minister on bringing it <Col N="317" /> in.  He has brought something onstream here which future generations will look upon and reflect that this House today in passing Second Stage did something really worthwhile to elevate what has been a Cinderella industry thus far to its proper status, rule and perspective in the national economy.  It is an imaginative Bill, perhaps there is an element of gambling in it but, if it is tackled with vigour and determination, it is equipped to deal with the job.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the sentiments of Deputy Carey in relation to the people who will be giving advice.  The ACOT advisers have done an excellent job in their own field and have been involved in afforestation to a limited extent; they should also be involved in promotion and giving advice.  I also share Deputy Carey's anxiety in relation to the failure by the Minister to properly quantify the valuation of the assets bequeathed by the State to the new organisation.  It is important to put a realistic valuation on it so that when the targets are met, when the annual report is made and the figures published, we will not get an under-valuation or an over-valuation.  It is an excellent idea to make them a private body but I hope we will not give it the independence of operation which we gave to An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann because this week a measure for consumer protection in relation to the activities of those two organisations had to be introduced by this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I urge the Minister to keep a watching brief on the organisation's activities.  Their success should be monitored and, if they need to be revamped, updated or revitalised, he should have the necessary humility to come before the House if certain measures need to be amended or changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is at a premium and I will be brief.  The Minister's proposal to set up a new State company to manage and develop our publicly owned forests is a welcome and innovative measure. The new company, to be known as Coillte Teoranta, will have, as their objective, the achievement of profit for the nation <Col N="318" /> from a natural resource which has been grossly neglected and undermanaged in the past.</P>
      <P>This is further evidence of the Government's utter commitment to forestry and afforestation which will result in an obvious benefit to the economy.  This commitment was first portrayed by the Taoiseach's appointment of a Minister of State to take sole charge of forestry, thus giving it a whole new significance and profile and departing from the traditional method of tagging it on to some other Department or Departments.  This was a major challenge to the appointee but few Deputies will disagree that Deputy Smith responded magnificently to the challenge. His grasp, knowledge of and flair for his subject is clearly recognised.  This is evidenced by the tremendous progress made in the brief period since he took office.</P>
      <P>Earlier this morning Deputy Doyle claimed credit for her former colleague in respect of progress made in forestry. We should all be grossly ashamed of the lack of progress in forestry until the Government and the Minister tackled the problem in a serious manner.  This is the first progressive and serious approach to the whole issue.  In 1987, for instance, the level of planting here was the highest in history, 11,000 hectacres, and all the signs are that 1988 will be another record year in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new company will be set up on the same lines as An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann as the format in relation to them has been successful.  The new board comprises nine members and chief executive, which is about right for optimum efficiency.  I have no doubt that those appointed to the board will be of appropriate management calibre and expertise. The responsibility the board will assume is quite awesome.  We are talking about taking over hundreds of millions of pounds worth of this country's assets which have taken many years to accumulate and for which the taxpayer has footed the bill.  It is envisaged that the new company will handle the commercial aspect of forestry only and will be staffed by the transfer of people from the Forestry <Col N="319" /> Service.  The Minister will retain responsibility for non-commercial activities such as wildlife and forest parks, etc.</P>
    <P>The Government have clearly recognised the potential of forestry as a major growth industry and are now taking the necessary action to ensure that such growth materialises.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another industry which comes into the same category in terms of growth potential.  It is very important that these two industries complement each other.  They can &mdash; and must be &mdash; closely related.  Haphazard planting without proper planning in terms of location, species and so on could seriously detract from tourism development into which the Government are putting so much effort and concentration.  This is particularly relevant as far as my own county is concerned where we lean very heavily on both these industries in terms of the overall economy of the county.  We have a wonderful, scenic countryside, much of which is attributable to the work of the forestry people over the years in relation to forest walks and the beautiful Avondale. It is very important for these two industries to work hand-in-hand.  It is essential that planting is designed in such a way that the resulting forest will compliment and adorn the countryside instead of detracting from its beauty.</P>
    <P>Our beauty spots and scenic areas cannot only be enhanced but expanded by careful attention to detail in this respect.  In this context, the Forestry and Wildlife Service must be complimented and congratulated on their attention to date to forest location and design.  The people involved deserve great credit.  In my day-to-day activities, I have had occasion to meet and to get to know intimately many of the foresters over the years and they are dedicated people. Year after year qualified people have emerged from our forestry colleges, with the result that we can now boast of a wealth of experience and expertise in this whole area.  The culpability for forestry not having developed commercially as it should, cannot be blamed on our foresters. The fault lies squarely on the <Col N="320" /> shoulders of successive Governments who failed to recognise or regard forestry development as a serious commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>It is vital that a concentrated, commercial approach is taken to this industry which has such a vast potential for wealth creation, long term perhaps, but that is the way we must think.  Planting is important but the planting of particular species and the range, from a commercial point of view, is also very important.  It is regrettable that negligible amounts of hardwood were planted in the past.  Hardwood timber planting amounts to a mere 3 per cent of total planting and, apparently, one-third of that was ash for hurleys.</P>
    <P>This takes us back to the necessity for a commercial approach which, had it been taken earlier, would have resulted in more substantial quantities of hardwood being available.  Had that occurred we could be thinking of processing that type of timber in the manufacture of furniture for the home and export markets.  We have allowed much of our hardwood forestry to be laid waste and there was no better example of that than in my own county of Wicklow.  We saw the great oak woods of Coolattin being ravaged in a most indiscriminate way.  The great oaks were felled and exported for personal profit and replanting, as stipulated in planning permissions granted, was not adhered to.  To add insult to injury, some of that Irish timber which was exported to Europe was imported by us in the form of furniture.  The consolation is that there still stands a section of those great woods in Wicklow in an area known as Tomnafinnoge woods.  For that we must thank the Taoiseach who, with the Minister responsible for forestry, Deputy Michael Smith, visited the area last year.  The resultant action brought to an end the destruction that was taking place.  That type of destruction of our inheritance must never be allowed occur again anywhere in our country.</P>
    <P>With the changes taking place in agriculture it is necessary that farmers look to new horizons and seek alternatives.  In this context forestry is an obvious and <Col N="321" /> realistic choice.  The Government have taken positive action to encourage and promote private tree planting.  It is also intended to extract from the EC greater financial incentives for the promotion and encouragement of private planting.  That increased funding will materialise, I have no doubt, because the Europeans are only too aware of their own disadvantages and limitations in the matter of tree planting as compared with the wonderful God-given agronomic, climatic and environmental advantages we enjoy.</P>
    <P>The measure before us is of great importance to County Wicklow which, percentage wise, has more of its area planted than any other county.  In Wicklow forestry, and the timber business in general, play a big role in the economy. The industry, which provides in excess of 1,000 jobs, is the largest source of work in Wicklow.  At this stage I am sure the Minister of State has been lobbied on many occasions about the siting of the headquarters of the new body and I should like to add my voice to that lobby.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Foynes is the place for the new headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many Deputies who would like to see the headquarters of the new company set up in their constituencies. I am no different and I have been pressing the Minister, and will continue to do so, to locate the headquarters of Coillte Teoranta in Wicklow which is the premier forestry county.  In my view Wicklow has all the attributes and qualifications to accommodate the new company. Indeed, there is a need for the fillip which the locating of the headquarters would give to the economy of the county. In recent years the economy of Wicklow has been devastated by the run down of operations such as those in the fertiliser and pottery industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to acheive decentralisation it is not essential to transfer an operation 100 or 150 miles from Dublin.  I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to my invitation to site Coillte Teoranta in the garden county.  Such a <Col N="322" /> move would be welcomed in Wicklow. The Minister has been informed that there are people in Wicklow who are prepared to provide ideal office accommodation should it be deemed necessary or appropriate.  In conclusion, I should like to wish the Minister continued success in his work and I wish the new board every success in the work that lies ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for giving such a warm welcome to the Bill.  It is clear that there is widespread support for the measure, even though we may differ in regard to some of the provisions.  The support for the Bill is such that I am sure it will be passed very speedily.  The Government decided to reorganise the Forest Service at a time when the industry is facing a most exciting but challenging and competitive future.  New opportunities will continue to emerge for timber sales at home and abroad.  We need to have in place an organisation that will ensure that such development takes place speedily and with benefits to the Irish taxpayer. We must ensure we are in a position to take up the opportunities as they arise.</P>
      <P>The new company will assume responsibility for all our commercial forests. It will have an agreed capital structure and the power to borrow.  I do not want to make light of the task that lies ahead of the new company.  When legislation is introduced here some Members believe that is all that remains to be done. In this case there is a gigantic task ahead for the staff of the new company if they are to ensure that the opportunities at home in supplanting imports of wood and timber products and those developing in the Community and Worldwide are grasped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past Governments have invested huge sums of money in forestry.  We do not want to have for all time a subsidised forestry industry.  We want it to be independent and the establishment of the new company will pave the way for that development.  Our aim is to have an industry that is financially self-sufficient. Some Members have expressed a worry <Col N="323" /> about the environment and so on and I should like to tell them that the only way we can guarantee we will be in a position to deal with such matters is to take the pressure off our taxpayers and have a self-sufficient industry.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Doyle was worried about the absence of provisions to protect our environment.  That is not so and I should like to refer her to section 13 (1) (c) which states that the company shall have:</P>
    <P>... due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of its operations.</P>
    <P>Section 38 (1) (c) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, issue directions in writing to the company requiring the company&mdash;</P>
    <P>to maintain or use specified land or premises in the company's possession for a particular purpose. </P>
    <P>They are worthwhile safeguards. Another provision enables the company to be refunded by the Minister for activities of a non-commercial nature which it carries out.  The company will be required to operate in a commercial way and it is fair to say that without the provisions I have referred to environmental and non-commercial activities, such as those related to forest parks and so on, would be neglected.  We have ensured that will not happen.</P>
    <P>Since we assumed power we have not been depending solely on the provisions of this Bill to indicate our awareness of the necessity to make the public as a whole more conscious of the environment. Deputy Jacob referred to the desecration of Coolattin which was taking place when we came to power. The oak canopy which overhangs Tomnafinnoge wood is still there because of the action we took.  We were not satisfied just to preserve a dwindling part of our oakwood inheritance.  We introduced an increased level of grants for the private planting of broadleaf trees and ensured <Col N="324" /> that the national planting programme will contain an increasing element of broadleaf plantation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We introduced a further measure relating to ash growing.  The Forest Service has opened up the forests to the public, has provided forest parks and picnic sites and has transferred over a number of years vast tracts of land under the most generous terms to the Office of Public Works.  If Deputies or organisations identify sites held by the Forest Service which are of a scientific, historical or other interest, we will have the same open policy of transferring those properties to the OPW.  Deputy Doyle referred to the recent case at Glendalough. We do not have to go much further in indicating our awareness of the environmental matters which hinge on these provisions.  We are not satisfied just to instal legal and statutory instruments. We have taken measures on the ground which have proved our concern not just to talk about these questions but to take action.</P>
      <P>I do not want to diverge from the provisions of this Bill but I will respond to the question Deputy Kavanagh has raised regarding another Bill.  A few weeks ago the Government cleared certain provisions which will be introduced as soon as possible to deal with a question he raised with regard to the compensatory features of the Local Government (Planning) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the method used to value estates.  Certainly we need to establish valuations at the earliest possible date.  A great deal of work has already been done but there are many aspects to valuation, including forest, land and buildings.  There is no difficulty in valuing buildings, roads, bridges and land but the valuation of a forest estate is a complex matter to which we are giving great attention.  We hope before the final passage of this Bill to give a detailed indication of our forest valuation.  I am aware of the points made <Col N="325" /> by Deputy Carey and Deputy McCoy in regard to valuation and the implications for the balance sheet of the company. These points will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The figure of £1 billion for authorised share capital in section 10 (2) (a) is designed to cover immediate share issues relating to the value of the estate and also future equity funding in the medium term.  It is not solely the value of the assets being transferred.  I cannot understand the concern regarding the major or minor shareholding in this company.  The shares are being held by the State, not for the gain of an individual Minister. The sections relating to the holding of shares are representative of normal shareholding provisions in other legislation. It is not inconsistent that the Minister who provides the finance should be the major shareholder.</P>
    <P>Deputies also expressed the wish to see the opening balance sheet of the company. I have already referred to the valuation of assets and it is reasonable that the company should deal with all relevant matters in their first annual report which, under section 31, will be laid before the House in accordance with normal practice. I will deal with this point in more detail on Committee Stage.  The points made by Deputies are relevant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey is concerned to know where in the Bill performance indicators are covered.  There are a number of sections which provide either for the setting of targets for the company or for eliciting information on performance. Section 38 (7) provides for the stipulation of financial and other targets to be achieved by the company.  Section 14 provides for agreement on the annual programme of the company for land and timber sales.  Section 31 provides for specific information to be included in the annual report of the company, apart from normal compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act.  We will always have the right to deal appropriately with the directors if their performance is not up to scratch.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCoy indicated that he saw <Col N="326" /> no clear corporate purpose or commercial mandate for the company in the Bill.  I refer him to sections 12 and 13 where it is clearly provided that the company will utilise the resources at its disposal in a commercial, cost-effective and efficient manner.  Additional objectives will, of course, be provided by way of section 38 (7) and the targets to be set for the company.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the problems relating to staff.  Personnel management and the general regime must provide incentives and flexibility and the bottom line accountability which will unleash the energies of the staff in the Forest Service to meet the mandate laid down in this Bill.  The clear message from the staff is that they accept the concept of transferring from the present service to company status and look forward to the new environment they expect this will create.  They will be able to get on with the job in a more efficient way.  It is clear that in the past they have often been frustrated by the difficulties of several imprecise and frequently contradictory goals.  Only those staff engaged in the activities being transferred to the company will be designated for transfer and discussions are on-going with the trade unions and staff associations in that regard.  It will be up to the company to develop manpower policies thereafter in accordance with their needs.  While the pension liabilities of all retired staff may be transferred to the company, the Minister for Finance will be liable for the cost of those pensions and the pension entitlements of all staff up to vesting day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock raised a point concerning guarantees to staff in regard to conditions of employment and felt there might be different treatment before, on or after vesting day.  I can assure him they will not receive any different treatment. I will consider making the relevant references more explicit.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies referred to the absence of marketing in the Bill.  I think they will understand that that is really a matter for the company as they must evaluate current and emerging needs and plan to meet them.  The whole <Col N="327" /> underlying reason for the establishment of this company is to provide the organisation with the mechanics to be more market and business orientated.  While references have been made in the past to the forest service marketing tactics, the tender system and so on, which were exaggerated and the criticisms unjustified, the forest service has made great strides in recent times in relation to its strategy and to the needs of the industry. In addition, all staff have received training in marketing techniques with an eye to the future needs of the company in this area.</P>
    <P>In the past year and a half we have introduced a number of new types of sales.  We have had a number of very successful national auctions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including Christmas trees, where we raised the income from £300,000 in the previous year to £700,000 without increasing the number of trees that were sold.  We have also tried to improve the quota system.  Quite a number of the processors now have advance notice of a certain percentage of availability of their supplies year in and year out.  This has obviously provided much more stability to this situation.  We intend to continue down the road of exploring new opportunities and new ways of developing that market.  We stand open to suggestion.  We are not solely depending on the tender system. Whenever there is an insufficiency of supply you have to adopt some system which limits sales.  The tender system obviously is one way of disposing of supplies at a time when you are not able to supply all demands.</P>

    <P>I do not think there is any relationship between the points which were made on marketing and the failure to sell off all the immature forests which were put up for sale in 1987.  The fact that we did not sell all the immature tracts last year does not suggest any failure on our part.  It would have been a failure on our part if <Col N="328" /> we sold these properties for the bids that were offered.  I said when they were put up for sale that we would not accept unacceptable bids.  If the Opposition parties want the Government to sell for the sake of selling, to accept the prices that are offered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though that presented an enormous financial problem for us last year, because we were obliged to raise £3 million through this source in order to have an extended advanced planting programme, we decided not to sell because the bids were not acceptable and we were short significant funds as a result.  We still maintained the advanced programme of planting and generated finance from other savings and other sales including Christmas trees.</P>

      <P>It is one thing to criticise but it is another to come up with a proposition or a suggestion as to how they should be sold in different ways.  As far as I am concerned, as long as I have the responsibility no properties will be sold unless I am happy that the correct value is paid for them.  We should ensure that in the national interest, and in the interest <Col N="329" /> of the taxpayer and the generations of people who have provided much money to make sure that these forests would be provided in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides, under section 12 (1) (b), for the establishment of woodland industries, which includes any form of industry related to timber processing. Deputy Bruton seemed to have a problem this morning with definition.  He wondered what this meant and what other forest activities meant.  When we are talking about forest activities we are mainly talking about establishment and field work.  This is intended to separate that from the processing area.  It is not intended that the company should become immediately involved in this area, but the provision is there should suitable opportunities emerge in the future.  We are giving the company the widest possible charter and I have no desire to restrict them in any way.</P>
      <P>The new company will continue to work in a close and constructive way with the timber processing industry.  Deputies referred to the necessity for further provision of kiln drying facilities and the use of the best and the newest technology in the development of timber products.  The development of improved drying and treatment facilities for timber is high on the agenda of this Department and obviously will be high on the agenda of the new company.  The IDA have grantaided several kiln drying facilities at sawmills. Recently Eolas, following many years work on mechanical stress grading, proposed a new Irish standard for construction timber.  The success of these measures can be seen in the displacement of imported timber for use and construction by Irish timber which now supplies 50 per cent of that market.  Our aim is that we would in the next number of years see the percentage of construction timber used on the domestic market transferred to native timber on a growing basis, rising to 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by Deputies that in the past there has been poor marketing. In some cases the treatment of the wood has not been anything like it should have been, but we have got over <Col N="330" /> that problem now.  In recent months a number of Irish processors have been able to gain a foothold in the UK market. Because the UK imports 90 per cent of its timber requirements, the opportunities for exports to the UK are phenomenal.  We have to ensure that we get a particularly good product onto the market.  The traditional attitude to Irish timber here at home, not to mind what it was abroad, was disastrous.  Any failure on our part to take up the opportunities on the export front and to have the best available product would certainly jeopardise the potential development that is there for the future.  It behoves the researchers, the processors, the forest service and the new company to ensure that no mistakes are made in this area.</P>
    <P>The setting of annual planting targets was raised.  Since assuming office we have, as I said on Second Stage, significantly increased planting both at State and private levels.  I hope we have got to the stage where it will not be possible in the future ever to go back the road we travelled in the late seventies and the early eighties in terms of cutting back on national planting, both State and private. It is not, however, a matter to be laid down in legislation.  For instance, we have seen private planting grow from a couple of hundred hectares a few years ago to 4,000 hectares this year.  We need to continue to increase the opportunities that exist for private planting.  A stage will come when a balance will be reached between what is an annual optimum possibility for private planting and what would be an agreed target in the same area for planting by the new company.  It is not possible at this stage to specifically put into the Bill what the company should or should not plant, but it is clear from what we have been doing in the area of State planting that that is the road we want to travel.</P>
    <P>In order to allay Deputies' fears so far as the capital being provided for the company is concerned, there would be no reason to make capital provision for the new company if they were not going to plant because it would be very easy for the new company to go on harvesting. <Col N="331" /> Even before we increase the amount of timber &mdash; at present just under 1.5 million cubic metres to 2 million cubic metres in 1992 and to 3 million cubic metres by the end of the next decade &mdash; they would probably break even.  The reason for making the financial provision is to have an even aged plantation.  To be able to secure contracts and supply wood, sawlog and pulpwood to industry and to attract new investment and new industry, we have to have an even aged plantation, and that requires consistent annual planting over a prolonged period.  About half our forests are still under 20 years old.  To put that into perspective, if we stopped planting, in ten, 12 or 15 years' time, the pulp that would be required for Medite or any other new industry we would attract would not be available from our own resources.</P>
    <P>No matter from what angle we look at this &mdash; the need for providing capital, which we are doing in this Bill, the fact that the company would be self-sufficient immediately if they did not have to plant, and the overriding requirement to get the balance between acceleration on the private planting side and having the proper mix with State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for his understanding, but I thought I had longer and wanted to deal with all the points raised.</P>
      <P>This morning Deputy Lowry raised the question of the black economy.  My Department have long worked with the Department of Social Welfare in giving information or facilities required to combat any black economy dealings in the forests.  I can assure Deputy Lowry that all contractors engaged by my Department are contracted to employ legitimate workers who pay tax and PRSI and who do not collect dole.  I cannot, however, vouch for the vast majority of contractors in forests who are not employed by my Department.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has initiated a campaign to track down these workers and great success is being achieved.  My Department and Coillte Teoranta will continue to co-operate with all regulatory bodies and I am confident we can provide a healthy competitive environment for all legitimate contractors and eliminate the black economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned the conflict of interests in relation to private planting. Private planting management is retained by the Minister for Forestry and not in the new company to avoid this conflict, although he may require the company to provide services in this connection on an <Col N="333" /> agency basis.  Deputy Carey also mentioned the funding arrangements and the Bill suggested a break even position by 1992.  The funds provided from the Bill essentially cover the next four or five years and, as is common practice in such matters, will enable the Dáil to assess the performance of the company over those years should it be necessary to amend those sections in due course.  I am, of course, concerned to ensure that break even occurs at the earliest possible date and the company will have much to do to live up to the targets I will be setting for them in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the agreement of annual programmes.  This section is not meant to constrain the company unduly but merely to protect the State's investment in their assets.  I want to ensure that the company's policies in regard to the disposal of assets is consistent with good commercial principles and that no short term gains are made at the expense of long term stability of supplies.  I can assure the House that I will not interfere with the normal commercial activities of the company but, on the contrary, will expect them to develop their own policies and manage their own affairs in accordance with the targets set.  Nonetheless, I regard basic control as essential.  We want the company to manage the farm, not sell off a field every year to cloak their inadequacies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with section 38, which deals with recoupment for non-commercial activities, in my reply to Deputy Doyle's question.  A number of questions were raised in the context of using ACOT and Eolas.  This Government have set their face against overlapping and we must avoid that at all costs in our planting scheme.  I do not envisage at this stage any need to involve any other body to carry out the administration or the inspections under the planting grant scheme.  I think it would be <Col N="334" /> preferable, however, that Eolas should continue as an independent institute giving advice to and carrying out research for a variety of interests in the private and public sectors.</P>
      <P>It will be for the new forestry company to decide what arrangements will exist between the company and Eolas, in the same way that private sector companies are free to take such decisions.  Obviously, the new company will have to do research but it will be open to them to avail of the services of Eolas, which I expect they will.  It will be going in the face of what have been new practices in relation to these matters when we avail of contracts.  That, traditionally, has been the relationship between the forest service and Eolas.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies misunderstood section 45 in regard to the use of the Office of Public Works.  There is no obligation on the company to use the Office of Public Works.  It is merely a facility which is available should they so desire.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I thank the Chair for his forebearance and the Deputies on all sides who supported this measure.  I want to say that we have a unique opportunity to put in place legislation which will give a commercial mandate to forestry and achieve the growth and benefits we want for the country as a whole.  I am still open to suggestion and I assure Deputies that we want to produce the best possible legislation.  I will be glad to hear Deputies' contributions on Committee Stage.  I am only sorry contributions were restricted today and that many Deputies who wanted to contribute, particularly on the Government side, did not have an opportunity to do so.</P>

      <P>Secondly, I found myself much in agreement with section 40 (3) which dealt with the vesting day and the taking over of the workers and employees of the present Department. There is a small phrase, &ldquo;with effect from vesting day&rdquo;; but, if this operation was not carried out on vesting day and all the people were not transferred, a number could lose out.  The formula is not the same as in the Telecom or An Post Bills. There is a slight variation.  Could the Minister look into that between now and Committee Stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>Or after.  Obviously, I shall be intent on ensuring that.  We will have continued negotiations with the trade unions in that regard.  On the question of worker directors, the position is that the decision has already been taken on the numbers that will be appointed to the board and each member of that board will be appointed in his or her capacity to carry out the mandate of running the forest service on a commercial basis.  It is therefore not intended to have worker directors as such, although provision is in existing labour legislation at sub-board level.  It will be open to any member at any level in the country, in the forest or otherwise, who has a capacity; and all we will be seeking is the capacity of the individual to carry out the mandate which we are laying down for the new forest service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to permit the adoption of children whose parents have failed in their constitutional duty to care for them.  In particular, it will permit the adoption of children of married parents in certain restricted and exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>This is, in fact, the third Bill of its kind.  The House will recall that Deputy Desmond, when he was Minister for Health, circulated a Bill along these lines late in 1986.  That Bill had not reached the stage of discussion when the last Dáil was dissolved.  Deputy Shatter subsequently introduced a Private Members' Bill, the Adoption Bill, 1987, which had the same general objective.  It was defeated at the end of its Second Stage debate here in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>While the overall aim of this Bill is similar to that of previous Bills, there are some important differences, particularly with regard to the procedures for applying for an adoption order and the arrangements for recouping court costs. This Bill comes to the Dáil after a very full and constructive debate in the Seanad.  A number of important changes were made during the Seanad consideration of the Bill which I will refer to when I outline the detailed provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be helpful at this stage <Col N="337" /> if I were to provide a brief outline of our present adoption legislation and to explain why this Bill is necessary.  The adoption of children is governed by the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976.  The essential concept of legal adoption is the permanent transfer of parental rights and duties from the natural parents to the adoptive parents.  The child's legal relationship with his natural parents is terminated and a new parent/child relationship is established with his adoptive parents.  Under the present legislation an adoption order can be made only in respect of a child who is an orphan; or whose parents are not married; or whose parents married after his birth but whose birth has not been reregistered. In general, the consent of the child's mother or guardian to his adoption is required, unless that consent is dispensed with on certain specified grounds.</P>
    <P>There have been various calls over the years for changes in the law so as to permit the adoption of children in a wider range of circumstances.  The Review Committee on Adoption Services, which reported in May 1984, found that a major defect in the present law is that it excludes from adoption many children who may be in need of the benefits which it can offer.  The committee were particularly concerned about children in the care of health boards whose parents are unable or unwilling to care for them and who under our present legislation cannot be adopted.  The children involved would include children of unmarried mothers and children of married parents.  The committee recommended that all these children should be eligible for adoption and this recommendation has received widespread support from the various bodies and individuals concerned with adoption and child care.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to deal with this situation in so far as can be done within the constraints of our Constitution.  Deputies will be aware that it has long been believed that it would not be constitutionally possible to provide for the adoption of children of married parents. This belief stems from the constitutional guarantees to protect the family and to <Col N="338" /> respect the rights of parents.  I have consulted the Attorney General about this and the advice I have received is that, notwithstanding the guarantees afforded to the family by the Constitution, it would be permissible to provide for the adoption of children of married parents, but only in very exceptional cases.  The basis for this view is to be found in Article 42.5 of the Constitution which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duties towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptable rights of the child.</P>
    <P>I am confident that should this Bill, when passed by the Oireachtas, be referred to the Supreme Court to be tested, there are cogent and substantial grounds for arguing successfully in favour of its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines various terms used in the Bill and explains how certain references are to be interpreted. Section 2 specifies how the Adoption Board are to deal with applications for adoption orders under the Bill and modifies certain provisions of the Adoption Acts for that purpose.  Section 2 (1) requires the applicants to make an initial application to the Adoption Board.  The board will examine the application using the same criteria as they apply to &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; applications for adoption under the existing Adoption Acts.  At this stage the board will assess the eligibility of the proposed adoptors and their suitability to have parental rights in respect of the child.  The board will also be obliged to hear the views of the health board for the area in which the applicants reside.  This is because in the majority of cases the child will have been placed with the applicants by the health board.  The health board will be able to supply the Adoption Board with background information on the applicants.  The health board may also be familar with the natural parents and <Col N="339" /> be able to advise the Adoption Board as to whether it is desirable in the child's interests that he be adopted.</P>
    <P>If, following their inquiries, the Adoption Board are satisfied that an adoption would be appropriate, they will make a declaration stating that they would be prepared to make an adoption order if the High Court were to authorise them to do so.  If, on the other hand, the Adoption Board are not satisfied that the child should be adopted, there the matter ends.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the circumstances in which the High Court may make an order authorising the Adoption Board to make an adoption order.  It is the most important section of the Bill and has been very carefully drafted in close accord with Article 42.5 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Where the Adoption Board have made a declaration under section 2 (1) that they would be prepared to make an adoption order, an application must then be made to the High Court for an order authorising the Adoption Board to do so.  The persons seeking to adopt the child must, first of all, request the health board in whose area they live to apply to the High Court on their behalf.  I would expect that in the vast majority of cases such a request would be acted upon immediately and that the health board involved would take over the handling of the application. However, the health board will have the option not to proceed with an application if it considers that it would not be proper to do so.  This might arise where the health board considered that there was a reasonable prospect of the child being reunited with his parents.  As I have already indicated, I do not expect that this would happen very often in practice but I think it is important that the health board should have this flexibility. However, in order to ensure that the prospective adoptive parents are given every possible chance, section 3 (1) (b) will enable them to make an application to the High Court in their own right even if the health board declines to do so.</P>
    <P>When the High Court receives an application, whether from the health board or the applicants themselves, it <Col N="340" /> must examine the case in accordance with paragraphs (I), (II) and (III).  The High Court must be satisfied that all of the conditions set out in these paragraphs exist with respect to the child before it can authorise his adoption.</P>
    <P>First, the court must be satisfied that the natural parents have failed, for physical or moral reasons, to care for the child for at least one year immediately before the adoption application is made.  No attempt has been made here to define what is meant by failure.  This will be a matter for the High Court to decide in each individual case.  However, I think it can be taken that the court would require evidence of serious shortcomings by the parents in looking after their children before it would be prepared to declare that they had failed in their constitutional duty.</P>
    <P>Second, the court must be satisfied that it is likely that the natural parents will continue to fail in their duty towards their child without interruption until he is 18 years of age.  This is an important safeguard for natural parents.  It ensures that before a child can be adopted the court must be satisfied not alone that the parents have failed to care for the child but also that the failure is likely to continue for the duration of his childhood. If, on the other hand, the court believes there is a likelihood that the failure of the parents will cease and that they will be able to resume their parental duties, the adoption cannot proceed.  While at first sight this may appear unfair to persons who wish to adopt a child, it would be absolute tragedy if each and every parent who fell down in their duty towards their children were to run the risk of having their children taken away from them and adopted.  That is not what is intended.  The question of adopting children whose parents have failed can only arise when there is no reasonable prospect of the parents resuming their parental duties.</P>
    <P>Third, the High Court must be satisfied that the failure of the parents is so great that they can be held to have abandoned all their rights with respect to the child. The rights of parents in this context <Col N="341" /> includes their rights under the Constitution, in the natural law, at common law and in statute law.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the court must be satisfied that, because of the failure of the parents, the State should intervene and supply the place of the parents.  Article 42.5 of the Constitution requires the State to supply the place of parents who have failed in their duty.  The Constitution does not specify how this is to be done; here it is proposed that it should be achieved by arranging to have the child adopted.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the court must be satisfied that the child involved is living with the applicants and has been living with them for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  The purpose of this is to avoid frivolous or vexatious applications by persons not having care of the child and to ensure that the child and the applicants have &ldquo;bonded&rdquo; with each other.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the court must be satisfied that the adoption of the child by the particular applicants would be an appropriate means by which to supply the place of the parents.</P>
    <P>If the High Court is satisfied that all of the above conditions have been fulfilled and that it would be in the best interests of the child that he be adopted, it will authorise the Adoption Board to make an adoption order in favour of the applicants.</P>
    <P>In reaching its decision the court must have regard to the constitutional and other rights of all the parties concerned. This is to ensure that the constitutional and other rights of the natural parents, the child and the applicants are all taken into account by the court in reaching its decision.</P>
    <P>If and when the High Court makes and order authorising the adoption of the child, the Adoption Board may then go ahead and made an adoption order in respect of him unless the circumstances of the prospective adopters have changed to such an extent that the board considers that it would no longer be proper to make an adoption order.</P>
    <P>Section 4 requires the High Court to hear the natural parents and any other persons whom it feels ought to be heard <Col N="342" /> before making an order authorising the adoption of a child.  If one or both parents fail or refuse to appear and give evidence or do not respond to a request to give evidence, the court may make an order authorising the adoption of the child in the absence of their evidence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the manner in which court costs incurred by natural parents and persons wishing to adopt under this Bill are to be met.  This is an entirely new section which was inserted on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The need for it stems from a recent development in relation to the provision of legal services in adoption cases.  Until now, the State has contributed towards the cost of legal representation in adoption cases in limited circumstances under what is known as the Attorney General's scheme.  In the Bill as introduced in the Seanad, it was envisaged that persons wishing to adopt, as well as natural parents, would avail of this scheme, as appropriate.  Following consultations between the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, it has now been decided that in future persons involved in legal proceedings in relation to adoption applications, including proceedings in the High Court under this Bill, will be able to apply for assistance under the civil legal aid scheme.  In the context of this Bill, this means that both the natural parents and the prospective adoptive parents will be in a very satisfactory position because, once their case is accepted by the Legal Aid Board, their costs will be minimum, regardless of whether they win or lose their case.  It also means that they will be entitled to some services which the Attorney General's scheme does not embrace.  For example, they can obtain the advice of a solicitor in connection with the initial application to the Adoption Board or the application to the High Court.</P>
    <P>In the event of the natural parents being refused legal aid, section 5 (1) (a) provides that the health board involved must pay any court costs that are incurred by the natural parents in contesting an application for the adoption of their child in the High Court or in the Supreme Court on appeal.  The amount to be paid <Col N="343" /> will be determined by the Taxing Master of the High Court or by agreement between the health board and the natural parents at a level equal to taxed costs. Furthermore, if the costs of any other party, for example, the applicants, are awarded against the natural parents, the court will be able to order that these costs too should be paid for them by the health board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the persons wishing to adopt a child, I would expect that in the majority of cases no costs would be incurred by them at all.  This is because in most cases the application to the High Court will be made by the health board on their behalf.  In such cases any costs arising would be met by the health board and the person wishing to adopt would not have to make any financial contribution. It is only where the health board, for some reason, has decided not to make an application and the persons involved go ahead and apply themselves without the backing of the board, that the question of court costs will arise. However, section 5 (2) provides that where the applicants are ultimately successful in obtaining an order from the High Court authorising the adoption of the child the health board involved must meet any costs incurred by them that are not met by any other party.</P>
    <P>Section 6 reduces from 21 to 18 years the maximum age at which a person may be adopted.  This will bring the upper age limit for adoption into line with the age of majority.  The section also contains a transitional provision so that any application which was made to the Adoption Board before the commencement of the Bill in relation to a person up to 21 years of age may continue to be processed and an adoption order may be made.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a technical provision.  It provides that references in certain sections of the Adoption Act, 1952, to the mother of a child shall, for the purposes of adoption under this Bill, include the father of a child of married parents or an adoptive parent or parents.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is an important new provision which was inserted in the Bill during its <Col N="344" /> passage through the Seanad.  The effect of this section is to relieve the Adoption Board of the statutory obligation which it now has to publish in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>, the names and addresses of persons who have had adoption offers made in their favour. While this is not directly relevant to the primary objective of extending the circumstances in which children may be adopted, it is a very desirable provision and one that has been sought by adopters and others for many years.  It has been argued that the publication of the names and addresses of adopters breaches the confidential nature of the adoption process and sets adopters and adoptees apart from all other parents and children whose names do not have to be made publicly available.  The Review Committee on Adoption Services recommended that this requirement be removed and I am pleased to be able to give effect to that recommendation in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains the usual provisions in relation to short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, this Bill is intended to deal with very exceptional situations.  It poses no threat to the generality of families and does not represent any rethinking or departure from the generally accepted principle that the best place for a child to grow up is in his own family.  While the majority of our children enjoy the love and affection of their parents and all the advantages of family life, there is a small but significant number who are not so fortunate.  It is these children, among them the most deprived and disadvantaged in our community, that this Bill seeks to help by offering them the chance of a fresh start with another family who are better able to look after and care for them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House today. However, it is only correct that I say that the lethargy displayed by the Government in bringing this Bill before the House is little short of scandalous.  It is over a year ago when a Private Members' <Col N="345" /> Bill to provide for the adoption of abandoned legitimate children was introduced in this House by me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  It is over a year ago since Government Deputies unitedly voted down that Bill, some of them doing so expressing doubts as to whether this reform was necessary.  In fairness to the Minister, I should say he acknowledged that the reform was necessary and simply said he was going to introduce his own Bill.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 children in long-term residential or foster care who could benefit from the possibility of adoption being extended to them.  Those 1,000 to 1,500 children have had to wait a further year before that benefit could be extended to them because the Government saw fit to vote down a Private Members' Bill, many of the provisions of which largely correspond to those contained in this Bill. Any of the amendments that the Minister has made to the Private Members' Bill which we brought before this House and which are contained in this Bill, in so far as they will assist the position, could quite easily have been made during a Committee Stage debate on the Private Members' Bill in June of last year and the Bill could have become law over a year ago.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill it must be remarked that it is little short of scandalous that it has taken the Minister over a year to bring it into this House.  The Bill was published in July 1987 and there was a Second Stage debate in the Seanad in July, 1987.  Then virtually nothing happened with that Bill until end April/beginning of May this year when Committee Stage and then Report Stage were taken in the Seanad.  That is most regrettable.  I also think it regrettable that some of the protections that were provided for prospective adopters, contained in the Private Members' Bill that Fine Gael published, are not contained in this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage I intend to deal in detail with some of the problems inherent in the provisions the Minister has inserted in this Bill with regard to the costs that <Col N="346" /> will be involved in the bringing of legal proceedings to effect the adoption of an abandoned illegitimate or legitimate child in the circumstances in which the Bill envisages that adoption orders can be made.  Indeed, there is a great deal of confusion in what the Minister has said about that issue in this House today which shows a complete lack of understanding on his part of the reality of what happens currently when adopters find themselves thrown into the stress and upset of court proceedings, or when a natural mother finds herself thrown into the distress and upset of court proceedings when difficulties arise currently in processing an adoption application under the law as it stands, even without the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In so far as the provisions of the Bill will extend the possibility of adoption to children currently deprived of that possibility, who have had, throughout their childhood no possibility of resuming a normal family life with their parents, the Bill is welcome.  Indeed, it is noteworthy that, whereas in this jurisdiction we are only now getting around to allowing the adoption of abandoned legitimate children, since 1929 in Northern Ireland the laws there have allowed the adoption of such children.  We are the last country in Europe to deal with this issue.  It is an indictment of the ways in which this House deals with child care issues.  We are great verbalisers in expressing public concern about the welfare of children. but we are extraordinarily lethargic, in the legislative sense, in translating our verbal concerns into legislative action that generally improves the position of children within this State.  One wonders how many thousands of children since the foundation of this State have found themselves living throughout their childhood in residential care who, if our legislators had years ago, or even in recent decades, the insight into dealing with this area, could have benefited from having extended to them the possibility of living within a family, with the security of adoption extended to their relationship within that family.  Indeed, as a result of the provisions of this Bill there are many <Col N="347" /> children currently in foster care who will be provided with the possibility of a greater degree of legal security within a long-term fosterage relationship in circumstances in which relationships with their natural parents have long since ceased and where there is no possibility of that relationship being resumed.</P>
    <P>One might well pose the question: how many thousands of children in years gone by could have benefited similarly?  I am absolutely of the belief that, had not the Government publicly embarrassed themselves this time last year by voting down the Private Members' Bill introduced in this House by the Fine Gael Party, had they not experienced the backlash of adverse public reaction to their actions within this House in voting down our Bill, we would not have this Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>The Bill is here and I hope we can give it a relatively swift legislative passage.  In saying that I hope also that on Committee Stage we can introduce a variety of amendments which I believe will be necessary to ensure that the Bill truly works in extending the possibility of adoption to the children it is designed to assist.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying he has introduced a somewhat different measure to the measure introduced as a Private Members' Bill by Fine Gael or to the measure introduced by Deputy Desmond as Minister for Health during the course of the previous Administration.  The Minister has given health boards a far more extended role under the provisions of his Bill than they were given under the previous Bills.</P>
    <P>The procedure that is envisaged is that a child that has lived for approximately 12 months or longer in a fosterage arrangement can be adopted.  In order for the child to be adopted first application will have to be made to the Adoption Board for the board to determine whether it would be appropriate for it to make an adoption order with regard to the particular child the foster parents seek to adopt.  That is a procedure that is <Col N="348" /> similar to the procedure in the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Adoption Board is satisfied it would be in the interests of a child that such an adoption order be made, having heard any submissions or held any oral hearings it feels are necessary which would involve the foster parents, the local health board, the Adoption Board's social workers and possibly also the naturral parents, the Adoption Board can give a preliminary adjudication that in its view it would be appropriate that a particular child be adopted.  In order for the child to be released for adoption a High Court order will then be required and two different groups can apply for such order.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he primarily expects that under the provisions laid down in this Bill it would be the health board that makes the application.  First the foster parents who want to apply to adopt the child will have to apply to the health board and ask the board to make the appropriate application to the High Court.  The Bill says that if the health board considers it proper to do so an application may be made by it for an order.</P>
    <P>We have eight different health boards in this country and each board applies different procedures in dealing with a variety of different matters that come under its jurisdiction.  Each health board has social workers who work in the child care area.  In my experience, despite the existence of departmental guidelines of a non-statutory nature which apply to the general area of child neglect, certainly in other areas beyond the areas in which the departmental guidelines apply, each health board employs a variety of different approaches and procedures in dealing with issues relating to children.  Because the departmental guidelines are grossly deficient and do not cover a variety of areas in which there is a need to give guidance to health boards to ensure uniformity of approach, even in dealing with children at risk, different health boards operate different practices and procedures, and individual community care areas in individual health boards often <Col N="349" /> simply because of the different personalities of the people involved in the individual community care areas operate and apply different procedures.</P>
    <P>If a primary role is to be given to health boards in determining whether it is proper to make application to the High Court to have a child released for the purpose of adoption, there should be a provision in this legislation to require the Minister to provide, by way of statutory regulation, a minimum code of practice to be applied by health boards in the operation of the powers conferred upon them by this Bill.  There should be some guidance to health boards as to what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;if the health board considers it proper to do so&rdquo;.  In what circumstances will the health board consider it improper to do so?</P>
    <P>There are the obvious ones where clearly if a child is only in temporary care it would not be proper that it be adopted but presumably if that were the case the Adoption Board would not have autorised the completion of the first stage of the process, that is, a determination that it would be appropriate to make an adoption order.  If there is a possibility of parents who have suffered temporary ill health regaining their health and properly and fully caring for their child, clearly in those circumstances, it would not be proper for an adoption order to be made.</P>
    <P>Is it to be left to individual directors of community care who may simply have medical experience and medical expertise to determine in a particular health board area whether it is proper for a health board to go ahead and make such application?  Will the decision be left to the senior social worker in the health board overall or in the community care area in which the child resides, or will it be left to the individual social worker who has been involved with a particular family to make these decisions?</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a social worker who is dealing with a family who have a number of inadequacies at a social work level, who is providing them with social supports and where that family is dependent on that social worker.  If they have a child or children in long term foster care <Col N="350" /> and have lost contact with the children or children, the social worker may realise the family is really not adequate to care for those children but nevertheless the social worker needs to maintain a good relationship with that family.  Is the social worker going to have to stand in judgment and determine in those circumstances whether it is appropriate that the adoption order be made when he or she believes it is in the interests of the child that an adoption order be made, but that for her or for him to so inform a director of community care for the purpose of the health board making a decision could either end or jeopardise the relationship built up with the inadequate parents for whom the social worker is providing social support?  Will that social worker deem it not proper to authorise the adoption of a child in the interests of maintaining a relationship with inadequate parents and of ensuring that the parents accept the social worker as an appropriate person to provide them with help with the various problems they have in the family?</P>
    <P>What happens if there are some social workers or directors of community care or health boards, some of them doctors, some of their politicians, possibly none of them with any expertise in this area at all, who decide as a matter of health board policy that in no circumstances will this health board authorise an application to the High Court to provide for the adoption of a legitimate child?  What happens then to all of the children in that health board area who are in long term foster care with no prospect of being returned to live with their own families where the health board itself decides that as a matter of policy they will never involve themselves in making such applications because the health board believes that no legitimate child should ever be adopted?</P>
    <P>There is a great difficulty in determining what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;if the health board considers it proper to do so&rdquo;.  It is my belief that if the Minister wishes to give the health boards this central role this House should, in the context of this legislation, spell out some basic <Col N="351" /> criteria the health boards should have regard to in determining whether it is proper to bring such applications.</P>
    <P>This House should spell out that it would be improper under the terms of this legislation for a health board, as a matter of overall policy, to make a decision that it will never involve itself in making such applications either because, ideologically, that health board believes that no legitimate child should ever be adopted regardless of whether there is a possibility of it being returned to its parents or if the health board makes that decision for other reasons.  What other reasons could the health board introduce as a matter of policy to ensure that no such applications were made by it with regard to children living within the health board area?  We all know that the health boards at present are hard up for cash. We all know there have been massive cutbacks in the health area.  We all know that the health boards have been looking at various ways in which to save money. I am not opposed to health boards providing efficient services at an economical level that does not result in excessive State expenditure &mdash; though I would argue with the Minister about his approach in that area.  It is not a matter to be dealt with under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Bill, let us assume that a health board has 100 children in long term foster care in its area whose social workers are advising it that there is no possibility of their ever again living with their parents and that they have had virtually no contact with their parents for many years.  They are children between the ages of, say, five and 12 who have not seen their parents since they were six or ten months old and whose parents have shown no interest in them.  We have a health board &mdash; let us assume it is the Midland Health Board or the Western Health Board &mdash; who have been advised by their social workers that they have over 100 children on whose behalf such an application could be made.  The health board decide, because this Bill provides no funding to enable them to fulfil their functions, that financially it is not on for <Col N="352" /> them to process High Court applications to have children within their area adopted who should be adopted under the provisions of this Bill.  If health boards are to play the role which the Minister envisages for them there is an absolute necessity for a uniform set of standards to be applied by all health boards which have statutory force.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters that need to be dealt with should be incorporated in this Bill, others can be dealt with by way of a statutory instrument or statutory regulation. The scenario I am painting in the context of health boards opting out of fulfilling their statutory functions is not all that far fetched because we still have a number of health boards who are refusing to operate all the functions which they can operate under the family planning legislation because a majority of the members on the board object to so-called non-natural methods of family planning. As a matter of policy the health board do not provide any family planning services or provide the financial backup to provide such advice regarding artificial methods of contraception.</P>
    <P>If a health board can rule as a matter of policy that it will not exercise statutory functions in the family planning area, it can equally as a matter of policy under this Bill determine it will not exercise the statutory functions assigned to it to enable the adoption of abandoned legitimate children.  I have given the Minister some of the reasons that could arise.  If he believes the health boards should primarily initiate these court proceedings and if he believes that in the vast majority of cases the health boards will do so and it will not be left to the applicants to adopt, he would need, if he is serious, to ensure minimum standards and set down criteria on the basis of which a health board would determine that it was proper that they involve themselves in the making of such an application.  Otherwise, I believe there will be a number of health boards who will not exercise their powers.  The central role which the Minister envisages for health boards under this Bill will not become a reality in parts of the country.  Instead of having an <Col N="353" /> Adoption Act setting a uniform law applicable throughout the country, it will be applied in differing and varied ways in different health board areas.</P>
    <P>Another defect in the Bill, as drafted, is that there will be no way of knowing whether health boards are properly carrying out their statutory functions as envisaged in the Bill.  There is no provision in the Bill which requires health boards, for example, to report annually on the number of applications made by a health board to seek to have a child released for adoption under the provisions of the Bill. If we are serious not only in seeking to ensure that we have on the Statute Book a measure that, in legal theory, extends the possibility of adoption to such children, there is a need not merely to ensure uniformity of approach on behalf of health boards but there is a need to monitor the performance of health boards and to ascertain within each area on an annual basis how many such applications are being brought by health boards.</P>
    <P>Health boards should be required to provide annual statistics and information to the Department of Health as to the number of children it has in long term residential care and long term foster care. There should be a monitoring process so that, if it appears there are a large number of children in long term foster care and in long term residential care within a particular health board area and that that health board are not seeking to have any of these children released for adoption, a statutory power should be given to the Minister to require the health board to give an explanation as to why they are not seeking to have some of these children freed for adoption.  There is a complete lack of monitoring provisions to ensure that health boards are operating correctly.  The need for such monitoring provisions is emphasised by the lack of adequate current statistics as to what the position is in reality in this area.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I have had to say that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 children in long term residential and long term foster care.  I am not saying all of these children either will be or <Col N="354" /> should be adopted under this Bill.  Some of those in long term care may be there in circumstances where they are still having regular contacts with their natural parents and it would neither be in the children's interests nor the parent's interests, nor envisaged, that they would be adopted.  The problem is we do not have up to date statistics.  During a debate in the Seanad in July 1987 the Minister had to resort to quoting 1983 statistics regarding children in long term residential and foster care.  When I tabled questions in this House to the Minister with regard to up to date statistics concerning the position of children in long term residential or foster care within each health board area I have, on a number of occasions, got the 1983 statistics &mdash; I got them in 1985, 1986 and 1987.  The Department should ensure that health boards supply them annually with the necessary information.  It will be even more important that that information is provided so that the Department and the House can monitor the manner in which the health boards are operating this legislation following its enactment.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board have a statutory requirement to make an annual report to this House of the number of adoption orders they make each year and must give certain other information with regard to adoption.  That is to ensure there is a degree of accountability on the part of the Adoption Board for the statutory functions they have to fulfil.  If we are now giving these statutory functions to health boards they should be similarly accountable.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Child Care Bill is setting up local child care advisory committees who will operate within each health board area.  Perhaps it is possible for us to ensure that the necessary health board information as to how this Bill is being operated is supplied initially by the relevant health board personnel to the child care committees.  It should not be kept spread between the different health boards with no central control, and the Department of Health and Members of this House, unless they happen to be members of local health boards, unaware <Col N="355" /> of what is happening overall throughout the country.  Therefore, I suggest seriously to the Minister that this obligation be imposed on health boards to provide information directly to the Department of Health and that an annual report be produced, possibly by the Minister's Department, on the basis of information being furnished directly to them by health boards, setting out the position with regard to the operation by each health board of the powers conferred on the health board by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to explain in his reply what additional funding he is making available to health boards to enable them to fulfil their functions under this Bill in making application to the High Court.  Also I want him to explain what additional funding he is going to provide to health boards to enable them to meet the legal costs incurred by natural parents and prospective adopters under the provisions of this Bill.  The reluctance of health boards to involve themselves in any sort of High Court proceedings is evident in one area.  Everyone in this House acknowledges the inadequacies of our child care laws.  They have been documented and talked about for 25 years, and shortly we will be dealing with a new Child Care Bill which the Minister has brought before the House.  In similar jurisdictions in other countries, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and other common law countries which have a legal system similar to ours, where their legislation has on occasion proved inadequate to protect children at risk either local authorities or health boards or their equivalents in all those countries have resorted to using wards of court procedure to have children made wards of court and to get protection orders with regard to children where the ordinary care legislation cannot be used. It is noteworthy that that procedure is very rarely used in this country by health boards despite the inadequacies of our children laws.  It has been used during the past 20 years on half a dozen occasions at most.  That is because the health boards, despite the fact that the children have <Col N="356" /> been at risk, have not wished to involve themselves in the expense of High Court proceedings.  The Minister is imposing an obligation on them to so involve themselves under this Bill and there is a need to ensure that they exercise those powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in some detail to the provisions in the Bill with regard to the issue of costs.  I want to deal with those in the context of the other option as opposed to the health board bringing an application.  Health boards must consider whether it is proper to make an application to have a child freed for adoption, and this Bill now provides for a time limit in doing that.  I think that was an amendment introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  If within a period of three months from the date upon which a request is made to a health board to make an application to the High Court the health board does not so do, the applicants to adopt can themselves apply to the High Court for such an order.  The Minister, of course will tell me that if a health board as a matter of policy decide never to make such applications the prospective adopters as foster parents themselves can go ahead and do so; but of course, if as a matter of policy health boards can make such decisions they will not be playing the central role the Minister referred to.  If under this Bill a health board take no action &mdash; and they may take no action, not because they think a child should not be adopted but because they do not want to incur the expense or the board themselves have made some sort of policy decision based on outdated and anachronistic views of social policy &mdash;the adopters can then bring their application to the High Court.  My belief is that, if a child is in long term foster care and if as far as the foster parents know the child has lost all real contact with its natural parents and if the Adoption Board have already adjudicated, which they must under this Bill, that it is appropriate that the child be adopted provided the High Court will release it for adoption, a couple who have in good faith cared for that child and who in good faith want to adopt it and who because of our legal and constitutional system are forced <Col N="357" /> to apply to the High Court to be allowed to adopt even after the Adoption Board have deemed it appropriate for the child to be adopted, that couple should not be placed at financial risk of incurring High Court legal costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that the provision he has now made in this Bill will protect the couple from incurring such costs.  I say to the Minister it will not adequately do so and that there are a number of peculiarities about this provision which will require remedy.  Unfortunately, much of what the Minister said today about legal aid and the new revolutionary changes being introduced is misleading.  I do not believe the Minister is intentionally misleading the House.  He may not understand in practice what happens in reality in this area.  Maybe there is some breakdown in communication between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice or between their officials, but it is essential that this is teased out.  This Bill will not work to allow legitimate children to be adopted if a couple fear they are putting themselves at risk of major financial outlay by seeking to adopt a child; and, as the Bill is presented at present by the Government, each couple who seek to adopt under its provisions will find themselves in that position if a health board refuse to co-operate with them, and there is no guarantee the health board will co-operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred firstly to something called the Attorney General's scheme.  That scheme has no relevance at present to this Bill.  It applies in a completely different area.  The Minister said that where disputes currently arise with regard to adoption adopters can get some assistance with their legal costs under the Attorney General's scheme.  That is correct, and the Minister said correctly that the Attorney General's scheme has been criticised for being inadequate.  He goes on to say that the new procedure he is now adopting will solve all these problems, so that this wonderful change has taken place, that now natural parents and adopters will be able <Col N="358" /> to apply for legal aid under, I assume, the civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to tease this out carefully.  I dealt with this issue in this House at some length when I introduced the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  I was accused by some members of the Minister's party of seeking to provide easy money for lawyers, something they like to try to use in this House whenever I introduce any law reforming legislation.  I am interested in ensuring that all those who, bone fide, involve themselves in an adoption process as a result of this Bill or under existing legislation do not find themselves, through no fault of their own, involved in High Court and Supreme Court cases which could result in their incurring considerable outlay by way of legal costs.  My only interest is to protect the adopters in those circumstances and to protect the natural parents who also, through no fault of their own, get involved in court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Under the Adoption Act, 1974, a child may be placed for adoption by a natural mother.  We will assume the child has been born outside marriage and that the mother is not married.  She places her child for adoption with a married couple and she signs an agreement to do so.  Six months after the child has been placed for adoption, the Adoption Board make contact with the mother and ask her to give what is known as the final consent. The mother is invited to consent to the adoption order being made, having previously agreed to the child being placed for adoption.  The mother is uncertain, she has been thinking about the situation for six months and she is not quite sure if she wants her child adopted.  She asks for a bit more time and, three months later, she is asked if she will consent.  She still wants more, time, and five months later, she is again asked if she will give her consent.  This time she also refuses and says that she wants her child back. The child has been with the adopters for well over a year, they do not know the mother and she does not know them.  The child is bonded with them.  The adoption society tell them that although the child <Col N="359" /> has been in their care since it was one week old &mdash; the child is now 16 months &mdash; they regret to have to tell them that the mother wants her baby back and they ask them to return the baby.  They refuse, they say the child has been with them since he was one week old and knows no other parents.  They say he is part of their family and that he does not know his mother.</P>
    <P>The adoption society tell the mother the adoptive parents have refused to give up the child.  The mother says it is her child, she carried it for nine months and gave birth to it.  She says she has made a terrible mistake and wants her child back. They end up going to lawyers.  The mother brings High Court proceedings seeking to have her child returned to her. The adopters bring proceedings under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, asking that they be allowed to retain the child in their custody and that the mother's consent be dispensed with so that the Adoption Board can make an adoption order.  The adopters know nothing about the mother, apart from the fact that she has changed her mind; the mother knows nothing about them except that her child is with a married couple who, she has been told by the Adoption Society, are caring properly for her child.</P>
    <P>Let us stop there for a moment.  At present, what lawyers would they consult? Since the civil legal aid scheme was established in 1980, a non-statutory scheme, the mother has always been able to go into one of the Government law centres.  There is nothing revolutionary in the Minister now telling us that the mother can go into such a centre.  She has been always able to get legal assistance from one of the solicitors there, provided her means are such as to qualify her for civil legal aid.  If she needed to bring court proceedings, she would be represented by counsel paid for through one of the Government law centres.</P>
    <P>A whole series of cases have been brought under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, in which mothers have been represented by one of the Government law centres.  What the Minister has told <Col N="360" /> us in regard to his arrangements with the Department of Justice is nothing new. Some mothers in these circumstances may not qualify for assistance in one of the Government law centres because they may be in full-time employment and their financial means may be such as not to satisfy the means test.  If they bring court proceedings under the Attorney General's scheme, as it currently stands, they would employ a lawyer in private practice and, at the conclusion of the court case, a judge can make a recommendation that they get some help through the Attorney General's scheme in discharging their legal costs.  Under that scheme, a small contribution is made by the Attorney General's office, usually one or two years after the case has concluded, towards discharging some of the legal costs incurred by the mother.</P>
    <P>At present, the mother is not obliged to go into a law centre even if her means qualify her for legal aid.  She can still go to a solicitor in private practice and she can get some of the legal costs paid for her through the Attorney General's scheme. There is nothing revolutionary about a mother in those circumstances going into a law centre.  Equally, under this Bill if the Minister said nothing about legal costs, if the married parents under the Bill were in a position whereby they were seeking to prevent the High Court freeing their child for adoption and if their means and income were such that they qualified for legal aid in a law centre, under the current Departmental administrative rules which govern civil legal aid, they could go into a law centre and get legal representation.</P>
    <P>What about the adopters?  Currently, in regard to proceedings under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, in theory they can get assistance from a Government law centre.  In practice, most natural mothers qualify for it because their means tend to be low.  Virtually no adopters can ever get legal assistance from a law centre because one of the suitabilities looked at is their financial circumstances. If a couple's means are so low as to render them qualified for legal aid from a law centre, it is unlikely that they would have <Col N="361" /> been deemed suitable to adopt.  Under the current scheme, prospective adopters can apply for assistance through a Government law centre but, if they make that application, they will be denied legal aid because they will not be able to fulfil the provisions of a means test.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, adopters go to lawyers in private practice and they then issue proceedings or defend proceedings brought by the mother.  At the conclusion of the case, a recommendation could be made &mdash; until 1 April this year &mdash; that their fees should be assisted through the Attorney General's scheme.  The Attorney General's scheme has been criticised because it did not fully meet the real legal costs incurred by adoptive or natural mothers in proceedings brought under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974.  It was based on a scale of fees which bore no relation to the work involved or the nature of the court proceedings that take place in adoption cases.  It was rightly criticised.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to what the Minister has done.  I do not know whether this is being done simply out of a lack of understanding of the problem, whether this is being done under the camouflage of a lack of understanding of the problem or whether the Government simply want to leave people who want to adopt under our existing laws legally high and dry when they find themselves in the state I described.  The Government have surreptitiously and secretively removed even the small bit of assistance that the Attorney General's scheme currently extends to adopters caught in the type of problem I described.</P>
    <P>I will go back to the couple who have had a child with them for 16 months and who are forced to bring proceedings.  As they have had the child placed with them for adoption, presumably they would not qualify for legal aid through a law centre. The Minister has not said that the means test will no longer apply under the scheme in the context of adopters and natural parents.  One assumes that the current means test will continue to apply.  Let us say that the couple who have had the child with them for 16 months want to <Col N="362" /> adopt the child but the mother has brought proceedings and taken them to the High Court.  The couple bring proceedings asking the High Court to dispense with the mother's consent so that an adoption order can be made.  Ultimately, the High Court case takes place and it runs for six days.  High Court cases relating to adoption rarely run for less than three days when they are contested in the courts and often run to four, five or six days.  Let us say that at the end of the case the adopters win, the court dispenses with the mother's consent but does not make an order for costs against the mother because everybody feels sorry for her position.  Indeed, if such an order were made she would not have any money to meet it.</P>
    <P>In such a case the adopters who have had a child placed with them by an adoption society, who know nothing about the mother, who are relying on social workers in the society to ensure that everything runs smoothly, find themselves through no fault of their own 16 or 17 months later in the High Court.  In order to complete the adoption process the adopters have had to go through a six day High Court hearing in which they are represented by solicitors and counsel. The mother may have both senior and junior counsel whose fees are paid by a law centre.  The adopters at the end of the six day hearing may be told by the High Court that they can adopt their child but they have to foot the bill for that. The mother may appeal to the Supreme Court and six months later there may be a two or three day Supreme Court hearing with the Supreme Court confirming the High Court decision.  The adopters would finally be allowed to adopt.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's decision in terminating the application of the Attorney General's scheme the adopters will not get any assistance whatever from the State to meet the bill for the legal costs they have incurred.  At the end of a six day High Court hearing, and a two or three day hearing in the Supreme Court, the costs may run into thousands of pounds.  The adopters would have been forced to bring court proceedings through <Col N="363" /> no fault of theirs to protect the welfare of a child placed with them and would have been held by the courts to have acted properly.  In my view it is a scandal that the Government have abolished the scheme.  The only reason there is not a public outcry about that is because it is too complex to explain what it is all about.  It is not easy to translate it into a simple headline in a newspaper.  In recent years there have been upwards of 60 adopters who have had to involve themselves in proceedings under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be abolishing the Attorney General's scheme as it applies to adopters in these circumstances. He should be replacing it by a statutory measure which ensures that the full legal costs that the adopters incur in such court cases are met and discharged by the State.  Instead, he has abolished the scheme.  The Bill does not do anything for those adopters, but the Minister seems to be suggesting that abolishing the scheme is extending some great new benefit to the adopters.  The Minister is saying to every adopter that, if a child is placed with him or her for adoption and if ten, 12 or 18 months later the mother changes her mind before the adoption order is made and finalised, the State will not do anything to help that person ensure that the welfare of the child placed with the adopter is protected by our courts adjudicating what should be done in the best interests of a child.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that the Minister is taking this course.  If the Minister is going to say to me that there is something in the Bill of relevance to section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, and the court proceedings brought under it, I will in return say to the Minister that that is not so.  If his officials so advise him they are wrong. I am concerned that &mdash; possibly not out of any malicious intent but merely out of a lack of understanding of what is involved &mdash; following the enactment of the Bill and the new procedures that will then apply there will be a number of adopters who will find themselves considerably at risk.  They have been at risk <Col N="364" /> financially for some years in these circumstances because of the inadequacies of the Attorney General's scheme, which needed to be changed to deal properly with this area.</P>
    <P>However, even the small pittance of help that that scheme currently extends is being taken away under the Bill &mdash; not in the Bill itself but as a matter of practice, according to the Minister's speech.  He has told us that the Attorney General's scheme will not apply any more in adoption cases.  If the Minister means that he is only talking about the Bill and that the Attorney General's scheme will apply to cases brought under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, he should tell the House.  In that event he should explain to us why he should have one scheme for prospective adopters who have legitimate children or children born within marriage placed with them and another scheme applicable to adopters who have children born outside marriage placed with them.  That does not make any sense.</P>
    <P>The Bill varies substantially from the Fine Gael measure in that the Fine Gael measure sought to ensure that, whether applicants for adoption are seeking to adopt an abandoned legitimate child under the provisions of the Bill or whether applicants for adoption were seeking to adopt an abandoned child born outside marriage, as a result of proceedings brought under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, the legal expense incurred by all adoption applicants would be met promptly by the State.  I do not mind whether the expense is met through the health board, provided they are properly funded, through the Adoption Board, through the Attorney General's office or through the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  I do not mind what the source is.  But when we are taking about the welfare of children, when we are talking about adopters who find themselves through no fault of their own caught up in proceedings of this nature, the State has an obligation to ensure they are not put at a financial loss.  The State has an obligation to ensure that the financial hardships that could result from being <Col N="365" /> faced with High Court and Supreme Court proceedings do not prevent prospective adopters taking court actions where it is in the interests of the welfare of the child that they do so.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to explain the reason he appears to be providing one set of measures to protect prospective adopters in the area of legal costs who are seeking to adopt children who are, in effect, born within marriage, while removing a protection of a minimal nature that exists as a matter of practice for adopters who are seeking to adopt children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill that gives rise to further concern.  The Minister says that if a health board does not bring an application the adopters can bring an application and, if they succeed, the health board can foot the bill for the legal costs incurred by the adopters. Again, the adopters, apparently, must apply to a law centre.  If one assumes the means test will rule them out, they will not get legal aid.  Under the Bill as drafted, the adopters could in good faith in the interests of the child's welfare seek to adopt, yet the health board would still not meet their legal costs.</P>
    <P>There is a curious difference in the treatment this Bill applies to the natural parents of the child whose adoption is sought and the prospective adopters.  The natural parents who oppose the adoption application to the High Court and do not get legal aid through a law centre will have all their legal costs met by the health board, regardless of their financial circumstances. The adopters will only have their costs met by the health board if they succeed in having the child freed for adoption.  If they do not get the order they are looking for from the court they will be penalised and will have to foot the bill for the legal costs themselves.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, in a moment of frankness in the Seanad that he was trying to construct some sort of impediment against adopters or foster parents making vexatious applications to the High Court and this is why there is to be no protection <Col N="366" /> against legal costs for adopters who do not succeed in having a child freed for adoption by making an application under this Bill.  Let us assume a foster parent has had a child for 18 months: what would be a vexatious application?  It would be vexatious if the foster parent could rush into the courts and ask for an order freeing the child for adoption, without doing anything else.  The courts might discover that throughout the period the child was in foster care he or she had been visited by the parent or parents and there was a possibility of the parents resuming care of the child.  Under this Bill no foster parent can unilaterally run into the courts and do anything.  There is a sifting procedure.</P>
    <P>Before any foster parent can ask the courts to free a child for adoption, the Adoption Board must hold a preliminary hearing.  They must hear what has to be said by the health board, the adopters, and the natural parents and must make an adjudication as to whether it would be appropriate in the best interests of the child to have it adopted and must indicate whether it would or would not have it adopted if the child were freed for adoption. The role given to the Adoption Board is a protection against anybody making a vexatious application.  Neither the health board nor the adopters can be the moving parties in an application to the High Court for an order freeing a child to allow it to be adopted unless the Adoption Board has already made an order that it would be appropriate for the child to be adopted, on the basis of the information available to them and the assessments carried out by their social worker.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill foster parents who have had a child placed with them for two or ten years may go through the Adoption Board procedure which results in the Adoption Board deeming it appropriate that an adoption order be made.  They might succeed in getting an order in the High Court that the child be freed for adoption, but the natural parents could appeal to the Supreme Court.  For technical reasons of constitutional law the <Col N="367" /> Supreme Court could rule out the possibility of that child being freed for adoption, even though it might be in the interests of the child's welfare to be adopted.  If that happened the adopters could not have their legal costs met by the health board.  They would be penalised for the fact that they had lost in the Supreme Court.  They might have lost in the High Court due to technical legal reasons or something could have emerged during the course of the hearing about the background of the natural parents that the foster parents knew nothing about since the health board never communicated it to them for reasons of confidentiality.  That matter relating to the natural parents, about which the adopters knew nothing, could be the determining factor in the High Court's deciding the child should not be freed for adoption, even though in the absence of that factor it may have appeared quite reasonable that it should.</P>
    <P>This Bill should ensure that foster parents or prospective adopters who make a bone fide application to the High Court to have a child freed for adoption, having already had it deemed appropriate by the Adoption Board that the child should be adopted, will have their legal costs met by the health board, whether they win or lose their case.  If they are acting in good faith and the child has been in their care for some time and if it has been deemed appropriate by the Adoption Board, there is no rational reason for penalising them and requiring them to pay their own legal costs.  All adopters under this Bill could find themselves in a situation where natural parents were automatically taking every case from the High Court to the Supreme Court because they were protected against any possible financial loss, even if they lost the case.  All adopters could be at risk of losing out on the possibility of adopting a child whom they wish to adopt because of the dangers of some technical legal issue arising in a Supreme Court appeal.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not provide the protections for adopters the Minister has <Col N="368" /> suggested.  It leaves every adopter vulnerable where court cases have to be taken.  There is no guarantee in the Bill as drafted that any health board will act within the three months laid down to commence court proceedings.  There is no protection against any health board refusing as a matter of policy to bring any proceedings of this nature.  Prospective adopters, foster parents who have had children with them for many years and who will remain with them for the rest of their childhood, are given no real protection in circumstances where a health board does not act.  It is even more extraordinary that the Minister has removed protections available to adopters under existing practice.  I hope the Minister will look again at this aspect of the Bill.  I am sorry for spending so much time on this point and I apologise to other Members but it is a central and crucial issue.  It appears that the way section 3 of the 1974 Act is operating is not understood by the Minister's officials.  If it is, I do not know how he could have been given such advice.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly says there are different legal views as to the constitutionality of allowing the adoption of legitimate children.  The Minister's Bill and the previous Bills which have come before the House have sought to take into account the difficult constitutional environment in which this legislation must operate and have reflected the language contained in the Constitution with regard to children's and parental rights. It is essential that there should be a degree of certainty in the area of adoption and that couples who adopt know that adoption orders are valid.  When introducing the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in this area I expressed the hope that if the Bill got through the Dáil and the Seanad it would be referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution for a determination as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech today that he believes this Bill is constitutional and that he has been so advised by the <Col N="369" /> Attorney General's office.  I ask the Minister &mdash; I know it is an independent function of the President &mdash; to publicly make it known, as I am now publicly making it known that it is in the interests of ensuring the proper working of this legislation that at an early stage a decision is made as to its constitutionality.  This Bill should be referred by the President, as my own Private Members' Bill should have been if it had been successful, to the Supreme Court under Article 26 so that there is an adjudication as to its constitutionality and so that prospective adopters and natural parents do not, under proceedings brought under the Bill, find themselves embroiled in a whole series of constitutional actions to tease out the constitutionality of the measure.</P>

      <P>Persons aged 16 years or over who are in employment are covered by the social insurance system.  If they become unemployed they may sign on the live register and they would qualify for unemployment benefit if at least 39 contributions have been paid in respect of them.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons aged between 16 and 18 years are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The income needs of persons <Col N="370" /> in that age group were examined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission in their report stated that they would not support any form of income maintenance which could in any way encourage young persons to leave the education system prematurely.  Extending entitlement to unemployment assistance to persons in that age group with no previous attachment to the labour force would clearly have that effect, which explains why the commission did not make such a recommendation.  It would also have very significant financial implications. There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 17 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the treatment benefits <Col N="371" /> scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons took effect from 19 October 1987.  Since then a total of 17,500 dependent spouses have made applications for dental benefit.  Because of the fact that a course of treatment may extend over a period of time and because many claims do not reach the Department until the treatment is completed, it is not possible to say how many dependent spouses have actually received treatment in whole or in part so far.  However, prior approval for treatment is sought in the majority of cases and such prior approval has been granted in 14,500 cases since 19 October 1987.  A total of 23,500 dependent spouses have made applications for optical benefit and over 200 dependent spouses made applications in respect of hearing aids.</P>
    <P>One hundred and fifty nine dentists have agreed to participate in the extended scheme up to this stage.  Seven of these joined the extended scheme over the last two weeks.  Since the new scheme began two dentists who were active on the panel have died and one has retired. The Optometrists Association, which represents opticians, gave its full co-operation to the extended scheme from the start and all opticians are participating.</P>
    <P>I met the Irish Dental Association twice in 1987 and explained the Government decision to extend the scheme.  On 30 November 1987, we agreed to set up a joint working group, comprising representatives of the Department of Social Welfare and of the Irish Dental Association, to examine all aspects of the social insurance dental benefit scheme.  The working group is due to report to me by 30 May 1988.  I understand that there may be some short delay but that the report will be ready soon after that date.  I do not wish to anticipate or pre-empt the contents of the report at this stage.  I expect, however, that it will clarify the issues which exist between the Irish Dental Association and the Department in relation to the social insurance dental benefit scheme and its coverage.  I will then consider the report and come to a conclusion on the matters at issue at the <Col N="372" /> earliest possible date.  I trust that the Irish Dental Association will then be able to recommend that the remaining dentists participate in the treatment of dependent spouses under the extended scheme.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties arising from the embargo by the Irish Dental Association so far, I regard the extension as a success. There has been no problem at all in relation to optical benefit and hearing aids.  It is very significant also that in the cases of dependent spouses who have been treated under the scheme a pattern of treatment has emerged that shows that many of them had been in need of dental treatment for some time.  In this respect, the extension has uncovered a backlog of treatment which was greater than anticipated and I trust that the dentists will be able to agree to co-operate in dealing with it under the scheme at an early date.</P>
    <P>The estimate for the treatment benefit scheme in 1988 is £19 million.  I expect that all of this money will be spent.</P>
    <P>The dental and optical schemes for schoolchildren are operated by the health boards which come within the remit of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, despite the long and detailed response he has given, if he would not accept that the scheme is not working, in relation to the level of success it should be having? Would he accept that the lack of co-operation by the vast majority of dentists is something that should be deplored?  I urge him to do something about that as a matter or urgency.  In relation to the figures of expenditure that are available for the first quarter of this year it would appear &mdash; I do not think anything will happen to change the figures for the remainder of the year &mdash; that there will be significant savings in relation to dental treatment.  Would the Minister assure the House that if savings are going to be made &mdash; it looks as if there will be large savings out of the £6.275 million for dental treatment &mdash; that money will be spent in up-dating and providing an adequate dental service to schoolchildren? I put it to the Minister very strongly that that service is about three <Col N="373" /> years out of date.  It is totally inadequate and it is a source of frustration to the administrators and the parents of children who are waiting for the service.  Can the Minister assure the House that any savings that are made in relation to the dental scheme for spouses of insured workers will be spent on the scheme for schoolchildren, which, he must accept, is totally underfunded and inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several elements in the question.  The scheme is working satisfactorily for those who can benefit from it.  The number of people who are benefiting is increasing fairly rapidly.  The fact that the cost was lower in the early stages is to be expected because the numbers participating have increased as the year has gone on.  As I have said, seven new dentists have joined the scheme in the last two weeks.  That is reasonably significant because the embargo still applies.  The dependent spouses have been very patient, as I asked them to be, because there is a total embargo on those jobs.  There is a service operating throughout the country, although it is limited in some areas.  There are some problems in relation to travelling a distance for the service and I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Deputies to be patient with me at this stage.  There are a number of factors concerned.  The report of the joint working group will be published fairly shortly, certainly by the middle of June, although it was originally expected to be available for the end of May.  There are approximately 75 new dentists <Col N="374" /> coming out this year.  Normally most of them would have to emigrate, but there will be work here.  I accept the Deputy's concern about this, and I too am concerned. Nevertheless, I am confident that the number of those participating in this scheme will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>In relation to health board activities as they affect children, they are the responsibility of the Minister for Health. It is important to note that there has been a considerable saving on the health board side as a result of this new scheme because many people who would have qualified for treatment provided by the health board services &mdash; medical card holders &mdash; and who have been on the waiting list are transferring to this scheme because they are eligible under it as dependent spouses.  This is relieving some pressure on the health boards and will enable them to provide more services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I wish to raise and perhaps the Minister would clarify it as he appears to have a very good understanding of the brief in front of him.  Will there be savings on the dental scheme this year?  The Minister spoke about the health service aspect, would he express the view that it would be in the interest of the children that all the money would be spent, even if it has to be transferred to another Department, rather than go back into the Exchequer as savings?  Would the Minister recommend that move?  Everybody in the House accepts that there is a three to four year waiting list for treatment for school children. If adequate treatment were provided initially this could mean a saving in the long term.  Would the Minister be prepared to recommend that this money be transferred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will be prepared to have discussions with the Minister for Health about the health board scheme for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an embargo and I have been trying to deliver as much as possible in those circumstances, and every Deputy is aware of that.  In the Department initially we regarded 150 as the minimum number needed to operate the service.  That is not to say that one can operate a satisfactory service with just that number, but that is the figure we set.  Obviously, the service will become more comprehensive in the future and I hope dentists continue to join the scheme.  The fact that seven dentists joined in the last two weeks is a good omen.</P>

      <P>As only nine new dentists have joined the scheme since the Minister last reported to us on 1 March, would he not agree that that represents a very significant slowing up of new arrivals into the scheme?  Does he know the number of dentists operating in the Dublin area?  In the north side of the city there are no more than three dentists operating at any one time, which is almost a non-service.  Does the Minister stand over his words at the annual meeting this year of the Irish Dental Association that, with or without them, he will see the full implementation of his scheme which is so badly needed, as the figures suggest?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I missed it in the Minister's comprehensive answer but I do not think he referred to the numbers eligible under this scheme.  He gave the numbers of those who applied for treatment, but how many are eligible?  He has also told us the number of dentists operating the scheme, but what is the total number of dentists who would otherwise be available to operate the scheme if there was no embargo?  Does the Minister see merit in combining the scheme with that of the health boards and having a unified scheme for dental treatment in the country as opposed to dividing the resources that are available?</P>

      <P>The number of dependent spouses eligible would be 330,000 out of a total of 1.3 million.  The estimates are based on the number who would be likely to apply, but may not mean the number of people with dental problems.  The number of dentists active on the panel would be 630; but, as I said, two have died and one has retired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about combining the scheme with that of the health boards.  That is the argument normally made by the Irish Dental Association. If we combined the two schemes we would have to introduce a means test for everybody.  I am opposed to that because I see this scheme as providing treatment benefit for insured workers.  If <Col N="377" /> we were to make that move, the insured workers would lose benefit.  That is my concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the effort behind any scheme, either in health or social welfare, should be the proper treatment of as many people as possible?  If a means test brings that about, is it not worth considering?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always very suspicious &mdash; I am not thinking of the Deputy when I say this because this question is put to me frequently outside this House, particularly by the Irish Dental Association &mdash; when the argument is put to me that we should always be concerned about the poor and those on the lowest income.  It sometimes is a case of the wolf in sheep's clothing.  I know exactly what it means. It means to put more people into the private sector so that we can have them as private patients and bring in these dependent spouses who have never had treatment for years.  What most people in this House believed is coming out clearly, that the amount of treatment being given to the spouses is far greater than the treatment given to the men because the dental situation for women is so much worse.  One can attack both situations separately.  In other words, there would <Col N="378" /> be ways of tackling the problem for those in the lowest income groups, many of whom come under this heading, but we must also deal with children and other categories under the health service. Different methods could be adopted to improve the position.  The dentists could help out, also.  The Taoiseach, when Minister for Health and Social Welfare, tried to bring in a scheme to help the position but did not get the co-operation of the dentists.  My main concern would be that the effect should not be to deny many workers and their spouses in the middle income group the treatment they need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for a free electricity allowance, a person in receipt of a qualifying payment must either reside entirely alone or with persons who come within certain excepted categories.</P>
      <P>A person providing full time care and attention to an invalided applicant is accepted as coming within the categories for satisfying the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition of the scheme.  It is not a condition of the scheme that a prescribed relative allowance be payable in such cases, but as a rule this would be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where care is provided otherwise than on a full time basis, for example, where the carer is working outside the home, free electricity allowance is not payable. This is not a new requirement, but one which dates from the early days of the scheme.  It was never intended that <Col N="379" /> households would qualify in which members were gainfully occupied.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, as a former Minister for Finance, that any extension of the scheme would bring additional costs.  I do not have additional funds available at present.  I appreciate that the Deputy is trying to limit the additional cost in a particular way and understand his concern in that direction.  The total number of pensioners within the eligible categories is over 350,000 and, of these, some 174,000 are receiving the free electricity allowance. If all eligible pensioners were to qualify, the cost of the scheme could double from £20.74 million in 1988 terms to over £40 million a year.  That is the size of the problem in terms of cost.  The Deputy is <Col N="380" /> suggesting a more limited extension but that, too, would involve cost and is a budgetary matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational opportunites scheme is a pilot scheme which gives unemployed persons over 25 years of age the opportunity to attend a leaving certificate course run by their local VEC while at the same time being paid a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.  The scheme is operating in Limerick city and Tallaght, County Dublin, and there are three classes with 44 pupils in all.</P>
      <P>The extension of the scheme on a nationwide basis and making it available to all social welfare recipients would have very significant implications in terms of costs, including physical resources and would have to be examined in the context of policy for adult education generally.  It is my intention, however, to extend the existing scheme to other locations, in consultation with the Minister for Education as resources permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the number who applied for the schemes which were offered in Limerick, Tallaght and Letterkenny. The Letterkenny scheme did not go ahead because it was not possible to form a class in that case.  The Limerick and Tallaght schemes went ahead.  There were two classes formed in Limerick, with 23 and 15 participants and one class in Tallaght with 12 participants.  The classes got off the ground.  There were six drop-outs during the course and in Limerick three people got jobs, one person dropped out because of illness and one participant moved away.  Generally the results were very good.  I would be very anxious to see the scheme extended further.  Of the original participants, 12 <Col N="382" /> are no longer on the live register, nine of whom got jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recently announced a scheme to allow for part-time work while drawing unemployment assistance.  Here we have a situation where people who want to improve their employment prospects by going into education are not allowed to do so.  Would the Minister not consider, for the coming school year starting in September, allowing social welfare recipients to, at least, draw part of their allowance if they go into part-time or full-time education, regardless of special classes being arranged for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly consider that.  I would be interested in looking into it very seriously.  As the Deputy says, it differs from the educational opportunities scheme which is a question of forming classes for over 25s.  He is suggesting now that people who are going to participate in a course to improve their opportunities for getting back into employment might be assisted.  I shall look into the matter.</P>

Because of the Minister's particular interest in this scheme I ask him to consider as a special case the Dublin north east area which is in need of such a scheme given its high rate of unemployment and the good burgeoning adult education schemes which exist there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply, extension of the education opportunities scheme will depend on the resources of the Department of Education.  I am very anxious that extra resources will be provided to establish courses in areas where they can be established.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Mitchell, let me say it would be a matter of letting individuals free to go where they can find suitable courses.  Some other Deputies also raised <Col N="383" /> that question with me recently and it is one which I am looking at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That illustrates our haphazard approach to the public finances. On the one hand the Minister has agreed to look at my suggestion to extend the scope of the education opportunities scheme while, on the other hand the Minister for Education is closing down adult literacy schemes.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for social assistance payments who have capital are assessed with a notional income from the capital.  The percentage rates used vary but the maximum 10 per cent rate of assessment is applied under the old age pension and unemployment assistance schemes to amounts of capital over a certain level.</P>
      <P>The assessment system is not related to interest actually earned but rather is based on the determination of a capital value.  Under the old age pension scheme a person can have means from all sources of up to £6 a week and still qualify for the maximum pension.  In the case of a married couple this would be £12 per week.  In relation to capital alone, under existing arrangements, a married couple could have joint capital of over £5,900 and still qualify for maximum pension. They could have joint capital of over £51,000 and still qualify for minimum rate of pension.</P>
      <P>The current assessment is not greatly out of line with rates of return which can be obtained on investments.  For example in relation to long term investments the representative yields on Government securities are currently around 9.5 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Subsidiary Employments) Regulations, 1979 list a number of employments of a subsidiary nature which are insurable at the class J rate of contribution, unless the person concerned is mainly dependent for his or her livelihood on the earnings from that employment.  In the latter event, the class A rate applies.  The class J rate gives cover for occupational injuries benefits only.  Employment as a &ldquo;part time vocational teacher&rdquo; is one of the employments covered by these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the person is not mainly dependent on the earnings from the employment, the question of whether class A or class J applies depends on the definition of &ldquo;part time&rdquo;.  The definition used for this is &ldquo;working less than 18 hours in the week&rdquo;.  Thus, where a vocational teacher, who is not mainly dependent on the earnings from the employment, is working less than 18 hours, he or she is regarded <Col N="386" /> as a &ldquo;part time vocational teacher&rdquo; and is insurable at the class J rate.  If he or she is working for 18 hours or more, the class A rate applies.</P>
    <P>In the normal course the number of hours worked, as recorded by the employer, is a significant element in determining the question of insurability. If some of these teachers are in fact working more hours than they are being paid for, the problem to be resolved may well be to ensure that the full hours worked are recorded by the employer.  It would be most unsatisfactory, and indeed probably an unworkable arrangement, if the social insurance system had to obtain and consider the applicability of hours worked which for some reason were not formally recorded by the employer as having been worked.</P>
    <P>My Department are about to commence an examination of the general question of the insurability of part time employment.  In view of the Deputy's question, I have arranged that the Department will include this matter in their examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is only the number of hours that a teacher spends in the classroom that are recorded and that the hours spent preparing classes are ignored by the vocational education committees and that, therefore, an unrepresentative picture of the number of hours actually worked, as distinct from the number of hours recorded, emerges in the case of part time teachers for the purposes of social insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem which the Deputy has raised but as I have said this matter will be included in the examination which is being undertaken at present by my Department at my request. Nevertheless, the Deputy will appreciate the difficulties which are being caused for my Department as a result of employers not recording the real number of hours worked.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is intended to establish a social welfare advisory council, representative of contributors, beneficiaries and administrators, to advise on policy formulation, as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended the establishment of an advisory body to advise the Minister for Social Welfare on any aspect of the system either on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Having examined the commission's recommendation I do not consider that there is a need at this stage for such an advisory body given the wide range of sources of advice that are currently available to me.</P>
      <P>Two advisory bodies currently operate under the aegis of my Department, namely the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Pensions Board and my Department are also represented on the National Social Services Board and the National Council for the Aged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interest groups make representations to me on a regular basis and clearly value the opportunity of putting their case directly on the various issues of concern to them.  In recognition of the important contribution voluntary organisations make in the field of social services the Government have given a firm commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to take measures to ensure a closer liaison with such organisations in the preparation and implementation of policies in the social welfare area.  In line with this commitment I engaged in a series of very fruitful meetings with representatives of voluntary organisations prior to the Budget and their views were fully taken into account by me in the formulation of my budgetary proposals for consideration by the Government.  I have also had discussions with representatives of voluntary organisations in relation to my proposals for greater flexibility in the unemployment payment <Col N="388" /> schemes.  I intend to continue to have discussions with representatives of voluntary organisations on a regular basis.</P>

Would he agree that one of their important functions would be the publication of an annual report reflecting what is needed on a continuous basis?  Furthermore would the Minister agree that it would be a very useful means of channelling these different representations at very little cost, because there are so many of those bodies and interested groups who would be only too willing to contribute to the work of such a review body?</P>

Rather, would the Minister agree that they foresaw it as a means of streamlining matters and providing the very valuable service of reporting annually on developments and work in this area?  Would the Minister at least think again about the suggestions contained in that report and take them on board?</P>

      <P>In all of these cases action was taken to recover the amount of benefit or assistance overpaid to the claimant and, where there was sufficient evidence to support prosecution, legal proceedings were instigated.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that there are a number of elements involved in this.  First, I should say that fraud is a very specific thing.  Abuse is something that would not be defined as fraud, nor would unwarranted claiming. The total number of staff involved is just above 500, 501 or thereabouts.  There is a special investigation unit on the job.  I should say that the quantified savings from abuses of the unemployment benefit and assistance schemes in 1987 amounted to £15.5 million, made up of £4 million arising from the work of the special investigation unit, £3.3 million arising from the work of the external control unit and £8.2 million from the Jobsearch programme, which would not include people who went on courses or disability benefit abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will realise that the whole operation of the system has been tightened up considerably in recent years, <Col N="390" /> much of the work in this area having come to a head in the course of last year. The previous Government initiated a number of measures to tighten up the position.  We went further with that exercise in the course of last year.  Deputies can take it that the system and its operations have been considerably improved and savings increased considerably, particularly in the course of the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will amend the regulations in order that a person visiting Northern Ireland should not be regarded as absent from the State for the purposes of social welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the recommendation of the Ombudsman in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Social Welfare regulations social insurance pensions can be paid to recipients in Northern Ireland or anywhere abroad.  Disability benefit can be paid for a period of temporary absence in Northern Ireland.  Unemployment benefit is not generally payable in Northern Ireland except in very limited circumstances where the recipient was a member of the Defence Forces and previously had been resident in Northern Ireland.  The export of unemployment benefit on a general basis to claimants in Northern Ireland would not be possible, given the arrangements which are necessary to administer and control payments under that scheme.</P>
      <P>EC regulations on social security for migrant workers provide for the payment of benefits, including unemployment benefit under certain conditions to persons resident in other member states or going to another member state to look for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman has expressed the opinion that a person visiting Northern Ireland should not be regarded as &ldquo;absent from the State&rdquo; for the purposes of social welfare payments.  The particular case which gave rise to this recommendation was that of a recipient of unemployment benefit who went to Northern Ireland for a two week holiday.  Under present arrangements it is possible for an unemployed person to take a two week holiday within this State without affecting his or her entitlement.  I recently announced that I consider unemployed persons, particularly those who are long-term unemployed, should be able to go on visits abroad for a period of two weeks in <Col N="392" /> a year and retain their entitlements in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements would operate in addition to the facility under which unemployed people representing Ireland at international sporting events will be allowed to continue to receive their unemployment payments.  If it is necessary to extend the legislation to enable these things to be done, I will be prepared to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy wants a very simple answer to something covered by very complex legislation.  That is why it is not quite that simple to give the Deputy the simple answer he wants.  For example, the words I have used are technically and legally correct.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the importance of that.  It is possible to judge that a person is still available for work in certain circumstances. The flexibility within that has been extended but it is a matter under the existing legislation for the deciding officers and for the appeals officers to decide.  I have said that I considered that the two weeks should be provided in the North as well as here and that would be a reasonable interpretation of what is intended in the Act.  It has not been the interpretation previously.  I believe that is a reasonable interpretation.  If that is not accepted as an interpretation then it will be necessary to bring in legislation.</P>

      <Col N="397" /> Prior to this year's budget I engaged in a series of meetings with voluntary organisations to discuss their views on social welfare policy and these views were taken into account in the formulation of my proposals in the context of the budget discussions.  I will be having further discussions with such organisations on a regular basis in the future.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the role which voluntary organisations can play in providing opportunities for unemployed people to become actively involved in their work.  I have had discussions recently with representatives of voluntary organisations in relation to the use which could be made of the part-time job incentive scheme and the voluntary work scheme in this regard and I am considering what further might be done to encourage this process.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a considerable amount of contact on an ongoing basis with voluntary organisations in the context of the scheme of grants for voluntary organisations in the social services area.  The Deputy will be aware in this connection that a special grant of £100,000 was recently made to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for a major programme of personal development and home management courses throughout the country.  This arose from discussions I had with the society prior to the budget. It will enable them to provide courses for over 5,000 families.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I fully recognise the major contribution which voluntary organisations make in the social welfare area.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was to the effect that there has always been co-operation in the voluntary organisations, that the Department have always sought the advice of voluntary organisations.  I take it from that that no measures have been taken to ensure closer liaison with voluntary organisations in the preparation and implementation of policies in the social welfare area.  That has been set down precisely in those terms in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> signed by <Col N="398" /> the famous social partners last autumn. The Minister has not indicated that he has taken that very seriously.  Does the Minister intend to have regular close liaison with the voluntary organisations who I am sure have a very close knowledge of the difficulties and problems in the social welfare area?  This is in the actual preparation and implementation of social welfare policies.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's statement, I said it has always been my policy to be involved.  I went on to say that I have had meetings with the bodies recently, in line with the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> and I will continue to have such meetings and discussions.  In fact, I regard the voluntary organisations as having a major integral part to play in the operation of the system.  That would be my own commitment in any event, irrespective of what is contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We are working very closely with the voluntary bodies and will continue to do so.  We have had a number of meetings with individual representatives of voluntary bodies in that regard and particularly in regard to two schemes which we want to develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that athletes who are on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit and who represent Ireland in other countries are refused benefit on the basis that they are not available for work; whether he is aware that this is unfair and leaves Irish athletes at a major disadvantage in relation to opponents from other countries many of whom are paid on a full time basis during training and trips abroad; if he will give favourable consideration to remove this by regulations to provide that athletes can sign before or after travel and be paid normal benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that last month I dealt with a specific question tabled about the position of unemployed athletes chosen to represent Ireland in the Olympic Games in Korea later this year.  My reply was to the effect that such athletes would be accommodated within the unemployment payments schemes for the period spent abroad in connection with the games and would accordingly be paid their unemployment payments entitlements for the relevant period.  In the course of that reply I stated that in normal circumstances unemployed persons who go abroad are not entitled to receive payment of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance; that I had, however, always adopted a flexible approach in relation to entitlement to unemployment payments generally, that claimants could participate in various activities without affecting their entitlements so long as they continued to be in the labour market and continued to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  I cited examples of those activities as participation in part time education courses and voluntary work projects.  I also stated that claimants were allowed to take two weeks holidays in the State without affecting their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a more general question in that <Col N="400" /> it does not deal with a specific international sporting competition.  I recognise, however, that athletes representing their country must put a great deal of time and effort into reaching the high standard required to compete at international level.  In the case of unemployed people this standard would have been achieved while the claimant continued to be in the labour market.  I believe it would be unfair in such instances if the person concerned were not entitled to payment for the short period during which he or she was participating in the particular international competition abroad.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I can inform the Deputy that any unemployed athlete who is selected by a recognised sporting organisation to represent Ireland abroad and who applies for continued payment of unemployment benefit or assistance for the period of his or her participation will continue to receive their unemployment payments.  The individual circumstances will no doubt vary from case to case, but measures such as adequate advance notice and verification of participation from the relevant sporting authority will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced that in future unemployed people representing Ireland at international sporting events will be allowed to continue to receive their unemployment payments.  In fact, earlier this week the first two applicants under the new arrangements were given approval to continue receiving their unemployment payments while representing Ireland in the 14 day cycling Tour of Britain which begins this weekend.  I know the Deputy will join with me in wishing them every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a very positive reply to my question.  I would like to draw to his attention a young man in my own town of Drogheda who was part of the Irish boxing team and has represented Ireland on eight occasions.  He is a young married man and each time he went to sign for unemployment assistance he was refused under existing regulations.  I would ask the <Col N="401" /> Minister to give sympathetic consideration to that case and I am sure there are many other cases.  Arising from the Minister's reply, will the Minister issue a regulation or instruction to the managers in employment exchanges, as soon as possible, so that there can be no misunderstanding about the announcement today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being done.  Last Friday was the day when the new arrangements came into force and I commented on them on Monday in Galway. At the time I had not known about the Deputy's question, but it is very relevant. As the Deputy is aware, we had some discussion on this matter previously and I was trying to discover how I could meet the requirements.  In the first instance it was straightforward to meet the requirements in the case of people chosen for the Olympic Games; to go beyond that meant there was the problem of control. Now we have a definition that will go beyond that and cover people generally in sporting events.  There is what has been going on during the past six weeks.  It so happens that there are two members of the Olympic squad going out this weekend. There are ten on the Olympic cycling squad, three of whom will be selected eventually; but two members of that squad are going out to compete in the Tour of Britain.  They are Paul McCormack and Michael Walsh, two cyclists, and they are benefiting under the new arrangements.  If the Deputy gives me information about the person representing Ireland on the boxing team, I will examine the case.  There is a difficulty dealing retrospectively, as the Deputy will understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan mentioned a case some time ago of people going to an EC poverty programme meeting who were unemployed here.  Other arrangements were made for them and they were actually covered, but in a different way.  The other question which arises is whether it is necessary to make regulations and bring in legislation.  Before doing that I would like to see, in practice, what way such legislation might be phrased if we <Col N="402" /> are to amend the legislation.  At present that interpretation is acceptable.</P>

      <P>The criteria used in determining entitlement under means-tested schemes comprise the following components &mdash; cash income, the value of any capital or property from which an income might be derived and, in the case of certain benefits, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the applicant.</P>
      <P>While the criteria are broadly similar there are nevertheless variations in the manner in which some of the components, principally capital and income from earnings, are assessed.  These variations can result in the assessment of means being more favourable to applicants under certain schemes.  There are at present 11 means-tested schemes which vary in one way or another and the application of a single means test for all these schemes would have major financial and other implications.  I am concerned, however, to reduce as far as possible the need for different means assessments and I am at present examining the scope for rationalising the various arrangements which currently apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he told me that a year ago? He has now told us that there are 11 different means tests with different criteria in his own Department.  In addition there are eight more in other Departments, including, for instance, education grants, differential rent, medical cards, disabled persons maintenance allowance etc.  Is the Minister conscious of the humiliation, irritation and inconvenience which people have to endure if they are unfortunate enough to need unemployment assistance or, in the case of a deserted wife, deserted wife's allowance? <Col N="403" /> Does the Minister know that a lady who becomes deserted must go through a means test for supplementary welfare allowance, a separate means test for deserted wife's allowance, a separate means test for a medical card, a separate means test for her differential rent if she is in a local authority house, a separate means test for civil legal aid if she requires it, a separate means test for free footwear for her children and a separate means test for free fuel, and that is not all.  They are done in different offices by different officials to different criteria.  Would the Minister not agree that this is crying out for urgent change?  Would he not accept that after one year it is disappointing to hear he is still considering the matter?</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental committee are working on the rationalisation of the means tests where duplicate means tests occur and are carried out both by the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare.  The purpose there is to ensure that the duplication is removed.  There are difficulties in it.  There are different criteria in different circumstances.  If we were to remove all the means tests, or simplify them to the one level, then the benefit would be much higher in some circumstances than in others.  Probably at the end of the day there would still be differences, but there is considerable scope for rationalisation. A number of areas have been rationalised. The free fuel scheme and the footwear scheme have been rationalised in relation to the benefit a person is on already from, for instance, the Department of Social Welfare.  I have rationalised that during the year and I will continue with that process.  The other approach I have taken in the year is that of the one stop shop and having the means assessed at the one time by the <Col N="404" /> various people involved whether health board or social welfare people.  I appreciate the difficulty and will be making every effort at rationalisation of the means tests.</P>

      <P>What is wrong with having one means test at the local health centre where the applicant is put through the hoops just once and then gets a certificate from the community welfare officer saying what the means are and using that certificate as an indication of whether he or she is entitled to all the items I have just mentioned?  I could add a few more.  Why have such persons to be put through the same hoops a dozen times in certain cases at different offices by different officials, costing a fortune to the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the need to rationalise the schemes.  The Deputy mentioned supplementary welfare benefit and deserted wife's benefit.  The means assessment in those two cases would be very different. In the first instance supplementary welfare is only establishing whether you have enough money this week for this week.  I know some additional discretionary categories can be added to that.  The deserted wife's benefit means test involves talking about a pension which is going to be long term and obviously different criteria will be involved there.  There is no reason why they cannot be done in the one place, of course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Without changing the criteria at all for any of the 11 items in the Department of Social Welfare and the six or seven in the Department of health, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment, why is there not just one calculation of the means of the person which can be used in assessment of eligibility for all the different things?  Surely that would reduce a great deal of administrative and bureaucratic time, which is costly, and would eliminate a great deal of inconvenience and humiliation for applicants who very often are at a low ebb at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, some of the benefits in means assessments given to elderly people are greater than those given to able-bodied young people. Consequently, the criteria are different in the two sets of circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary in some cases to go into all those means and it is necessary in other cases.  Broadly speaking, I would not disagree with the Deputy.  There is considerable scope for rationalisation, but at the end of the day there is a danger that the averaging will be downward because some of the means allowed in some cases are extra means allowed because of a person's circumstances and the assessment is done for that reason.  I know the Deputy will suggest that the one person to do all of these means tests.  At least we can let the number of persons doing them, whether <Col N="406" /> they are from the health boards or Department of Social Welfare, do them in the one place.

    <Title>Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for Question Time I had raised the issue that it is essential that there be a degree of certainty in the area of adoption.  I drew to the Minister's attention the fact that the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill introduced a year ago to provide for the adoption of legitimate children abandoned by their parents dealt with the constitutional issues in a way similar to a way the Minister deals with them.  I said that so as to ensure that, many years after an adoption order was made pursuant to the terms of my Bill as it was when introduced and many years after an adoption order is made under this Bill now before the House, no problems can arise as to its constitutional validity and that there was a need to have at an early date a decision as to the constitutionality of the procedures provided for under this Bill in permitting the adoption of abandoned children born to a couple within marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech did not indicate whether he favoured such a constitutional decision taking place at an early date.  I repeat it is my belief that this Bill should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution so there can be a once and for all decision as to its constitutionality. If that is not done we will discover after the Bill comes into force, on the first two or three occasions when an applicant for adoption makes application under this Bill to the High Court for permission to adopt a child who has been with the applicant in fosterage for some time, that the constitutional issues will have to be fought out between the applicants and the natural parents if they are opposing the application.  Even if there is no opposition from the natural parents to an adoption order being made, the court may of itself on its own volition raise the constitutional issue and the first adopters who seek to adopt under the <Col N="426" /> provisions of this legislation, through no fault of their own and without wishing to be so involved, could find themselves involved in a constitutional action in which they have to ask the courts to determine the constitutionality of this measure.</P>
    <P>It is preferable that this issue is disposed of before we start working the provisions of this Bill.  Accordingly, I urge the Minister, using whatever influence he has, to publicise the fact that not only Deputies on the Opposition benches but also the Government Minister and the Government themselves would like the President when he has this Bill before him for signature to consult with the Council of State with a view to having a decision as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that this Adoption Bill, like its predecessors, including the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, has had to follow a very tortuous and difficult legal route in laying down the criteria applicable and to be determined by the courts in ascertaining whether a child should be made available for adoption.</P>
    <P>The Minister, quite fairly, during the course of the Seanad debate indicated that in the context of the criteria laid down, the High Court must have regard to such criteria when making a decision. However, he could not fully explain the meaning of the criteria or fully set out the circumstances in which the court might regard parental failure as constituting an abandonment on the part of parents and all parental rights under the Constitution or otherwise.  The Minister said it must be left to the courts to determine when there is such a failure and the wording of the Bill follows that of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution in this regard.</P>
    <P>The previous measures which came before the House in dealing with this area also had to follow this route.  The difficulty with this legislation in practice is that until the courts impose their own interpretation there will be some degree of uncertainty as to the exact parameters of its application.  It is most regrettable that that uncertainty remains because we have not yet faced up to or tackled the constitutional issues that need to be <Col N="427" /> resolved in this area.  The need to resolve them was highlighted not just by the somewhat prolix provisions contained in this Bill but also by the provisions in the Bill dealing with child care which will be debated on another occasion, which seeks to tread over constitutional glass in trying to ensure that children at risk can properly be afforded care and protection without health boards violating constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution is grossly defective in this area.  There is a need for a clear statement on the rights of children and parents without the ambiguity that exists by reference to inalienable and imprescriptible rights, which are referred to in the Constitution.  In effect, it is left to the courts to decide what those rights are and how they should be applied.  I am not suggesting that parents or children should be deprived of their rights but it is unfortunate that there is a constitutional grey area in which no one can be certain of the rights of parents and children in particular circumstances, how such rights should affect adoption or where a child is at risk as a result of parental misconduct. We need a charter of rights, not merely under our ordinary law but under the Constitution, in relation to children. Emphasis should be laid on the rights of a child, as very much the vulnerable and dependent person, and at all times to ensure the child's welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing this Bill in the Seanad in July 1987, said that he would have preferred, if possible, the powers which the Bill confers on the High Court to have been conferred on a family court.  Almost ten months later there is still no sign of the Government doing what the Minister would like to see done. It bears repeating that there is agreement on all sides of the House that there is a need for family courts to deal with contested issues in the area of adoption, issues that arise under this Bill and the whole plethora of problems that arise in the contentious area of family law. Nevertheless, the Government have turned their back on enacting legislation to provide family courts and, considering <Col N="428" /> the statement made by the Minister in the Seanad in 1987 that he would like to see family courts, it was expected that some time early this year the Government might have implemented the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to provide such courts.  We will go some of the way in that in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill but we will not provide a unified system of family courts as a separate and totally different court system from that currently operating because that cannot be done in a Private Members' Bill.  It can only be done by the Government because the establishment of such a court would constitute a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Health, when responding, to indicate to the House what steps he has taken since he spoke in the Seanad in 1987 expressing a preference for a family court to deal with all these matters.  It is noteworthy that the Minister made no reference in his speech today to the desirability or need for family courts.  Perhaps he will confirm that it is now the case, as has already been suggested by the Minister for Justice, that the Government have no interest in providing family courts and no commitment to them.  Will he confirm if the Government intend to do anything about providing family courts?</P>
    <P>There is another major disappointment in the Minister's approach today.  When the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill was introduced by me, the Minister indicated that not only would he produce his own Bill to deal with the issue but that he would introduce legislation to implement widescale reform in the area of adoption law.  Indeed, in reply to a Dáil Question on 30 April 1987 the Minister stated that in the coming months he intended to study the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services with a view to introducing reforming legislation.  It is now almost 14 months since the Minister gave that reply in the House.  It is also noteworthy that in his speech today he made no reference to the wide variety of reforms which the Review Committee on <Col N="429" /> Adoption Services suggested were necessary. There is no indication from the Minister as to whether he has completed his study of the report.  I presume he could not still be studying it because it is not a particularly complex document and it has been around since 1984.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate whether he intends to introduce further legislation in the area of adoption, some of the comprehensive reforms to our adoption laws and practices and to implement all the reforms recommended in the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services, or even a portion of these reforms? If he intends to implement some and not others, will he indicate which reforms he will provide for and when the House is likely to see comprehensive legislation dealing with the whole area of adoption.</P>
    <P>The Minister would not have introduced this Bill if Fine Gael had not brought in a Private Members' Bill this time last year.  He has not given any positive indication that he intends to implement some of the many necessary reforms to modernise our adoption laws and if this continues to be the case, Fine Gael will bring before the House a further Private Members' Bill dealing with other aspects of adoption law that need to be reformed.  If necessary, we will force the Minister to take action on badly needed reforms.  They have been documented for a long time.  They did not originate with the Review Committee on Adoption Services. Many of them have been referred to by groups working in the area of adoption before that committee produced its report in 1984.  I could list some of them as an indicator of the reforms necessary to bring our adoption laws and practices up to date to confront the many problems that the law currently ignores.</P>
    <P>For a long time it has been said that there is a need to enact a statutory provision so that there would be a code of uniform procedures and practices applied by all adoption societies within the State.  We do not have a statutory provision which allows, for example, the Adoption Board to ensure that minimum codes of practices and procedures are <Col N="430" /> applied by the different adoption societies we have.  The differences of approach of the adoption societies in the area of adoption has been commented on by a variety of groups over the years.  Some societies are better than others, some are more efficient than others, some have more qualified personnel than others and some adopt different practices that bear no relationship to the law.  For example, there is no provision in our adoption Acts which sets down any statutory maximum age for adoption though as a matter of practice, the adoption societies for some years would not allow a couple to adopt where both the husband and wife had exceeded the age of 40.</P>
    <P>We now have a shortage of children being made available for adoption.  More mothers who have children outside marriage are keeping them and caring for them.  At one time we had in the region of 1,200 to 1,400 adoption orders made each year but that figure has dropped to between 600 and 800 adoption orders per year.  As a result a number of adoption societies have closed their doors on adopters. They will not entertain any new applicants on their list because they have many people waiting for adoption placements and insufficient children to place with them.</P>
    <P>Taken with that we now have adoption societies, and health boards, unilaterally, and without legislative force, imposing age limits on couples who can adopt which are a good deal lower than the 40 years that previously applied. There are some adoption societies who will not place a child with a couple for adoption where either the husband or the wife is over 33 years of age.  The age limit has gone that low.  Some are applying an age limit of 35 years.  Those limits do not have any statutory force, and it is in such areas that we should have minimum codes of practice and procedure, ensuring a uniformity of approach.  Couples are being deprived of access to adoptions under Irish laws because of unilateral decisions taken as a policy matter by adoption societies as to the age of couples with whom children will be placed, due to the shortage of children available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> There is also a need for a more integrated approach between fosterage and adoption.  Currently, health boards largely deal in the area of fosterage and do some adoption work.  Some do a little adoption work while others do a lot but then we have denominationally based adoption societies who largely and solely work in the area of adoption.  There is a need for the breaking down of the barriers between adoption and fosterage into a more integrated approach.  It is quite illogical at this stage that we have one agency dealing with adoption and a totally separate agency dealing with fosterage because there are overlapping considerations in those areas.  Obviously, short term fosterage is quite distinct from adoption.</P>

      <P>I regret to interrupt the Deputy who has such a reputation in this area but it is open to the Deputy on Second Stage to refer to what is in the legislation before us or what might be in it.  Is the Deputy advocating that all the omissions that exist in respect of adoption should be in the Bill?</P>

      <P>I am referring to what could be in the Bill had the Minister done his job properly.  The Minister has had 18 months to deal with the report.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister who has the Adoption Bill and the Child Care Bill before the House has virtually ignored the area of fosterage.  The Bill before us highlights the interaction between fosterage and adoption.  Before a couple can adopt under the Bill they will have to have a child placed with them for at least 12 months.  The Bill shows the exact connection between adoption and fosterage. It shows how the artificial barriers have been erected, by the piecemeal development of social services here, between agencies that deal largely in adoption and others that deal largely in fosterage.  That artificial barrier needs to be remedied by a coherent and comprehensive piece of <Col N="432" /> legislation which will amalgamate all children's services under the aegis of one major agency.</P>
      <P>The Minister had 14 months since he took office to deal with the report of the review committee.  In the last Dáil the Minister was Opposition spokesman on Health and I presume that during his three years of spokesmanship he read the report of the review committee and had some views on it.  Considering the amount of time he has had to deal with that report he should be dealing not just with this measure but with a comprehensive adoption Bill.  Another matter that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency is the tracing of origins.  Under our legislation there is no formal arrangement whereby a child who was adopted 25 or 30 years ago and wants to trace his or her origins and ascertain the identity of his or her natural parents can formally do so.  Equally, there is no formal way in which a parent who placed a child for adoption 15 or 20 years ago and who wishes to communicate with that child can formally do so.</P>
      <P>The reality is that there are quite a number of people in our society who were placed for adoption and would like to make contact with their natural parents. There may be a number of natural parents who would be happy that such contact be made but there is no legislative means of facilitating that contract.  The Adoption Board have recognised that problem by making reference to it in their reports.  There is a need to look at the area of tracing of origins and provide formal legislation setting out a procedure applicable in regard to it so that people who wish to make contact with each other can do so.  It is necessary to provide the proper safeguards in circumstances where people wish to ensure their anonymity. We have not sought to address this issue in the House and it needs to be addressed in an adoption Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem that the Minister needs to address, and which I raised during the course of my speech on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill &mdash; I suggested that the Government should deal with it in their legislation &mdash; was the <Col N="433" /> recognition of foreign adoption orders. An increasing number of Irish couples are adopting children in India, Chile, Peru, the Phillipines and a number of other countries.  Because there are so few children available here for adoption and because adoption societies have closed their doors.  Some couples are forced to adopt outside this country because they are of a minority religious persuasion or are of mixed religion, and are not facilitated by existing denominational adoption societies in respect of whom there would rarely be a child available that they could adopt under our existing adoption laws.  More Irish couples are adopting children outside Ireland and returning here with them and we do not have any laws stating in what circumstances the State recognises foreign adoption orders.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem has been recognised by the Adoption Board who now produce a special leaflet for couples who intend to adopt outside Ireland explaining to them what they need to do if they want to have the foreign adoption order repeated by having an Irish adoption order also made.  Some couples end up having a recognised adoption order because, having adopted a child in Chile or Peru, they come back to Ireland and adopt here.  For many couples it is not possible to do that.</P>
    <P>We are the only country in Europe which has no legislation setting down the circumstances in which we will recognise a foreign adoption order.  A growing number of children adopted in foreign countries are living in Ireland in a legal twilight zone because Irish law does not recognise them as having any legal relationship with the parents by whom they have been adopted.  This matter will create a large number of problems in the future.  It is regrettable that the recommendation by the Review Committee on Adoption Services that legislation be enacted in this area is not dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A large number of other reforms are required in our adoption laws.  I have referred to a small number of those mentioned by the Review Committee and I urge the Minister to indicate when he <Col N="434" /> intends to provide comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Bill is before us.  Clearly there are problems which will have to be resolved to ensure that neither prospective adopters nor natural parents are put to unnecessary expense in seeking to process adoption applications.  I hope the Minister will consider seriously the comments I have made about the problems of expense and come back with amendments on Committee Stage, not merely to deal with adoptions under this Bill but also to deal with adoptions which run into trouble and require proceedings to be brought under the 1974 Act which can result in court contests between natural parents and prospective adopters in circumstances where the Adoption Board have not finalised the adoption process.</P>
    <P>If we can get this aspect of the Bill right, we will have done a good day's work in going some of the way to extending the possibility of adoption to those many children who are in foster care or residential care and have no prospect of again living with their parents.  Having enacted this Bill, we should not regard our work as having been completed in the area of adoption.  There is an urgent necessity to bring before this House comprehensive legislation to provide us with a modern adoption code to carry us into the next century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having sat through all of Deputy Shatter's speech, I extend my compliments on the very learned discourse he has given, drawing from his vast knowledge and experience.  It will prove a very valuable contribution to the debate on the necessary alterations in the adoption laws.  The House owes him a deep debt of gratitude for the interest and commitment he has shown over the years in seeking to bring about major change in legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome this Bill which gives legitimate children the hope of having a normal family life.  It has been a tragedy for many families that legislation of this nature was not on our Statute Book long before now.  All of us in our constituencies have knowledge of the trauma <Col N="435" /> suffered by foster parents and particularly by the children themselves in cases where close family bonds have been developed with foster parents, only to be shattered through lack of legislative support in certain deserving cases.  It is a tragedy that the 1,500 children in care in our institutions are denied the opportunity of forming a strong family bond with caring and concerned adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House on Second Stage because our views on the need for this legislation were put on record when Deputy Shatter's Private Members' Bill was discussed last year. Whatever about the delays which have occurred, it is appropriate to express appreciation to the Minister for coming forward with these proposals, as well as his predecessor, Deputy Desmond, who took the first initiative, and to Deputy Shatter.  Since this Bill will have general support in the House we may assume it will be passed.  It will be the first time we will have legislation which proposes to allow the adoption of legitimate children.</P>
    <P>I should strike a note of warning by saying that we are immediately confronted by constitutional problems.  Article 41 declares that the family have inalienable and imprescriptible rights.  In the Ryan <i>versus</i> the Attorney General case in 1965 Mr. Justice Kenny said that &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; means that which cannot be transferred or given away, while &ldquo;imprescriptible&rdquo; means that which cannot be lost or abandoned through non-exercise.  When this is coupled with the JH case in 1985 where the Supreme Court said that a legitimate child has a constitutional right to be with its parents, one can see the difficulties.  The major problem is that in the case of legitimate children the principal test applied by the courts is not what is in the best interests of the child, regardless of other considerations. They presume that the child's interests are best served by being in the custody of its parents, unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.</P>
    <P>This was illustrated by the JH case itself.  In that case an adoptive couple had <Col N="436" /> had custody of a child from the time it was one month old but the final adoption order was delayed by An Bord Uachtála for various reasons.  In the meantime the natural parents married, thus legitimating the child.  They then refused to given final consent to the adoption order and sought custody of the child in the High Court.  Mr. Justice Lynch refused to grant the natural parents custody, saying that it was in the best interests of the child that he remain with his adopters. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, saying that the now married parents had a <i>prima facie</i> right under Article 41 of the Constitution to custody, that one could not simply apply a &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; test in this sort of case and that only where one could show that this was an exceptional case within the meaning of Article 42.5 where the married parents had failed in their duties towards the child that they could be deprived of custody. The adopters had failed to prove or show that this was the case and the upshot was that a three-year-old child was transferred from its adopters to the married parents.</P>
    <P>That case shows there is a need to amend Article 41 to give greater protection to children's rights.  Their interests, be they legitimate or otherwise, should come first in all legal proceedings. This is the policy we in the Progressive Democrats are committed to.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the Bill, we believe it must be referred to the Supreme Court and we hope that when the President comes to consider it, if and when passed here, he will refer it to the Supreme Court because of the constitutional doubts about it.  One could not tolerate a situation where the Act would be struck down five years later.  That would cast doubt on the validity on all adoption orders made during that period.  Before this legislation is ever brought into operation it should be tested by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to enter certain reservations about some of the cumbersome legal requirements proposed in this Bill. Health boards will play a primary role in making application to the High Court for <Col N="437" /> authorisation for an adoption order to be made by the Adoption Board.  Experience has clearly shown that long delays occur in bringing cases to the High Court and in getting decisions from the High Court.  High Court proceedings involve enormous costs at times.  There is an urgent need for family courts.  I am anxious to emphasise and support the points made earlier by Deputy Shatter about the need for family courts.  The Minister can be quoted from references he made elsewhere that he too sees the need for family courts.  I am aware of proposals of that kind being made in this House over a period of 20 years but we are still without an adequate family court structure.  It is possible, within the existing legislative and constitutional requirements, to enact legislation establishing family courts.  The view has been expressed that it would be necessary to have a constitutional amendment for this purpose.  However, the Minister has not made any long reference to that today but he did so on other occasions.  I hope this is not something that the Minister is going to walk away from and just make passing references to when Bills of this nature are brought before the House.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the power to make adoption orders should be given to a special family court, a court that would have all the powers of the High Court but without the adversarial system and the trappings of a regular court.  It is also important that it would be staffed by judges with special expertise and training. This is one of the major difficulties that we see with this Bill.  Even though we welcome and support it, we recognise the difficulties that it will present when cases have to be brought to and contested in a High Court setting which is not at all suitable to deal with the type of matter that would be under discussion.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of that in considering the need for legislation in that area when discussing these matters with his colleagues.  It would be more appropriate for the Minister for Justice to bring forward that type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon quoted from his speech in Seanad Éireann in 1987 when <Col N="438" /> this Bill was being discussed there.  He said it would be preferable if we had a family court to deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with all aspects of proposed adoptions as it would avoid the need for cumbersome procedures, including the need for two applications as is envisaged in this legislation. There is no doubt &mdash; this is the view of the Adoptive Parents Association of Ireland and their legal advice &mdash; that the legal machinery that exists for High Court actions is totally inadequate in the adoption area as it lacks expertise and specialist training, it is too costly and it is subject to lengthy delays when hearing cases of this nature.  That is a fairly commonly held view across the board.  It is only the Government that can take action in that area and we appeal to them not to delay in doing so.</P>
    <P>A family court structure should now be established, according to the Adoptive Parents Association, even if this necessitates a constitutional amendment.  It is up to the Minister to fill us in on the advice he is getting in that regard.  We believe it is possible to establish a family court without having to have a constitutional referendum.  The Minister was asked by the Adoptive Parents Association to consider introducing a section in this Bill providing for the establishment of family courts or the hearing of adoption cases in family courts.  I do not know what response he has given to that request.  I would like, when the Minister is replying to this debate, if he would speak at some length on the prospects he sees for the introduction of a family court to deal with cases such as this and other similar cases in that area, as there is broad agreement on the necessity for such courts.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he referred to the question of costs that will be involved for applicants for adoption orders, costs which the natural parents might be involved in and the costs to the proposed adopting parents, the applicants.  The arrangements he has provided for are admirable except in one case, where the prospective adopting parents do not get the support of the health board in making the application to the High Court.  I understand that if they proceed to make <Col N="439" /> the application on their own and do not succeed they will have to carry the costs themselves.  If that is so it would be very unfair, particularly as we know that cases can be lost in court on mere technicalities. The courts often refuse cases before them but make recommendations for alterations in the law.  In other words, they agree with the principle that is being sought but the law does not provide for it.  The Minister has not given a full explanation to the House as to why he is excluding the cost to prospective adopting parents who proceed to make an application on their own for an order from the High Court.  Otherwise the proposal in the Bill is admirable and is a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>We note with interest the important role the Minister is giving the health boards in this area.  I presume that if legislation is introduced in future to alter the structure of health boards some suitable arrangement can be made to ensure that similar procedures apply.  Many Deputies in the House feel that there is need for fundamental change in regard to the existing services and structures of the health boards but that is a matter for another occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seek to ensure, either through a constitutional amendment or through legislation, that when the courts are considering adoption cases the interests and welfare of the child would at all times be paramount.  Whatever legislative measures have to be taken to bring that about should be taken. We are anxious that that be done and I appeal to the Minister to take action in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the difficulties that will arise with foreign adoption orders.  Many of us have experience of this from people in our constituencies who go abroad for a short period and adopt children in the countries that were mentioned, South America in particular. I know that people in my constituency have been in close contact with adoption authorities in that country.  Parents who have already entered into foreign adoption orders are concerned about the legal <Col N="440" /> relationship between them and their foreign-adopted children while living here in Ireland and the legal status of those children.  The Minister's Department are aware of this problem because a number of cases have been brought to their notice.  I would like the Minister to make some reference to that and to say whether it is proposed to introduce legislation to clear up many of the doubts and anomalies that exist in that area.  We welcome the Bill and look forward to a more detailed discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Bill has already been amended by the Seanad.  A very worthwhile debate has taken place in the Upper House on this legislation and I am very anxious that the Bill would become law as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>This Bill was published in 1987 and I hope it will be concluded before the recess.  Our strategy of care and intervention is aimed at the retention of the child in its natural family.  However, there will continue to be such children who will require to be separated from their parents.  Some of them will be placed with foster parents and circumstances will arise where integration with their natural families will neither be possible nor in the child's best interest. This legislation will permit their adoption by their foster parents in certain very restricted circumstances, so giving the child the opportunity of a stable, secure family upbringing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note what Deputies have said about the importance of ensuring the constitutionality of the Bill.  Under the Constitution, it is entirely a matter for the President to decide whether to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court for ruling as to its constitutionality.  It is not a matter <Col N="441" /> in which the Government can intervene. I want to make it quite clear that this is strictly a matter for the President who will be conscious of the contributions made in this House.  The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I are satisfied that, should this Bill be passed by the Oireachtas, and tested in the Supreme Court, there will be cogent and substantial grounds for arguing successfully in favour of its constitutionality. I want to emphasise that I would be very glad to see that confirmed by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the issue of further legislation in the area of adoption. We propose to bring forward a further adoption Bill in due course which is being worked on at the moment.  However, my first priority once the current Bill is passed is to press ahead with the major new child care Bill to update the present law relating to the care and protection of children.  After that, I would hope to bring forward a comprehensive adoption Bill relating to the reforms recommended in the report of the Adoption Review Committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised an issue which is dealt with in some detail in the report of the Adoption Review Committee, that is, the adopted person's right to know their background.  The Bill before us is confined to extending the categories of children eligible for adoption and I do not wish at this stage to broaden it.  The question raised by Deputy Shatter is a complex, sensitive issue about which there are strong conflicting views.  I intend to study this issue carefully and I hope to include a provision to deal with this area in the comprehensive adoption Bill which we will bring forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter requested that the age limit of adopters should not be inflexible. There is no statutory age limit for adopters, and it is not proposed to introduce one in this Bill.  Obviously this is an area in which there should be flexibility, particularly where older children are being adopted, which I hope would happen under this legislation.  However, the practice at present is that persons selected as adoptive parents should not be older than the generality of parents of <Col N="442" /> other young children.  The lowering of the age limit is a very interesting point and is one my officials will look at.</P>
    <P>Under this policy younger adoptive parents, under 40 years of age, are favoured but this policy does not rule out a different approach in exceptional circumstances. I am most anxious that in all aspects of adoption there should be as much flexibility as possible while maintaining certain guiding principles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the cumbersome procedures whereby foster parents must request the health boards to make an application on their behalf to the High Court.  It was necessary to include such a provision because in the majority of cases children have been placed in foster care by health boards in the first instance.  The health boards have statutory responsibility for these children. As our child care services develop and with the updating of our child care laws, I hope the increasing trend towards placement in foster care rather than in children's residential homes will continue. Health boards should be involved in placement and in overseeing the welfare of children in foster care.  I expect there will be a higher level of co-operation between the health boards and foster parents in preparing applications to the High Court under the proposed legislation.  I should say at this stage that adoptive parents are providing an excellent service for the State by ensuring that these children are not put into institutions.</P>
    <P>The board will have knowledge of the natural parents, whose rights we must not overlook, as well as the child and the foster parents, and the board will be in a position to advise foster parents as appropriate. Deputy Shatter mentioned the fact that in the event of foster parents taking an application to the High Court and being unsuccesful, the cost will not be met by the State.  If foster parents take a case to the High Court it means the health board have declined or failed to make an application to the High Court on their behalf.  I expect the boards's decision will have been taken on the basis of information available which would <Col N="443" /> suggest that the application would not be in the best interests of the child.  In the interests of all concerned &mdash; and here again I would ask the House to have regard to the rights of the natural parents &mdash; there should be some disincentive to inappropriate applications to the court.</P>

      <P>I strongly recommend the speedy passage of this legislation which has been debated at length in the Upper House.  It is very important that the Bill be brought for signature and decision by the President as quickly as possible.  I have taken note of the points raised by Deputy Molloy which we will deal with again.  I would be willing to look at amendments on Committee Stage if they improve the Bill, but I must stress that the scope for major amendments may be very limited in the light of the serious constitutional issues which underpin the main provisions of the Bill.  There are a number of other areas which need to be reformed but which would be more appropriate to the next adoption Bill.  However, I will be giving them full consideration and I will bear in mind the comments that have been made on this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for granting me permission to raise what I believe is a very important matter, one Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Sherlock and I tried to have discussed on some basis within the order of the House on a number of occasions, and I welcome the opportunity to do so this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horrific proportions and dimension of what is happening in Palestine and the occupied territories at the moment are brought home by the very sad press reports of a recent incident where it was recounted that a young Palestinian was <Col N="445" /> shot dead by a member of the Israeli security forces on the basis that he had attacked with his bare hands that member of the security forces in the process of an arrest.  It in some way helps to measure the balance of forces, of interests and of might that exists in this struggle that, on the one hand, the right of life seems to have been reduced to nothing and, on the other, an unarmed civilian who struggles with or attacks&mdash;whatever the word is&mdash; a heavily armed member of the security forces can be put to death as a consequence.</P>
    <P>What is happening on a daily basis in the occupied territories is inevitable, if one considers the context in which the situation has exploded.  Since the assumption of authority and jurisdiction by the Israeli State of these territories, the regime has been one of severe repression and steel-handedness.  The regime is one that recognises virtually no civil law and is dominated by the role of military order and edict.  Each area of the occupied territories is divided by the Israeli administration into districts or areas ruled over or dominated by a military officer-of-command. That man, or indeed woman as the case may be, can issue edicts&mdash;and does on a regular basis&mdash;that dominate throughout the civil life of the indigenous inhabitants.  The civil historical administration of the Palestinians has been effectively set at nought.</P>
    <P>In October 1980, in association with and on behalf of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Brussels, I spent over a week visiting the various areas in the occupied territories and prepared a detailed report, along with a member of the Supreme Court Judiciary in Italy and a legal academic from France. In discussions with Deputy Sherlock on his recent return from visits to the same areas and considering the daily reports, little has changed, but if there has been change it has been in the direction of increased repression and disregard for the civil order of things and, indeed, for life itself.</P>
    <P>One must consider the degree of interference that exists and has led to the resentment and uprising, as it is so rightly <Col N="446" /> called.  The land traditionally owned and occupied by the Palestinians has been systematically assumed, taken over and occupied on a daily, ongoing basis.  The system of colonisation is one on almost paramilitary lines.  It is a system of fortification using civilian members of the Israeli population who are moved into strategically built hamlets, heavily armed though not necessarily active members of the Israeli armed forces.  People who look at press reports and photographs are often at a loss to understand how one can see a school child or teenager going to school carrying what looks like very awesome weaponry.  It is a phenomenon of Israeli colonists moving into territories of great hostility, who enforce or maintain their existence there literally at the end of the barrel of a gun.  There is a plan of colonisation with the intention, ultimately, of controlling every square inch of the occupied territories which has gone on unabated.</P>
    <P>Academic life and school life are supervised by military edict.  Curricula in the schools are vetted and controlled.  The presence of armed forces in Bir Zeit University is a daily occurrence.  The dismissal or employment of the academics in the universities is, again, subject to military edict.  The daily newspapers must be submitted in advance to the military controller in the region for clearance before they can put to print and the papers sold.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the economy of the Palestinian people has been entirely eroded.  Labour and trade union rights are non-existent.  One of the most disturbing social disruptions and resentments that exist is the degree to which labour has been forced out of its traditional employments and obliged on a daily basis to travel long distances to work on developed farms and in factories inside Israeli territory, as opposed to any serious economic investment in development of the Palestinian lands.  I have an abiding memory of one evening at about 5 o'clock during my visit, speaking with the local majors or representatives in a provincial town in the Palestinian area of Ramala.  The buses from the Israeli side were coming in convoy and disgorging <Col N="447" /> hundreds of Palestinians who had to dash on to district buses and find their way home.  I was told that they were engaged in a journey of upwards of two hours to and from work every day.  That was four hours of the working day spent in searching out employment and travelling to and from work.  All this has led to the inevitable consequence of the turmoil that exists.  While I have sought to paint what is clearly a one-sided perspective of the situation, a side that I know of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That brings me to a matter which must clearly be of much concern to all of us in this House and, in particular, a matter for the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and that is how best we, as Irish people and as parliamentarians, can address ourselves to contributing to the solution, or assisting on contributing to the solution, of what must be solved. With regard to conflict anywhere in the world, we cannot be seen to stand idly by and take firm or blinkered lines, from whatever side or aspect we seek to address it.  There must be negotiations and discussions which must involve all parties and sides concerned.  One of the major stumbling blocks in progress is the position attributed, or sought to be attributed, to the legitimate representatives <Col N="448" /> of the Palestinian people in the form of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.</P>
      <P>In the brief contribution which I seek to make here tonight and in the few moments remaining to me, I wish to urge upon the Irish Government to continue their efforts in pursuing a solution based on peace, based on talks seeking out a peaceful solution and, as a natural consequence, based on a recognition of the position that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation represent within the context of the Palestinian people, within the context of the international recognition afforded to that organisation by the United Nations and recognising that it is only in talks involving them and the legitimate representatives of the Israeli people that we can begin to collect together those interests that are directly concerned and can offer a peaceful, worthwhile and lasting solution to the Middle East.  Peaceful negotiation and co-existence are paramount to the mandate which the Palestine Liberation Organisation have been given by the Palestinian people.  I ask all concerned to recognise that fact and to use it as a basis for making some progress in achieving a solution to this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail myself of the opportunity to reiterate to the House the Government's continuing concern at events in the occupied territories.  The Government's position in this regard is clearly on the record <Col N="449" /> and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear in the Dáil and Seanad on several occasions since the outbreak of the present disturbances the importance which we attach to matters affecting the rights of the population of the territories.</P>
      <P>The Government have followed with a profound and deepening sense of concern the tragic catalogue of violence which has continued now for over five months.  The death toll rises almost daily and to date over 180 Palestinians have lost their lives and countless more have been injured in violent confrontation with the Israeli security forces.  The harsh and repressive response of the security forces has presented us with a sad and depressing series of human rights abuses against the population of the territories.  There is a widespread sense of outrage at the harsh methods of riot control and maintenance of public orders marked by excessive violence and acts of brutality against individuals.</P>
      <P>The climate of violence which has led to the tragic events of recent months on the West Bank and in Gaza is directly attributable to the longstanding and deep-rooted sense of frustration and anger felt by the vast majority of Palestinians with the occupation of the territories which now continues for over 20 years and with the resultant harsh security measures imposed by the Israeli authorities.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position on Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied territories is clearly on the record.  We have consistently spoken out at the United Nations, at the UN Human Rights Commission and elsewhere in defence of the rights of the Palestinian population and have been actively involved in measures to contribute to the economic and social development of the territories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also repeatedly and firmly expressed our profound concern at the severe and repressive nature of Israeli security measures in the territories.  Practices such as administrative detention without charge or trial, the imposition of collective punishments, the forced closure of academic institutions, including the University of Bethlehem with which <Col N="450" /> UCD has established strong links, the demolition of homes, deportation and the long and depressing list of human rights violations inevitably create and sustain the conditions which produced the violence of recent weeks in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and The Golan Heights.</P>
    <P>We are also of the firm opinion that the 1949 Geneva Convention which sets out the rules for the treatment of civilians in time of war is applicable to the population of the territories.  This Convention lays down the civilian population's entitlement to safety and protection.  It specifies that protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices and their manners and customs. It states that at all times civilian persons shall be humanely treated and shall be protected against all acts of violence or threats thereof.  We have called on Israel to accept the <i>de jure</i> applicability of this Convention and to modify its practices to comply with its terms.  This is a view shared by the vast majority of the international community.</P>
    <P>A basic principle underlying Ireland's approach is the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force.  A military occupation is temporary and cannot confer upon the occupying power rights of annexation or disposal.  For this reason we have vigorously opposed the policy pursued by Israel of opening new settlements in the occupied territories.  We consider that every new and every existing settlement is in violation of international law and we have repeatedly called on the Israeli Government to end this illegal policy.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated to the House our concern at recent events has been conveyed to the Israeli authorities in the course of a number of bilateral contacts in Dublin and Tel Aviv since the beginning of the present unrest.</P>
    <P>In addition in the framework of European Political Cooperation the Twelve have made clear to the Israeli authorities our shared concern for the population of <Col N="451" /> the occupied territories.  On two occasions since the outbreak of the present violence, the Presidency's Ambassador in Tel Aviv has expressed to the Israeli authorities the views of the Twelve at the rapidly and seriously deteriorating situation and urgently called on the Israeli authorities to ensure the immediate protection of the inhabitants of the area.</P>
    <P>At a meeting which I attended in Bonn on 8 February the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve had a thorough discussion on the situation.  The Declaration which they adopted expressed their profound concern at conditions in the occupied territories and their conviction that the <i>status quo</i> in the territories was not sustainable. They deeply deplored the repressive measures taken by Israel which are in violation of international law and human rights and called for the cessation of such measures.</P>
    <P>Subsequently on 15 April, the Twelve again addressed the situation in a statement which expressed their concern at the effect of recent Israeli actions in deepening mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians and making a peaceful settlement in the region harder to find.  This most recent statement of concern by the Twelve, a copy of which I have arranged to have deposited in the Library, deplored the deportation policy pursued by the Israeli authorities and other repressive measures including the destruction of houses, which are clearly in breach of international law.  The Twelve furthermore expressed their regret at the Israeli decision of 30 March to close the Palestinian Press Service which had been an important source of information for those concerned with developments in the territories.</P>
    <P>The disturbances have brought home once again the urgent necessity of seeking a political solution to the conflict so that progress can be made towards the achievement of a just, comprehensive and peaceful solution.  The two essential elements in our approach are (1) the right of the State of Israel to exist within secure <Col N="452" /> frontiers and (2) the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination with all that implies.</P>
    <P>I welcome in this connection the efforts by US Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz, to establish a basis for negotiation between the parties directly concerned.  We are of the view that the solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the present disturbances in the occupied territories, is by means of a comprehensive, just and lasting political settlement in accordance with the 1980 Venice Declaration and subsequent Twelve Declarations.</P>
    <P>At their meeting in Bonn on 8 February the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve reaffirmed Twelve support for the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations as the suitable framework for negotiations between the parties directly concerned. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear on a number of occasions Ireland's commitment to the convening of such a conference under UN auspices with the participation of the parties concerned and of any party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development.  We believe that the Palestinians and the PLO must be associated with any negotiations for a comprehensive settlement.  Successive Irish Governments have recognised the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that the Government will continue to follow closely developments in the occupied territories. The current tragic situation underlines in a direct and telling way the need for all concerned to redouble their efforts to find a just, comprehensive and peaceful solution.  We will continue to work bilaterally and through the Twelve to ensure that the momentum is maintained toward achievement of this objective as the only certain way of ending the cycle of repression and violence which for so long has characterised the lives of those Palestinians living in the occupied territories.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 27 May 1988.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to estimate either the likely take-up under the part-time job incentive scheme or the resultant savings.

      <P>Applicants for maternity benefit under the general maternity benefit scheme are required to satisfy certain contribution conditions in order to qualify for payment.  These conditions require a person to have at least 39 paid contributions since entry into insurance and also to have a minimum of 39 paid or credited contributions in the last complete income tax year before the year in which the maternity claim commences. At least 13 of these must be paid contributions.

It is also available to persons under 66 who are in receipt of an Irish invalidity pension or disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is only payable to persons who have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and are permanently incapacitated.  UK invalidity pension is payable after 28 weeks and is not subject to a requirement that the person be permanently incapacitated.  No scheme exists in the United Kingdom which is similar to the free electricity allowance scheme in this country and the question of reciprocity does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are about 3,300 United Kingdom invalidity pensioners in this country and the cost of extending the free electricity allowance to them is estimated at £0.4 million.

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="413" /> Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) on the plight of 4,000 to 5,000 long term unemployed who did not receive the announced Christmas bonus; the reason they did not receive the bonus; the steps which were taken in cases of individual hardship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>As part of my commitment to helping those who have to rely on social welfare payments I arranged to pay a Christmas bonus last year to all long term social welfare recipients, including those on long term unemployment payments.  This decision, taken in spite of the difficult financial situation, was in recognition of the extra financial commitments which arise at Christmas.  Statutory Instrument No. 293 of 1987 provided for the bonus to be paid to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate on any day in the unemployment week ended Tuesday, 1 December 1987.  The bonus payable amounted to 65 per cent of the weekly payment.  The regulations applied to social welfare payments only and did not provide for payment of a bonus to persons engaged on training courses with FÁS, this being a matter for the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>Subsequently an administrative decision was taken by the Department of Labour, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, to pay certain trainees of FÁS a bonus similar to the one paid by my Department.  The announcement regarding payment of a Christmas bonus for trainees was made in a press release issued by the Minister for Labour on 25 November 1987.  My Department in their advertisement in the national newspapers on 29 November 1987 based their information on the contents of the press release from the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement in this advertisement was that the bonus would be paid to all AnCO and CERT trainees who would otherwise have qualified for a bonus payment had they remained unemployed. <Col N="414" /> This gave rise to certain queries, and in an effort to clear up any possible misunderstanding the Minister for Labour issued a further statement on 11 December 1987 clarifying the position in that only trainees who had commenced their courses since 17 August 1987, and who had immediately before the course been in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance, would qualify for the bonus.  The minimum allowance payable to these trainees was linked to the unemployment assistance rate rather than the unemployment benefit rate as in the case of those who commenced their training prior to 17 August 1987.  It was not considered necessary or appropriate to insert a further advertisement by my Department following the latter statement by the Minister for Labour, because the payment of a bonus to AnCO trainees was not the responsibility of my Department.</P>
    <P>In accordance with legislation, the higher, long term rate of unemployment assistance can only be paid to those persons who have been in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for a total of 390 days in any continuous period of unemployment. The newspaper article referred to by the Deputy incorrectly stated that some long term unemployment assistance recipients failed to qualify for the bonus because their claims had been broken when they participated in a course with FÁS.</P>
    <P>This in fact is incorrect.  Under current legislation a person in receipt of long term unemployment assistance who participates in a FÁS training course for a period of up to one year, requalifies at the long term rate on re-applying for unemployment assistance within 20 weeks of the end of the course.  Such applicants, if on the long term rate between 25 November and 1 December 1987, would have received payment of the 65 per cent bonus.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A working widow in receipt of widow's contributory pension is not liable for the employee's PRSI contribution. She is, however, covered by the social insurance system and her employer is liable for his share of the contribution.  If she is insured at the standard rate contributions paid in respect of her are reckonable for old age contributory pension purposes and, subject to satisfying the contribution conditions, she could opt for old age pension at age 66.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer and her husband are taxed on the aggregation basis in accordance with section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Both are in receipt of social welfare pensions which are paid gross.  It is standard practice to allocate tax-free allowances in priority against social welfare pensions thus reducing the tax-free allowances available for set off against other income. In this case the tax-free allowances are further reduced by the amount necessary to cover the husband's second pension. The balance of tax-free allowances has been allocated to the named taxpayer for use in applying PAYE to her earnings. The excess of her earnings over this balance of allowances is correctly taxable at 35 per cent and it is confirmed that the correct amount of tax is being deducted.</P>

      <P>The position is that a small amount of money was withheld in respect of an extension to Clareen National School, Birr, County Offaly.  Some of this money was withheld because the work did not comply with my Department's specifications while the remainder related to works which were not eligible for grant-aid.  The school authorities have been informed that no further payments will be made in this case.</P>
