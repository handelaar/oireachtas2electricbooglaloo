    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the sequence of steps which he envisages as necessary to secure his reported objective of a unitary State on this island; and the role he sees for the Anglo-Irish Agreement in this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 5.7 of the report of the New Ireland Forum, which was endorsed by all the parties participating, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular structure of political unity which the Forum would wish to <Col N="2" /> see established is a unitary state, achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the nationalist and unionist identities.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, at Question Time, to attempt to set out any exhaustive set of steps towards achievement of the form of unity wished for by the parties to the Forum, except to say that such measures would in my view have to meet the requirements set out in chapter 5 of the Forum report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> These requirements would, among others, include:</P>
    <P>a total cessation of violence which can have no place in the building of the Ireland of the future that we all desire;</P>
    <P>constructive dialogue with Unionists in Northern Ireland;</P>
    <P>accommodation of the two traditions, their aspirations and their loyalties;</P>
    <P>an all-round constitutional conference to formulate new structures.</P>
    <P>This Government's policy and actions under the Anglo-Irish Agreement are in accordance with those requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that his quotation from the New Ireland Forum report has been only partial? I know he cannot quote all of chapter 5.  Would he not also agree that the specifications set out in article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement are perfectly compatible with that wish expressed in the Forum report?  Would he not further agree, therefore, that the very objectives set out in article 1 of the agreement are perfectly consistent with working towards the objective of a unitary State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The article in question is subject to different interpretations, perhaps more of emphasis than anything else.  Basically I would not disagree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case, would the Taoiseach not agree that suggestions that we should pursue a path that is aside or separate from the Anglo-Irish Agreement at this stage would be counterproductive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The Deputy would have to advert to the fact that representatives of the Unionist traditions are not prepared to accept the processes of the Anglo-Irish Agreement at this stage at any rate.  Therefore, if we want to have dialogue with them in any shape or form or in any context, it would have to be outside the process of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in parallel <Col N="4" /> with it, but certainly not in contradiction to it.  I agree with the Deputy on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that first of all the existence of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in itself objectively has been the only factor that has brought about a degree of movement in terms of the Unionist political position? Would he not also agree that, even though the processes of the agreement as they are now known and regarded by the Unionists might not be acceptable, certain other processes and objectives to which he has himself referred are not looked upon with any great enthusiasm by the Unionist tradition in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I do not think the Deputy would push the matter so far as to say that we should not have any dialogue with any representative of the Unionist tradition outside the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That would be an unnecessarily restrictive position to adopt.  It would have to be done without taking from the processes of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach mentioned that respect for the aspirations of both communities is fundamental to the New Ireland report, could he indicate any acts done by his Government during the past 12 months working in that direction to show respect for the aspirations of the Unionist community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the most recent one is my invitation to representatives of the Unionist tradition to let me know what their concerns are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that I do not wish to push certain arguments, all the more so since the scope of my questions to the Taoiseach has been very substantially restricted by the Ceann Comhairle in disallowing three other questions I had put down.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the business of dialogue with representatives of the <Col N="5" /> Unionist parties and the Unionist tradition, necessary as it is, which must for the moment be carried on outside the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement should not in any way put in jeopardy the objectives of the agreement itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that any dialogue of the kind we would all wish to take place can and should take place without taking from the Anglo-Irish Agreement processes in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Deputy Cooney for a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put a brief supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dwelt rather long on this Question but I will allow Deputy Barry to put a brief supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see the Anglo-Irish Agreement as an impediment to dialogue with Unionists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time the Taoiseach has referred in the House to his invitation to the Unionists to come and discuss with him whatever problems they have.  Has he formally put this to them or is this invitation just a response to a journalist's question at a news conference about a month or five weeks ago? Has he used the channels available to him to issue a formal invitation to Unionists to come to see him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with that matter several times in this House.  The Deputy is not being very accurate or fair in saying that in issuing this invitation I was only responding to journalists.  I issued the invitation at the most important platform available to me from the point of view of my party, that is our Ard Fheis, which was given full publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="6" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach also referred to it prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequently I elaborated on it in this House.  It was not just a reply to journalists' questions.  I also indicated that in my judgment at this stage I would prefer to leave it at that rather than take the step of issuing some sort of formal invitation which might not be the best step to take at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is in favour of having talks with Sinn Féin leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only circumstances in which talks with Sinn Féin could be contemplated by an Irish Government would be if they rejected violence and accepted that constitutional politics are the only legitimate way to achieve economic, social and political objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not hear the beginning of that reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only circumstances in which talks with Sinn Féin could be contemplated by an Irish Government would be if they rejected violence and accepted that constitutional politics are the only legitimate way to achieve economic, social and political objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is prompted by a report which was attributed to the Taoiseach in America in which he said he welcomed the talks between the SDLP <Col N="7" /> and Sinn Féin.  As Sinn Féin are a Thirty-two county party I was wondering if he would extend his viewpoint by initiating discussions with Sinn Féin in an effort to persuade them to do exactly what he has said in his reply and, that is, to discontinue violence.  Would the Taoiseach consider it in that light?  Is it true that the Taoiseach welcomed the talks between the SDLP and Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not know to what the Deputy is referring.  I do not know if I ever used those words.  What I have said about the talks between the SDLP and Sinn Féin is that I accept John Hume's judgement and assessment of that situation and if he believes that something worthwhile or beneficial particularly from the point of view of the cessation of violence can be achieved, I would be prepared to accept his judgement in the matter.  That is as far as I have ever gone on that issue.  The Deputy would have to understand that there would be a very great difference between John Hume as the leader of a political party in Northern Ireland having conversations and the Irish Government, as a sovereign Government, having the same type of conversations.  There is an enormous difference between those two processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach exclude any consideration of having talks <Col N="8" /> with Sinn Féin until they repudiate violence completely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The offer made to the Unionists in conjunction with the talks which have taken place between the SDLP and Sinn Féin seem to indicate that there is a contradiction or a certain void where the supporters of the political organisation of Sinn Féin are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to advert to a very clear distinction and that is that my invitation or, indeed, the invitation of any of the major parties in the Republic, to a representative Unionist tradition would be to representatives of constitutional political Unionist parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained in reply to previous questions on this matter on 24 November last, the question of compensation for the former employees raises complex and sensitive legal issues which require the most careful consideration.  I expect to have examination of the issues completed and conclusions brought to the Government for consideration shortly.  The Minister met representatives of the former employees on a number of occasions, the most recent being on 25 September last when he met them together with the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>The estimated total cost to the State of the liquidation of Irish Shipping is £51 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister, Deputy Wilson, left the House just as this question was being taken. Does the Minister of State recall that a similar answer was given this time 12 months ago, that this would be resolved in a reasonable time?  In November of 1987 we were told it would be resolved in due course and now the Minister says <Col N="12" /> it will be resolved shortly.  This has been going on since 1985.  Employees are still without compensation and many are still without their wages and living in poverty. Could the Minister tell us precisely what is the reason for the delay?  When will they get their due moneys paid to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a complex and sensitive issue.  If the Deputy wants a definitive answer, it is easy to say that it cannot be done.  We are doing something which is a lot more difficult.  We fully appreciate the dilemma in which the Irish Shipping workers find themselves and we are trying to establish if there is any possible solution to this problem which does not expose the State to the level of liability which I referred to in answering questions in the past.  At that time we referred to something like £200 million if we deviate from the statutory regulations which are there.</P>
      <P>To date we have been unsuccessful in finding a mechanism to achieve this objective but I am certainly not reluctant to keep on trying.  I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made to bring this matter to a conclusion.  I expect to have this examination of the issues completed and the conclusion brought to the Government within a short period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter part of the Minister's reply really worries me. The Minister now indicates that he has got no further along the road to solving these very complex problems than he had three years ago.  Yet the Minister is able to say that he hopes to have it resolved shortly.  Can the Minister explain that?  If the matter is so complex that they cannot find a solution and he is working on it and trying to do that, how can he expect to resolve the matter shortly?  I cannot follow that line of reasoning.  Surely if there are complex legal problems the Minister should either be thinking of legislation to overcome those problems or some system such as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment which would not be covered in the legislation that he was talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State and I in the past year visited all the regional fishery boards and have had discussions with them on a number of issues covering the whole area of inland fisheries, including administrative structure, financing and other related issues.  As the Deputy will be well aware, some of these are very complex and complicated issues and naturally there would be widespread differences of opinion in different areas and between members and individuals.  Overall, we have had very good co-operation from both the members of the boards and the staff associations and personnel with whom we have had discussions also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Minister that this is a complex area.  It is so complex, in fact, that selective members of fishery boards appear to be involved in discussions and some others are not.  The Government appear to be talking to two different types of fishery board.  Would the Minister not agree that the regional fishery boards are in disarray? They do not know what is going on and are very concerned about the position. This is adding further problems to the whole operation of the regional fisheries and how the boards are to carry out their duties.  A decision must be arrived at very quickly.  Statements have been made for far too long that the position is under review and discussion.  Answers are now needed.  How soon will the Minister be able to put everything into perspective as to what direction he will take?</P>

I would hope we would be in a position shortly to submit a memo for Government decision detailing the changes, after having the <Col N="19" /> most comprehensive discussions and dialogue with the various interests involved &mdash; I would say in the next week to ten days.  The Government will make the decisions.  Part of the difficulty in this area is that some of the issues may need legislation to deal effectively with the present situation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that, apart from the cash crisis facing the regional fisheries boards, their uncertain future is having a devastating effect on morale?  Last December, the Minister used the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; when questioned on this very point.  He has used it again today.  Can he be more explicit as to what he understands the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; to mean in this case?  Can he give us some guarantee as to when he will be back before this House detailing his plans for the central fishery board and the regional fishery boards?  Can the Minister guarantee that if there are to be changes &mdash; and he intimated last autumn that there would be changes &mdash; whatever structures are put in place will represent all fishing interests and all fishing groups throughout the country, that they will have a vehicle through which their voices can be heard?  Has he made a decision with regard to An Bord Iascaigh Intíre?</P>

      <P>If there has been any undue delay in the finalisation and bringing forward of proposals, it is because we undertook this fairly extensive dialogue and communication with the various interests involved, the central fishery board, the staff associations and the various regional fishery boards.  In formulating the decision, we also have to bear in mind the lack of a proper forum for responsible organisations to express their points of view on various issues if they have them to express.  All discussions and dialogue by the Minister of State and myself with the various regional boards and the central authority, the present central fishery board, and all communication with them are in sharp contrast with the attitude adopted by the previous Government who abolished the central fishery board <Col N="20" /> without any consultation, without making any arrangements as to how the work would be undertaken, or without reaching any decision about how the people involved in that work would be redeployed or dealt with.  We have adopted a different course of action which may necessitate some delay but which is far superior to the ham-fisted action of the previous Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the action he proposes to take on the Salmon Review Group report, as the date for submissions on the report has passed; if a report on the submissions of the report will now be published; who will implement the recommendations of the report; and when they will be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have accepted the objectives recommended in the Salmon Review Group report.  I am of the opinion that they will <Col N="21" /> form a firm foundation on which to build the future of the salmon fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I extended the latest date for receipt of submissions on the report to 31 March 1988 and, indeed, submissions have continued to flow in right up to the present. I do not consider a report on these submissions to be necessary.  I may, of course, advert to key points made in submissions as announcements are made on an ongoing basis regarding the implementation of specific measures recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>When I have completed my examination of the views expressed in these submissions I will arrange for the implementation by my Department at the earliest possible date of those recommendations in the report which I consider will best achieve the objectives I have adopted.</P>
    <P>I have accepted in principle the introduction of a tagging and quotas system for dead salmon which is one of the alternative conservation measures recommended by the group.  My Department are at present formulating detailed arrangements for its early introduction following consultation with all relevant interests.  These arrangements include the fixing and distribution of quotas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is again formulating opinions or reviewing things. Will the tagging system for salmon be introduced this year; what arrangements has the Minister made to have it introduced, and what procedures is he following? Since I came into the House I have heard the Salmon Review Group report being referred to to cover a multitude of everything.  What are the specifics? The season is upon us again.  Is it going to happen and, if so, what arrangements have been made to ensure that it works efficiently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not been hearing about the Salmon Review Group report since he came into this House.  We got the report on 20 October 1987 and we indicated that there have been many <Col N="22" /> requests from interested bodies and fishermen that they should get an opportunity to study the report in detail before any firm decisions are made on the report.  We expected to have the final views and opinions by the end of February. I extended that date to end of March this year to facilitate responsible people and organisations who sought time to make submissions.  Many decisions are involved in this, decisions which will affect the fishing industry, traditional salmon fishing and the livelihoods of many.  These people have a legitimate point of view to which we have an obligation to listen and we have an obligation to take their views into account in making a final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably accept that the cynics have been saying that the extension date for submissions on the report was to ensure that nothing would have to be done on the report this year.  I do not accept that.  I take what the Minister says in good faith, but we may as well face up to the fact that that is what the public think has been happening. On the tagging and quota system, who will decide what quotas individual fishermen will get?  The system will not be in place for 1988.  The Minister can be categorical about that and let us be frank with one another.  Can the Minister guarantee that it will be up and running for 1989?  Who will be making the all important decisions on quotas?  How long will the Minister let the tagging and quota system run in terms of years, before he will assess whether it has been successful in controlling the illegal intercepting at sea of salmon?</P>

      <P>We discussed that issue, Deputy.  These people asked at that time that the date for submissions be extended.  I have subsequent requests from other bodies and people who wish to express a point of view about this.  We are still receiving submissions.  In relation to the quota and tagging system, any new system will have to be carefully studied in advance of bringing it into operation. The worst possible thing we could do, as the Deputy will agree, is to rush a system in which might be difficult to operate and which might break down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to have discussions with the various interests involved before embarking on a course of action.  How long the quota and tagging system remains is a matter which will have to be decided on the basis of the experience when the system begins to operate.  It will have to be long enough to deal with the deteriorating stocks of salmon.  Whatever system that is put in place must be capable of being fully implemented.  It will have to remain in operation until we can be satisfied that there is a positive result in terms of an improvement in salmon stocks.</P>

      <P>I have no plans for the development of amenities in the Dublin Port area.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board have applied to me for a harbour works order to reclaim approximately 21 hectares, about 52 acres of foreshore east of the Sealink freight terminal to construct a 550 metre quay on the river side of the reclaimed area and to provide associated ancillary facilities such as roads and lighting. An earlier application to reclaim approximately 38 hectares, subsequently reduced to 32 hectares, has been withdrawn by the board.</P>
      <P>Notice of the proposed order was published by the board in the national press on 22 April, 1988, as required by harbours legislation and 21 days have been allowed for receipt of objections or representations. In arriving at my decision on the board's application, I am obliged to take into account any such representations made to me by interested parties.  I have consulted the Minister for the Environment and the local authority whose views I will also take into account.</P>

    <P>The duration of the lease will be 30 years.  The capital assets associated with the lease would in the normal course revert to the State, unless there is a decision at that time to continue the lease.</P>
    <P>As is normal in a State lease, there will be a clause requiring the developer to obtain all necessary permissions, and prohibiting the developer from proceeding with any part of the development for which such permissions have not been obtained.</P>
    <P>A technical liaison committee will be established to oversee the development and to ensure that adequate provision is made for access in all its aspects and for protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>As regards access, there will be a clause in the lease to ensure that adequate access be provided to the piers, the slipways, and all harbour areas.  The precise details of the security arrangements that will be required by the developers to protect the boats in the marina will be overseen by the technical committee. However, these arrangements will not involve the fencing off of part of the harbour in a way that will affect existing public access.</P>
    <P>There will be a clause in the lease to ensure the protection of the environment. In particular, berth holders will be prohibited from discharging sewage from their craft within the harbour area. Water quality will be monitored continually and regular reports will be made to me.</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed that the Private Notice Question in the <Col N="30" /> names of Deputy Barry Desmond and I was disallowed and I would like now to raise some of the issues mentioned in that question with the Minister.  First of all, can he tell us when he expects the contract and lease for the marina development to be signed?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the so-called directors are at present negotiating with interested parties in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and making arrangements with them at a time when no contract has been signed with the State?  Surely, this undermines the position of the marina generally.  Let me also raise an ancillary matter, a matter of great concern to interested bodies and third parties in Dún Laoghaire, and that is the fact that no planning permission will be required for phase one of the development, a floating marina on the sea.  Before the contract is signed, will the Minister consider what was done in the case of the Dublin Gas contract which is imposing a contractual obligation on the developers to go through the normal planning process?  I understand the Minister has the power to do this and it has already been done in the case of the building of caverns in Dublin Bay.</P>

In fact, there is adequate scope for many more such developments and any proposal of that nature will be examined by us.  All the various views will be taken into account.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, a matter arose today which has a connection with disagreements we had in the House last week.  I had a question down to the Taoiseach today, part of which you ruled out of order on the basis that the matter is <i>sub judice.</i> I am not disputing your interpretation of precedent but it seems that again that matter indicates that we need to look again at how we approach that rule.  You allowed me &mdash;<Col N="123" /> and I am very grateful to you for having given me the opportunity &mdash; to ask a question of the Taoiseach about the very same Anglo-Irish Agreement, but because it happened to have a connection with a different aspect of the agreement you, a Cheann Comhairle, were apparently able to decide that it was not <i>sub judice.</i> I submit that that puts this House in an absolutely unendurable position, where not only do we have to tailor our questions to get the answers we need, and we all do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>1.  &mdash;As respects the year 1988-89 and subsequent years of assessment, the Finance Act, 1980, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in subsection (2) of section 1, by the substitution of &ldquo;£5,830&rdquo; for &ldquo;£5,300&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985), and of &ldquo;£2,915&rdquo; for &ldquo;£2,650&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985), and</P>

      <P>(2) In this section &ldquo;the specified amount&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) in a case where the individual would, apart from this section, be entitled to a <Col N="133" /> deduction specified in section 138 (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, £5,830, and</P>

    <P>Provided that, if at any time during the year of assessment either the individual or his spouse was of the age of seventy-five years or upwards, &ldquo;the specified amount&rdquo; means £8,085;</P>
    <P>(b) in any other case, £3,465;</P>
    <P>Provided that, if any any time during the year of assessment the individual was of the age of seventy-five years or upwards, &ldquo;the specified amount&rdquo; means £4,042.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with income tax allowances.  In my contribution on Second Stage I made it clear that The Workers' Party were most dissatisfied, once again, at the lack of any attempt to reform the overall tax code.  I pointed out then, and reiterate, that tax changes &mdash; of which there have been many since the famous tax marches of March 1980 &mdash; do not amount to tax reform.  The tax changes proposed in this latest budget give no indication whatsoever of tax reform.  In fact, the PAYE taxpayer today pays more than he or she did at the time of those tax marches.  At that time PAYE taxpayers were paying 87 per cent of all income tax whereas now they pay in excess of 90 per cent.  Therefore, it will be seen that their position has worsened, that they still pay the greatest amount and there is no indication of any attempt to effect any substantial change in that respect.</P>
    <P>The reliefs allowed under the provisions of this latest budget will not reduce the total tax take from those PAYE taxpayers. In referring to the need for a cut in the take from the PAYE taxpayers, I wish to make it clear once again that we do not mean a cut in the total tax take.  We do not believe that we as a nation are overtaxed but we do believe that workers are overtaxed.  As <Col N="134" /> the Minister has admitted and as international reports have made clear, in comparison to other European countries and most western States, we pay the lowest amount in capital taxes and many other taxes.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify what the purpose of this amendment is.  In our submission on the budget we proposed to the Minister that the total tax take from PAYE workers should be reduced by 10 per cent.  We believe that that would be an indication of the Minister's concern and recognition of the need for reform in that area.  We propose that the total tax take should be cut from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of income tax, not so as to reduce the amount the Minister receives but to spread the balance over other taxpayers. We propose that the burden of tax should be spread over other areas, which was the purpose of the tax marches, and of the Tax Commission, whose many reports dealt with that area of tax reform.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said again that we wished to have a 10 per cent cut in the total tax take from PAYE workers.  This amendment is not in any way going to meet that target but we believe that all allowances should be increased by 10 per cent at least.  That will still not reduce the tax take by 10 per cent or anything of that nature but it would be a help and also be an indication that the Minister is serious about what he says.  Our amendment proposes in subsection (2) of section 1 to increase the allowance of £5,300 by 10 per cent to £5,830, in other words add £530 to the amount stated by the Minister.  Similarly we propose that the amount of £2,650 should be increased by 10 per cent, that is £265, to bring it up to £2,915.  Our proposals are put fairly concisely in this amendment and each amount is specified.  We also propose that the sum of £6,300 should be increased by £630 to £6,930.  I notice that the figures given in the amendments tabled by the Labour Party are specific.  For example, they propose that the sum of £5,500 should be increased to £6,000, which is a nice even figure.  We put forward our amendment because there is a meaning and purpose behind what we are trying <Col N="135" /> to do and if it is accepted it would be seen publicly as a serious attempt by the Minister to reduce the burden of taxation by a specific amount.  There are many other areas where we propose increasing allowances by 10 per cent.  It is important for the House to indicate that there is a definite desire by it to reduce the burden of taxation and increase allowances and to give a specific commitment to do this.</P>
    <P>I have not examined all of the Fine Gael proposals in detail but on my first reading it seems they are going after one particular group, the highest earners, which I suppose is only their due.  They are going after the people who support them, their own friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basis of it.  I notice that on the last occasion a tax band was reduced from 65 per cent to 58 per cent there was a loss to the Exchequer of £41 million which meant that the highest earners paid £41 million less. However, I do not want to go into that on this occasion.  What I am saying is that instead of going for a Thatcher approach and saying &ldquo;Let us have a 25 per cent and a 40 per cent rate&rdquo;, the Minister for Finance should give an indication of his intention.  I do not think there is any indication of intent or policy in the Minister's tax proposals.  It is a bit of fiddling up and down but there is no indication of intent, purpose or clear policy.  Is it intended to reduce the tax take in one area and increase it in other areas or is it intended, as Fine Gael propose, to reduce the tax take all around and then reduce health and education services because there will be less money coming into the Exchequer?  That would be a clear indication of policy.  If the tax take from the highest earners is reduced and the services available in health and education are also reduced so that people have to pay more for them, that will allow the higher earners to have sufficient money to pay for their health and education services but those at the bottom <Col N="136" /> will have to do without.  That is a clear indication of Fine Gael's policy and intent but unfortunately the Minister has made nothing clear with regard to his policy. This is one small thing which we feel could be done in this area.  There should be an indication of an intention to spread the burden of tax.  The burden of tax has consistently increased on PAYE workers and, in fact, it increased by £300 million last year in spite of some reductions announced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are simply asking in our amendment that all allowances in this section be increased by 10 per cent.  I do not want to pursue this any further because we have a lot of amendments to get through by 7 o'clock and I hope to deal with the other items as they arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to comment briefly on The Workers' Party amendments and the other amendments which we are taking now.</P>
      <P>There has been universal approval in this House for the concept of tax reform. We have heard it from the Minister, from this side of the House in my Second Stage speech, from the Progressive Democrats who have been talking about it longer and with more consistency than anybody else, and from The Workers' Party also. On Second Stage the Minister said we were a bit short on specifics and that is why I came back and gave him certain specifics.  I do not regard tax reform as simply a way of facilitating taxpayers. The way we run our economy is seriously out of line with that of our competitors and, in particular with the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour and still our biggest market.  I have argued previously that our cost factors are out of kilter with our competitors, whether they are wage costs, energy costs, telecommunication costs, transport costs or a variety of other costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personal taxation can be included in that group of uncompetitive ways in which we run our economy.  In modern economies both capital and labour are highly mobile.  Labour is particularly mobile between countries with a common language.  Movements in Canada are <Col N="137" /> reflected in the personal tax system in the US and <i>vice versa.</i> That is a historic fact of recent note.  Movements in the UK on the personal tax front will affect our labour market here and there is no doubt that highly skilled young people in particular who are mobile will be attracted out of our economy if a more benign tax regime exists close to our shores.  It exists now a £70 or £75 return flight away depending on who you travel with.  That has to result in a serious road block to growth in our economy.  The very people we need to maintain here with the skills which could make this economy grow are being attracted out.  I know from my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce that, when it comes down to the last line and the board in the US, whatever state or city they are in, are making the decision whether it will be south-east England, Edinburgh, Waterford, Geneva or Brussels, quite frequently they consult the people who have explored the sites here and the man they intend to appoint as plant manager.</P>
    <P>We have a most benign corporate tax regime, 10 per cent maximum rate, one of the finest in Europe, but it is matched with the most disadvantageous personal taxation system one could possibly have. As a consequence, people who would come here for the corporate tax advantages set up elsewhere because of the disadvantages of personal income tax. The Minister's colleague, Deputy Reynolds, Minister for Industry and Commerce can confirm this.</P>
    <P>There is also tremendous upward pressure on wages when there are high marginal rates.  If somebody is looking for a wage increase in any company in this city at the moment and wants to maintain the net value of his spending power, instead of a wage increase which matches inflation, 3 per cent, he will have to get a wage increase between 7 per cent and 8 per cent if we are to apply 58 per cent tax to it.  Tax of 58 per cent up to £15,000 in effect means 65.75 per cent because of PRSI on top of PAYE and high marginal rates.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the greatest problem <Col N="138" /> facing our country is combined unemployment and emigration.  The Government estimate that 256,000 people on average will be unemployed during this year and they estimate in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that 30,000 persons will emigrate and this will continue. A fair summary of Government policy is that if the Exchequer borrowing requirement is reduced to stabilise the debt-GNP ratio, this will reduce interest rates and increase business confidence.  That is the theory behind present Government policy.  If this is paralleled by effectual sectoral policies, especially in financial services, the food industry, the tourist industry or forestry, we will have growth in our economy and our problems will be solved.</P>
    <P>This is fine as far as it goes, but this strategy alone will be insufficient to give us the growth rates to cut the dole queues and stem the flow of emigrants.  There is little or no hope of reducing unemployment next year, the year after or in the first half of the nineties unless we achieve growth rates in excess of 4 per cent of GNP per annum.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that and I am sure the people who advise him will give him similar figures.  There are various studies, now, some pessimistic and some optimistic, but we will not be in the ball park in cutting the dole queues and reducing emigration unless we get growth rates at that level, and I am talking about net growth rates.  The present policy will not achieve this.</P>
    <P>I have enumerated various road blocks to growth and foremost among these is the problem of personal taxation.  An independent body of economists out there support that view.  I have talked about high marginal rates.  Even after the Minister's reforms here a person will pay a combined rate of tax and PRSI of 55.75 per cent on a gross income of £8,550.  I do not know what the arithmetic is now. Perhaps Deputy Mac Giolla will have it but that is just about the average industrial wage.  If the same person progresses to just under £11,500 he goes on to the marginal rate of 65.75 per cent.  In the meantime in the UK a single person can <Col N="139" /> earn up to somewhere in excess of £19,000 and pay 25 per cent on it.</P>
    <P>Is it reasonable to think that this will not damage our economy in future or that it is not damaging it already?  If we did not have the enormous emigration problem at the moment, what I am talking about would be quite clear, but the dynamic people who are being attracted out by the pull factors of emigration to a benign regime in the UK are hidden in the overall statistics and we do not notice them because of the thousands who are being pushed out due to adverse economic circumstances.  The high marginal rates rather than the allowances referred to in Deputy Mac Giolla's and Deputy Desmond's amendments are the problem. In reform of income tax we must move on the high marginal rates rather than on the allowances.  Our party's opinion is that income tax reform is as essential to growth as is control of the national debt.</P>
    <P>Several countries have attempted to reform tax.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to articles in the <i>Financial Times</i> of Saturday, 9 January and Tuesday, 12 January 1988 written prior to the budget in England.  They talk in general terms about the necessity for tax reform and how to do it.  Generally those countries who tried to reform tax in a major way in the past five or six years fall into two categories, those who tried it incrementally, bit by bit as the Minister did last year and is doing this year and those who rolled it into a package and did it all together.  Those who tried it incrementally did not succeed because, when you adopt a gradual approach to tax reform and proceed incrementally, as in any tax reform system there are winners and losers.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Mac Giolla has moved an amendment and the amendments put down by Deputy Desmond are also under discussion.  They are all being advocated as a method of reforming the income tax code.  The method of reform being suggested in Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment is increasing allowances by 10 per cent.  I am arguing that we need reform of income tax but increasing allowances on an incremental basis is not the way to do it.  We need to reduce the overall rates of tax, and I believe I am in order.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> People who proceed incrementally fail.  People who seek to reform income tax tend to look at it always as an economic or financcial issue when it is a political issue.  As politicians we should be arranging the politics of the package rather than its finances.  Many people who represent excellent Departments could arrange the finances of it, but the politics of it are different as anyone in Government knows.  If you reform tax there are winners and losers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The winners pay less tax and the losers pay more tax.  If you try to do it incrementally piece by piece in three, four or five years. immediately you move the losers identify their losses and as soon as they do so they form pressure groups.  The pressure groups try to get the Opposition parties in behind them and as soon as the Opposition parties align themselves with the pressure groups tax reform grinds to a <Col N="141" /> halt.  That has been the experience particularly in Australia.</P>
      <P>Why are the winners not so smart? Frequently the winnings are more widely dispersed.  The winners do not form a coherent group.  Since the winnings are distributed incrementally over four or five years they do not make a lobby anyway. The Government of the day combined with those who gain from tax reform are not strong enough to resist the pressure from the Opposition of the day combined with the losers under tax reform and consequently the attempts grind to a halt. The Minister brought it in last year and this year and if Deputy Mac Giolla were Taoiseach and tried to move incrementally towards increased allowances he would be doomed to failure as well.  On the other hand, in the USA and New Zealand we have seen tax reform in a package and Deputy Mac Giolla speaking on Second Stage said he supported the idea of a package.</P>
      <P>We have always operated as if tax were the only ultimate variable.  The Government decide how much to spend on agriculture, health, education or the roads and decide that the expenditure must be covered by a combination of tax and borrowing. Since we are now reducing borrowing, tax becomes the ultimate residual and thus the ultimate variable. Of course it only varies in one direction &mdash; upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am borrowing successful ideas from other countries.  In Massachusetts and California they put statutory obligations in place by referendum to which legislatures had to respond.  In those instances property tax was the main issue but the same can be done with personal income tax.  I do not believe there will be any real reform of personal taxation here if it becomes an issue where the Government propose and all the Oppositions oppose and align themselves with those who do not like the changes.  To get away from the idea of tax as the ultimate variable, if we were to agree during the next fortnight that we would have two rates of tax &mdash; a standard rate of 20 per cent and a higher rate of 40 per cent &mdash; and if that were written into the legislation, we <Col N="142" /> would be doing by statute what they have done in the USA by referendum.  Then there would be a statutory direction to us and to the Cabinet to live within those parameters.</P>
    <P>If we were to adopt this proposal the loss of revenue would be £661 million, an enormous amount of money.  I am grateful for the answers I received from the Department of Finance to questions which were judicially placed to cost this proposal.  The answers were given on Tuesday, 2 February in reply to written questions and I am sure I am interpreting them correctly.  Wherever we find this huge sum of money, we cannot borrow it.  There is no question of increasing the debt.  We must keep the Exchequer borrowing requirement on a downward trajectory, as well as the current budget deficit.  These very large financial resources will have to be found somewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister has experience of the difficulty of identifying cutbacks and presenting them to the House.  He has been helped by the attitude of the Opposition, in particular by the Fine Gael Party since the announcement of the Tallaght strategy and also by the Progressive Democrats. Progress has been made in reducing the debt burden.  The national debt is still rising but not at the same rate.  The trend is towards stabilisation.  This has been done by consensus politics.  I do not believe that the Minister could have got through this House the Book of Estimates produced last October were it not for the Opposition parties, particularly Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats. We should apply the same strategy to tax reform.  If we do not there will be no tax reform.</P>
    <P>Where do we find the resources?  We should have an all-party committee.  I have heard Deputy Mac Giolla's party talking about extending the tax base, the paltry sums collected in capital taxation and the need for property taxes.  I have heard Deputy Desmond's party doing the same, inside and outside Government. Why not do it within a formal structure and let us see if there is consensus in the House on this matter?  If it is done in an <Col N="143" /> informal way with the Minister proposing and an Opposition opposing, the Minister will be pushed back before he gets to the first gate.  One crowd will roar about a diminution in allowances and another will shout about further tax impositions on the capital side.  All the Opposition parties will support them and we will not proceed any further.  The nerve of the Government will falter.  They will ask why they should bother and give another incremental increase in allowances the next year.</P>
    <P>Allowances are interesting.  I put down another question on 2 February 1988 and got some interesting information.  On mortgage interest relief the expectation in 1988-89 is that foregone tax will amount to £160 million.  Tax foregone in respect of medical insurance will amount to £48 million, life assurance £44 million, PAYE employment £286 million and PRSI £84 million.  On those allowances alone the total tax foregone is £622 million, according to information supplied by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's party have advocated a property tax and he has suggested that ultimately it would yield a return of between £400 million and £600 million. A well-known economic journalist, Mr. Tansey of the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> has recently looked at the whole area of allowances and has added the tax foregone in the allowances to which Deputy Mac Giolla is drawing attention and the tax foregone on the corporate side because of the benign tax regime.  He has calculated that the tax foregone on allowances, both personal and corporate, is between £2 billion and £2.5 billion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Thank you very much indeed.  I am saying that there are resources in the tax area which are available for transfer to other areas of the tax system.  The allowances I have nominated amount, from the Department of Finance figures, to £622 million. I said that calculations have been made, too.  Speaking from memory the tax foregone on all allowances, other than those I have nominated, together with the tax foregone on the corporate side, would amount to in excess of £2 billion and I believe it would be nearer to £2.5 billion than to £2 billion.  There are ways of finding the resources necessary to dramatically reform income tax in one year, two years or half a year or whenever we want to do it.  The problem is not a financial one because we are not talking <Col N="145" /> about identifying revenue from North Sea oil which might accrue to us.  We are not talking about borrowing.  We are talking about identifying resources which are in the system and applying them in a different way.  It is not a financial or an economic problem but it is a political problem.  It is the politics of adversarial decision making which makes it impossible for any Minister for Finance to move in a dramatic way to reform tax.</P>
      <P>For the first time in the history of this State we have shown that a certain amount of consensus across this House and less game playing can achieve sound economic results.  If the same formula is applied to tax reform and if there is a meeting of minds between the parties here, or between a majority of the people in this House as represented by their parties, we can identify the kind of resources I am talking about, and, having identified them if we can apply them to reducing the marginal rates of tax, we will have removed one of the main roadblocks to growth in our economy.  That is well worth doing.  The only thing that prevents us from doing it at present is because the Minister is on that side of the House and we are on this side.  Traditionally whatever the Minister proposes is wrong and whatever we say is right and if I say it the Minister says it is wrong.  You cannot move forward on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that this was not dreamed up casually.  It is something that I have examined carefully.  I thank the Department of Finance for providing me with the basic information necessary, by way of reply to written questions, as far back as 2 February.  I think this is achievable but it is achievable only on a cross party basis and if the kind of consensus that applies to stabilising the debt-GNP ratio is applied to the reform of income tax.  The resources are there if the political decision is made to apply them in a different way.  Once that is done one has to stick to it.  I had intended to quote very briefly from the article to which I referred and which appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 12 January 1988 but I will leave it.  I will bear in mind what the Minister has said and that would drift <Col N="146" /> into section 2 and to the amendment I have put down subsequent to that.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a better understanding in the House now of what I am talking about.  It is not a proposal against anybody.  It is a proposal to see if we can extend the consensus which has formed on the debt to the area of tax reform and if we can extend it, certain things can be done.</P>
    <P>I will make one last point.  Deputy Mac Giolla who objects to the way I have gone on referred to the Fine Gael proposal. He said it was a proposal for the rich, but of course it is not.  While we are talking about the top two rates of 58 per cent and 48 per cent reducing to 40 per cent, we are also talking about the 35 per cent rate reducing to 25 per cent.  Anybody who works is paying tax at at least 35 per cent.  The overall cost of reducing the 35 per cent rate of income tax to 25 per cent would be £449 million according to the figures supplied by the Department of Finance on 2 February.  To reduce the top rates to 40 per cent, in my calculation, would cost £212 million and I am sure I am not out very much in that calculation. We are talking about £450 million for the ordinary worker who is paying tax at 35p in the £.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If I wanted to construct an amendment to serve the rich, as Deputy Mac Giolla charges, I could construct an amendment which would reduce the top rates down to 35 per cent.  We could abolish all the top rates and it would cost less than £300 million gross.  The net cost would be around £200 million.  The Minister's proposals which are undramatic &mdash; they have not been acclaimed on the streets; we have had no marches to Merrion Street yet applauding the Minister and meeting <Col N="147" /> him with torches &mdash; would cost £152 million in a full year.  If we wanted amendments to ease the top rates, and do that alone, they are quite within the ball park of what the Minister is doing this year, and the Minister knows that.  If the Minister took the £152 million and applied it to the top rates, I believe that if he had another £30 million or £40 million he would come very near to abolishing the top rates and having one rate of 35 per cent.  Deputy Mac Giolla is right.  That would be inequitable and I do not think we should proceed in that way.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I am on my feet and one of the reasons I put down this amendment is that a lot of nonsense is spoken about tax.  There is a perception out there that everyone is paying the 58 per cent rate or the 65 per cent rate and that that collects billions of pounds.  It does not.  It is the 35 per cent rate that collects the significant sums of money and it is in reducing the 35 per cent rate that there will be much benefit and that is where big costs are involved.  To talk about proposals in ease of the rich is only the kind of class politics which we avoided in this country for a long time until the emergence of The Workers' Party.  That is not meant as a compliment to the Labour Party.  I hope I will be able to return to this topic.  Because of the way in which the debate is being taken today all sections, I understand, will fall at 7 o'clock.  I would like some guidance before I sit down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to amendments Nos. 2 to 13, inclusive.  My colleague, Deputy McDowell, wishes to contribute, subject to the Minister's agreement.  The only point I want to make about my amendments is that they relate, in a very fundamental way, to the general exemption limits from tax.  It is of critical importance that we proceed down that road as far as we can within the scope of Exchequer resources.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a small increase in the general tax exemption limits in his Bill from £5,300 to £5,500 for a married couple and from £2,650 to £2,750 for a single person.  As a result of that change a very small number of persons, only about 16,000 out of the many tens of thousands who are liable, will be taken out of the tax net altogether, and about 5,000 become entitled to the marginal relief.  That is a very small annual conservation because, come next year, with changes in income they will parachute back into the net again.  Therefore, I am endeavouring in this series of amendments to take anything up to 50,000 persons out of the tax net, mainly those on quite low incomes.  I am also endeavouring, by applying the tax ememption limit to ensure greater equity overall within the system.</P>
      <P>That is the import of our amendments. They are quite simple and there is no reason the House should not consider them.  It is within the framework of this budget and of the general taxation system to find the resources, which I admit would be substantial enough, to meet the cost of those amendments, bearing in mind that the overall structure of the taxation, the tax mix, has changed in effect.  For a decade at least tax components as a percentage of GNP have remained virtually unchanged other than income tax itself.  It is necessary to bring that back into line with other levels of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reserve my other comments.  I just <Col N="149" /> want to make those opening brief comments on these amendments to ensure that all the amendments from 1 to 13 are now before the House.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's view on the matter.  I will be particularly interested in hearing his view as to what this would cost, because there is an air of direct reality about our discussions.  Then I will have an opportunity to respond further, suggesting alternative ways of meeting a challenge of that nature, suggesting fundamental changes in the general tax exemption limits which are required if we are to have a radical relief from income taxation for those on low incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the House and all the parties represented by their spokespersons here for their co-operation in agreeing all the procedures we have embarked upon here today on the financial resolutions and on the timescale for dealing with the Committee Stage.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the co-operation of all parties involved in that regard because we all know the detailed provisions of the Finance Bill can take endless hours to debate.  We will do our utmost to ensure that each item that is raised is responded to and that all items get some coverage in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>For that reason I will not spend too much time replying in a wider fashion than the amendments would have allowed normally in a debate on tax reform and so on.  I will get the opportunity to make a few points on that matter on section 2 where there is a wider series of amendments proposed.  I do not tend to respond to all the queries that were raised other than to cover two points. Deputy Mac Giolla raised the question of the 90 per cent of income tax receipts coming from the PAYE sector which is not absolutely accurate.  It is 81 per cent that comes from this sector, just to keep the record straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion made by Deputy Mac Giolla that the cost of a 10 per cent reduction for the PAYE sector alone would be roughly £220 million, so one can see the kind of figures we are dealing <Col N="150" /> with.  I do not want to spend too much time when I get up to speak.  I would prefer to leave the opportunity to all the Deputies opposite.  I will be coming back to many of the points that were made on this section and on this amendment later on section 2.</P>
    <P>Let me deal specifically with, first of all, amendment No. 1.  As we know, the purpose of the amendment is to increase general income tax exemption limits and the exemption limits for aged persons proposed in the Bill.  It is proposed to increase the general exemption limits as set out in the Bill by a further £330 for married couples and £165 for single and widowed persons.  It is also proposed to increase the exemption limits set out in the Bill by £430 for married couples and £215 for single and widowed persons aged 65 or over but under 75 years and by £485 for married couples and £242 for single and widowed persons aged 75 or over. Acceptance of this amendment would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £4.1 million in 1988 and £6.8 million in a full year and would exempt some 11,500 taxpayers from tax liability.  That is just in relation to amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill already provides generous increases in the exemption limits &mdash; £200 in the case of a married person under 75 years of age and £100 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category; £250 in the case of a married couple where either spouse is aged 75 or over or £125 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category.  These increases and the associated marginal relief will cost the Exchequer £2.3 million in 1988 and £4.1 million in a full year, and will exempt a total of 9,100 persons from liability to income tax.  A further 33,200 persons will have reduced liability because of the operation of marginal relief as a consequence of the increases.  The increases in the exemption limits provided for in section 1 of the Bill are the most generous that can be afforded at this time, especially as other significant reliefs, meaning the increases in the rate bands and the main personal allowances and the <Col N="151" /> renewal of PRSI allowances beyond what was promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> are provided for in the Bill.  Accordingly, the amendment must be opposed.</P>
    <P>Turning to the similar amendments, amendments Nos. 2 and 3, 8 and 9 propose to increase the general exemption limits set out in the Bill by £500 for married couples and by £250 for single and widowed persons, etc.  Rather than reading through the different ones let me just say that the cost of amendments Nos. 2, 3, 8 and 9 to the Exchequer would be £4.5 million in 1988 and £7.6 million in a full year, and would exempt some 10,600 taxpayers from tax liability.  Amendments Nos. 4, 6, 10 and 12 would cost the Exchequer £1.4 million in 1988 and £2.1 million in a full year, while some 4,200 taxpayers would be exempt from tax liability as a result.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 7, 11 and 13, if accepted, would cost the Exchequer £0.4 million in 1988 and £0.6 million in a full year and approximately 1,200 taxpayers would be removed from tax liability.  The total cost to the Exchequer of amendments Nos. 2 to 13 combined would be £6.1 million in 1988 and £10.3 million in a full year.  As I have already indicated in relation to amendment No. 1, it is not proposed to accept these amendments. The allowances already provided for in the Bill are as generous as we can afford at the present time.</P>
    <P>In relation to a general question raised by Deputy Desmond about exemptions and who has been exempted as a result of the budget and what is proposed in this Finance Bill, under the various proposals the personal allowances will exempt 2,200; PAYE allowance, 4,900; PRSI allowance, 13,000.  The overall effect of the allowances exempts 20,000 people approximately.</P>
    <P>On exemption limits, the general limit is 6,700 people.  The exemption limit among people aged 65 to 75 years is 1,700 and for those aged 75 years or over it is 700.  The overall effect is 9,000.  The total exempted by the budget is 29,000 people <Col N="152" /> and that is not too bad in the context of our difficult budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>Because of what I have said and what is already proposed in section 1 of the Bill, I cannot accept any of the amendments Nos. 1 to 13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to keep to the sections dealing with the specific thing they are dealing with.  As far as I am concerned I was not considering tax reform when I was proposing changes in the allowances.  What we are dealing with is the Finance Bill that is before us.  I dealt with the issue of tax reform in my contribution on the budget and on Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  We are trying now to do the best we can with the Finance Bill put before us by the Minister.  We are talking about people in the lowest bracket of tax exemption limits.  How could anybody pay any worker £55 a week in this day and age? It is unbelievable.  Should anybody offer that little to anybody?  Having got a job at this miserable wage, it is incredible to have the Minister for Finance taxing such people.  Could anybody feed and cloth himself and keep a roof over his head for £55 a week?</P>
      <P>There have been many references to farmers.  I am called anti-farmer but I have to refer to them.  Farmers will say that their average income is £2,600 or £2,700 a year and that they should not be taxed.  In fact, 120,000 of them are not in the tax take.  A very interesting point in that regard is that, according to a reply I received only last week, 12,000 CIE workers paid £36 million in income tax last year, plus £10 million in PRSI.  That was greater than the total income tax taken from all farmers.  That puts the matter in perspective, that one group of workers pay more than all the farmers. Let me not be told that there are not farmers capable of paying a little more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying in our amendment to take out the lowest bracket and increase the exemption limits a little.  I want to tell Deputy Noonan that none of these matters would be seen by me as tax reform.  We are trying to do the best we can.  I appeal to the Minister to give <Col N="153" /> consideration to the effect of the Bill, or lack of effect of it, in the area of taxation. I am asking him to take the people out of that low bracket and bring in others.  I understand that he is trying to bring in others and he will have no problem in getting another 29,000 people out there who are not paying tax and should be, to make up for the 29,000 people, the miserably lower paid workers he is asking to pay tax because the others will not pay it.  To find that if a worker is paid £56 a week, 82p is taken out of that sum is incredible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the exemption limits, we have to look at the area of poverty. This is a time of increasing poverty and low levels of pay, with more and more employers paying less and less in wages. Lower levels of pay are becoming a very common factor in employment now.  The purpose of this amendment is to take such people out of the tax bracket.  I ask the Minister to have another look at the limits and see if he believes that people can live on those amounts and pay income tax, when it is further money they should be getting.  I am strongly of the view that amendments should be made to these exemption limits and I am pushing this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very fine for Deputy Mac Giolla to cry crocodile tears in relation to tax exemptions.  The fact of the matter is that this year we are giving £91 million in tax concessions and £152 in a full year.  These are enormous amounts. The Deputy and his party &mdash; and I do not want to be personal here &mdash; have trotted in here for the past 13 months, put down motions and opposed every single item of saving put forward by this Government, to the extent of defeating the Government on many issues, even with regard to amounts as low as £500,000. Notwithstanding that, this Government were in a position to find sufficient savings, with the support and co-operation, rightly acknolwedged by me, of <Col N="154" /> Deputy McDowell and Deputy Noonan and their respective parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring into sharp focus the question of tax reform in the context of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1988.  It is in that spirit that I move this amendment.  For reasons which will become apparent afterwards, I may not be enthusiastic about pressing it to the ultimate conclusion.</P>
      <P>First, the effect of the amendment is to reduce rates of income tax from 58 per cent, 48 per cent and 35 per cent to 50 per cent, 45 per cent and 33 per cent respectively.  The measures which are encompassed in such an amendment would, I appreciate, cost very significant sums of money in terms of revenue foregone to the Exchequer.  My own estimate is that the 2 per cent reduction in the standard rate of tax from 35 per cent of 33 per cent would mean a loss of about £90 million in Exchequer revenue; the reduction of the 48 per cent rate to 45 per cent would involve about £25 million forgone in revenue and the reduction from 58 per cent to 50 per cent would mean a sum in the region of £60 to £65 million foregone in revenue, giving a total figure of £165 million approximately as the gross cost of such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that there would <Col N="161" /> be some corresponding buoyancy, usually calculated, I think, in the region of 25 per cent or 30 per cent.  Therefore, in net terms the proposals would cost the Exchequer in the general region of £125 or £130 million.  I appreciate that is a very large sum of money and is not one that can be tossed off the pen lightly as a proposal for tax reform.</P>
    <P>It is not lightly done either, but it is done in the spirit of forcing this House to address itself to the implications of a radical tax reform package.  I am conscious &mdash; and I want to assure the Minister of this &mdash; that in proposing such figures I am not suggesting that the moneys necessary to fund the shortfall thereby created can be conjured up out of thin air.  It is a sad fact, however, that the rules of procedure of this House lay down that no Member who is not a Minister can propose an amendment of any kind to the Finance Bill which imposes a charge on the Exchequer or a charge on any person.  Therefore, the only kind of amendments that can be tendered to the Finance Bill which are not merely procedural in nature are ones which involve tax cuts.  On occasions this leads to the general perception that Opposition amendments to Finance Bills are uncosted and unbalanced by corresponding provisions elsewhere, and on occasion it can be the case that people perceive them in that context as irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I am stating quite clearly that I am not tendering this amendment as an uncosted measure or one which I suggest should be taken on board by the Government without regard to its consequences.  As I have said, the rules of procedure of this House require me to abstain from making any corresponding proposal as to where the money could otherwise come from.  I am bound by the rules of this House. That is a somewhat antiquated procedure and is regrettable in my view.  However, it is the rule of the House and it binds all parties and has done so for many years. I am not suggesting that it should be lightly cast aside.  I see its purpose.  Its purpose was to give the Government a monopoly of carriage of financial resolutions in the House and its purpose <Col N="162" /> was to accord to the Executive under the Constitution the right to determine the course of budgetary policy.  It is implicit in our system of Government that the Executive takes responsibility for it and is not divested of that responsibility on a transient basis by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In that context I believe this House has totally failed in its duty to establish a responsible forum for considering alternative tax systems.  The House approved a motion establishing a Commission on Taxation under Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien and has since in substance ignored and shelved the recommendations of that learned commission who were so long involved in valuable and detailed analysis of the taxation system.  The House has not established any means whereby Members of this House who engage in debate on budgetary matters are obliged to consider the exact consequences of the proposals they make.  As I have said, Opposition in this House is confined on financial matters to effectively proposing tax cuts.  It is in ease of the Opposition that they are never required to balance their amendments to the budget, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a need for an all-party committee of this House, not simply to do what the Committee on Public Accounts do, that is, to consider whether the moneys which we vote in this House are spent in accordance with the mandate given to Government and not simply to do what the Committee on Public Expenditure did, simply to ascertain whether each individual item of expenditure is good value for money, but to look at the whole substance of budgetary politics and the fiscal underpinnings of the State and to make recommendations on a cross-party basis for reform.  I believe that committee is necessary and, for reasons to which I will revert in a few moments, it is also something which the Government should seriously consider establishing.  It would have the effect of obliging politicians in this House, from whatever party, to address the consequences of their proposals.  It would be an occasion on which conflicting ideas or fiscal ideologies would be mediated and examined <Col N="163" /> in circumstances which force some responsibility on those who suggest change.  With all of that I am in agreement. I note that Deputy Noonan so suggested earlier in this debate.  I am in agreement with him that such a committee should be established.</P>
    <P>That, effectively, is where I must part company with Deputy Noonan.  If anybody is in the business of suggesting radical tax reform to this House, the Government or the electorate, it is absolutely essential that those people should speak from a base of integrity, that it should be clearly understood that suggestions which are thrown out for political consideration are really attainable.  It should be an ethic among politicains that unattainable objectives should not be thrown out lightly just for the purpose of creating a headline, striking a political pose or affecting the next opinion poll.</P>
    <P>The subject of tax reform is much more serious.  Indeed I welcome the change of heart on the part of Fine Gael in relation to the question of tax reform.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Noonan's amendment has been tabled here today as indicative of that change of heart.  But there are several points about it which disturb me.  First, the suggestion that this House should seriously set about changing the entire nature of our taxation system in one year appeals to anyone with a drop of radical blood in their veins. But, in so far as it is something which is not attainable, in so far as it is something which is unrealistic, I have to say that it devalues the political process if it is seriously put forward in that knowledge. It is all right to put things forward with a sense of reality.  I do not believe it is obligation to maintain about oneself a sense of reality.  I do not believe it is possible.  If I did believe it I would say so immediately and concede the issue absolutely without demur.  It is not possible to change the nature of our income tax system in one budget.  It is not possible to turn about the tax system in one year to the extent of £660 million.  Figures, such as the one implicit in my amendment, would be very difficult to attain, <Col N="164" /> would require considerable alteration of the tax base and curtailment of public expenditure in one year to bring them about.  I must part company with Deputy Noonan's suggestion on this basis, that I do not accept &mdash; neither do the Progressive Democrats &mdash; that it is possible to bring about the radical change needed in our taxation system in one budget.</P>
    <P>In substitution we propose now &mdash; as we have proposed at all times since the foundation of our party &mdash; that a five-year strategy be put in place to turn around our taxation system.  Central to the question of a five-year strategy is an identification of the goals and targets of that strategy. Unless you can ascertain, in advance, where you want the taxation system to go, where reform should take the tax system, the kinds of reforms suggested cannot be achieved.  Unless the end product which is in view is spelt out there is no point in talking in vague terms about lightening the tax burden or reforming the tax system.</P>
    <P>Woolly talk about reform does no good.  In this respect I believe that the targets set out by Fianna Fáil in their <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which formed the basis of their manifesto for the last general election and which suggested a plausible-sounding target, of putting two-thirds of people on to the standard rate of income tax, was political candyfloss, if I may use that phrase.  What was wrong with it is this: when they came into office 43 per cent of people were paying tax above the standard rate.  They proposed to reduce that figure to 33 per cent which could be achieved by altering the tax status, the marginal tax rates, paid by 10 per cent of taxpayers.  Therefore, what appeared, on the one hand, to be radical tax reform, what undoubtedly would cost very substantial sums of money, is so variable internally because one must think in terms of what is to be the standard rate of tax, how the structure of allowances underneath that standard rate is to be changed in order to bring it about, that kind of concept of bringing X-percentage of people onto the standard rate, which means or involves altering the marginal tax rate of 10 per <Col N="165" /> cent of taxpayers &mdash; does not constitute a radical tax reform programme.</P>
    <P>I believe absolutely in the proposition that the Single European Act will transform this country.  I said so on Second Stage so I will not repeat myself at length here.  I believe it will transform this country in terms of not simply our obligations, duties and capacity to manoeuvre in respect of indirect tax but also in respect of direct tax itself.  We are in close proximity to a low tax economy.  The general trend among OECD economies is toward lower taxation rates on personal income and simplification of those rates.</P>
    <P>I believe that our party's proposal for a 25 per cent standard rate of income tax, and an upper rate of 40 per cent, is not simply a luxury, a bauble, a distraction, an ideal or a political mirage put before our people some where on the horizon to be aimed at.  Establishment of a tax system, incorporating substantially that structure of tax rates, is an absolute essential if this country is to survive within the Single European Act régime. We cannot go on as we are with the highest initial tax rate of any OECD country, that is 35 per cent, and that does not take into account PRSI contributions to which I will revert later.  We cannot go on as we are, with the most sharply progressive tax system going up to rates of 58.5 per cent for people who are on or about the average industrial wage, single people earning in or about that amount. It is deluding ourselves to think that we have, in the last analysis, a choice not to radically reform our taxation system.  The Single European Act is coming down the tracks at us like a train; implicit in it is a radical reform of our personal régime of income tax.  We cannot avoid it; it is coming at us.  The sooner this House gets together, on a cross-party basis, and realises that that is the case, the better it will be for all of us.  There is no point in pretending or wishing away what will be the consequence of an integrated European market: once labour, capital and enterprise become fully mobile &mdash; as is implicit in the further development of the EC &mdash; you cannot have a radically <Col N="166" /> different tax structure in relation to personal, corporate or capital taxes obtaining in one area of the community.  Most of all, one cannot have such a system within a small, open economy from which everything can go in and out without hindrance, and from which everything has shown a disposition to move over the past 20 to 30 years.  In this House we simply must face up to the question of tax reform.  There must be established an all-party committee on tax reform.  There appears to be an unwillingness to move unilaterally.</P>
    <P>In relation to my proposals I have to say this: I appreciate that any radical tax reform programme, such as that I propose, is one requiring a widening of the tax base.  It requires also &mdash; and this is most important &mdash; a willingness among the political parties in this House to be honest with the electorate about what widening the tax base means.  It means either, in general terms, imposing new taxes, bringing areas now exempt from tax into the net, or, alternatively, eliminating areas rendered exempt by means of the tax allowance system we currently enjoy.  On all of those fronts there is a requirement for honesty.  In that regard I have to say that it is not good enough for political parties to suggest all the good sides of a radical tax reform, including reduction of marginal rates of taxation, if they are not willing to deliver on the other side, that is to express the bad news as well in clear understandable terms to the electorate.</P>
    <P>That is why when it came to tax reform the Progressive Democrats made it very clear that we acknowledged that property tax would have to be part of a radical tax reform system which involved widening of the tax base.  It was not an easy thing to do.  We did not wait for an all-party committee to indicate our willingness to impose a different form of taxation.  If Fine Gael are to come this far on radical tax reform they must take the next step and show a willingness &mdash; quite apart from what Fianna Fáil do or do not do or what the Progressive Democrats do or do not do or say or do not say &mdash; to put up their own model of a taxation system, <Col N="167" /> warts and all, the down side as well as the up side.  That is what this amendment is calculated to do.  It is to provide an opportunity for those in this House who believe in radical tax reform to state that that is the case and to give some indication of some of the less popular aspects of how they would defray the shortfall to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I listened to the debate on the last few amendments and it was very clear to me that Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Desmond were effectively tinkering around with the present system of tax allowances. They were doing so from the commendable point of view that those at the bottom of the heap should get some kind of relief.  However, I have to say that such a marginal incremental approach which leaves it being the highly progressive nature of our tax system is precisely the route this House should not adopt.  We must tackle the other end &mdash; the rate structure of taxation &mdash; and that is what this amendment is about.</P>
    <P>We should avoid tinkering around with the system and providing incremental reliefs because all the same problems are postponed and inflation takes care of every allowance that is given.  Inflation does not take care of standard rates being 35 per cent or 25 per cent.  The chemistry of the tax system, if I may say that, is much more likely to be profoundly affected by a cross-party consensus, which I believe exists between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, on the nature of the progressivity of our tax system than on a surrender to incrementalism, if I may use that word, which is coming in this House from the Left Wing parties.</P>
    <P>If you want the ideological split in this House it is that the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil &mdash; I think Fianna Fáil because we do not hear the soul of Fianna Fáil speaking often, we only hear the ministerial line &mdash; take the view that progressivity in Irish taxation is exaggerated, destructive and needs reform.  I expect that that is the general view of Fianna Fáil Deputies. The three major parties who represent <Col N="168" /> 80 per cent of the voters and who have a clear consensus on the pattern tax reform should take should speak out and be willing to talk in terms of attacking the highly progressive marginal rates of taxation rather than the incremental reforms which have occurred yet again in this budget.</P>
    <P>Implicit in tax reform is a frank acknowledgement of the relationship between PRSI and the tax system.  The Taoiseach announced on radio that he now accepted that PRSI was effectively a tax on work.  If it is a tax on work it is a tax paid on the first £15,500 of income without allowance.  It is the most regressive, anti-work, anti-poor, poverty trap ridden system of taxation that we have. It requires to be taken on and dealt with in conjunction with tax reform.  This is the second basis on which I would differ from the remarks attributed yesterday by the press to Deputy Noonan.  Unless you tackle PRSI and income tax together, first you will create injustice because if you reduce the rates and fiddle around with the tax allowances there will be so many losers at the bottom of the heap who are paying PRSI that you will find a popular revulsion against radical tax reform.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in their approach to this issue the Progressive Democrats dealt with PRSI as if it was a part of the general tax structure.  We decided that it should be, as the Commission on Taxation suggested, merged into the general tax structure as an integrated component part, that it should effectively be the social security element of taxation, apply on all incomes and not have an upper limit. We also decided that, in the process of dismantling PRSI as it presently applies, for various technical reasons to avoid there being too many losers in a programme and strategy for tax reform, you had to concentrate on employees' contributions first even though economically it might be preferable to go to employers' contributions.  By giving relief on employees' contributions you can, in fact, give the poorest people at the bottom of the heap a concession which <Col N="169" /> reducing the higher rates of tax and consolidating them at 40 per cent and 25 per cent does not allow you to do.</P>
    <P>That is why we took that decision and why, in the papers we have used politically and internally in our party, the PRSI element paid by employees has been brought to centre stage in the tax reform equation.  It would be a mistake to think that we could go about the business of radical tax reform without considering the employee's contribution on PRSI because you would do precisely what Deputy Noonan was talking about &mdash; create a considerable group of losers at the bottom of the heap.  Anybody's view of social justice will revolt against a system that ends up giving more to the 58 per cent men, the 48 per cent men and the 35 per cent men and hammering the people who are at the bottom of the heap.</P>
    <P>I also want to say something about another aspect of the amendment that I proposed.  The House will note that there is not a radical proposal in respect of allowances or bands in it.  I have to say to the Minister &mdash; and I hope he will allow me wear my lawyer's wig as well as my politician's hat on this &mdash; that the Murphy decision was interpreted by the late Mr. George Colley when he was Minister for Finance as a very significant constraint on the way in which you could restructure allowances.  In the event, a highly simplistic model of doubling the band on the allowance at any given stage to a married couple rather than to a single person was the model chosen.  That was a highly simplistic view of the requirements of the Exchequer laid down by the Supreme Court in the Murphy decision.  I do not accept that it is necessary to give a married couple twice a single person's allowance. I do not accept that that is the case because I believe the way around it is to bring in the concept of earned income.</P>
    <P>The Murphy decision is only authority for the proposition that, if two working people get married, they should not be worse off than two working people who stay single and cohabit.  That is the high tide mark of that decision and it does not mean &mdash; and this is very important from <Col N="170" /> the point of view of Irish taxation, philosophy and policy &mdash; that a married man, because he is married to a woman, or a married woman because she is married to a man, gets double the allowance and bands that a single person gets.  That is not implicit in that decision and failure to understand that at that time contributed to the general pressure for a highly progressive system of taxation. Once you got to the stage where you felt compelled, by a Supreme Court decision, to double tax bands for married people over what is available to single people, it put immense downward presure on the tax system generally and prevented the widening out of the tax bands and the dismantling of our highly progressive system.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one component I suggest for radical tax reform is a reassessment of the effect of the Murphy case.  In that context the approach I am adopting here should be applied, but perhaps this is too generous as well.  We need to reintroduce the concept of earned income relief and make that central to our tax system.  I believe from what Deputy Noonan says that he accepts our fundamental tenet that the tax system must be conducive to work, to economic participation and, in that context, to give double the tax allowance to a dependant over a single participant in the economy is flying in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan in speaking about The Workers' Party amendment &mdash; but I think he was talking more about his amendment here &mdash; used the phrase: &ldquo;Tax should no longer be considered as a residual&rdquo;.  I agree with him fully on that. It should not be considered as the residual in the public accounts, nor should it be considered as a residual as far as the individual earner is concerned.  In relation to the individual earner there is a tendency on the part of the tax establishment &mdash; if I may use that phrase &mdash; to see income as something determined separate from tax.  The tax driven level of renumeration is not a concept which this House has really played around with or grasped fully.  The fact that people <Col N="171" /> make their decisions as to remuneration, as to what they offer other people to work or what they seek for their own work, conscious of the tax element, is a point which seems to have been lost on what I refer to as the tax establishment.  They feel income is not driven by taxation; I believe it is.  It is governed to a substantial extent by levels of tax which prevail at any given time and on that basis many fundamental mistakes have been made.</P>
    <P>We have put in place a system which between PRSI and PAYE has changed the climate for enterprise and work dramatically in the past 20 years.  Deputy Bruton put forward a White Paper at the time of the last budget for which he was responsible in which he pointed out that in the 20 years from 1965 to 1985 the amount of tax on work, payroll taxes, PRSI and PAYE, the predecessor being the stamp, PAYE and tax on income, had doubled from 23 per cent of our tax take to 46 per cent and that in those two decades the amount of taxation on property, for instance, had gone down from 16 per cent to less than 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those figures are frightening because unconsciously this community through their Legislature doubled the emphasis of tax on work.  Look at the amounts of money income tax accounts for expressed as a percentage of GNP.  From 1977, halfway through that period, to 1988 it has effectively doubled from 9.3 per cent to 15 per cent odd, and that is only half the story because it was worse before that.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is this.  According to the NESC's strategy report up to 1991, a person on one and a quarter times the average industrial wage, which would include many bank clerks, people at £14,000 level, teachers starting and the like, will represent a payroll cost to his employer for every £1 he takes home in pay of £2.10 approximately.  That is the ultimate sign of a society that has turned its back on enterprise and employment. I agree with what has been said from the left &mdash; and not only from the left; it has been said by many distinguished academics such as Dr. Seán Barrett of Trinity College &mdash; that this country gives huge <Col N="172" /> subsidies to capital, property and industry, but, any society which says that if you want to give a man £1 to take home in a relatively modest income you must lay out £2.10 has indicted itself as an anti-work economy.  That figure is probably higher now.</P>
    <P>The essence of radical tax reform is a willingness to accept honestly the implications of broadening the tax base.  It is a willingness to accept that there will be costs, to take on vested interests which most certainly will be there, to flout taboos such as the sacrosanctity of real property which as a community we have shown unwillingness to do until now.  The essence of tax reform is a willingness to be radical.  The purpose of tax reform must be to open up this economy and ensure that everyone has an incentive to participate.</P>
    <P>In the 25 per cent and 40 per cent rates I believe as a matter of intuition that nobody should be asked to give up out of his last marginal £1 more than 40 per cent.  Bear in mind that if he spends it on luxuries, higher rated VAT things or whatever, he is going to give more tax to the State.  Every £1 everyone earns at the margin should be worth more to him than to the community.  A society that forgets that fundamental ethic gives up on the work ethic.</P>
    <P>If Fine Gael are coming aboard the ship of radical taxation I say, without rancour, they had better face up to the fact that there is a down side.  You have to put your head above the political parapet and risk getting it shot off, or at least injured, if you are going to be a proponent of radicalism.  You cannot seek an all-party committee as a panacea for all the problems attached to radicalism in tax reform.  You must be willing to spell out the general thrust at least of where you believe change must occur.  Deputy Noonan has brought Fine Gael a significant length and I congratulate him on it.  He has brought Fine Gael around to a viewpoint different from the one they had.  I remember standing on platforms and outside churches being told in scornful terms by Fine Gael people that 25 per cent and 40 per cent tax could never <Col N="173" /> be achieved, was wishful thinking and should not be attempted.  I also remember some speeches from the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, attacking us in the most merciless way as electoral fraudsters for being willing to propose radical tax reform.  We survived that and we are here in this House changing the view of this House.  We have put pressure of a kind on Fine Gael and they are now changing their attack.  That is what politics is all about and I accept the Deputy's right to hunt about in our clothes rack if he wants anything that he thinks will suit or fit him, but I suggest that if he is going out on a clothes buying expedition he should come out with a full wallet politically and be willing to pay for the clothes he takes.</P>
    <P>For instance, those who have taken the initiative and suggested a property tax should not find their courage on the matter circumvented cutely by Deputy Noonan who says he is in favour of everything they are in favour of but that an all-party committee will tell him how it can be paid for.  He has to come one stage further than that if the all-party committee are to be of any use.  It cannot be an occasion when those who are really radical are outmanoeuvred by those who are only faint-hearted radicals.</P>
    <P>I am asking Fine Gael on this occasion to continue with the good work, to continue to approximate to Progressive Democrat policies, to continue to make party political co-operation this way and across the House more possible.  I am asking the Minister to take on board that fact that there is now a consensus for radical tax reform.  Curiously enough, he would not have it if there was a snap election now and his party got more seats. With Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats he has 80 per cent of the support of this country and he has more room to manoeuvre than ever he will have in future.  I am asking him to take advantage of that opportunity because, even if it goes for another year without being taken up, political circumstances will set in which will make it much more difficult for him to attend to it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that 25 per cent tax <Col N="174" /> and 40 per cent tax are coming in and will be either shoved down our throats or accepted willingly.  It is up to us as legislators to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I welcome Deputy McDowell's speech, which is very supportive of the arguments I have been making.  I should like everything I am about to say to be taken as following from the contribution I made on amendment No. 1.  There is no point in repeating the same arguments when other Deputies want to become involved.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to an article by Cedric Sandford in the <i>Financial Times</i> of Tuesday, 12 January 1988 which states:</P>
      <P>Ironically, the worse the tax system to begin with, the more the chance of successful reform.  The more discontent with a tax system, the more tax reform will be welcomed, or at least accepted.  This goes some way to account for the degree of success in the US, where tax shelters had got out of hand; and in Australia and New Zealand, where very high marginal rates of income tax were being paid by the ordinary working man.</P>
      <P>Does that not sound very familiar?  Could we not substitute Ireland for the United States, Australia or New Zealand?  Certainly we have fulfilled the first requirement. We have a very bad tax system to which the majority of taxpayers object and, consequently, there is a movement of people who are willing to examine proposals for reform.  The article continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking two approaches to tax reform can be distinguished &mdash; the incremental and the package.  To civil servants the incrementalist approach is always attractive.  It means working in known territory; less danger that tax revenue will fall; less fear of congestion and overwork in the Revenue department. But incrementalism has its disadvantages. It is necessarily slow; and it may be much less successful.  Unless a Finance Minister has money to give <Col N="175" /> away, an incrementalist approach invariably means some clear losers. Often the benefits are spread but the losses concentrated; and the losers will shout loudly while the beneficiaries will hardly be aware of their good fortune.</P>
    <P>That makes the point for a package approach to tax reform rather than an incremental approach.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy McDowell's acceptance of the idea of an all-party committee. He has said this is unattainable on a one-year basis.  Unless tax reform is approached in a very definite timescale which is not too long, then the impetus for it and the political support will dribble out as the years go by.  To introduce a series of proposals now which would only be effective over a five-year period is to take the incremental road.  There are so many crossroads, turning points and milestones along that road, politically, economically and financially, which could occur over the next five years that the initial impetus would not last and we would not achieve the reform we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell has asked where the resources are to be found.  I have never suggested that there are hidden resources out there which we have not identified, some crock of gold which will yield over £600 million to be applied to tax reform. That is not the position.  I am talking about identifying resources in one area and applying them to reduce income tax to a 25 per cent standard rate and a 40 per cent higher rate.  I have indicated the areas for examination.  Enough time and enough words went into the report of the Commission on Taxation.  A variety of options are identified in the first report on direct taxation.  I have already said that in respect of personal allowances, mortgage interest, medical insurance, life assurance, employee and PRSI allowances the total tax foregone is £622 million, according to a reply I received on 2 February 1988.  I am not advocating this as the area where we should find the resources but I am open to suggestions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> Deputy McDowell talks about a property tax.  We have put down a marker on property tax.  We do not think the rates work very well.  The old rates were iniquitous but that is the only thing which our spokesman on the environment, Deputy Boland, has ruled out in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell talks about the courage to put the head above the parapet. We put the head above the parapet 12 months ago when we forced on a very reluctant electorate and a reluctant Opposition who are now in Government the reality that the magnitude of the national debt and the problems of servicing it were inhibiting growth in our economy and that we had do deal with that problem, regardless of what happened. Deputy McDowell says we will not put the head above the parapet because it might be blown off or injured. We put the head above the parapet during the last general election and we had 19 people who were shot to death because they lost their seats.</P>
    <P>It was not done lightly to put at the centre of the debate the key issue of the control of debt.  Deputy McDowell in that war ended up with 14 commissioned officers.  When one has gone through war and has had casualties one knows the risks of putting the head above the parapet. That is not the reason we are not itemising where this money is to be found.  We are saying there are areas to be considered.  The Minister might have different views and Deputy McDowell's party would have some different views. The left-wing parties certainly would have different views.</P>
    <P>Tax reform is not so much an economic or financial problem as a political one. We need a political structure to deal with the taking of resources from one area to apply to another.  That is what I am trying to construct here.  The best way to do it is to apply the strategy which has been successful for the past 12 months in this House.  We need to extend to the area of tax reform the consensus which exists on the control of debt and the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement. That consensus has been achieved between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the <Col N="177" /> Progressive Democrats who make up over 80 per cent of the membership of this House.  Let us see in Committee if we can agree strategies which we could not agree unilaterally for fear of one side bushwacking the other.  Has this not been the problem which has faced us for years? As soon as Party A propose any policy which offends some, Party B support those who are offended.  It is one of the great truisms of Irish politics that Mary does not vote for you because you kicked Mick.  If the Government kick Mick, the Opposition back Mick.</P>
    <P>Can we apply the obvious resources in this House to the idea of an all-party committee?  We need reform and I have outlined the kind of reform that is necessary. The resources are available but we must identify them and then take the political decisions to apply those resources to reduce the rates.  It is not a job for accountants but for politicians. All the information is there but we must apply it for political decision-making.  If there is no consensus, the committee will break down and then we will know it is not possible to get tax reform by consensus in this House.  On the other hand, if it succeeds we might go part of the way or all of the way, or we might even go beyond the targets I have set.  Really we have to match the UK system where the standard rate applies right up to approximately £19,000 for a single person.</P>
    <P>The second political input which I have in mind is something that Deputy McDowell took up as well.  As I see it, and our experience in Government would support this, the ultimate variable is the tax system.  The process of decision-making decides what will be done with health, what will be done with education, with agriculture, in industrial policy and so on.  There was great fun and it was marvellous in the late seventies in that Government where people with undeserved high reputations served as Ministers. Then the variable was borrowing, so one could decide what one liked inside in Cabinet and it did not get chucked across on top of the taxpayer but filtered out into increased borrowing.  It was marvellous sport altogether and it was grand <Col N="178" /> making decisions in those days.  The economics of digging holes and filling them up again was great fun; directives were sent out to the health boards and county councils all around the country asking why they had not taken on their 30 extra workers for the month of July.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond who is a great man for having Government memoranda to which he refers on occasions can, I am sure, produce the correspondence from the various health boards around the country.  The county councils receive a letter asking why they did not take on the 30 extra employees for that month.  Back comes the reply that first they have no tables for them, second, no chairs on which they can sit, third, no offices in which to put the chairs and tables if they had them and, fourth, there is no work for them anyway.  Another letter then goes down from the Minister for Health saying that it is Government policy and they must be taken on anyway.  That was the economics of the late seventies and I am quoting an actual example without naming the health board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Did that hurt the taxpayer?  Not on the day anyway, because all that happened was that more borrowing was done and the borrowing paid for it.  We have departed from those heady days now.  We do not have the alternative variable of borrowing; we are controlling the borrowing. So there is only one variable left &mdash; tax. It varies in one direction, upwards.  Even the Minister's modest proposals would cost £91 million this year and £152 million in a full year.  If one runs the table of little tax increases which the Minister has introduced in this budget it works out at around £90 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the rebate of VAT to farmers, the 5 per cent VAT on electricity, the proposal on cash cards which is now dropped and will be substituted for by the bank levy, the £30 million which came across from the ESB which is not a tax but a once-off payment from <Col N="179" /> the ESB, the imposition on pensions work out at around £90 million as well, and I am sure would reach £150 million too if we could extend them over the full year.  So there is no give away on tax.  It is substitution of one form of tax for another.  My question is: why should tax be always the variable?  One would not run one's own house that way.  One would not decide to make all the spending decisions first, to buy a microwave, a new video, new furniture and carpets and then decide on the level of pay to pay for all these things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Not in my house anyway.  No one could operate on that basis.  I know analogies between domestic situations and affairs of State are frequently fallacious and I accept all that, but it makes the point.  Why not do as has been done in other countries? When, in the teeth of the most massive opposition, the people took it into their own hands in Massachusetts with proposition 2½ and in California with proposition 13 to take property taxes down by 50 per cent, the politicians and the interest groups and the lobbies all said it would break the State, that it could not be done.  It was done and it did not break the State and the impetus for growth that was put into places like Massachusetts and California gave them the greatest growth rates in the United States as a result of tax reform, and Dukakis is a very strong contender for the Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So the proposition I am seeking to write into the Finance Bill that for the 1989-90 tax year we should have tax rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent is an attempt to introduce by statute the kind of obligation on a Government which was introduced by referendum in some of the States in America.  I am doing this in an attempt to point out that tax does not need to be the variable, that we could decide our tax rates and the amount we collect in tax, and expenditure decisions <Col N="180" /> would become the variables; it is a reversal of the abymsal approach to governing this country.</P>
    <P>Other people want to get in here. Deputy Mitchell wants to contribute to point out to Deputy McDowell and the Progressive Democrats that we have not forgotten about PRSI.  Deputy Mitchell outlined a very significant package of proposals on PRSI here in this House on the Social Welfare Bill.  The proposals on tax and the proposals we have made on other cost factors in the economy are to be taken as part of a package to try to relieve the road blocks to growth in this economy and to increase employment, reduce the dole queues and cut emigration.  It is a continuum of policy.  There are no contradictions; one is the development of the other.  I take Deputy McDowell's point. I know exactly what he is talking about. Unless something is done for the lower paid there will be a lot of traps put in and we will guarantee that in any tax reform system we will create a myriad of losers which will make it politically impossible for the decision to be taken.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am trying to construct a political framework within which we can take decisions to reform tax.  I believe those decisions are absolutely necessary to growth in the economy and consequently they are absolutely necessary in fulfilling our objectives of having more people at work and fewer people unemployed. To do that we need consensus in this House.  We have it applying to the debt problem already; let us apply it to tax reform.  Let us go further and borrow from the experience elsewhere and underpin that by a statutory obligation to achieve targets.  Then let us examine all areas including all the proposals of the Commission on Taxation together with areas of public expenditure if people think further cuts can be made in ease of tax rates, and let us see if there is consensus between that side of the House and this side of the House and the Progressive Democrats.  I am sure Deputy Desmond, whose heart is in this, will encourage us from the sidelines if he cannot come along with the proposition. That is what I am talking about.  It is not <Col N="181" /> fancy footwork.  It is an attempt to apply a political solution to what is a political problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In essence the amendments before us today are about tax, but what lies behind the import of the amendment is jobs.  It is clear that one of the greatest impediments to job creation here is the level of taxation, as has been so eloquently stated by Deputy Noonan here today and yesterday in his statement and, indeed, by Deputy McDowell.  The penal levels of taxation when combined with the PRSI charges both on employers and employees are the single biggest impediment to jobs and to enterprise. That is why we have never got the levels of growth here that have been achieved throughout the rest of northern Europe.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling that not just in the past five or ten years but over the past 60 years since independence, we have never achieved even half the level of growth of the rest of northern Europe, even in the heady days of high growth in the sixties. We are alone among the 13 countries in that league.  There are high fliers in Northern Europe and there are middle fliers but there is only one low flier and that is ourselves.  That is the reason we have never been able to create full employment.  It is why we have had to rely on emigration as a solution to our unemployment problems for so long. Admitteedly, there was a short period when emigration actually stopped and there was the reverse, there was some immigration for a few years.  If we do not get growth we will not get jobs.  It has been estimated that we need at least a 4 per cent growth for the true unemployment figures to remain static, that is assuming no distortions of emigration, no distortions of Jobsearch type schemes or no distortions of, for instance, pre-retirement schemes &mdash; taking people off the register &mdash; so that one is not comparing like with like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that we have 250,000 people unemployed and still have a very low female participation rate we would need much higher rates of growth if we were to take up all the slack in this economy <Col N="182" /> and to relieve much of the hopelessness and despair which is now a fact of life. Therefore, the proposals contained in the amendment tabled by Deputy Noonan are not, as <i>The Irish Times</i> stated today in its editorial, half thoughts.  In the light of what Deputy McDowell has said, the agreement of the Progressive Democrats to the all party committee suggested by Deputy Noonan, is a very significant step. I hope that The Workers' Party and the Labour Party will also agree to it so that they will not feel excluded and that there can be a genuine effort at an all party solution.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for this.  In Denmark where they have had a minority government for many years they have managed to create tens of thousands of jobs.  That minority government recognised that they were a minority government and set up a very effective all-party system in their parliament to the extent that before Ministers can agree to anything at Council of Ministers meetings in Brussels they must revert to their all party parliamentary committee.  That has worked wonders for Denmark where in excess of 100,000 extra jobs have been created over a short period.  Regarding job creation we need to be speaking in terms of at least that scale, if not greater.</P>
    <P>The OECD has said that Ireland has the income tax cum social welfare system which is most biased against employment. It can be no surprise, therefore, that we have the highest unemployment rate of all of the OECD countries.  Why is this?  It is because of the way we have done things.  Certainly it is because there has been excessive borrowing in the past which now has to be repaid at high levels of interest although these rates have reduced significantly compared with what they were.  That means the pre-emption of money which could otherwise be used to invest in the economy.  Much of the borrowing in the past was used for purposes which showed no return and therefore yielded no income to pay off the debt.  That debt is an albatros around our neck and a continuing difficulty though, as Deputy Noonan has said, very welcome progress has been made in the past <Col N="183" /> year because of the strategy laid down at Tallaght by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dukes, and because of the magnificent U-turn the Fianna Fáil Party made on assuming office.  We now need to develop that consensus.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan has said, we should not see this particular amendment in isolation. If it were to be treated in isolation a number of adverse things could be said about it.  It could be said that it favoured the better off but if it is taken in conjunction with the PRSI and other amendments which we put down to the Social Welfare Bill a few weeks ago in this House, it will be seen that the overall package is a very significant one.  It is not yet complete because there are other areas that have to be addressed particularly in the area of social legislation where the changes are not having the effects they were designed to have.</P>
    <P>In those amendments to the Social Welfare Bill we addressed precisely the question of the penal imposition on the lowly paid of PRSI and how that affected them compared with those in the social welfare system.  We proposed an amendment to allow the Minister to exempt by regulation the first £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000 or whatever of income and we also allowed him to compensate for that by increasing the upper limit, if he so wished, rather than have the £16,200 limit we have at present.  The Minister did not take on board that amendment even though it would not have forced him to do anything.  It would have given a great deal of flexibility to the Government. I thought it was a very sensible amendment &mdash; I tabled it.  On reflection the Government might wish to bring in a measure of that sort even this year.  It gives a great deal of extra flexibility in the area of the imposition of PRSI, on how PRSI affects particularly those on low pay and affects the relativity and replacement registers as between low pay and social welfare.</P>
    <P>These amendments were connected with our amendments on the family income supplement which is assessed on the basis of gross pay and not net pay, <Col N="184" /> thereby creating a major anomaly.  A person on social welfare gets into his hand a social welfare allowance.  A person in employment does not get gross pay into his hand, he gets his net pay and that is what has to be compared.  Very frequently because of the anomaly of using gross pay rather than net pay, under the family income supplement, a person on social welfare, especially if they have a family, can be better off on social welfare. Therefore there is an impediment to work because you cannot expect someone to go out and work for less than he will receive on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Similar amendments are needed to measure the differential rent and general medical services card areas so as to affect relativity between work and social welfare. Those changes would have greatly helped the lower paid.</P>
    <P>Our second proposal &mdash; and this is not original because it was proposed by the Commission on Taxation &mdash; was that we should not tax labour in our circumstances, even though people will rightly argue that the social security contributions of employers here are not at a particularly high percentage compared with some other countries.  That is not the point.  Other countries do not have the huge unemployment problem we have.  Because of the 12½ per cent tax on payroll there is an enormous incentive for employers to move expenditures off payroll so that it will not attract the 12½ per cent tax, and pay it in allowances such as travelling allowances, meal allowances etc. or, perhaps, to employ people in the black economy.  We proposed a social security levy on company turnover in lieu of part or all of the present payroll tax. That was a very radical proposal.  It was not new, though the idea of using the company turnover as a base was new. The idea of a social security levy rather than an employer's contribution on payroll was not new.</P>
    <P>Those amendments to the Social Welfare Bill were the first instalment and these amendments today are the third instalment of a developing radical policy in relation to employment.  It will not work unless it is very radical.  Without <Col N="185" /> being churlish I have to say on that point that we did not get the support of those parties on this proposal, nor were there any amendments from any other parties although there were very worthy contributions from Deputies Bell, De Rossa and Wyse.  The all-party committee &mdash; if it is agreed on, as I sincerely hope it will be &mdash; ought to look at all the areas creating road blocks to the generation of growth and the generation of jobs.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but no economist has come up yet with the answer to why it is not reflected in increased jobs.  The answer must be what the OECD have already identified as our total bias against employment in our social welfare and taxation systems.  I hope that the proposals made by Deputy Noonan will enjoy the support of other parties, including that of Deputy McDowell, who has already indicated a general willingness to participate in an all-party committee. Unemployment is the major problem that faces us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is running very late and we finish this debate at 7 p.m. <Col N="187" /> First, I agreed with many of the points made by Deputy McDowell in regard to high tax on labour as against low tax on capital.  This is a point that we have been making for many years.  It is time that it was addressed.  However, I am afraid I cannot support Deputy McDowell's amendment which is simply, particularly in the higher bracket, reducing the rate of tax from higher incomes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's amendment, apart from his proposed changing of the tax bands, proposes an all-party taxation committee.  In his opening remarks on my amendment to section 1, he dealt with many issues.  He made gestures about agreeing with the possibility of a large amount to be taken in property tax and such like.  It sounded quite good, that he was prepared to look at all the areas where tax could be taken, to make up for lower amounts taken from the PAYE taxpayers.  We have always said that that is precisely what we would like to see done.  We would like tax bands of the nature proposed by Fine Gael for workers.  However, we would clearly not want to see that amount made up, as Deputy Noonan was suggesting at his press conference and subsequently, by cuts in Government expenditure, more people now being allowed to do overtime or take a second job.  Double-jobbing would be all-the-go for people on the higher tax band.  When they would not have to pay so much on tax, they would be doing a lot more overtime and taking second jobs, which would mean fewer rather than more jobs being available for the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the proposals on what the all-party taxation committee should be doing: specifically, first, not to increase the current budget deficit &mdash; and we would go along with that &mdash; but, secondly, to examine the overall levels of public expenditure.  When he was speaking on this amendment Deputy Noonan said much about the variables and changing the attitudes of Ministers for Finance. Instead of collecting enough money to keep things going, you decide to collect a standard amount of money and then <Col N="188" /> see what you can do with that.  Deputy Noonan should realise that the variables are in our society, that the variables are there before us.  More people are becoming unemployed, and does he say that from now on if there are another 100,000 unemployed we shall not give them anything, we shall allow the Minister for Finance to have the standard amount as now?  Does he say there is no variable in social welfare, that we will not increase benefit as unemployment increases, that we will stop at 100,000 people, that any number over that gets nothing?  Does he say that there are no variables in education, that with increased the numbers of children you do not increase the numbers of teachers, but just manage on what you have?  Similarly, if there is more poverty and more health problems, you do not increase the services to those people, but just carry on with what you have?  That is absolute nonsense.  That is not how you run a society.  It is how you might like to run a business, with ruthlessness, where you do not care what happens to anybody so long as you make profits.</P>
    <P>That raises the point about which Deputy Mitchell was talking, that when there are increased profits and low inflation, how is it that there is not change in the number of jobs?  A very good example of that, Deputy, would be to look at the Fitzwilton report published recently.  Their profits went up from £176,000 in the first six months of last year to £1,008,000 in the second six months of last year, all without the increase of one job.  That profits go up does not mean an increase in jobs.  That sort of nonsense is being peddled to us here all the time.  We are being told all the time that we should allow the climate to be right.  The climate is great for making money, but it is not great for making jobs.  When people get the right climate in which to grab money they will do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the amount of tax foregone by the State and said that it amounted to about £600 million in reliefs for employees.  There was also £900 million at least in tax foregone for reliefs to businesses and industry and <Col N="189" /> so on.  They also get a further £400 million in grants and subsidies.  That amounts to £1,300 million in tax reliefs, grants and subsidies to private sector industries. That is never noted.  All we note is the few hundred million pounds that goes to the semi-State companies.  The private sector, instead of investing this money and developing new industries, agriculture, the seas and the forests, want to grab and privatise the public sector enterprises that are doing well.</P>
    <P>The State is wide open for development and expansion but the reason we cannot develop and expand is because of the attitude of the private sector which is to take whatever money is going and shout about getting the State off their backs.  How would they feel if the State got off their backs and did not give them the £900 million in tax reliefs and the £400 million in grants and subsidies?  In that event we would have money for education, for health services and for social welfare.  Only for the State the private sector would not be in business at all. We must keep that fact before us when talking about tax reliefs, benefits and jobs.</P>
    <P>Everybody says that what they are doing relates to jobs but I am saying it is not about jobs.  Tax relief for somebody going into the new financial services centre should be based on the production of jobs.  Since last year the Minister began thinking like this, that all grants and subsidies should be on the basis of projects and on the basis of results.  A firm might get a grant this year but if they do not show results they will not get it next year. That attitude should also prevail in relation to tax reliefs and benefits and then we would see jobs created.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that Deputy Noonan in his amendment is going to make up the £600 million tax which would be foregone from some other sectors if this amendment is accepted.  The Deputy did not show in his amendment where he would increase taxes to make up the £600 million which would be foregone and that is where the amendment falls.</P>
    <P>I would go along with the idea of a taxation committee as there are a number <Col N="190" /> of areas in which agreement could be reached, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The budget has already been passed and the plans are made for the year.  If the Deputy suggests an amendment cutting £600 milliion he must balance it up in some other way.</P>

I cannot go along with the prospect of more cuts on top of the cuts already implemented by both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I will keep an open mind on the proposal for an all-party committee on taxation as some benefits can come from it. However, I cannot support this amendment on the basis of the programme put before us by Deputy Noonan and on the basis of the other amendments which are being put to this Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things have been raised since we started this debate at 4 p.m. not only on these amendments but on others to section 1.  First, I refuse the criticism of this Bill that there are very few tax reform measures.  We have gone a significant way in tax reform, in relation to income tax, corporation tax, capital taxation and the problems of tax evasion, tax collection and enforcement, despite all the difficulties we face in the budgetary finances.  In the case of income tax we have given more than three times greater than what was contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and when £30 million would have done we <Col N="191" /> have given £90 million this year and £152 million in a full year, bringing nearly 63 per cent of taxpayers to the standard rate when we gave a commitment just over a year ago to have 66 and two-thirds of the population on the standard rate as soon as is possible.  We have come as far as 63 per cent in just one year.  Indeed, this is the first year for a considerable number of years when there has been a significant reduction in the number of people on the higher rates of tax.  Apart from a short lived period in 1980-81 due to the implications of the Murphy decision, the trend has been moving up from about 3 per cent of taxpayers on the high rates in 1974-75.  Following the Murphy decision this went up to 12 per cent and represented 14 per cent in 1981-82, 40 per cent in 1983-84, 42 per cent in 1984-85 and in 1985-86 there was a marginal drop to 40 per cent, moving to 42 per cent the year after and rising to 45 per cent in 1987.  This year the figure will drop to 37 per cent, a drop of 8 per cent.  That is significant progress, not to mention the corporation tax, the self-assessment collection system, power of attachment and all the rest.</P>
      <P>Turning to Deputy McDowell's amendment and discussions about the consensus that exists in the Dáil for radical tax reform, that would exist if one asked a child in the street but where are we to get the money?  Not one person in this debate so far has told us where to get one pound of the amount of money needed.  The amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell would cost £107 million this year and £179 million in a full year.  It is out of the question and it could not be tolerated.  The proposals put forward in Deputy McDowell's amendment which now does not include any committee or anything else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nothing could be further from the truth.  While considerable progress has been made since this Government came to office, we are not out of the wood yet.  A major gap remains to be bridged to reduce Exchequer borrowing and debt to sustainable levels. This year we will borrow £1,457 million and the debt-GNP ration is still rising. Against this background a sizeable budgetary adjustment, probably of the same order of magnitude as in 1988, will again be needed in 1989.  The proposals in this amendment have to regard to the budgetary position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality. We must now begin to look at what would be needed to come any way near implementation of this proposal costing £60 million.  Mortgage interest relief would be gone &mdash; £160 million.  Deputy Noonan and Fine Gael opposed a modest reduction in that last year.  The VHI relief costing £48 million would be gone.  Life assurance relief which cost £44 million <Col N="193" /> would be gone and lump sum retirement allowance would be taxed which would cost £49 million.  Is this what Fine Gael have in mind or do they envisage imposing a 15 per cent VAT rate on food? An alternative option would be to charge social welfare to tax which would bring in £76 million.  If we were to put a VAT rate of 5 per cent on food it would bring in £101 million and a property tax could bring in between £150 million and £250 million.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by repeating again what Deputy Dukes as Minister for Finance said in 1984.  He said however desirable it may be to reduce taxation this cannot be done on a significant scale, if at all, until current expenditure is reduced and the current budget deficit eliminated.  We are a long way from that and I must say that I am disappointed that such glib proposals in relation to tax reform have been put forward.  The greatest efforts on tax reform in recent years, definitely in my time in the Dáil, have been made by this Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> It gives me very great pleasure to move this Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats and I hope it will receive support from all sides of the House.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1988, is not just timely but long overdue.  This evening I want to extract, if I can, from all sides of the House a clear commitment that the Bill will be accepted and enacted at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>During the years there have been a number of obvious and glaring abuses and scandals in planning law and the current Minister for the Environment is as aware of these as I am.  One of these abuses, which has been the source of public scandal and which has added to the burden on the taxpayer, is the extraordinary anomaly in planning law which allows often spurious and speculative developments to obtain from the public purse compensation which is completely unjustified in so far as it appears to award compensation to an applicant because of a refusal of planning permission.  In some cases these people must have known that the application they were making was in definace of development plans, of any legitimate expectations of what reasonably could be conceded by local authorities and in some cases against the common good.  Nevertheless, they were awarded massive sums in compensation and that has been the source of scandal. It is an abuse which should cease.</P>
    <P>There are other abuses which this Bill seeks to deal with.  One abuse which some builders, a minority I hope, engage in is on having built estates of houses and on having sold them to young couples who quite often are hard pressed to raise the money they clear off leaving essential work undone.  In some cases they set up similar companies down the road to replicate this kind of cowboy operation.  We are all aware of those who do not fulfil their obligations to those with whom they have been doing business.  The local authorities have found themselves powerless to act against these people and successive administrations have ignored the plight of such people.  This Bill offers a clear <Col N="195" /> and immediate way of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Those scandals, and they are no less than that, which over the years have obtained in planning law and which were a form of speculators' charter in some cases are represented, as I have said, by the present bizarre entitlements to financial compensation from the hard-pressed taxpayer arising from the turning down of often spurious planning applications and the shirking of responsibilities by some of these builders &mdash; I stress a minority &mdash; who on pocketing the proceeds from the sale of houses walk away from their responsibilities to finish off the estates they leave behind.</P>
    <P>Those are key elements in this Bill.  I want the Government to accept this Bill as it is in the public interest that these abuses cease and that measures identical to the measures contained in this Bill are enacted as a matter of urgency.  These abuses have cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and have created major social and economic discomfort.  Our Bill will end those abuses and deserves to receive support from all sides.  I do not anticipate any particular problems from either the Government or Fine Gael.  I do not anticipate any problems in terms of support from the Government because in this context the Taoiseach was quite explicit during the recent general election campaign.  At a conference in Dublin city centre organised by the Dublin Crisis Conference he said that he accepted that there was a problem in the law which needed to be dealt with.  His exact words were:</P>
    <P>It should have been done long ago but it has only come into acute focus in the last couple of years and quite frankly I don't think anybody ever anticipated that the Supreme Court would hand down the sort of decision it did in the Dún Laoghaire case but we are all agreed now that it will be dealt with one way or another immediately.</P>
    <P>In replying in writing to a questionnaire sent by that organisation to all parties to <Col N="196" /> elicit their responses to the need for policy initiatives in the city centre Fianna Fáil said and I quote:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to introducing new legislation to close the loophole which has led to recent High Court decisions awarding large compensation sums to developers.  We do not accept that it is necessary to amend the Constitution to achieve this but instead we will concentrate on (a) amending section 56 of the 1963 Planning Act so that zoning of land is a non-compensatable reason for refusal and (b) amend the 1977 Planning Act so that An Bord Pleanála will have a code of practice requiring it to specify non-compensatable reasons for refusal where these apply.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate any problems in getting support from Fine Gael because, quite frankly, we on this side of the House have been quite breathtaken by the degree to which they have in recent days endorsed our policies in a number of respects &mdash; taken aback might be more appropriate &mdash; and accordingly we expect an immediate and very warm embrace for this most recent policy emanation from our party, similar to the embrace for our taxation proposals which initially were given a bit of a hammering by the side who yesterday announced that they are now delighted to welcome the same principles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go down that road any further as it would be too provocative and because this is a night on which we should all unite behind a reasonable and sensible measure.  The principal proposals in this legislation include the ending of the open-ended right to compensation for often speculative developments which the taxpayer currently has to pay for arising out of the legitimate refusal by a planning authority of planning applications which in their judgment contravene their draft development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> This measure, when enacted, will also remove the definite pressure that exists on local authorities to grant such planning permissions against their better judgment, under the threat of large compensation claims.  Many of us are aware of instances where such permissions have been granted reluctantly and against the better instincts of local authorities because they feared they would receive a massive compensation claim and that is a shame.  Once again this penalises those who play by the rules and who accept the verdict of planning authorities or of An Bord Pleanála in these matters and apparently rewards those who believe that you can and should ride a coach-and-four through these pieces of legislation.</P>
    <P>The second major measure in the Bill is, as I have mentioned, the appalling abuse of unfinished housing estates all over the country.  Although for some reason this has not caught the public imagination in the same way as the first abuse has, it has caused probably the same, if not more, distress economically and socially to many couples already hard pressed to try to raise money for mortgages and for their ordinary day to day needs.  Under this Bill that will end because local authorities will be given the power to insist on a sequence of development in their planning permission which will ensure that the essential infrastructure or basic facilities which are necessary in any community will be put in place before the houses are occupied. It is quite wrong that some, the chancers engaged in this activity who are unfortunately a reflection on the legitimate builders and are detrimental to the interests of all right-minded people who are interested in seeing the developments coming on stream, have not just done this once or twice but continue to replicate their anti-social activities.  Despite the promise of Fianna Fáil a long time ago that action would follow immediately, nothing has happened to date.  This Bill, therefore, has to be a watershed in that respect.  It points the way forward to ensuring that that abuse ceases.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision in the Bill that where a developer has not completed a <Col N="198" /> development in accordance with the terms of a permission, a planning receiver who will carry out that work and ensure that the developer pays the cost can be appointed.  The concept of the planning receiver is, like much of what this party put forward, new and radical.  It proposes a system which will not rely on the labyrinthine processes of out-dated law in order to bring about the progress that is necessary.  It is a measure which, if the local authority fails in the normal way to insist on proper standards, will allow them to go immediately to the courts to have the receiver appointed, to have him or her do the job and pursue the developer for the costs.  They are not going to pussyfoot around for years while some developer rides a coach-and-four through the courts and exercises an infinite appeal to the courts for an effective delay, wearing down the patience, not just of the local authority but also of the unfortunate residents who in many cases at present have to band together in order to insist on minimal standards of environmental provision and facility for their families. That abuse exists at present and is being over-seen by the Government as it was over-seen by their predecessors.  When the Minister intervenes in this debate I want him to commit himself to accepting the Bill for that reason.  He is the recipient, as is everyone in this House, of pleas from people who find themselves in that situation.</P>
    <P>The third measure is very important from our point of view, as a party who believe that there should be easy and relatively inexpensive recourse to justice for any citizen and for local authorities. The whole process of pursuing those who behave in this anti-social manner is made, in this Bill, easier and less expensive.  A Circuit Court will be given the powers, under the appropriate section of the Bill, to deal with requests for planning injunctions, rather than the High Court as heretofore. That recourse to the High Court is available and has worked but is unnecessarily cumbersome and expensive and therefore, particularly in view of the relative paucity of funds which this <Col N="199" /> Minister has made available to local authorities, is likely to be less utilised than has been the case up to now.  There is no reason the Circuit Court should not be given the opportunity of making an adjudication on applications by local authorities for planning injunctions where such urgent action is required. That is reasonable and in the common good.  Therefore, quick and inexpensive recourse could be had to the law and the courts would have power to make orders which are mandatory in character.  That would be a significant and effective change in the legislation.  It would ensure not just that there is a cosmetic exercise of going through the legal motions but that the court will have real power to make public policy which will stick in a case like this.  We can see no valid argument, therefore, for not granting to circuit courts the powers to operate in this area in order to ensure that the kind of fly-by-night operator, which this Bill is designed to get at, is dealt with quickly, efficiently and as inexpensively as possible.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the bizarre situation at present operating in relation to the obligation on sanitary authorities and local authorities to provide various essential services, such as sewerage services, to developments, even when they are illegal, is removed and the onus is shifted to where it should be, in favour of the local authority and the taxpayer.  It is quite preposterous that somebody who has proceeded illegally with a development is, in the eyes of some people, still entitled to exact from the taxpayer and the nearest local authority a service for the disposal of sewage and so on from his or her development.  That is clearly nonsensical.  Some of us might suggest that in other areas of law we might go a little further, if we are serious about such illegal planning developments, and say that no service which the State has an influence in providing should be made available to those who contravene the law.  That is perhaps another day's debate and I do not want to unnecessarily widen this debate.  This Bill makes provision to <Col N="200" /> deal rapidly with another area of abuse at present on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>We want to make clear that we are still on the side of protecting the fundamental rights of people who own property and land.  We are not suggesting that we should rewrite that fundamental principle or indeed rewrite the Constitution in any way.  We are simply saying that people with property have obligations as well as rights and that we are endeavouring to redress the imbalance which has been allowed to develop over years of neglect politically and from a legislative point of view, to the extent that local authorities consider themselves to be under this kind of pressure.  In this respect at least we have no intention of rewriting the Constitution. The rights of individuals are still important to us, although I have to add that there are other areas in which we are quite happy to rewrite the Constitution and, if the Whips of the House allow it, we will be quite happy to debate that some other night.  However, that is not an issue in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not want someone to raise the perennial red herring of constitutional difficulty that is raised whenever someone does not want to do anything, as a reason for inaction in this case.  That will not wash for a number of reasons.  If the Minister has taken the trouble, as I am sure he has, to read paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill he will see that there are a number of legal cases, the details of which I do not intend to go into but which show that the courts have once again been nudging the arm of Government to do something in this area. Those cases clearly indicate that there is no rational basis for any concern in this respect.  The 1989 case of Pine Valley Developments Limited <i>v.</i> Minister for the Environment clearly indicated that there was no real foundation for any such fears.  It is no harm to point that out lest someone may use it as an argument for dodging or weaving away from the essential issue.  Planning permission in respect of speculative developments has been described as an enhancement to property rights and a bonus in that case.  In that case also the Supreme Court held that <Col N="201" /> a property developer could not sue for breach of constitutional rights when a planning permission was declared invalid by the courts as there was no constitutional right to planning permission in respect of such speculative developments.</P>
    <P>The court went beyond that in the X.J.S. Investments Limited case when it actually queried whether &ldquo;legislation which appears to authorise such a use of public funds is constitutionally proper&rdquo; in itself.  In other words, in so far as the courts have given any indication in these matters, they have said quite clearly and explicitly that the present mechanics which operate are probably in breach of the Constitution.  I do not want this argument trotted out here because whenever anybody wants to give a excuse for doing nothing, they invariably mention the Constitution.  The Constitution is not an argument against accepting this Bill and it should not be so produced.</P>
    <P>We are quite happy to assert that the land owner still has the right to receive compensation when a refusal of planning permission effectively means that he cannot develop his land within the reasonable and lawful expectations which he would normally enjoy under the development plan for his area or under any reasonable expectation in terms of the zoning for that area or under any other relevant criteria.  We do not believe that someone who has land, and whose application for planning permission is turned down because it is in open conflict with the development plan for the area, should get compensation relevant to the notional value of the permission for which he or she applied.  That is what we are aiming at in this Bill.  I want to emphasise that there is no suggestion of undermining any constitutional right in the matter.  The constitutionality of this has been dealt with very comprehensively in our Explanatory Memorandum which sets out clearly the reasons there is no basis for any suggestion that this Bill can be challenged on these grounds.</P>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, as is normal procedure, I wish to allow Deputy Martin Cullen to take the remainder of my time. <Col N="202" /> I appeal to the Government who were explicit last February when they were in a givish mood, and they were particularly givish in this respect and put it in writing. I am not one who waves documents in front of people because that sort of thing is over-played as a political device, particularly when there is a library of such documents which could be produced on occasions like this, but the vehement and explicit commitment of the Taoiseach on that occasion was a joy to behold.  I was present at that debate and there was no suggestion of equivocation, ambiguity or any wobbling which occasionally occurs. The Taoiseach said there would be action &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;, and he then put it in writing that his party, Fianna Fáil, did not see a problem constitutionally and would go further, and he went on to say precisely how they would deal with this. When we considered the issue we were happy to be able to embody some of the thinking in that expressed commitment in our Bill.  If the Minister says this is a good Bill and he accepts it, I will be very interested to hear what excuse he produces for any kind of prevarication.</P>
    <P>I am overcome at Fine Gael's enthusiasm for accepting our policies and I am looking forward to their warm endorsement of this Bill.  I do not see any inhibition on their part in endorsing our policies these days, and we welcome that even if it is a latter day conversion and if, in some cases, our bruises are barely recovering from the hammering we got during the election when we suggested certain radical ideas in the taxation area, which are now to be the basis of a broad political consensus.  I remember taking some stick from my erstwhile colleagues &mdash; and, who knows, ideologically identical colleagues on this issue at least &mdash; when I mentioned that during the elections. I am looking forward to their support.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says tonight that he thought about this Bill and is in favour of it, but that it is flawed and he has a better Bill on the stocks &mdash; that has happened on previous occasions &mdash; part of me will be elated but another part of me will be deeply suspicious.  Like Thomas when <Col N="203" /> Christ appared to him I need to see the wounds.  I need to see the heads of the Bill chapter and verse and I need explicit commitments on the date of introduction before we suggest even considering whether we should make any kind of gesture in terms of conciliation to this Government who, by and large, have neglected and ignored this area.  We are not unwilling to listen to any reasonable offer from a Minister who, now and again, has proved to be quite reasonable in his approach to these matters.  I want to see in black and white, or even in technicolour, precisely what the Minister has in mind.  I would possibly want to see it in triplicate before I would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I will ask my colleague, Deputy Harney, to answer this debate next week. In the meantime I have no doubt a number of my colleagues will want to contribute.  I formally move the adoption of this Bill by the Dáil.  I appeal to all sides to accept it.  We all know the principle is right.  My party are not hung up about dotting an &ldquo;i&rdquo; or crossing a &ldquo;t&rdquo; if an amendment is appropriate.  We are not pretending this is the last word on these matters but we can claim truthfully it is the first word in any real sense in trying to do something about this problem.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I have great pleasure in commending this Bill to the House.  I will ask my colleague, Deputy Cullen, to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect this Bill will receive the support of the House.  There have been many discussions about the recognition and need for this type of Bill. As Deputy Keating said, the Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have spoken on this issue on many occasions and all have commented on the need for up to date legislation in this area.  Sadly, that is all there has been, discussion and more discussion, &ldquo;the need for,&rdquo;&ldquo;in the event of&rdquo;, and &ldquo;another review&rdquo; and &ldquo;We are considering,&rdquo; until tonight when at last some party in the Dáil &mdash; again the Progressive Democrats &mdash; have come forward with an initiative in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> We are dealing with a fundamental issue which affects many people in this country, particularly young married people who are our future.  I speak on this Bill as a victim of what existing legislation has been doing.  Some years ago as a young married man facing his first mortgage I ended up in an estate where all the problems we are facing today were an issue.  It is wrong for politicians to go on talking about doing something in this area while, at the same time, being patronising to those directly affected.  There is no need for any further long debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>We have brought forward a Bill which encompasses directly many of the issues which are fundamental to planning and development.  Our Bill is designed specifically to encompass immediately those areas which need to be dealt with. We are not saying it is something which has to be laid down in tablets of stone, but what I am saying &mdash; and what my party are definitely saying &mdash; is that this Bill should be passed by this House and the waffling should stop.  If, at some future date, there is a need in other areas, we will not wait for the Government or anybody else to do something about it. We will be to the fore in updating that legislation.  I hear rumours that the Minister has another Bill on the stocks.  Perhaps we will welcome it, but that should in no way prevent the Government accepting this Bill.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this Bill is crystal clear. Local authorities should not be liable to pay either individuals or companies compensation in all cases in the event of planning permission being refused either by the local authorities or by An Bord Pleanála. We are all only too aware of the massive funding problems which local authorities are facing at present and the added burden of implied blackmail, when they refuse planning permission and leave themselves open to a substantial payment of compensation, is wrong.  This is something which the taxpayer who ultimately foot the Bill should not have to bear.</P>
    <P>We have seen far too many cases where <Col N="205" /> local authorities, because of their financial state, had to grant planning permission. They feared what the cost of the compensation would be, and they could not afford to pay money in this area. Even if a development was blatantly not in the interest of a particular area, they succumbed and let it go through.  That is not the way planning in an even and proper way should proceed.  It is contrary to the way a small island should want to develop.  We have a natural amenity infrastructure which must be protected and which can be of great benefit to us in the long term.</P>
    <P>Haphazard building developments carried out in an unplanned way take greatly from the natural beauty and amenities that are on offer.  The existing legislation is far too broad.  It greatly favours the interests of the individual or company rather than the interests of the local authority or indeed the local inhabitants.  This Bill will narrow greatly the areas of entitlement for compensation.  When the Bill is enacted the balance will be weighted much more fairly.  It will still allow for compensation to be paid where planning permission is refused for a development which is similar to the existing use and generally compatible with the development plan for the area.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important issue. Where genuine plans are submitted which are directly compatible with the objectives for the area, the local authority or indeed An Bord Pleanála should not be allowed at their whim to knock this type of development.  Obviously developments which are within the confines of the requirements for the area should be allowed to go ahead and if the local authority, for peculiar reasons, refuse permission, then compensation should be granted in those cases.  But that certainly redefines the grounds for which compensation should be paid.</P>
    <P>Granting the Circuit Court the full powers to handle this matter is also an important point in the Bill.  This will be of great benefit to local authorities in terms of the cost and speed with which the claims can be dealt with.  At present the cost involved in going to the High <Col N="206" /> Court is unnecessary and is an extra burden which had to be borne in mind by local authorities when considering such action.  I have no doubt that the Circuit Court will be able to deal fully and effectively with these matters.  It is obvious that those directly involved in the area of planning and indeed in the pursuit of proper development could be greatly hindered by the cost of going to the High Court, the slowness of that procedure and the consequences of what that means.  That is patently wrong.  There is no reason why matters of this magnitude should not be dealt with by the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>There is another very important issue dealt with in the Bill.  At present if a builder blatantly knocks down a building without having permission to do so, the only powers available are to stop him going any further.  At present there are no powers available to actually force him to replace the building he has destroyed. That is completely wrong.  In this day and age a JCB can wander on to a site in the middle of the night and flatten half of it and there is no recourse to the law to make that person replace the building. There is only recourse to prevent him from going further.  That is not right. This Bill deals with that issue, and in my opinion quite rightly so.  I have seen examples of this in my constituency and I am sure there are many more around the country.  In my constituency of Waterford a specific example occurred where the facade of a beautiful building was totally destroyed and nobody had recourse to the law to have the facade replaced.  The builder was prevented going further with his demolition job but the damage had already been done.  Ultimately when the hot issue died away the builder achieved what he had originally intended; that he would do the initial damage, put up with the ballyhoo in the meantime and eventually carry on regardless.  It should be greatly welcomed that the Bill deals with this issue.</P>
    <P>One of the most imaginative and necessary aspects of the Bill is that it allows the planning authorities to have real control over the sequence and duration of works <Col N="207" /> to be carried out on a particular site.  We are only too familiar with housing estates scattered throughout the country &mdash; and my own constituency is no exception &mdash; where builders have blatantly failed to bring the roads, footpaths and lighting up to a reasonable standard.  This is clearly an appalling and dangerous state of affairs and leaves new residents in a hopeless situation with regard to having the infrastructure of their estates completed.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that bona fide builders will be pleased with this aspect of the legislation, because many of them adhere to this standard.  The cowboy or fly-by-night builders abuse the system and thereby wreck the reputation of builders in general.  I would like to see this remedied in the very near future.  I am sure the Minister has seen estates on the Continent where the roads, footpaths and lighting are completed before a house is built on the proposed development.  We are not going that far at present.  But it has been shown quite clearly that these standards can be adhered to and there is no reason we should not aspire to similar standards.  This would immediately do away with the builder who is under-capitalised, and chancing his arm on having a go.  He then walks away at the end of the day leaving huge problems behind him.  This is totally wrong.</P>
    <P>Another practice creeping into the estates being built at present, particularly the larger ones, is that the builder also develops a small shopping area.  This is generally located at the front of the estate and is usually developed by the same builder who is building the houses.  On numerous occasions the shopping area has been pitifully developed.  Some of the units are taken up but the whole landscaping and infrastructure at the front of the estate is left undone.  This is totally abused.  That is dangerous.  It is a danger to the residents, generally young couples and their children.  There is no proper development of the infrastructure in many of these estates and the way the front of the estates are left is a serious <Col N="208" /> consequence of the unplanned and wide-ranging facilities for builders to proceed with.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down quite clearly a staged process of development giving the local authority real power to have them implemented and to actually prevent the builder developing further and selling the houses if he has not adhered to the proper infrastructural development on the stages as agreed when planning permission was granted.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a planning receiver is a very imaginative step forward.  This will give the courts a tangible course of action to prevent the maverick builder or developer from abandoning one development and starting another, and to repeat another substandard development, which is the curse of residents in new estates.  I think this is a very forward-looking provision in the context of legislation.  It certainly allows and gives real meat to prevent builders from doing a half-baked job and abandoning the estate and going elsewhere.  The full weight being given to the planning receiver by the courts to go in and to prevent that developer developing elsewhere or indeed getting involved in any other development is extremely important because it puts a definite onus on him or her to complete the housing estate.  That needed to be looked at.  I think the way it is put forward in the Bill encompasses the thrust of what is desired.  I think it should be wholeheartedly welcomed.</P>
    <P>The obligation placed on local authorities at present with regard to public sewerage systems puts an open-ended strain on the purse of the local authority irrespective &mdash; I think this is very important &mdash; of the merits or demerits of the development being carried out.  I believe it is right that there should be some financial contribution from the developer towards the cost of providing the sewerage system in the development.  This will have the added effect of providing proper sewerage facilities in the first instance rather than the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which sometimes pertain at present.  The <Col N="209" /> Minister will know the state of local authority funding better than I do, in circumstances in which local authorities have allowed new developments to be linked into existing sewerage systems.  I can cite one glaring example of a new estate having been built at a much higher level than an existing sewerage system which served an older estate below its level.  The net result was that houses of original residents in that area were absolutely flooded.  The whole system collapsed, destroying the whole area.  That is the type of practice being allowed at present.  It is a problem which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are sufficiently imaginative to address such problems.  While Deputies might smile at the example I have given, I contend that the provisions of this Bill are a relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tréaslú i dtús báire leis an Teachta Keating as ucht an Bhille seo a chur romhainn.  Is trom agus is práinneach na fadhbanna a bhaineann le cúiteamh i gcúrsaí pleanála, agus is cuí an díospóireacht seo leis an cheist a phlé go hionraic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remote origins of a formal system of physical planning in Ireland go back to 1934.  The modern planning system, based on the 1963 Planning Act, is now some 25 years old.  Planning, of its nature, involves a trade-off between the rights of private property and the requirements of the common good.  It is not surprising that controversy and difficulty have attended its operation.  It is not surprising either that there should be widely different views about the value of the planning <Col N="210" /> system, with developers tending to emphasise its restraining effect on development and cost to the economy and that conservationists should be critical that it has not realised their goals more clearly.</P>
    <P>Given these divergent views, it is possible to wonder if any demonstrable good at all has come of our 25 years' experience of modern planning.  Certainly the system has its faults, which have been addressed periodically in successive amending measures.  But it is surely beyond doubt that, in the most dynamic quarter century of physical development in the history of this country, the existence of formalised planning has stood between us and physical chaos.</P>
    <P>Throughout the period in question, land has been absorbed for development at the rate of 4,000 to 6,000 acres per year; nearly a half million new houses have been built, together with the greater part of the industrial warehousing now in use in the State.  Urbanisation has also proceeded at its fastest rate ever.</P>
    <P>Despite all criticisms of it, the planning system has channelled this massive development process into orderly paths. Development has been broadly contained within the areas planned by local authorities for servicing and major road lines have also been held against encroachment of development.  By thus avoiding the need for duplication or proliferation of public services, the planning system has done a good job for the taxpaying public.</P>
    <P>Irish planning legislation has, necessarily, been framed with an eye to the qualified guarantee given by the Constitution to the rights of private ownership. Given that the virtual <i>raison d'être</i> of the planning system is to regulate and restrain development rights in the common interest, this means that some arrangements for compensation are inescapable in our planning code.  How exactly these arrangements should be drawn or delimited is a matter for legitimate debate.  But it would not be defensible, as a matter of principle, to exclude a compensation facility from Irish planning law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> It is striking that, while there have been many changes in planning law as the system has evolved since 1963, the provisions on planning compensation included in the 1963 Act have undergone very little change in 25 years.  Section 55 of the 1963 Act lays down the general principle that if, as a result of a decision to refuse planning permission or impose conditions, the value of a person's property interest is reduced, that person shall be entitled to compensation from the planning authority in the amount of the reduction.</P>
    <P>However, while this general statement of principle is technically correct, in practice it is rather misleading.  The exceptions laid down in section 56 to the general right to compensation are so extensive that no widespread rights to compensation arise in the administration of planning control.  For instance, of the 183,000 planning applications decided by local authorities between 1982 and 1986 claims for compensation arose in 130 cases only.  Only nine of these claims have actually been paid, in most cases on the basis of a reduced compensation award. Total compensation paid by local authorities in this period came to just £82,000.</P>
    <P>It is relatively difficult, then, to adduce strict quantified or statistical evidence that planning compensation is a widespread problem.  However, the potential financial loss to local authorities even from the small number of claims made is extremely worrying.  The 130 claims made between 1982 and 1986 amount, on their face, to nearly £70 million.</P>
    <P>There has been a growing consensus in recent years that compensation is posing invidious problems for planning authorities, in major urban areas in particular. Certain well publicised cases on their face have suggested that the present legal provisions on compensation are open to exploitation by speculative interests and that planning authorities are being unduly hampered in exercising necessary planning control by the fear of inflated claims for compensation being <Col N="212" /> sustained against them.  In this sense, statistics may not show the true or full picture. There is a widespread perception that the threat of incurring heavy compensation liabilities is inhibiting the proper exercise of planning judgment in certain cases.</P>
    <P>The problem of planning compensation, and the associated one of the right of connection to public sewers, has been clearly identified by this Government and targeted for remedial action. Our pre-election document on <i>Construction and the Environment</i> dealt with it extensively.  It was underlined again in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I am pleased to inform the House that work on the complex issues involved in my Department has now advanced to the stage where a general scheme of a Bill has been approved by the Government and sent to the Attorney General for priority drafting.  Therefore I expect to be in a position before long to circulate comprehensive legislative proposals on compensation to the House.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I acknowledge the timelines and the conscientious intent of the Bill before us.  It makes common cause with the Government's stated proposals on a number of important questions, notably on restricting further the entitlement to compensation where a proposal conflicts with objectives of the development plan and on better regulation of access to public sewers. Reluctantly, however, I have to regard the Bill before us as deficient in a number of material respects.</P>
    <P>For example, it would leave the law unchanged on undertakings between local authorities and private developers, even though as a result of the <i>Grange Developments v. Dublin County Council</i> decision, the provision involved has been found by local authorities to have extremely limited effectiveness.  Neither does the Bill in any way review the present rules for determining the amount of compensation awards made by the property arbitrator.</P>
    <P>In addition, the advice available to me is that the basic legal premise of the present Bill may also be too simplistic, <Col N="213" /> and that the wider definition of &ldquo;use&rdquo; for the purposes of section 56 (1) of the Planning Act, 1963, is unlikely to resolve compensation problems to the extent claimed for it in the Explanatory Memorandum. More precisely, I have some concern about the possible effect of the amendment proposed to section 56 (1) (a) of the 1963 Act under section 3 (a) of the Bill &mdash; this amendment is proposed arising from the judgment in the Viscount Securities Limited case.  My concern is that the amendment may go too far and in so doing could give rise to serious problems leading in turn to constitutional difficulties.  It seems to be very far-reaching in that it could lead to a virtually total exclusion of compensation where it applies.</P>
    <P>I would find it regrettable also that a Bill to resolve planning compensation problems should not address the preservation of amenity trees in woodlands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coolattin situation brought difficulties to light in seeking to achieve this kind of preservation and it was the threat of compensation under section 45 of the 1963 Act which created the problem.  During Second Stage debate on the Private Members' Bill titled &ldquo;The Local Government (Trees and Woodlands) Bill, 1987&rdquo;, I pointed out that the Government accepted that there was a need for a general review of the compensation provisions of the Planning Acts and that we intended that this review be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As I have just said, this work has now advanced to drafting stage.  It will, of course, propose a solution to the preservation issue in line with the commitment which I gave last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the present Bill is silent in respect of the kind of transitional provision which is customary and necessary in a measure such as this.  What is to happen in relation to rights of compensation arising under existing legislation up to the enactment of the present <Col N="214" /> Bill?  Are they to immediately close or will they be claimable under the provisions of the old legislation?  I am not seeking to impugn the considerable efforts of the drafters of this Bill or to dictate a particular solution to these transitional issues.  The Bill's silence on them is, however, a technical deficiency unacceptable in a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>I should like to outline briefly the main elements of the general scheme of the Bill prepared in my Department which is now with the Attorney General.  It goes to sever the present link between the planning compensation code and the compulsory purchase compensation code and tightening up the market value basis for assessment of compensation.  It also goes to restore the law on &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; to the position which obtained prior to recent court judgments and will strengthen certain aspects of it.  It will allow planning authorities much wider grounds for refusing planning permission on grounds of deficiency of water supplies or sewerage facilities without incurring a liability to compensation.  It will remove the liability for compensation in any case where the refusal of permission is on the grounds that the proposed development would conflict with an objective of the development plan.  It will amend the law on tree preservation orders to allow for better protection of amenity trees.  It will regulate the right of connection to public mains services.  It will also widen the circumstances in which permission can be refused without incurring a liability to pay compensation.  It is a comprehensive package to deal with the problems we all agree exist.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, request Deputy Keating, in the most constructive spirit possible, to withdraw the present Bill on the grounds that it is deficient.  I assure the House, as I have already stated, that I have a comprehensive framework in hands which will deal with the problem of compensation and related issues.  I offer the further assurance, here and now that when the Bill is debated, I will be open to all reasonable amendments for its improvement.  I believe that is in all our interests.</P>

      <P>Although planning compensation is the central issue of the present Bill, it contains a number of other proposals for improving planning administration on which I would now like to comment.  Section 4 proposes to add access to the Circuit Court for an injunction against unauthorised development to the present access which the Planning Acts give to the High Court only.  This idea has been mooted for some time and on its face it has certain attractions.  It is a fact, however, that the High Court provisions have worked quite well and we should be careful about changes in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, provisions similar to those of the Planning Acts are now also contained in other major environmental legislation, that is, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  If we are to adopt the amendment proposed by section 4, it would be consistent to apply it to these other enactments also.  I am certainly prepared, however, to consider the intentions of section 4 in a more general review of miscellaneous provisions of the Planning Acts but I do not think <Col N="216" /> this is the way to do it because it applies to many other statutes also.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 address the problem of unfinished estates.  This is a matter which I feel deserves some comment.  The provisions in the Bill are basically too particular, and better administration and practice and more vigorous enforcement seem to me to be the key to tackling this problem.  Conditions regarding the sequence of completion of works on estates are common practice and my Department's Development Control Guidelines which were circulated in 1982 recommended such an approach for large, schemes.  Some planning authorities have arrangements where they will not release a &ldquo;certificate of compliance&rdquo; with the planning permission unless they are satisfied that planning permission conditions are fully met.  The lending institutions generally require this and the planning authorities find it a useful tool in securing satisfactory completion, although as we all know the cash buyer or the buyer on bridging finance very often takes up occupation without requesting a certificate such as this but the person buying could request such a certificate.  However, in general, buyers in the large housing estates require the certificate of compliance and this enables the planning authority to keep a reasonable degree of control.</P>
    <P>I recognised that problem on taking up office and my Department have recently completed a survey of unfinished estates from returns furnished by the planning authorities.  The survey has shown that there are about 300 estates countrywide which remain unfinished with work to be done at an estimated cost of £4 million.  One of the most significant facts which the survey has shown up is that in a substantial number of cases the developer or builder is either in liquidation or has left the jurisdiction and cannot be pursued through the courts. This is a very difficult problem to resolve. The powers already available under section 27 of the 1976 Act are quite strong and enable a planning authority to seek a High Court order to compel defaulting <Col N="217" /> developers to comply with development permission and this procedure is frequently used quite successfully by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Enforcing the court order is where the problem very often lies.  If there is an immediate cash flow problem for the builder or developer a planning authority may hold off in the hope that matters will improve and the necessary works will be finished.  If they press too hard the builder or developer may be forced into liquidation in which case the court order is of little or no value, so in practice the planning authority has to strike a quite difficult balance on when to exercise pressure and when to hold back.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly I find it difficult to envisage how the concept of a planning receiver could work.  It might appear to offer a solution to the problem of unfinished development but in practice its effectiveness is questionable.  Most builders of good repute want to preserve their reputation.  Those cases where a planning receiver might have a role would seem to be fairly limited and the danger that the planning authority would ultimately have to foot the bill is quite real.  I am at present examining the results of my Department's survey to see what measures can be taken to minimise the problem. The kind of measures I am considering following the returns having been received include early action and a vigorous enforcement programme by planning authorities; the impositions of appropriate conditions in permissions to copperfasten the provisions of adequate security for completion and new approaches and initiatives in the area of security which have been adopted with apparent success in some areas.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Construction Industry Development Board of my Department's survey results and I have asked the board for their advice and recommendations on dealing with the problems encountered.</P>
    <P>As I said already, there are aspects to this Private Member's Bill which are <Col N="218" /> consistent with the Government's stated proposals and which I can accept in principle, but because the Government's own proposals are more comprehensive and have taken all aspects of the compensation code on board, I have to ask the proposer to withdraw the motion for a Second Reading.  I accept that there is genuine concern over this problem and that there are strong reasons for this concern. I can assure the House that the Government's own proposals have been given a priority status and that they will be published as quickly as is possible.  I think my remarks cover most of the matters raised by Deputy Keating and Deputy Cullen.  I felt that the thrust of what they were doing was they wanted to and saw the need to do the thing right, rather than bringing in a measure that would go only part of the road to settle the business.  Our measures will do more effectively the job they want done.</P>

      <P>Also I told the Deputies when Coolattin and the Trees and Woodlands Bill were being debated here there was need to do something, that I was <Col N="219" /> going to have a survey carried out on the unfinished estates.  I did.  That survey was completed only quite recently and I have asked the construction industry board to tell me the best way of dealing with it.  If it can be done under existing legislation and if we can get the right result, without doing anything extra by way of new legislation, fair enough.  If it cannot, then so be it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was implied twice in the Deputy's contribution that he wanted the Bill &mdash; fair enough &mdash; or measures similar to those in the Bill to be enacted immediately. Those were the words he used. Also he suggested he was suspicious the matter might be longfingered and he would have to be guaranteed that the heads had been drafted and the draft was with the Attorney General.  I am confirming that to him.  We agree with him that there is a problem and that legislation is necessary.  The Taoiseach gave that commitment and we have committed ourselves to it on a number of occasions, publicly and in writing.  What the Deputy put forward is a sensible and reasonable measure to address that situation. He has done a good job, the best he could, in dealing with it but, as is the traditional way of doing things, the Government take the overview, get the legal officer's advice in the matter, put a Bill forward and then the Deputy can put down amendments.  I do not see this as a shouting match across the Floor but as a negotiated matter across the Floor between me, the Deputy and the other Opposition spokesmen in the matter.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I think it is the right way to do it.  We get a measure then on the Statute Book that satisfies everybody.  It has been teased out here and amendments can be put forward if Deputies think it is not going far enough, but I think my measure very much the <Col N="220" /> more comprehensive.  It does not seem to be defective in any way.  It addresses some measure extra to what the Deputy contemplated and it poses the question that some elements of what he has suggested might not stand up.  In all our interests it would be better to get it right if we are doing it at all.  The heads of the Bill are cleared by Government, it is at drafting and it has priority rating.  I cannot tell the Deputy openly that he is going to have it this day week but &mdash; as he knows since he was in Government himself and as his Leader knows very well &mdash; priority rating is quite a thing to say in the House because it means you get the legislation in a pretty short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Progressive Democrats for the initiative they have taken in bringing this matter before the House because the issues with which the Bill seeks to grapple &mdash; compensation, the difficulty of achieving a balance between the interests of the developer and the property owner and of the wider community &mdash; are ones of great complexity.  They have been discussed by at least one committee chaired by a High Court judge and also two committees of the House.  It is courageous and ambitious for a party in Opposition to decide to use Private Members' time to address these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that they probably would not have been in a position even to contemplate addressing issues of this nature if they were not able to draw on the expertise of some of their voluntary party members who are prepared to give their time and talents.  I say that because the <Col N="223" /> public may not realise the extent to which, in our under-funded democracy and party political system, all the parties in the House &mdash; more specifically the parties in Opposition &mdash; are heavily dependent on people who are prepared to make their expertise available.</P>
    <P>If I were to be churlish or sceptical about the way the Bill is presented, it would be on the difference of approach between the Bill, which seems to be a serious attempt to grapple with issues of considerable subtlety, and the approach taken in the explanatory memorandum. I cannot believe that the same author is responsible for the Bill and the explanatory memorandum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the explanatory memorandum, it seems there was a fairly clear decision to sacrifice accuracy for punchiness.  Certainly, the explanatory memorandum adopts a considerably more polemical tone than is the fashion in this House.  That willingness to sacrifice accuracy for colour was perhaps a feature of Deputy Keating's speech.  He is not a man to be worried by a few million pounds here or there, a decimal point or a zero here or there.  At one stage he was talking about millions of pounds and at other stages it was tens of millions of pounds.  The Deputy will, no doubt, tell us which figure is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum suggests that it might be unfair to describe the Planning Act, 1976, as a speculator's charter.  It certainly would be unfair to describe it in that way and if it is unfair and if the authors of the explanatory memorandum think it is unfair, it is hard to see why they introduced the term. Difficult issues of balance are involved here and the owner of property has a reasonable expectation of being able to develop his property.  He will ordinarily feel that he should be in a position to <Col N="224" /> secure compensation if he is frustrated in proceeding with a reasonable development.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin, of course, is that the existence of generously framed compensation may open the door to people whose anxiety is to make a fast buck.  The task is to draw up legislation which affords compensation where justice requires it and which does not penalise the ratepayers or the taxpayers in cases where compensation would not be just, equitable or appropriate.</P>
    <P>The authors of the Planning Act, 1963, attempted seriously to address those issues against a background of the Constitution which itself draws a somewhat hesitant and uncertain balance between individual property rights and the exigencies of the common good.  My recollection is that at least one commentator on the Constitution said that the private property provisions of our Constitution scarcely go further than those of Yugoslavia. However, the 1963 compensation code has given rise, in some instances, to speculative gains and to claims for compensation which are barefaced and impertinent.  The reaction to that has been one of widespread public indignation. Of course, that indignation is increased when they see claims &mdash; and in some cases awards being made &mdash; at a time when the financial resources available to local authorities are barely adequate to allow them to provide basic services to those who dwell within their boundaries.  It is appropriate that the issues raised by the Bill should be addressed by legislation and that there should be a very wide consensus in the House in this regard.</P>
    <P>We must also maintain a sense of proportion. The 1963 Act has not served as a speculators' charter.  I understand, for example, that in 1985 a survey by An Foras Forbartha showed that in that year compensation claims amounted to £17.5 million but that the awards totaled only £24,095.  Equally, a number of the cases <Col N="225" /> which have given rise to particular indignation &mdash; and I suspect which have given rise to this Bill &mdash; show a very sharp divergence between the very dramatic claims made and the much more modest awards that have followed.  Let me give two examples.  In the Killiney Hill case the compensation claimed amounted to £2.37 million but the award amounted to only £150,000.  In the Cooldrinagh case, reported as <i>McKeown v. Kildare County Council</i>, the amount claimed in compensation was £3 million but the divergence was even more sharp as the award was £12,500.</P>

      <P>I know there are problems and the example which Deputy McDowell referred to shows that they must be addressed.  However, there is a need to maintain a sense of proportion.</P>
      <P>As I understand the position in the case of the open spaces in Killiney, the local authority had for many years an offer to purchase all the open spaces for about £40,000 but they spurned it.  If they had accepted that offer, there would never have been an application for planning permission nor for compensation, excessive or otherwise.  I say that because there are problems in our local government system over and above those in our planning Acts and compensation charter. Some of the problems could be addressed with a little more foresight by those involved, at elected and administrative levels.  I am struck by the contrast between the approach taken in the explanatory memorandum and the Bill.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum suggests that compensation follows the refusal of planning permission unless there are exceptional circumstances, for example, where the proposed structure would create a traffic <Col N="226" /> hazard.  I do not think many people would regard that as a fair summary of the present law.  The fact of the matter is that there are a wide number of grounds on which permission can be refused by local authorities without that refusal giving rise to grounds for compensation.  I should like to quote what some of them are.  I will not quote from the Act because there is a substantial degree of cross-referencing between the sections and the Schedule but I will quote from the standard text on the subject, &ldquo;Irish Planning and Acquisition Law&rdquo; by Philip O'Sullivan. I imagine that Mr. O'Sullivan can be regarded as an authority by Deputies of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>In his book Mr. O'Sullivan states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of cases where compensation will not be payable for a refusal to grant planning permission include cases where the development consists of or includes the making of any material change in use; or where the development would be premature by reference to a deficiency in water supplies or sewerage facilities or because a road lay-out for the area has not been indicated in the development plan; or where the development would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard or obstruction of road-users; or where one of the reasons for the refusal is the necessity to preserve any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest; or where the development is in an area to which a special amenity area order relates; or where a reason for the refusal is that a <Col N="227" /> development comprising any structure or addition or extension of a structure would infringe any existing building line, would be under a public road, would seriously injure the amenities or depreciate the value of property in the vicinity, would tend to create serious traffic congestion, would endanger the health or safety of persons occupying or employed in the structure or any adjoining structure or would be prejudicial to public health.</P>
    <P>Further, compensation will not be payable if the development would contravene materially a condition attached to an existing development permission.</P>
    <P>There is also a long list of conditions which preclude the operation of the compensation provisions.  This list is to be found in section 56 of the 1963 Act and in the Third Schedule (parts 2, 3 and 4) and is too long to be set out extensively here.  These conditions relate to good building and design standards, conditions relating to zoning, congestion, planning and services, and amenities generally including conditions relating to preserving land for public parks, dumps, rights-of-way and conditions relating to the preservation of items of archaeological and historical interest, preserving ruins and preserving woods, trees, shrubs, plants and flowers.  In addition, no condition relating to a matter in respect of which a requirement could have been imposed under any other Act or statutory instrument without liability for compensation can attract compensation.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly lengthy list of grounds on which a local authority can at the moment refuse planning permission.  To suggest that the 1963 Act is a speculators' charter is wide of the mark.</P>

      <P>The Bill decides to address the problem by focusing on two decisions of the Supreme Court and, effectively, decides to reverse them.  That is certainly one way of approaching it but it is not necessarily the only way.  It seems to me to be not altogether clear that the appropriate course of action is to address the grounds on which compensation is or is not payable rather than to address the methods by which compensation is to be calculated.  That is a subject for future debate.  The first case the Bill addresses is the Viscount Security case to which Deputy Keating made reference.  There is no doubt but that any layman would have to say that the decision in that case was more than a little surprising.  It must have come as a surprise to the local authority, and to most other people, to be told that a green field that was suddenly to sprout some 240 or 280 four-bedroom bungalows did not represent a material change.  That, one has to say, was a somewhat surprising conclusion to have reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable that the Progressive Democrats would wish to see that decision reversed.  However, we should be aware of what the impact of reversing that decision would be.  To find out what <Col N="229" /> the effect of taking an alternative view of what the word &ldquo;use&rdquo; in the planning Acts mean one can look at the judgment of Mr. Justice Finlay in that case.  He said:</P>
    <P>If the interpretation sought to be placed by the Planning Authority in section 56, (1), (a) were valid then combined with the other provisions of section 56 and with the provisions of section 57... would have the overall effect of making the case in which an owner refused development and suffering a reduction in value in his interest by reason thereof was entitled to compensation a rare or unusual rather than the general case.</P>

      <P>The second leg of their attempt to restrict the areas in which compensation is payable is when they address the question of the availability of sewerage.  In that regard they seek again to overturn the Supreme Court decision. In doing that they have the advantage that the court said at the time that they thought legislation was required.  Notwithstanding that, that was a good many years ago, legislation has not been forthcoming. In fact, that is one of a series of cases where the courts have drawn attention to serious anomalies in legislation, have urged amendments and where this House has neglected its responsibilities.  That has happened in the area of industrial relations where the Supreme Court gave important judgments, for example, in the Gouldings case, and there was not a whit of response from this House.  It has happened, and this is addressed in a Private Members' Bill in my name on the Order Paper, in the area of the expiry of time under the statute of limitations.  In that instance I have no problem at all with the approach adopted by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>On the first objective of the Bill, of moving the balance in relation to where compensation is paid and not paid, while I do not pretend that the Progressive Democrats have necessarily got it absolutely right they are in the right direction. The Bill deserves to be supported on that basis.</P>
      <P>The second substantial issue that is addressed by the Bill is the question of enforcement and, more specifically, the question of unfinished estates.  Deputy Cullen told us of his own background and his own knowledge of the problems facing young married couples.  Let me add my twopenny-halfpenny and say that I have knowledge of the problems of living in unfinished estates and in estates that have not been taken in charge.  Some Members in the House can vouch for the fact that I have had that experience over a number of years.  There is a serious problem in regard to this and a need for further legislative action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> It is the case that section 27 of the 1976 Act provided a very worthwhile and useful remedy and it has been used to considerable effect by local authorities and aggrieved individuals.  That is worthwhile. There is substance in the Minister's comment that more effective management would have an impact and I would like to see that happen but I am not convinced that the existing legislation is adequate.  There is a need for further legislation in this area.  What the Progressive Democrats seek to achieve in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill is altogether admirable.  Where I have some difficulties is with their practicability. Deputy Keating suggested that, like much that emerge from the Progressive Democrats, their proposal to address this problem was new and radical.  I have to say that it seems to be like much that emerges from that party, it may well be new and radical but it is very doubtful whether it is practicable.</P>

      <P>Their sections which suggest the making available of extra remedies to local authorities do not take into account the state of the construction industry.  I have no doubt that those sections would work very well given a thriving construction industry and a thriving economy, but we all know the construction industry is on its knees and that the actions of the Government, who promised them £250 million, have inflicted blow after blow upon them.  Builders are struggling to survive and in those circumstances I have doubts about how the measures proposed would work.  I will suggest a couple of alternative approaches which would meet the situation adequately and which, if this Bill goes to Committee Stage, I will invite the Progressive Democrats to consider as possible amendments.</P>
      <P>In the early years of the 1976 Planning Act it was certainly the practice for orders to be made against directors of companies. That is no longer the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister for Finance and commiserate with him on dragging him back into the House following the long debate on the Finance Bill.  I do not propose to take the 20 minutes allocated.  I want to raise the issue and the questions that arise from it.</P>
      <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would put on the record of the House the nature of the decision by the Labour Court on this issue.  As I understand it, Wicklow County Council had decided that refuse would be collected in Greystones by a private contractor.  They did this as a result of the general cutbacks on local authorities and specifically as a result of the cutbacks which faced Wicklow County Council.  With a limited budget they could not maintain services at the level at which they had been organised and they decided in the Greystones area to hire a private contractor to do the work previously carried out by county council workers.  I understand that the firm involved actually hired some of the county council workers who had been providing the service over the years and everything was going rather well.  Then the ITGWU took the case to the Labour Court and I understand that the decision was made in favour of the trade union and within the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> I am looking for confirmation of the facts in the first instance because I am relying on media reports.  The key factor seems to be that the Labour Court found that certain items had been agreed in the programme and that a condition of redundancy in the public service was that it would be voluntary and not in any way compulsory.  Consequently when the local authority compulsorily transferred work which was traditionally the work of county council employees redundancies would inevitably follow which would appear to be made under compulsion.  Is this the case?</P>
    <P>Secondly, how widely does the precedent extend?  I understand that the Minister for the Environment had suggestions that certain roads, bridges and various capital construction work within his Department would be carried out by the private sector, that one method of reducing public expenditure on capital services and providing capital infrastructure would be to bring the private sector in and allow them to build, as they did in the case of the toll bridge across the Liffey.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Financial institutions expressed an interest.  These suggestions were certainly there when we were in Government and I think the interest continues.  Could the Minister tell me if the decision has a wider application than in regard to the collection of refuse by a county council and whether it prevents the transfer of public works to the private sector by local authorities? As a consequence of this decision, will the plans of the Minister for the Environment be discontinued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to pursue this any further or get into the whole area of privatisation. I want a clarification of the decision and to know if the precedent extends beyond refuse collection by local authorities.  I <Col N="234" /> also want to know if it has implications for public expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity of putting on record the facts as we know them.</P>
      <P>I understand that a dispute arose recently in Wicklow county in relation to the manner in which a particular refuse collection route should be discharged. The county council had decided that this route should be contracted out to a private contractor.</P>
      <P>The local union sought a Labour Court ruling on the matter, claiming that the proposal was contrary to clause 11 of section 2 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The court ruled that it could not find any reference to privatisation of services in section 2 paragraph 11 of the programme but went on to recommend that &ldquo;on industrial relations grounds, as an alternative to contracting out, the disputed route should be manned by staff redeployed from non-essential services&rdquo;. It would appear accordingly that the court's recommendation was directed towards settling a particular dispute in a particular location and was not intended to endorse any principle or to set any general headline.</P>
      <P>I understand that the county council have written to the Labour Court seeking a rehearing on the basis that the matter on which the court recommended was not before the court at the original hearing and therefore the county council did not have the opportunity to put any considerations, either written or oral, to the court on the issue.  In these circumstances I think the Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to comment on the particular case until the court has responded to the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as general issues are concerned, I think everyone in this House would accept that the Government must have the flexibility to ensure that any opportunity which exists to reduce the cost of public services, and thus reduce the <Col N="235" /> burden on the taxpayer, must be carefully examined.  The notion that any service at present executed by the public sector must continue to be provided by the public sector at all costs is not one to which this Government could subscribe. I fully accept that the industrial relations aspects of making any changes of this <Col N="236" /> nature have to be taken into account and that the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to achieving any reduction in the number of public service employees on a voluntary basis must be honoured.</P>

      <P>I am determined to ensure that the Irish aquaculture industry and individual projects within it are presented in the best light when submitted for FEOGA grant-aid and I have undertaken a number of initiatives to this end.  I will come back to this point.</P>
      <P>May I advise the House at the outset that I was disappointed at the level of grant-aid approved for Irish aquaculture projects in the December 1987 tranche and have conveyed my disappointment informally to the commissioner on several occasions.  I also raised the matter at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December last year.</P>
      <P>In his response the commissioner has referred to the five year duration of the present structures regulation and suggested that funding would even out over this period.  In the December 1987 tranche, Ireland secured 6 per cent of total FEOGA aid available and this figure had risen to 10 per cent in the most recent April 1988 tranche.  I will, nevertheless, continue to press for an increased level of funding.</P>
      <P>On specifics, my Department have had detailed discussions with the European Commission in relation to the criteria and methods used in Brussels to assess projects for grant-aid.  On foot of that exercise my Department will be drawing up detailed guidelines to assist in the presentation of projects.  In addition, my Department, together with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta, will ensure that proper technical and economic evaluations of projects in Ireland are submitted to Brussels.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the proposal recently circulated by the European Commission for the introduction of additional control measures.</P>
      <P>The issue of quota-hopping of flag of convenience operators is a very sensitive one which causes deep resentment and frustration within the Irish fishing industry. My position on this has been consistent and quite clear.  I cannot tolerate a situation where the benefit from the fishing of Irish quotas does not accrue to the Irish fishing industry and the Irish economy.  I have raised that issue on a number of occasions at the Council of Fisheries Ministers and also in contacts which I have had with the Commission. I am glad to see that the Commission has accepted the seriousness of the problem and has seen fit to come up with the present proposal.</P>
      <P>The essential thrust of the new proposal is to make for speedier and more efficient catch reporting particularly when fishing vessels land in another member state.  The proposal is being discussed at working group level at present and the various implications, particularly the legal issues involved, are being considered. In the circumstances, I would not wish to prejudice this work.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that the full implications of the proposal are being considered and that any additional measures which would assist in dealing effectively with the quota-hopping problem will have my full support.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a silt problem arising from Dublin Corporation's water treatment plant at Ballymore Eustace.  The possible impact of this problem on fish life has been under continuing investigation by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board. However, no fish kills have been detected here and the board are not contemplating any legal proceedings at present.  I understand that Dublin Corporation hope to have their sludge de-watering plant &mdash; which has already been constructed at the site &mdash; in operation shortly and that this should solve the problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine his reaction to the decision by Brussels that the Irish fishing fleet must be cut by 16 per cent by 1991; his views on whether we need an increase in our gross registered tonnage; and the plans he has to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very seriously concerned about developments at Community level which may affect the size of the fleet and I am determined to ensure that these developments will not retard the proper expansion of the fishing industry.  The present position is as follows:</P>
      <P>Decisions taken in November 1987 at Community level within the framework of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme Regulation (No. 4028/86) adopted in 1986 require all member states to reduce on a phased basis by 1991 their gross registered tonnage by 3 per cent as compared with the end 1984 level.  The decision in Ireland's case is subject to further consultations between the Irish authorities and the Commission.</P>
      <P>Discussions are proceeding with the Commissioners on the interpretation of these decisions and I am not in a position at this point to indicate in any precise way the implications for the overall size of the Irish fishing fleet.  It is clear, however, that compliance will require some reduction perhaps in the size of the fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear however that failure on our behalf to adequately comply with Community requirements in relation to the size of the fleet could put in jeopardy EC financing of the purchase <Col N="43" /> of new vessels, the modernisation of existing vessels and indeed aid for other fishing programmes.</P>

    <P>The submissions received from local authorities in connection with this programme greatly exceeded what could be <Col N="49" /> funded with the amount available.  The local authorities concerned were therefore invited to identify priority projects.

This will include both directly tourism-related amenities and county roads which provide access for tourists.</P>
    <P>This process has, I would accept, been somewhat time-consuming.  However, it is providing useful experience for the more widespread application of the programme approach to the use of ERDF which is envisaged in the current reform of the European Community's Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> I am informed by the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána that no instructions have been issued to members along the lines suggested by the Deputy and that no case has come to notice of an alien being instructed by the Garda not to collect unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a number of EC citizens in receipt of State assistance do not have permission under aliens legislation to reside in the State and may for that reason be in breach of the Aliens Act, 1935.  It is the duty of the Garda Síochána to enforce that law.</P>
    <P>Normally permission to continue to reside in the State will be refused to persons who cannot maintain themselves. The question, however, of their receiving State assistance while they are here is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare. I see no reason to make any approach to him about changing the situation. Neither have I any proposals to change the regulations affecting EC nationals.  This would, in any event, be a matter for the EC in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I consider it entirely appropriate that the Garda should, where the law so requires, make any necessary inquiries or investigations about the activities of aliens who are residing in the State and who may be in breach of the law.  In the course of such investigations it would not be unusual for inquiries to be made with other Departments particularly with the Department of Social Welfare who may have information which is crucial.  Information received as a result of such inquiries is treated confidentially.  I am aware that such inquiries have been made in relation to aliens in many areas of the country which includes the County Galway area.  The question of any prosecutions resulting from such investigations is a matter for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

Molloy the Garda were aware of the existence of an insurance policy on his life, which names Mrs. Therese Flynn as the beneficiary and which inaccurately named her as a sister of Fr. Molloy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

Should such a complaint be made, or should additional evidence be forthcoming, it will be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, it is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements to the House concerning details of Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances are so exceptional that such a course is deemed appropriate. I do not propose to depart from this practice in this instance on the basis of certain reports that have recently appeared in the media.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that when Maynooth or Celbridge station is closed, the area served by the station is covered by Garda mobile patrols operating from Rathcoole and Naas stations. Each of these stations is provided with an external radio-telephone &mdash; the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo;&mdash; which enables callers who require Garda assistance when the station is closed to make immediate contact with the district headquarters at Naas. The Leixlip area is patrolled by a Garda car and motor cycle based at Lucan station.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that these arrangements make very effective use of existing resources and they have no proposals at present to provide additional transport for the areas in question.  They are, however, keeping the policing arrangements for the north Kildare area as a whole under continuing review.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The Offences Against the State Act, 1939 confers on the Garda a power of arrest in relation to certain specified serious offences.  The power is exercisable where the arresting officer suspects the person arrested of having committed or being about to commit one of those offences.

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for registration of a Land Commission vesting fiat which was lodged in the Land Registry on 8 December 1987.  Such applications are not generally as urgent as other applications because registration of title takes effect retrospectively from the date of vesting. There is at present an unavoidable delay in completing registration in these cases due to the pressure of other more urgent applications and in general they are dealt with at present only as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it would not be possible to give favourable treatment to any particular application except at the expense of other applications.  I am informed, however, that the Land Registry gives priority to applications in respect of which it is brought to its attention that there are special grounds for urgency, such as bridging finance for example.  Accordingly a request for expedition in this case will be considered if details of the reasons for urgency are submitted to the Land Registry.</P>

As already announced, I have decided not to proceed with this scheme because it did not prove possible to settle appropriate arrangements for the funding with the principal organisations directly involved. I will continue to encourage the financial institutions, the meat factories and others involved to follow their own best interests in giving real support to expansion of beef cow numbers.  Within the limits imposed on me at national and Community level, I am seeking alternative ways to accelerate the current increase in beef cow numbers and hope to be in a position to make a further announcement in this regard at an early date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 25 November 1987.  Payment of benefit was not authorised from that date, as, according to the available records, he had not the required minumum of 39 contributions paid or credited in 1985-86, the contribution year governing his claim.  He had a total of 28 credited contributions recorded for that year.</P>
      <P>The claimant, who indicated that he was employed in Britain during the 1985-86 contribution year, submitted a copy of his P.60 and the Department of Health and Social Security was requested to clarify the position.  From 4 January 1988 payment of benefit to this claimant is dependent on his insurance record in the 1986-87 contribution year, which records 44 credited contributions.  Payment was accordingly, authorised from that date at the appropriate weekly rate of £40.70, and continued to issue to 28 February 1988 when a final certificate was submitted.</P>
      <P>The British insurance record for the person concerned has been notified to the Department and these contributions when added to his Irish record, qualify him for maximum rate disability benefit, £42.50 per week, in respect of the period from 25 November 1987 to 28 February 1988.  Pay-related benefit has been authorised from 16 December 1987, the 19th day of incapacity.

It also promised a further reply regarding the position under the proposals for PRSI for the self-employed. The second letter was issued on 10 February 1988 and it dealt with the question concerning the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's subsequent representations, dated 12 February 1988 and acknowledged on 16 February, concerned the query about PRSI for the self-employed. This letter was acknowledged in the normal way.

      <P>The Forest Service of my Department have developed an integrated forest pest <Col N="70" /> control programme based on the principles of exclusion, eradication, protection, avoidance therapy and resistance.  In conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food, they operate a strict prohibition policy on the importation of coniferous timber with bark attached in order to prevent the introduction of the spruce bark beetle and other pests to this country.  This policy is rigorously enforced and timber and plant imports are regularly checked to ensure their freedom from dangerous forest pests and diseases.</P>
      <P>A major publicity campaign has been launched to alert the public and the relevant authorities of the dangers posed by forest pests like the spruce bark beetle. Forest Service staff and the timber industry have been alerted to the potential danger of such pests to our forest crops. Contingency plans have been drafted in the event of an infestation of this or other plant pests and diseases.</P>

      <P>While tree planting and maintenance costs vary according to site and terrain, it is accepted that higher costs are generally associated with the planting of broadleaves. In recognition of this, special incentives are provided by my Department to encourage broadleaf planting. Under the State private planting grant scheme and a new grant scheme for farmers, broadleaves qualify for £300 more per hectare than conifers.  The minimum qualifying area for broadleaves is only 0.25 hectares compared to two hectares for conifers.  Also, stocking rates for broadleaves below the norm are accepted for grant aid by my Department in certain circumstances such as when tree shelters are used or when hurley ash is being planted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy his views on whether the end use value of properly grown hardwoods and its wealth creation and employment potential is much greater than that of softwoods; if so, if this justifies positive discrimination in favour of hardwoods which facilitate amenities, tourism and wildlife during its growing life; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Hardwoods generally command a more valuable end use value than softwoods. The contribution each makes to overall wealth and employment creation is largely determined, however, by its level of demand in the market place.  As this in Ireland is around seven times greater for softwoods, they support a much higher level of employment in the forest and downstream wood industries.  For this <Col N="73" /> and other economic reasons, including the considerable difference in the length of time for each to reach maturity &mdash; 40/45 years for softwoods compared to 100 to 150 years for hardwoods &mdash; an afforestation programme based primarily on hardwood plantations would not be justified.</P>

The adjustment will result in these borrowers being charged and average interest rate of about 8.3 per cent in the year to 30 June 1988, which compares very favourably with an average rate of just over 10 per cent which borrowers of local authority annuity and convertible loans will have paid over the same period.</P>

      <P>Pre-departure information and advisory services for persons contemplating employment abroad are administered by FÁS through its national network of offices.  These are part of the general services provided by FÁS for the public at large and it is not possible to isolate the cost of the youth emigrant-support element from the overall costs.</P>
      <P>The printing costs of the information booklet &ldquo;Working Abroad&rdquo;, available from FÁS offices, and of the posters used in the publicity campaign in 1987, amounted to £11,000.</P>
      <P>FÁS participates in the European Community SEDOC system whereby details of unfilled vacancies and of job-seekers looking for work elsewhere in the Community are regularly exchanged between the national employment services. The service is open to young people as well as adults and is also used by students looking for summer jobs abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition, various voluntary bodies around the country are assisted by FÁS, through its social employment scheme and Teamwork programme, in the provision of support services for prospective emigrants, young and adult.  I do not have a breakdown of the expenditure involved readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> In 1987, in accordance with the recommendations of DION, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare, grants amounting to £250,000 were paid by my Department to voluntary agencies, mainly based in the United Kingdom providing support services for emigrants generally but particularly young people.  A sum of £10,000 was paid to the Emigrant Advice Centre in Dublin on DION's recommendation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amounts mentioned above, some expenditure may be incurred by other Ministers in providing support services for young emigrants.</P>

      <P>The development of a climate conducive to economic expansion and employment creation is a major objective of the Government's overall policy.  This provides the best way to improve job prospects for the unemployed.  Young people are particularly well placed to take advantage of improving job prospects because of their level of educational attainment and flexibility.</P>
      <P>In my own area, I am concerned to ensure that manpower policy contributes to the development of this climate while promoting social equity for more disadvantaged groups.  FÁS play a major role in this regard, through their provision of labour market services such as the following:</P>
      <P>(i)  to provide, arrange for, encourage and foster the provision of employment schemes; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  to facilitate and assist local community groups and worker or community co-operatives in the provision of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  to provide placement and training services, which both benefit potential enterprises for instance through the <Col N="106" />&ldquo;Start Your Own Business&rdquo; Programmes and the provision of a pool of trained workers to facilitate the expansion of existing and new undertakings.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>I have asked FÁS to review all employment and training programmes.  As a result an improved integrated and harmonised package will soon be developed for the maximum assistance to individuals, co-operatives and local communities.</P>
    <P>The operations of CERT are also beneficial to employment creation through its provision of training and of advisory services to the tourist industry which are identified in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as offering significant prospects for employment generation.</P>

      <P>Ensuring that workers have safe and healthy workplaces is an important aspect of my Department's activities.  The implementation of a targeted programme in 1988 to reduce accidents and ill health at work is one of my current priorities in this area.  This relates to four sectors which account for about a third of reported accidents, i.e. construction, glass manufacture, processing of meat, fish and meat products and milk products. The programme involves enforcement, information and advice.  My Department have consulted the social partners, who have welcomed the targeted programme and undertaken to co-operate in its implementation.</P>

      <P>For a fuller explanation of what is involved I would refer the Deputy to my budget address of 4 February 1988 wherein I used the term normal, basic facilities in connection with classroom accommodation.  The point which I would wish to emphasise, and which may not have been captured in the media reports, is that while many schemes may during the present period of financial constraint have to be confined in scope by the omission of features such as general purposes areas, libraries and medical inspection rooms, the classroom facilities would conform to normal, basic expectations. These facilities would include as standard such features as toilets, an adequate floor area and suitable levels of insulation.</P>
      <P>The question of my Department's issuing changes in building specifications, as such, does not arise since design teams are free to use a variety of suitable materials and design approaches for the provision of authorised accommodation in individual cases.</P>
