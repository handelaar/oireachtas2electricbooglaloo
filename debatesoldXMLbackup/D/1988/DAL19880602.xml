    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways this section represents the core of what the provisions of the Bill are about.  Certainly it is the triggering section that brings the new machinery into effect.</P>
      <P>This Bill has had a lengthy gestation period.  It is in many ways quite similar to the Bill circulated during the lifetime of the previous Government.  It is, of course, a follow-up to the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act of the mid-seventies.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of comments that have to be made.  The first is that although there has been quite a wide-ranging debate on worker participation since then, during which period we have had reports of advisory committees on worker participation, quite a degree of academic discussion on the subject and so on, what is before us is not a Bill dealing with worker participation.  It deals with a much narrower subject.  It deals with the question of worker participation in a stated number of State enterprises and in respect of those State enterprises the approach taken is a fairly traditional one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the seventies there have been circumstances obtaining in which there have been worker directors serving on a number of boards, I think six initially and <Col N="1241" /> subsequently An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Now two further State bodies are to be added to the list that will have worker directors.  The two selected or identified as being right for addition at present are well chosen.  I am thinking particularly of the very considerable degree of preparation there has been involving workers and management in Aer Rianta and the considerable enthusiasm obtaining within that body for taking its place among the front-line group that have full formal worker directors.</P>
    <P>That is at one level.  The other level &mdash; and this really is what this section is at &mdash; is the opportunity afforded by this Bill to a wider range of State enterprises to become involved in a formal way because, of course, many of them will have had their own structures in the area of worker participation at sub-board level.  I would make one particular appeal, that is, in implementing the provisions of this section, there be the maximum degree of flexibility.  The legislation to date has suffered from the fact that it has applied a uniform procedure. We have had one level of participation, that by way of worker directors elected in accordance with a standard set of procedures. That has not taken account fully of the very wide variation in character of the different State enterprises, variation in terms of the activities in which they are involved, in terms of the sizes of their workforce, in terms of the extent to which they have a track record on consultation, co-operation, of code decision-making, variation in terms of the way in which their workforce is distributed, in some instances, between a very small number of plants and, in others, in small numbers scattered all over the country.</P>
    <P>If one was to identify a weakness in the way in which the 1977 Act has operated it has been that it has been uniform in character.  My concern would be that this new Bill, when enacted, should not follow that same approach but that there should be the maximum degree of flexibility and inventiveness in trying to devise formulae that will meet the individual needs of the workplace.  The Bill, as <Col N="1242" /> drafted, provides that opportunity if it is seized.</P>
    <P>We really have been quite conservative in many ways in the way in which we have looked at worker participation.  There has been an assumption that this is achieved by way of election, with all the paraphernalia we have come to associate with local or general elections and which have been transferred into elections for worker directors onto the boards.  We have not looked at the question of supervisory boards, works councils, or the various other machineries that have operated successfully in other countries.</P>
    <P>There can be no quarrel it seems to me on the principle.  It seems to me that the argument in both the public and private sectors for saying that there is a broad community of interest between all of those who go to make up the enterprise &mdash; management, shareholders and workers &mdash; is undisputed and that we must devise structures to give effect to that.  That is clear but we have been remarkably unadventurous in attempting to give effect to it.  Of course there has been the initiative taken by Fine Gael in Government in their succession of Finance Bills with their incentives of the offering of shares in a company to workers.  That initiative was very worthwhile and I should like to see it availed of much more widely than has been the case to date.  In saying that one has to say that workers, just by virtue of being employed in an enterprise, have a very direct share in that enterprise and that having a share certificate is not necessary for that to be said.  Nonetheless it is the case that the issuing of shares by a company to its employees confirms the community of interest and can be effective in helping to eliminate the &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; attitude which to some extent, has been a feature, of our industrial relations from time to time; I stress to some extent only. It is unfortunate that that kind of confrontational approach should be in the news today arising from the developments in Longford.</P>
    <P>My appeal really would be that we should not get hung up on any one model. If one looks at the list of enterprises in <Col N="1243" /> the First Schedule one will see just how remarkably different in character are some of those bodies.  Some are very new &mdash; FÁS and so on &mdash; some are very centralised, some are overwhelmingly staffed by specialists.  Any attempt to lay down a standard form of participation must necessarily fail.</P>
    <P>I would hope that what we will see is a very innovative and flexible approach to worker participation in the public sector and that that would be triggered by the provisions of this section.  I hope that will be taken up with much greater enthusiasm by the private sector.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage there were appeals for recasting this Bill.  It was suggested that the Minister should legislate for worker participation in the private sector.  I have to say I consider that to be more than a little unreal.  One cannot coerce people, by legislation, into becoming partners.  One cannot coerce people into a belief that they have a community of interest but I do believe that the Minister has an important role to play, by promotion and education, in advancing worker participation in the private sector.  I hope this Bill is not seen as being the end of the road and as being the Government's response to worker participation because this is limited.  It is the Government's response to worker participation, in a limited number of companies.  I agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in total agreement with Deputy Birmingham.  In a very long Seanad debate many of the issues in this Bill were teased out and amendments were put forward and agreed to in order to make the Bill better.  In relation to the private sector, section 3 is very important. In the Department of Labour, throughout the autumn, winter and spring, we awaited the passage of this Bill and during that time on a nationwide basis we have been promoting in the private sector, the concept of worker participation. As Deputy Birmingham said, it is not realistic to legislate for the private sector in relation to worker participation <Col N="1244" /> but I agree that we should endeavour to get them to implement the process which Aer Rianta and An Bord Telecom have been engaged in for quite some time. This is how we can get the concept of worker participation across.</P>
      <P>Another point which is very important relates to flexibility, because of the range of organisations involved.  The Bill has developed since the two years when Deputies Quinn, Birmingham and Kenny were in the Department of Labour in order to make it as flexible as possible, so that we will not tie the hands of people who have to make this legislation work. Section 3 sets the pace for the legislation.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 and 5 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 49, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  In the absence of any agreement, the information to be furnished or disseminated by the specified body, shall include such information:</P>
      <P> (a)  as may be prescribed by the Minister, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such other information as the specified body would be obliged to furnish if it were a company under the Companies Act, 1963, as amended.&rdquo;.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe that amendment No. 2 is related and I would suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together.  There can be separate decisions if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the giving of information.  The amendment goes further in requiring that the Minister may request information he deems relevant to the Bill, so that the Bill will be broadened to allow for the disclosure of information in accordance <Col N="1245" /> with the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1987.  There is a provision in the Companies Act regarding private companies, but this does not extend to the State companies.  If there was such a clause we would not have had the battle earlier this week when a semi-State company sold off their shares in Irish Distillers.  This company could, without disclosing information, sell off their shares simply because the financial sector is excluded from the Act.  As these two amendments are related I would ask the Minister to consider accepting both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that amendment No. 1 is intended to cover a situation in which it has not been possible to conclude an agreement under section 6 of the Bill.  Section 3 requires that the specified body shall as soon as may be make arrangements pursuant to section 6 of the Bill.  An amendment along the lines proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan would change the provision of section 3 from a definite imperative to a provisional requirement and this would alter the intention of the provision.  The sub-board arrangements in the Bill give flexibility to the State enterprise concerned and to the representatives of the employees to identify the issues they see as central to the evolving process in their enterprise.  The Bill deliberately refrains from specifying the kind of issue to be included in the agreement.  It is likely that if requirements, no matter how minimal, are written in, it would be seen in some quarters as removing the need for dialogue in other areas.  That is not what the Deputy wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be easy to put in legislation an information requirement which would come into force in the absence of the development of participation and co-operation in the enterprise.  The purpose in this legislation is to facilitate the development of joint consultation and co-operation.  In general agreements drawn up under this section both sides are free to agree on what issues should be in the agreement so that they would have a platform on which to discuss these issues.  We say that there should be a <Col N="1246" /> written agreement signed by both parties. I take the Deputy's point that certain aspects should be covered by these sections and we say generally in the Bill that certain things should happen, without tying them down to details.  We encourage people to make agreements in as broad as possible a way.  Some organisations and semi-State bodies have already developed worker participation. An Bord Telecom, as the Deputy knows, is extremely developed in this area and the Deputy would not like to limit them in this Bill.  We are trying to allow it to be as broad as possible.  The Bill is broad enough to allow the issues raised by the Deputy to be covered in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of words such as &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;broad&rdquo; is interpreted at times as indicating an area of weakness which can be used to militate against the workers.  That is why one must be specific.  One cannot legislate for flexibility. If we want something included in the Bill it must be spelled out clearly and this is not the case in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2, particularly, and amendment No. 1, if accepted would weaken rather than reinforce the requirement to establish sub-board participation.  Under sections 3 and 4 (8) there is an unequivocal legal obligation on each body to provide worker involvement arrangements following requests from employees.  Once this is agreed, through the various procedures in the Bill, an enterprise must have worker participation.  The arrangements are then a matter for agreement between both sides.  The amendment might remove that legal obligation so that it would dilute rather than strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said every time this has been debated, one cannot legislate for every aspect of worker participation. We cannot legislate for every aspect of what should be in every agreement but we can legislate for the concept and then make that concept legally binding.  That is precisely what section 6 seeks to do.  The <Col N="1247" /> proposed amendment would qualify the clear obligation by requiring only that the specified body make every reasonable effort to facilitate the making of the agreement under section 8.  For that reason the amendment would have the wrong effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is specific the danger is, as Deputy O'Sullivan is aware, that you would then set the floor above which many enterprises would not go any further.  They will say, &ldquo;This is the requirement of the Worker Participation Act, 1988.  We have to comply with that section and if you set the floor too high it may be beyond what organisations or employees want and nothing further will be achieved.&rdquo;  If you let it broaden you will allow the organisations where there is a developmental attitude to worker participation to extend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was prompted by the experience of some worker directors in some companies and as a result of this we asked that this amendment be included.  They were excluded from some decisions and information was withheld from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have on a number of occasions met the worker directors and I am aware of one particular incident which I would not be over the moon about standing over.  In view of all the boards and all the excellent work which has gone on in the past 11 years, if one tries to legislate to tighten up everything because of that one incident that would provide bad legislation.  I think I know the incident to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred and we are not condoning that. We in the Department of Labour and my predecessors have been keen not to allow these kinds of regulations to continue. In relation to this section, the Deputy's <Col N="1248" /> amendment would limit what many of the worker directors would want both now and in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of the involvement of subsidiaries was one that troubled the Seanad considerably. The Bill as originally drafted alarmed some of the unions.  It is worth putting on record that the very exhaustive debate which took place in the Seanad means that there would be a general view on both sides of industry that the Bill is now a much improved Bill.  For those who would question the value of the Seanad, it seems to me that the debate which took place on this particular issue is a fair answer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 22, after &ldquo;body&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that a cessation shall not take effect where it is under appeal and the question under appeal has not been determined. </P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to protect a worker director who may be removed from the board and be under investigation. There could be a situation in which it would be advantageous to have him off the board.  This amendment seeks to protect the position of a worker director while he or she is under appeal.  It has occured in the past that worker director could be suspended for one reason or another, he may be on strike and his term of office may be concluded. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment with a view to protecting that worker's interest.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 which refers to the Principal Act of 1977, states that:</P>
      <P>A member or director of a designated body who is appointed or elected prior to the passing of this Act, shall not be obliged to cease to be an employee of that body merely by attaining an age of retirement before the expiry of the term of office stipulated in section 17 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for instance, somebody retires in the month of January and his term of office as a worker director is not due to expire until seven months later, he would be <Col N="1250" /> entitled to continue on until a new board is elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues that we are now debating.  The first deals with the question of the displacement of a worker director and what happens in terms of when the vacancy arises and the procedure to be followed.  On that point Deputy O'Sullivan and I have both tabled amendments.  The second issue relates to the question of someone who is elected but in the course of his term of office retires.  I will deal with that issue first.  I am not convinced by the arguments put by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is of the utmost importance that worker directors be just worker directors, that they not be former worker directors and that they not be people who have changed employment or people who have severed their direct links by ceasing employment on retirement age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument in favour of worker directors is because of the intimacy of the link between someone who is in current employment and the contribution which that person can make to the board table. I would not favour that change.  There is a very good case right across the State sector, and indeed in the private sector, for seeing to it that there is effective representation of pensioners' interests and it may be that some of the flexible arrangements that can be developed at sub-board level should concern themselves with that question.  While it is true that in some of the State companies the unions have a very honourable record in defending the interests of their pensioners, there have been other companies where that priority has not been placed and where the emphasis has been on achieving conditions for those currently employed and at the expense of their pensioners.  For instance, in CIE the pension position was appalling for a number of years.  A situation where the board were confronted on a regular basis with the needs of pensioners would be valuable. There is a very good case for devising a system, and it would have to be on a non-statutory basis, which would see to it that pensioners' concerns are on the <Col N="1251" /> agenda, as it were, but I do not think that means, nor would that objective be achieved, that someone who has gone out on pension would be allowed to remain on as a director after he ceased to be an employee.</P>
    <P>The other issue on which Deputy O'Sullivan and I find ourselves in agreement is where a worker director is dismissed. I have suggested that instead of the vacancy being deemed to arise on the day following the vacation of the post, as the Bill provides, it will not arise for a week and will be further stayed if within that week an application is brought to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  In that case the vacancy will not arise until after the determination of that case by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or any appeal therefrom.</P>
    <P>I concede that this is by no means cut and dried.  If one adopts the procedure Deputy O'Sullivan and I argue for there are drawbacks.  It means that perhaps in cases where someone has been properly dismissed and the dismissal is fully upheld, eventually the board have been for that much longer short of effective representation.  I realise that must inevitably influence the Minister's thinking, but on balance where someone is dismissed on the dismissal the election procedure is commenced and then perhaps weeks or months afterwards the dismissal is found to be unfair by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal order reinstatement and then where are you?  Who is the director at that stage?  If the person is reinstated does reinstatement reinstate him on to the board as well?  If so, what happens to the person who was elected in the meantime, or to the election that may by then be in progress?  The potential harm that could be caused in such a situation outweighs the inconvenience of a longer period of an incomplete board which is a consequence, I concede, of what we are proposing.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is not very likely.  There are two answers to that. First, so far as we can, we should protect not only against what seems to us to be <Col N="1252" /> probabilities but against what could be seen as latent but improbable dangers in our legislation.  My recollection is that the late Cearbhall O Dálaigh expressed that view on a number of occasions in very trenchant terms, that if legislation has the potential to give rise to difficulties even in scenarios that seem somewhat improbable one should guard against them if at all possible.  Second, it is not altogether that improbable.  One hopes it will not arise but one can conceive that perhaps in a particularly acrimonious dispute or whatever the worker director finds himself being dismissed.  If the worker director also found himself being fired from the board and the result was that decisions were being taken without the workers' input the effect would only be to exacerbate what would already be by that stage a very difficult situation. Therefore, I ask the Minister to think about this.  I know he has already thought about it, but it is nagging at a number of people.  I hope the Minister will have some good news for us or, at the very least, he will indicate that he will attempt to address it, perhaps on some non-statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Birmingham's remarks about the operation of this on the person, I take his point that what happens to the worker director should not affect the workers, but it is unrealistic to say that a former employee would continue as a worker director having ceased employment with any company.  Election to get on to these boards is very competitive in the workforce as a rule and the likelihood of any person being re-elected, having ceased to be employed, is very remote.  In the interests of the dignity of the person who represented the workers for so long on the board, having reached the age of retirement he should be allowed to finish his term of office until the next election.  It is unlikely if somebody is several months from retirement before an election that he will be elected on to the board.  It is usually only a matter of months and the issue should be non-contentious.  It is just to afford some dignity and allow a man <Col N="1253" /> to retire with some grace having reached his age limit.  There is a certain appreciation for the contribution he has made to his workmates in the company.  I do not think the issue should be debated at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>My views are similar to Deputy O'Sullivan's.  Let me give an example.  If a person who has worked for many years for a company is eventually elected to the board of that company under the provisions of the Bill and has reached the age of retirement or whatever and ceased to be employed by the company, why should legislation provide that that person should be off the board immediately while two-thirds of the board members very often have no connection with that company whatsoever? They are business people who are appointed to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unsympathetic to the point that has been made and maybe the experience that has been brought to bear at the board table and through many years of working in the company would be such that that person would be eminently suitable for appointment as, say, a ministerial nominee to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What is at issue is whether the person should occupy one of the slots reserved for a workers director. If he does it means the workers' participation is to that extent reduced to one. Deputy O'Sullivan has prompted one train of thought and perhaps I can diverge momentarily to put it to the Minister. Over the years before this legislation was brought into force there was a tradition in many semi-State companies that leaders of the trade union movement were appointed to the boards of semi-State companies.  We can all think of people appointed to Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and so on.  The universal opinion within those companies is that those leaders have brought a unique contribution to bear, <Col N="1254" /> that their background in the trade union movement coupled with the fact that they have a knowledge of dealing with companies right across the economic spectrum has been valuable indeed to the company.  There has been some tendency in those companies where worker directors are elected to take the view that the trade union interest, the worker interest, is now on the board and that in appointing the rest of the board the Minister does not look to that section of the population for his directors but he looks exclusively to the business community or whatever. In companies where worker directors are elected some of the leading figures in the trade union movement who are involved in the NESC and have a contribution to make at national level can prove very worthwhile directors.  I hope the Minister, and his colleagues, will bear that in mind when making appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Many points have been made on this section.  The question in regard to pensioners' interests being represented is an important one.  I do not think Deputy Birmingham is suggesting that we should deal with it in the legislation but those interests should be kept in mind in any arrangements made. Everybody is a potential pensioner and for that reason we should keep that issue in mind.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Birmingham that the worker director is different person from the trade union representative.  It is usual that senior people hold these board positions.  Trade union representatives have a broader view than worker directors who tend to have a view of their own enterprises.  They would not have the over-view that senior trade union people bring to the boards they are on.  We have appointed them to many of the boards under my control.  I accept that the Department of Labour are different from other Departments because we are involved with the social partners and there is a social dimension in our work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 provides that worker directors who cease to be employees of a designated State enterprise shall at the same time relinquish the board membership <Col N="1255" /> and resultant vacancies shall be treated in the same way as a casual vacancy under section 22 of the Principal Act.  Under that provision, casual vacancies may be filled by the appropriate Minister who shall have regard to the results of the election before making the appointment. A number of important issues arise in regard to this.  It is a complex matter and the more one goes into it the more complex it becomes.  Today, retiring workers are not necessarily those at the end of their working life, a person who is just filling out the last three or four months before ceasing work.  Such a person may be leaving a semi-State body and taking up an appointment in the private sector which is in direct conflict with the semi-State body.  The matter was not dealt with in the 1977 Act but we are dealing with it in this Bill for the reason I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I have a lot of sympathy for the point of view expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan. It is a different issue if we are dealing with a worker who has six weeks or two months to go before reaching retirement age.  Under the present system &mdash; I am aware of this from my experience as Minister for Labour in the last 15 months &mdash; reference is made to the ballot held for the previous election before the casual vacancy is filled.  If there is a view among the directors, the trade union interests and the staff that such a person was an excellent representative on the board and should be retained there is nothing to stop the Minister concerned re-appointing that individual.  We are trying to have flexibility while at the same time ensuring that a person who leaves a State body for the commercial sector does not remain on as a director.  I am more concerned about the person who is not 65.  The reappointment of a person of that age who is about to retire can be dealt with under section 22 of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Birmingham said, the matter was discussed at length in the Seanad and up to 20 scenarios were put forward.  I had discussions with the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman and the Seanad agreed that <Col N="1256" /> the matter should be dealt with administratively because of the various problems that could arise.  I was asked in the Seanad what would happen to a candidate for the position of worker director who was dismissed the day before the elections.  Most of the fears expressed in the Seanad are unlikely to occur but that is not the point.  Our view is that if such a dismissal leads to a major disruption in the company it is more likely that the enterprise will be brought to a standstill. Dismissing a person for no good reason would not be tolerated.  If there is a doubt about the dismissal of the person and an appeal is lodged with the Unfair Dismissals Tribunal or the Employment Appeals Tribunal it would be better to await the outcome of that appeal.  It would be better to leave the filling of the casual vacancy to the relevant Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Labour.  In the event of the dismissal appeal being rejected the relevant Minister could act accordingly.  As was mentioned in the Seanad, it is usual that because the relationship between employer and employee has broken down in the case of dismissals, appeals tribunals tend not to reinstate the employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view if the appeal involved a worker director they would be more likely to be arguing about a matter of principle than the job.  The filling of a casual vacancy should be dealt with administratively.  A dismissal may occur for a number of reasons, such as the misuse of funds and the Minister may not want to reinstate such a worker to the board.  That is the reason why I do not think we should include a provision in regard to the filling of such vacancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister's views on these issues.  The Minister is saying that a person who has appealed to a tribunal against a dismissal is guilty until proved innocent.  That could lead to a black mark being put on the person's character.  It would be difficult <Col N="1257" /> for such a person to live that down.  It is very unlikely that a person who reaches retirement age will be re-employed.  We must remember that there are 250,000 unemployed here.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but 99 per cent of the people who retire early are forced to do so.  Deputy Birmingham referred to trade union officials being appointed by the Minister and I do not think he was fair in what he said.  There is a definite distinction between ministerial appointments and those who are elected to State boards.  I cannot see the need to introduce this provision.  The person appointed by the Minister may be elected at a later stage.  The debate has taken on an element of stonewalling by the Minister.  We want him to legislate on behalf of workers and ensure that their rights are defended.  The Minister is asking us to leave everything alone, and saying that everything will be all right but in practice things will be different.  I am left with no choice but to press the amendment.</P>

It is being claimed that the worker director who is elected to the board and ceases to be employed would immediately have to relinquish his seat on the board because he might take redundancy and set up another little business in conflict.

My goodness, he would be such a threat.</P>

      <P>Under section 20 of the Act such a person from the private sector has to declare his interests.  I am not sure that the practice to which Deputy Sherlock refers has actually happened.  I have a lot of sympathy for a retired worker who has a short period to go and wishes to participate but to legislate for that person in this section would allow all sorts of anomalies.  I am asking the House to agree that this should be a matter for the Minister of the day in association with the Minister for Labour, who normally deals with worker directors.  We should not leave a loophole in the legislation which might create difficulties.  The prinicple is that workers should be represented by workers.  It has already happened that a person who retired continued for some time on the board.  This Bill extends the period served by worker directors from three to four years, which <Col N="1259" /> makes it more likely that this kind of thing could happen.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment asks what happens in the switch from three years to four years to protect people who may reach the age of 60.  He is concerned about the interregnum between the current Act and the coming force of this legislation.  We have made inquiries since the debate in the Seanad to find out if there are any worker directors who will reach normal pension age in this period. There are no persons in this category.  In future there will be a four-year period.  If somebody aged 63 is elected he will have to go at the age of 65.  The point Deputy O'Sullivan made is not in line with his amendment.  Any worker directors at present serving a three-year period will not be affected by this legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 47 to 49, and in page 12, lines 1 to 6, to delete paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>This is to allow all employees in a company to participate in the procedure for the election of worker directors.  We are opposed to the discriminatory exclusion of part-time workers.  This is more important than ever as more and more companies, including State companies, are employing part-time workers.  They are already discriminated against in the social welfare area and are not covered by workers' protection legislation concerning unfair dismissal, minimum notice, redundancy payments, etc.  There is a need to ensure that part-time workers are given the same rights and entitlements as other workers.  With unemployment so high it is likely that the use of part-time workers will increase and we should at least give them the same rights in industrial democracy as full-time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of seasonal workers who are at present excluded from participation in the election of worker directors.  Some companies such as the Irish Sugar Company make widespread use of seasonal workers, many of whom have great loyalty to the company <Col N="1261" /> and come back year after year.  Consideration should be given to their position. I have great experience in this regard.  In the Mallow area where I come from there are people who have a record of service to the Sugar Company extending over 25 or 30 years.  They are seasonal workers who opt for that position for one reason or another.  They are loyal, faithful workers to that company and come back year after year at the start of the season.  They are slightly protected under the legislation as regards redundancies and so on.  The purpose of the amendment is to include such categories of workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of part-time workers has occupied the minds of Deputies in the House at Question Time on several occasions recently. There is a general feeling that part-time work will be an increasing aspect of the employment scene and there is already statistical evidence to that effect.  Many people will argue that to exclude part-time workers from the protection that is available to those who work full time is harsh and unfair.  As against that, the voice of caution would say that the reason there is a growth in part-time work is that many employers find it more advantageous to have the flexibility that is associated with it and that they would not be in a position to be bound by the various regulations on unfair dismissal, minimum notice, holidays and so on, available to full time workers.  The argument is if you put part-time workers and full-time workers in the same position you would simply have less part-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever substance there is to that argument, when it comes to the application of protective legislation &mdash; and there is some substance and cogency in that argument although it may not be an argument that any of us like &mdash; what is involved here is quite different.  What is involved here does not impose any burden on the enterprise.  It is simply the right to participate, the right to vote in an election.  There is no logical reason for saying that for example, someone employed as a cleaner, in the airport for <Col N="1262" /> many years, working 17 hours a week, is any less qualified to fill in a ballot paper and express a view on who should represent worker interests on the board than somebody employed for 25 hours a week. I see no logic in that.  The basic principle should be, is someone an employee of the enterprise and if so, they should have equal voting rights.  We do not attempt to weigh votes in a parliamentary or local democracy depending on the contribution that someone makes.  There was a time when in local democracy people had property votes depending on how many houses they had but there was an essential view that everyone got one vote. It seems to be perfectly reasonable to say that everyone working in an enterprise, for whatever period they work, should have one vote.</P>
    <P>There is a particular anxiety that stems from the fact that part-time workers are overwhelmingly women.  That is certainly true in the economy as a whole.  Whether that statement would hold up to the same extent when it comes to part-time workers in the State enterprises I do not know but I suspect that it would.  If that is so, by excluding part-time workers from participating in the electoral process to elect worker directors we are indirectly reducing the prospects of participation by women in the electoral process.  On that basis it represents an indirect, and I accept unintended, discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>In ease of the Minister I accept he did not set out on the basis of wanting to discriminate against anybody.  What he has done is widened the franchise in this measure as against the 1977 Act and to that extent he deserves to be commended. It probably would be the case that if he had not tried to do so no-one would have ever addressed himself to this issue but the Minister has addressed himself to the issue and it is before us.  We should consider whether it is appropriate that there be a cut-off point and given what is involved here, I do not think it is.  If it is a question of costs or of people's entitlements to benefits, then obviously questions arise as to the levels they were <Col N="1263" /> paying contributions but that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is a much more limited right, the right to participate in an election which will elect minority representation onto the board of a company. The maximum number of worker directors will be one-third of the board anyway.  To identify any category of workers and say that their contribution does not measure up and they have not earned a vote represents a rather invidious discrimination.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the spirit of the amendments, or if he has problems with the wording of any of the amendments to provide one of his own.</P>

What we are really talking about is a fundamental right which these people are being deprived of and I would ask the Minister to recognise this.  The point has already been made sufficiently and I will just ask him to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify the position in regard to people engaged in temporary or seasonal employment?  Am I right in thinking that if the election takes place in a week when the person is on the payroll he would have a vote but otherwise he would not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised that they must have one year's continuous employment before they would have a vote.  Deputy Birmingham has clarified that the subsection changes the definition of employee in this Bill so that it applies to employees working a minimum of 18 hours per week.  The definition had previously applied to whole-time staff only. I am glad that the number of hours is being reduced from 40 a week to 18 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a number of definitions of employees in various statutes, the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 and the Holidays <Col N="1264" /> (Employees) Act, 1973.  The definition to include part-time workers is in line with the most favourable provision in other legislation.  The definition of part-time employment generally is a matter for consideration in a separate discussion.  I would like to say that you could isolate this legislation.  The issue of part-time workers which this amendment seeks to cover has implications beyond the scope of the proposals before the House.  It is the considered opinion that they cannot be isolated.  There has been considerable discussion in recent times, as has been stated by the Deputies, concerning the appropriate definition of part-time work. It is not a matter which will be resolved in the context of this Bill because it affects several Ministers.  It affects the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare in regard to some of the regulations on health and it also affects the Minister for Labour.  It cannot be isolated.  The social partners have put forward very strong views on this issue in recent months.  Concern has been expressed today and previously during Question Time about this issue.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, under the Principal Act only whole-time employees could participate in worker director elections. In the insolvency legislation in 1983 the hours were reduced to 21 but it still applied to whole-time employees until now.  The Bill broadens the scope of the definition to include anyone working at least 18 hours a week.  This is a catching up measure &mdash; I am not saying it is any more &mdash; intended to bring the definition of employee for the purpose of work involved into line with that obtaining in other legislation.  As Deputy Birmingham has said, while all the other legislation reduced the number of hours to 21, this legislation still referred to whole-time employers.  It is now being changed from whole-time to 18 hours a week.  That is a considerable change and will take a number of people into account because it is unfortunately a growth area.</P>
    <P>I fully understand the underlying case for the amendments and recognise that the definition in the Bill does not take <Col N="1265" /> account of concerns relating to part-time employees working few hours per week. I acknowledge that point.  I ask Deputies to accept that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for some time have been canvassing on the issue of how we should deal with part-time workers.  Recently I received a very detailed submission for the implementation of a package of measures to improve the position of part-time workers across the board.  I am looking at this matter to see what can be brought forward.  This is an excellent submission.</P>
    <P>I have a lot of sympathy for what the Deputies have said.  A revision in our employment standards is warranted because there may be exploitation of part-time workers in some legislation, but not in this Bill.  It is important that there be uniformity and that part-time workers be treated uniformly.  I cannot say what will happen in the discussions with the Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers and the social partners because there are other Ministers affected, particularly the Ministers for Social Welfare, Health and Finance. I have been assured that they are anxious to help to eliminate discrimination against part-time workers.</P>
    <P>This issue was raised in the Seanad. Deputy Birmingham asked why this issue could not be taken alone.  I cannot do that, even if I wished.  An Post have a total of 8,200 staff and 422 temporary employees.  Telecom Éireann have only 124 members who work less than 18 hours a week.  Aer Lingus have no temporary staff, and casuals who are recruited around this time of the year are not included.  Bord na Móna, B &amp; I, Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta and the ESB have no part-time staff.  The Sugar Company have no part-time staff, but they do have campaign workers, the people Deputy Sherlock mentioned, who are not covered.  I am not too sure if these people could be covered even if the figure was 18 hours, although they could work maybe 40, 50 or 60 hours a week for a short period.  I am not too sure into what category they would fall.  I have been told that there are one or two obscure categories in CIE who would have workers employed for <Col N="1266" /> less than 18 hours.  Aer Rianta have casual workers and NRB have three or four part-time staff.  As Deputies can see, this legislation will not affect a great number of people.  I do not think the part-time worker concept is prevalent in State organisations.  It is far more prevalent in the private organisations, as statistics will prove.  Perhaps somebody would quote statistics for one of the organisations mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue against a concept I believe in.  We have to do something more in legislation for part time workers. Many people have looked closely at this issue and have said there are ruthless and uncaring employers who do not concern themselves with the issue of part time workers.  These workers have to be protected. Needless to say, whatever the outcome of the discussions, this matter will have to be dealt with.  I ask Deputies to accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no better way for the Minister to demonstrate his concern for the people who are being exploited than to show the way in the semi-State sector.  He has the opportunity to do that here and he should not let it go by.  If he accepted the amendment, he would be taking a positive step forward and showing that it is his intention to redress the situation in the private sector where many part time workers are exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully understand the Minister's position.  First, he said there were wider implications in these amendments and later he said one had to adopt a uniform position.  I do not know what those implications are, and I do not believe we have to adopt a uniform position, but at present there is not a uniform position in relation to part time workers.  There is some protective legislation which excludes them and some which includes them &mdash; for example in the health and safety areas there was never any differentiation in terms of the obligations of employers.  If what was involved was simply a blanket statement that every part time worker was to have <Col N="1267" /> all the rights and benefits of a full time worker, I could understand the Minister's concern.  If these amendments were saying that the part time worker the newsagent takes on to help with the after Mass rush on Sunday should qualify for protection against unfair dismissals, have pension and maternity rights and so on, I could see that there would be very serious implications involved, but that is not what is involved here.  What is involved is one specific proposal dealing with the extension of the franchise.  I can see no reason this cannot be considered on its own because it does not appear in any way to prejudice the wider debate.</P>
      <P>If one addresses the wider debate it will not be possible to take, even there, a uniform decision.  There will be a general view that there is a need to extend the protection available to part time workers, but there will also be a view that we will have to have regard to the cost that will impose on the employer and the State. That means when we go through the menu of the various items in protective legislation, we will probably reach different conclusions in respect of each one as to whether protection can be extended. However, all that is for another day.</P>
      <P>This is a very narrow proposal and the Minister has to some extent, made the case for us by showing how narrow it is. All that is involved here is marginally increasing the electorate in a number of State boards to allow people, who make a very real contribution to those enterprises, to have a say by casting a ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this very clear.  The definition in legislation for the lowest number of hours worked by an employee in full time employment is 18 hours, and that is what we are putting into this Bill.  Most of the people working in the organisations we are talking about will be covered.  If we were to reduce the figure from 18 hours to zero, we would be entering into the debate on part time workers, and I do not believe we can change that.  In separate discussions on <Col N="1268" /> several issues, including the conditions of part time employees, we are trying to reach common ground with the Federated Union of Employers and the Congress of Trade Unions.  In this legislation I took the lowest figure I could find in existing legislation, which was 18 hours.</P>
      <P>We can discuss all the other issues together and we can make considerable progress.  Perhaps later on we might have uniformity in the legislation, as mentioned by Deputy Birmingham.  It would be wrong for me to say that we would get uniformity in every case, but we can tidy things up a great deal.  This Bill helps that process.  It does not appear to affect very many people, so it will not have a great effect one way or the other, but it is an important principle, and we are changing legislation which is only 11 years old. That shows how much the concept has changed in that time.  Until this legislation is passed by the Oireachtas it is only the whole time worker who can vote, but this will bring eligibility down to 18 hours which is a substantial improvement.</P>
      <P>I am acknowledging that perhaps in the overall discussion about a package for part-time workers it does not go far enough.  It is the Government's view that the discussions should continue, to see what can be done across the board to help the lot of the part-time worker.  I shall be supporting those efforts and have given my commitment here on a number of occasions during Question Time.  It is now necessary only to give an indication of our commitment to helping the lot of the part-time worker.  We are doing that by bringing down the 40 hours mentioned in the 1977 Act to 18 hours.  In an orderly way we can continue on with discussions rather than create precedents and break up discussions.  We must try to get a fairly long-term solution to the problem of part-time employees, but it is better to do that in an orderly way rather than try to jump ahead of all other legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 35, after &ldquo;Bord na Móna&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, Bord Gáis Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, the basic aim of the amendment is to extend the scope of industrial democracy by the election of worker directors or board members.  The amendments in the names of the president of my party, Deputy De Rossa, Deputies Tomás Mac Giolla and Pat McCartan are linked. They refer to RTE, Eolas, Teagasc, VHI, FÁS and a series of State financial institutions, such as the Central Bank, Irish Life, Industrial Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta.  We are in favour of extending the principle of industrial democracy as far as possible.  Why should major employers like RTE, with some 2,000 employees, and FÁS with perhaps 10,000 employees, be excluded from the full benefits of worker democracy by not being allowed to elect worker directors? What is the difference between an employee of Aer Lingus or NESC, who is allowed such election and employees of FÁS and An Bord Gáis who are not? There is worker participation in the Electricity Supply Board but not in the increasingly important An Bord Gáis.  I <Col N="1270" /> ask the Minister to think very hard and have such bodies included.</P>
    <P>We can never sufficiently stress the importance of worker participation.  For far too long workers at ground floor level have experienced bad decisions made at board level.  The whole purpose of worker participation is to have representation from the ground floor to the board room.  This should have been done long ago.  Where it is in operation it is working effectively.</P>
    <P>It is significant that one area of the State sector has been totally excluded from any element of industrial democracy. This is the area of the financial institutions such as the Central Bank, Irish Life, the Industrial Credit Corporation, ACC and Fóir Teoranta.  Not only are the employees denied the right to elect worker directors, but they are excluded from participation even at sub-board level.  I understand that the justification put forward by the Government for this extraordinary exclusion is the alleged need for confidentiality.  This is an implied slur on the integrity of those who work for the State's financial institutions. These people deal every day with financial matters which require confidentiality. There is no evidence that this trust is ever breached, nor is there evidence of any suggestion that if workers were on the boards of these financial institutions that would endanger confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for instance, the case of ACC.  A person working in a local ACC office down the country will have knowledge of the financial position of many farmers, what exactly they borrowed, how much they are in debt and whether they are able to meet their repayments. What information would they have at board level that would be more sensitive than that?  I want to emphasise that point. Why is it assumed that worker directors could not be trusted on the board of the Central Bank or Irish Life but that the representatives of the commercial banks or other privately owned financial institutions who are on their boards can be trusted?  It is far more likely that these people would abuse the confidentiality of <Col N="1271" /> the information to which they have access on such boards for the benefit of their own companies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at the case for worker directors on the boards of the bodies mentioned.  If he cannot agree to participation at board level, surely he should be able to agree to their involvement in sub-board structures.  The importance of having representation on boards generally, or at sub-board level, is the giving to the employees of a say in matters where they know that changes need to be made.  There is an irrefutable argument for asking the Minister to include such bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to my amendment, I should like to say that I support Deputy Sherlock in all that he has said regarding industrial democracy. I would refer first to his amendment No. 11 regarding Teagasc.  There is no justification whatsoever for not proposing to have worker directors in Teagasc.  They were elected to ACOT and should be elected to the new company.  Is the Minister really serious about industrial democracy and about worker participation? It would be deplorable if this new body had not such representation.  I ask the Minister to single out this amendment above all others.  There was a lengthy debate during the passing of one of the Agricultural Bills in the House with regard to this organisation.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 27 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 17, Part I of the First Schedule, between lines 9 and 10, to insert &ldquo;The Irish Forestry Board Limited&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the Minister's sincerity regarding the role of the worker in the semi-State sector.  Why have those workers been excluded?  If the Minister is serious about involving the workers he should include the Forestry Board.  Amendment No. 37 seeks the deletion of lines 15 and 16 which refers to the National Rehabilitation Board.  Representation in this case is being reduced to two, which is unacceptable. I will be interested to hear the <Col N="1272" /> Minister's reply.  The Minister, consciously or otherwise, is eroding the role of the worker director and undermining the concept of industrial democracy.  He may not accept that but when there are exclusions and reductions of representation on various boards it is time to question the Minister's intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is astounding that adding 39 organisations to the position of worker participation could be interpreted as eroding their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are there exclusions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is is very hard to exclude something which has not been set up like the Irish Forestry Board and Teagasc &mdash; they are not legal entities.  Therefore, their position has not been eroded.  The purpose of these amendments is to add certain enterprises to the Bill for worker-director arrangements.  The proposed enterprises include five financial institutions referred to by Deputy Sherlock. The financial institutions have been excluded from the scope of the Bill because the Government are concerned to safeguard the highly confidential character of their operations in the private, corporate and public sectors.  The confidential nature of their work must preclude the establishment of channels for reporting back on individual customers and incentive market information. From discussions I have had, I understand that this is an accepted position in those organisations as they have their own arrangements, not related to this legislation.  Even though these decisions were made around Christmas, there has been no representation from any of these organisations to me or to the Department of Labour.  They understand their position but, if they wish to forward proposals, I will be glad to look at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals contained in the Bill regarding RTE and Eolas provide for the sub-board participation to fully explore the opportunities for involvement given to them in the Bill before seeking to be <Col N="1273" /> included in worker-director arrangements. This was probably the reason that the previous Minister admitted RTE. designation of enterprises for worker-director arrangements should be a matter for the appropriate Minister to decide in due course.</P>
    <P>Under the 1977 Act, many of the organisations and semi-State bodies were given full worker directors.  The argument made by worker directors when they met me, in Government and Opposition, was that we should operate worker participation at sub-board level before going to board level.  This would enable them to get used to working together. When any of these organisations succeed in building up worker participation, worker-director participation could be looked at again.  Many people think that people get used to working together at sub-board level, building up confidence and understanding of each other and agreeing to disagree when necessary.  At that stage, they could become full board members and that concept is accepted.</P>
    <P>When organisations who have worker participation at sub-board level reach agreement where both sides are quite confident, they can then have worker directors on the board.  Since 1977 we have not been allowed to make changes where necessary but under section 24 (2) of the Bill the Minister will be allowed to do so.  The Minister for Labour in consultation with the Minister for Finance can, by affirmative order, add a particular board.  That is an important change in this legislation which was welcomed in the Seanad and I am sure it is also welcome here.  If an organisation have proved their merit at sub-board level they can go forward, by affirmative order, without a lengthy procedure.  That is a great step forward and has been accepted by the agencies with whom I have been in contact.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health appointed a worker director informally to the existing VHI five member board.  A Bill comprehensively amending the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, will be introduced by the Minister for Health shortly and it will be more appropriate to discuss <Col N="1274" /> the size of the membership of the board then.  The provision of worker directors on the board of Irish Steel is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He has intimated that the appointment of such worker directors should be deferred at present.  The body to be known as Teagasc does not have a legal existence and, therefore, their inclusion in the Bill would not be possible at this Stage.  However, the Department of Agriculture and Food have indicated that Teagasc will in due course be included in the sub-board provisions in the Bill in place of ACOT and An Foras Talúntais. In regard to Bord Gáis Éireann, the Department of Energy do not consider it appropriate to appoint worker directors at present, but the Bill allows for the designation of further enterprise worker directors by order.  The procedure in this instance &mdash; as in others &mdash; could be used at a later date if it was decided that worker directors should be on the board of Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>The worker participation Bill coincided with the legislation in regard to FÁS and I gave a commitment some time ago to the Workers' Union Of Ireland and other unions concerned that they could proceed with worker director elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the proper way to proceed is by sub-board level and then on to a full board?  Perhaps he will explain why that course had the reverse effect in IFI?  The worker directors were on the full board of NET, yet when there was a joint venture with Imperial Chemical Industries and with what emerged as IFI, the role of the worker director was significantly reduced.  Is the Minister suggesting that the sub-board level is a process of learning about the company?  I would not like to see what happened to NET repeated. Does the Minister not see any obstacles to appointing worker directors to the boards of Teagasc and the Irish Forestry Board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, as soon as Teagasc become a legal entity, the Minister for Agriculture and Food intends that they would have sub-board representation and would continue to participate on that sub-board until the new organisation settles down.  The Minister would then be willing to consider whether they should have full board representation.</P>

      <P>Under section 24 (2) an order may be made which would allow worker directors to sit on the board of a particular agency.  Such an order would have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  New legislation would not have to be introduced, an affirmative order would only be required.  I assume that the Deputy's question referred to the process of going from sub-board representation to full board representation. In the case of sub-board representation the names can be added by the Minister for Labour in consultation with the relevant Minister and he can move on from there through the making of regulations and an affirmative order which would come before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a very streamlined procedure.</P>

However, there are four worker directors on the board of NET.  There are no worker directors on the board of IFI. I would be concerned if our semi-State companies entered into joint ventures leaving worker directors one step removed from the action, which is one of the concerns of the workers in NET. There are four worker directors on the board of NET.</P>

I do not want to be critical but I would be concerned if worker directors had no role to play.  I had a meeting with the worker directors in NET some months ago and although tensions exist they are working their way around the arrangements.  That is a practice which I would not like to see happening.  The arguments in regard to NET are much broader.  Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day was doing <Col N="1277" /> the best thing for the organisation in negotiating the joint venture and, as I have said, there are still four worker directors on the board of NET.</P>

Would it be true to say that it was not because of the confidential character of their operations that these bodies were excluded?</P>

      <P>In their own view, these financial organisations consider themselves to be different.  On a daily basis they deal with highly confidential information and whatever arrangements they will enter into will have to be kept separate from their other business.  I wait to see if these organisations wish to be involved at sub-board level but as far as I am aware no submissions have been received on this matter.  Having been involved with a union in a dispute in the Central Bank I understand that the Central Bank have their own internal arrangements and have trade union representation. Perhaps they do not see themselves as falling in line with this kind of structure.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to protect the interest of worker directors on the boards of State companies.  Amendment No. 15 arose out of an incident which occured at a board meeting of Bord na Móna on 26 April 1985 when the worker directors were not allowed to vote on a pay increase.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  If we are going to allow worker directors to sit on a board it is only right and proper that they should play a full role and it should not be left to anybody's discretion as to whether or not worker directors should vote on a particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 16 is self-explanatory. My amendment No. 17 provides that a worker director shall not participate in or vote on any question before the board which affects that director only and does not affect other employees of that body.  Essentially what that amendment provides is that if such a worker <Col N="1279" /> director does vote for anything he should declare his interest.  A worker director should be subjected to the same conditions as apply to other board members under which a person is forced, under standing orders, to declare his interest and not vote.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 18 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 14, before section 20, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;20.&mdash;The following subsection is hereby inserted in section 20 of the Principal Act:&mdash;</P>
    <P>`(7)  A Worker Director shall have the same (and no less) right to participate in the business of the Board, and to vote on any question before the Board, as any other member of the Board, including the Managing Director.'.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>These amendments are self-explanatory. Time does not permit me to expound further on them.  I would ask the Minister to accept them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's proposed amendments appear to upset a basic principle of company law which is the equivalent status of all directors.  That principle ensures that all worker directors carry the same rights and responsibilities as directors generally.  Section 20 of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, which these amendments seek to amend, has been carefully drafted to protect the equivalence of all directors. The provisions of that section affect all directors, not merely worker directors.  If an amendment of the nature proposed were made, other directors, with some justification, might seek similar and distinct affirmation of their rights as directors. I know that these amendments might give rise to concrete proposals in some quarters to restrict the role of worker directors on boards and worker directors generally.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the case Deputy O'Sullivan made.  As I said earlier, it was an isolated incident.  I am not aware that it <Col N="1280" /> has been reported or has occurred elsewhere. If that type of incident were to recur in the future we would have to deal with the issue.  However, the equivalent status of all directors is a useful provision ranging over many areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Housing Bill is a major social measure.  Its main concern is with the provision of adequate accommodation for those persons who cannot afford to provide it from their own resources.  Most importantly, it will provide a new statutory framework for the development of social housing whether provided by local housing authorities or by voluntary housing organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are many other important aspects to this Bill and I would like, therefore, to start by mentioning briefly some of its main objectives which are to revise and update the statutory basis for the provision, improvement, management and letting of local authority housing so as to ensure, in particular, that the needs of categories such as the homeless, the aged, disabled and travellers get due priority; to increase the powers of housing authorities in regard to the accommodation of homeless persons; to put in place arrangements to facilitate the sale of local authority houses to tenants at prices which reflect the present condition and market value of the houses; <Col N="1281" /> to provide statutory backing for a number of schemes of grants, subsidies, loan guarantees and assistance for housing introduced in recent years; to provide an easier procedure for discharging mortgages in certain cases; to amend the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, in relation to the provision of emergency accommodation and, in particular, in response to the accommodation needs of travellers; and to repeal the offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; which is contained in the Vagrancy Act, 1824.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill careful consideration was given to every aspect of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985.  The provisions of the 1985 Bill, which were considered necessary and appropriate, have been retained.  In other areas new provisions have been devised.  The Bill &mdash; as indeed the 1985 Bill would have been &mdash; is the most farreaching revision of housing legislation since the modern housing code was laid down in the Housing Act, 1966.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill on homelessness have attracted most comment since the Bill was published and I would expect that this area would be one of the main concerns of Deputies in this Second Stage debate.  Comments on this aspect have concentrated in the main on whether legislation should place upon housing authorities a statutory obligation to secure accommodation for homeless persons.  Section 10 of the 1985 Bill attempted to provide for such an obligation but one must pose the question, was that the most appropriate and effective response to the problem of homelessness? The proposed obligation was included in section 10 of the 1985 Bill not because it was legally or otherwise correct nor indeed because it was likely to significantly improve the lot of the homeless.  It was included basically because of commitments made by the previous Government in the course of a difficult debate on a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with some of the issues which would be raised by a <Col N="1282" /> legal obligation to provide accommodation for any single category of housing need.  The first problem is that any obligation required certain safeguards against abuses; this the 1985 Bill attempted to do.  First, it provided that a person claiming to be homeless could not force a local authority to provide him or her with accommodation if he or she had become homeless deliberately.  A second qualification was, in effect, that housing authorities would only be obliged to secure accommodation for persons who were capable of independent living.</P>
    <P>Both of these, though in themselves reasonable and necessary, posed many difficulties for housing authorities.  I suggest no reasonable person would advance an argument that local authorities should be obliged to house people who are not genuinely homeless but were merely abusing a provision in law to force a housing authority to provide them with alternative accommodation.  Similarly, I do not believe that housing authorities should have imposed on them an obligation &mdash; enforceable through the courts &mdash; to provide accommodation for a homeless person who did not have the capacity to live independently.  This would not be an appropriate response to the needs of that person.  The <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on the Homeless which reported to the Minister for Health in December 1984 recommended that homeless persons who were incapable of independent living should be the responsibility of health boards rather than housing authorities.  This is clearly the sensible approach.  Health boards have available to them the medical, nursing, caring and other services needed to care for these people; local authorities do not.</P>
    <P>The basic response by local authorities to the needs of the homeless remains the direct provision of accommodation but there will always be limits to the accommodation available to a local authority. The powers of local authorities to deal with the homeless therefore need to be expanded so that the smaller local authorities, in particular &mdash; who have very limited housing estates and very few <Col N="1283" /> vacancies becoming available &mdash; would have new powers to help them meet the needs of the homeless.  These powers are provided for in section 10 of the Bill. They include a new power for housing authorities to secure accommodation for a homeless person with a voluntary housing organisation and to pay that organisation in respect of the accommodation so provided.  In addition, housing authorities will be able to provide assistance, including finance, to a homeless person in order that that person may secure accommodation and, finally, a housing authority will be able to rent accommodation or lodgings for a homeless person.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new powers provided for under section 10, housing authorities will be obliged for the first time to fully integrate the needs of the homeless into the planning of their housing programmes. Homeless persons have not previously been identified in legislation as a specific category of housing need. The provisions of this Bill will, however, ensure that housing authorities will in future be required to take into account the needs of the homeless at every stage of the planning, provision and allocation of local authority housing.  Under section 9 of the Bill, housing authorities, prior to carrying out their annual assessment of the need for local authority housing, will be required to notify adjoining housing authorities and health boards and voluntary organisations who will then have the opportunity to bring the needs of any homeless person to the attention of the authority.  Under section 11, housing authorities will be able to set aside a specific number or proportion of houses coming forward for letting to meet the needs of the homeless and other categories.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that housing authorities may not respond to the needs of the homeless, or properly operate the new powers they are being given.  I would point to the fact that housing authorities, even without these powers, provided accommodation for over 1,800 homeless persons in the past two years.  I think the <Col N="1284" /> majority of Deputies would agree with me that housing authorities will act responsibly in using their new powers and will seriously address the problem of the homeless in their areas both directly and in co-operation with the voluntary housing organisations and the health boards.</P>
    <P>A number of sections of the Bill relate to voluntary housing.  Section 5 in particular will provide an updated basis for the development of the voluntary housing movement which can play an important role in meeting social housing needs.  As in many other countries, voluntary housing was the first organised response in the nineteenth century to the appalling housing conditions of the poor.  However, the scale of the housing problem facing this country in its early years was such that the State through the local housing authorities began to play a greater and greater role in meeting social housing needs.  For many years the potential and, indeed, the need for an additional arm of social housing was lost sight of in the mistaken belief that the State could solve all housing problems.  In recent years, however, a successful scheme to again encourage voluntary housing has been put in place.  This scheme comes within the wide range of powers conferred by section 5 on local authorities to assist the provision and management of voluntary housing accommodation.  Finance to enable local authorities to make fully subsidised loans for voluntary housing is already being provided by my Department. In March 1984 the scheme of assistance for voluntary house accommodation was extended to include accommodation provided for homeless persons.  However, between March 1984 and the end of 1987 only six units of accommodation had been provided for the homeless.  It was necessary to encourage greater take-up of this scheme by organisations working on behalf of the homeless and with this clear objective the scheme was modified so that accommodation for the homeless would attract in effect 95 per cent grants rather than the 80 per cent that is available for the other eligible categories of housing need. The technical standards and guidelines <Col N="1285" /> for accommodation under this scheme have also been revised to take account of the particular needs of homeless persons. The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement that an additional £3 million over three years would be made available for the provision of accommodation for the homeless under the voluntary housing scheme &mdash; £1 million of this being provided in 1988.  This brings to £4 million the capital available this year for assisting voluntary organisations in the provision of housing accommodation.  This compares to expenditure of just £248,000 under this scheme in 1984.  I am very pleased that there has been a great response to the special provision of £1 million for accommodation for the homeless in 1988 and already one project which will provide accommodation for over 50 homeless persons has been approved in principle.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme in the mid-sixties still faced major problems of clearing unfit and overcrowded housing.  Families in very bad housing conditions often had to remain for years on local authority housing lists before being offered accommodation. Recently, however, local authority housing has been available more or less on demand to families in bad housing conditions.  In the seventies and indeed in the early eighties single persons, unless they were elderly, had little real prospect of local authority housing. Recently there has been a dramatic change; for example, two-thirds of lettings by Dublin Corporation last year were to one and two person households.</P>
    <P>While the total number of approved applicants for local authority housing has fallen by one-third in recent years, this does not fully reflect the real decline in housing need.  More than anything else this has shown itself in a situation where reasonable accommodation has to be offered to a number of applicants before it is accepted.  A further consequence of the current supply position on local authority housing is the problem of vacant dwellings.  While some vacant dwellings cannot be entirely avoided, particularly in the case of a larger local authority, an <Col N="1286" /> undue number of vacant dwellings is a waste of resources and presents a serious and expensive management problem for the local authorities.  It is a problem that is not met by simply boarding up houses and this is an area where a more positive and creative approach by local authorities could yield many benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides a new procedure which is designed to ensure that the provision of local authority housing is in future better matched to the real needs of persons seeking such housing.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the emergence of smaller households as the dominant element in social and, indeed, overall housing needs was not adequately reflected in the local authority house building programme either in type of housing unit provided or in choice of location.  I believe Deputies will agree that a local authority housing programme of a much smaller scale than that of the early eighties is now necessary.  This limited programme must be directed at the needs now dominating the waiting lists and not solely at family type houses.  The housing needs of a one-person household are not best met by the provision of a three bedroomed house or flat.  When almost 60 per cent of applicants for local authority housing consist of one and two person households then it is wrong that the local authority housing programme should be dominated by three and four bedroomed family type accommodation. All the evidence is that average household size will continue to fall and this point must be clearly understood and addressed by housing authorities in presenting proposals for new local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Section 20 will oblige local authorities in providing accommodation to take into account the range of housing needs as revealed in their assessments under section 9 and, moreover, to maintain a reasonable balance as between the different categories of need.  These measures were proposed in the 1985 Bill and I believe Deputies will acknowledge that they are, if anything, even more necessary now than when they were orginally proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> The new tenant purchase scheme for local authority dwellings is now in operation and is attracting a very high response.  Under this scheme, the gross price of the house to the tenant is calculated in relation to market value and having regard to the structural condition of the house.</P>
    <P>The continued operation of the requirement for pre-sale repairs contained in section 13 of the Housing (Miscelleneous Provisions) Act, 1979, would clearly be wrong where house prices are being assessed on market value.  In addition, the procedure can be very costly to local authorities, can result in long delays in transferring houses and can cause a serious hold-up in sales.  Section 23 of the Bill accordingly provides for the repeal of section 13 of the 1979 Act and also for necessary transitional arrangements to ensure that the section 13 arrangements will continue to apply to houses being sold to tenants under earlier schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the scheme of remedial works to local authority housing estates.  For many years the local housing programme was directed at the provision of new accommodation with little if any attention being given to the need to modernise and improve the existing rented stock.  In recent years, however, the easing of the pressure of demand for new construction has allowed additional resources to be provided for improvements to the existing stock.  In this way the State's investment in local authority housing can be protected and the loss of dwellings to the rented housing stock can be prevented.  In 1988 the allocation for this scheme has again been increased and is now £10 million compared to expenditure of £7 million in 1987 and only £1.5 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the benefits which accrue from the injection of capital funds into the local authority housing stock though the remedial works scheme will be quickly wasted unless there is improved estate management by local authorities.  In this regard the role which the tenants themselves can play is of vital <Col N="1288" /> importance and authorities must now make every effort to foster and develop tenant interest in the running of their estates.  The consultation process under the remedial works scheme should prove to be an important headline in this regard.  Many Deputies will already be aware of a renewed spirit and pride in local authority estates which are being upgraded under the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections in the Bill which relate to the provision of housing, halting sites and other services for the travelling community.  Section 6 provides statutory authority for the recoupment by the Minister of the salaries and expenses incurred by local authorities and certain approved bodies in the employment of social workers in connection with the accommodation of travellers. Section 13 deals with the provision of caravan sites and facilities.  Section 9 requires housing authorities to have regard to the needs of travellers in their annual assessment of housing needs.</P>
    <P>Section 27 amends section 3 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to enable a local authority manager to undertake works which he regards as urgent and necessary to provide a reasonable standard of accommodation for any person.  This measure has been retained from the 1985 Bill and is in effect designed to help with the provision by local authorities of accommodation for travellers.  The serious problem of the travellers requires some measure such as this.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill deals with the power of the Minister to make grant assistance available towards the running expenses of a small number of advice and research organisations working in the housing area.  For a number of years now my Department have provided annual grant assistance to the National Association of Building Co-operatives, the Housing Centre and Threshold.  I am pleased to inform Deputies that a grant of £45,000 has recently been made available to Focus Point in 1988.  This grant is, of course, quite separate from the grant of £50,000 to Focus Point towards <Col N="1289" /> the cost of a project for the accommodation of homeless persons which was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  It is, of course, also quite separate from any assistance that may be given to Focus Point for provision of additional accommodation for the homeless under the improved terms of the voluntary housing scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding private housing, while the main thrust of this Housing Bill is in the area of social housing and meeting social housing needs, there are a number of important measures related to the private housing sector.  Section 14 provides a more up-to-date basis for subsidising the site costs incurred by certain persons of modest means in providing or acquiring housing for their own occupation, for example, through a housing co-operative, the Rural Resource Organisation, or joint venture housing.  This section provides for grants to be paid rather than a loan charge subsidy.  The current grant level is £1,000 per site.</P>
    <P>It is a primary concern of housing policy to ensure an adequate supply of mortgage finance for house purchase.  For many years this objective has involved the Government in providing substantial mortgage finance through local authorities for persons of modest means. However, the development of the housing finance system in recent years, particularly the emergence of the commercial banks as major providers of mortgage finance and the availability to the building societies of significant capital repayments from loans advanced in the seventies and earlier years, has meant that house purchase finance is now readily available from commercial lending agencies.  This development presented the opportunity of transferring from public to private funding a significant proportion of demand for local authority house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>Last year the banks and the building societies agreed to make £70 million available to provide mortgage finance to persons who would otherwise require loans from the local authorities.  As Deputies are aware, local authority house purchase loans continue to be <Col N="1290" /> made available as heretofore to applicants who are unable to secure a loan from a bank or building society.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements to encourage commercial lending agencies to provide this additional mortgage finance for lower income groups, a partial guarantee may be given by a housing authority to cover in the case of default payment of half of the amount by which the loan advanced exceeded 75 per cent of the value of the house.  Section 16 of the Bill provides the statutory basis for this new loan guarantee scheme and provides for recoupment by the Minister of all or part of any expenditure incurred by a housing authority on foot of any guarantee given.</P>
    <P>Although now terminated, significant expenditure continues to arise under both the mortgage subsidy and the £5,000 surrender grant schemes.  The 1988 provision for the payment of mortgage subsidy is £23.3 million and the provision for the £5,000 grant scheme is £3.5 million. Significant expenditure under the latter scheme should not arise beyond this year; however, payment under the mortgage subsidy scheme will continue up to 1993.  These schemes are being given statutory backing by sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that a new house grant may be paid in cases where a previous owner-occupier is providing a new house following marital breakdown if the person is in need of housing and refusal to pay the grant would cause hardship. This will be an exception to the normal requirement that only a first time owner-occupier may be paid a new house grant. This provision was also included in the 1985 Bill.  Section 4 of the 1979 Housing Act already provides for the payment of a new house grant to a previous owner-occupier providing a new house where the applicant's previous accommodation was destroyed by fire, explosion or Act of God and where refusal to pay the grant would cause great hardship.</P>
    <P>The offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; is contained in the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  A number of groups have sought the repeal of this offence.  In addition, its repeal was recommended by the Law Reform <Col N="1291" /> Commission in their report on Vagrancy and Related Offences which was published in 1985.  While the Minister for Justice is primarily responsible for the Vagrancy Acts, repeal of this offence is included in the Housing Bill as an element in the Government's overall response to the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Most of the remaining sections of the Bill are largely technical in their nature and do not involve significant policy considerations. Some of the more important of these are: section 7 validates certain payments made before the passing of this Bill; section 18 extends to all mortgages the simplified system for the discharge of fully paid mortgages which has heretofore applied only to building society mortgages; the provision in the 1985 Bill applied only to housing mortgages but under section 18 the simplified procedure will be available for the discharge of all mortgages and this is, therefore, a significant amendment to conveyancing law; section 29 deals with offences under the Act and provides for fines not exceeding £500 for knowingly furnishing false or misleading information or withholding material information in connection with obtaining accommodation or assistance from a housing authority.</P>
    <P>In my concluding remarks, I would like to make a few brief points regarding the overall thrust of housing policy and legislation as indicated in the Housing Bill, 1988.  This Bill comes at the end of a period extending from the foundation of the State during which the main concern of housing policy was directed at providing new accommodation to meet a persistent and often chronic housing shortage.  In this period much has been achieved.  For example, over 40 per cent of the housing stock, or more than 400,000 new houses, have been built since 1971.  However, as I have already indicated, as one problem in the housing area appears to have been addressed, new problems emerge to demand our attention, expertise and resources.  Problems such as homelessness and other special housing needs appear to require more complex responses than merely setting a <Col N="1292" /> target for annual housing completions. Large scale local authority housing estates present difficult management problems for local authorities and, more importantly, offer little satisfaction to tenants.  The 1988 tenant purchase scheme is, I believe, most important as it offers local authority tenants the real prospect of becoming owner-occupiers.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be well aware of the good results that sales of houses to tenants can bring to the appearance, environment and, indeed, physical fabric of local authority housing estates.  However, the sale of local authority houses to tenants cannot be the only response to the vandalism and anti-social behaviour which plague some local authority estates. What is also required is an enlightened approach by local authority housing managers to the management of their estates, particularly by involving and consulting tenants in the running of estates.  Locally based maintenance and management appears to have a key role to play in this area.  I will be encouraging the larger housing authorities in this direction, as the problem is clearly related to scale with the larger local authorities having the greater problems.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the comments of Deputies on the Bill and full and careful consideration will be given to these before Committee Stage.  We will also have an opportunity to tease out fully the details of the various sections in the course of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that at a time when the Government are presiding over the dismantling of the private and public housing programme the Bill to validate so many of the measures which ensure the success of the housing programmes of previous years referred to by the Minister is now before the House for ratification. I can only point to the irony of the Minister reminding the House that 40 per cent of our total housing stock was built in the last 17 years and to compare that proud achievement so very unfavourably with the record of output in the local authority and private housing <Col N="1293" /> sectors during 1987 and the anticipated output &mdash; perhaps I ought to say, non-output &mdash; of local authority and private houses this year.  The Minister said that the legislation will fundamentally update the main housing Act of 1966 and that is being done at a time when the Government are producing the entire recipe for a return to the days of housing crises, a phrase we had not heard since the later sixties.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, not with anticipation but with confidence, that the nineties will be a decade of housing crises the seeds for which have been sown by the policies of the Government in the last 15 months.  It is fair to say that the Government, and the Minister in particular, have in 15 months dismantled the proud and substantial achievements in housing of the last 15 years.</P>

      <P>We will be lucky, I suggest if the achievement, if it can be described as that, for 1988 reaches half the 1987 figure.  I cannot recall, and the statistics that are easily available do not go back far enough to tell us, the last time the anticipated output of local authority houses was so low.  It is interesting to compare those with the private sector figures.  On average more than 17,000 new houses in the private sector were completed in each of the years 1984, 1985 and 1986.  That figure also fell by 2,000 completions last year to 15,376.  I venture <Col N="1294" /> confidently to suggest that that figure will not be matched during 1988 either.</P>
      <P>We have the recipe for a return to the disaster days of the sixties as far as housing is concerned.  It is ironic that I am getting an opportunity to make those comments when the House is debating a Bill to validate many of the measures which were integral to the success of the housing programme of the previous Government.  There are specific sections in the Bill to validate mortgage subsidies, the £5,000 grant, the extension of the special scheme to provide up to 95 per cent finance for voluntary bodies to provide housing for the homeless and so on.</P>
      <P>The Bill also addresses a redefinition of the categories of people whom a local authority are obliged to house, in sections 2 and 10.  The Minister of State in his speech, which was more akin to an explanatory memorandum than to a speech introducing a major piece of legislation or enunciating policy, made a passing reference to the homeless.  In my view the Minister should have included in the legislation a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide housing for those who are known as the homeless.  One of the difficulties in this area is that the phrase &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; means different things to different people and the concern that has been expressed has often come from voluntary groups involved in providing accommodation, social services and back-up facilities for certain categories of people, mainly in urban areas, who do not have permanent accommodation. I am in agreement with not placing a statutory obligation on local authorities because I do not believe it would be workable or fair.  I do not believe that any attempt to build into the system a protection against abuse could have been successful.  The result of the natural desire of the voluntary bodies to achieve a regime where substantial and decent accommodation is being offered to the people they are concerned about would have been the virtual abandonment of the local authority priority waiting list for applicants for housing in the normal way.  That would have led to inequities and abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> Many Members have been members of local authorities which are housing authorities. Anybody who has been a member of a housing authority knows the extent to which people will go to use, manipulate and &mdash; I am afraid I must say &mdash; abuse the system in an endeavour to gain for themselves additional points or a higher preferential place on a local authority waiting list.  If the request that had been made in an effort to help a particular category had been included in the Statute, I am certain it would have resulted in chaos in the local authority housing programme where it would have been impossible to decide on a scale of priorities and where in an effort to solve one problem a far greater one would have emerged.</P>
    <P>It is equally correct that there should be greater emphasis placed on grantaiding the voluntary bodies in the provision of housing for the particular category who have come to be known as homeless.  However, I do not think that the provision of a sum of £1 million a year remotely goes towards adequately recognising the role played by the voluntary bodies and the amount of expenditure which it would be necessary for them to engage in in order to make a really meaningful contribution to resolving this problem.  It is particularly appropriate that the voluntary bodies should be encouraged and I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate them on their involvement at all levels in this area over the years and especially over recent years.</P>
    <P>The point has often been made, and indeed has been made in some submissions from some of those groups quite recently, that the provision of mere adequate housing accommodation alone for many people in this category is not sufficient.  There must also be provided back-up social services.  It should be clear, which it is not from the Bill &mdash; and I hope to pursue this further on Committee Stage &mdash; that the finance being made available to voluntary bodies is sufficient and is designed to allow them to provide not only adequate accommodation but <Col N="1296" /> the back-up social services that are in many instances necessary.  I do not think the local authorities if they were exclusively to endeavour to take on that role have themselves that expertise.  In that area it is the right approach that there should be greater grant-aid assistance given to the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I know the scheme was extended in 1984 to provide assistance of up to 95 per cent of the capital cost to voluntary bodies who provided housing for the homeless, but there was a very small number of units actually built on foot of that extension.  I had an opportunity to visit some of those units in Galway some years ago and cannot speak highly enough of the work that had been done there and of the standard of accommodation and back-up in terms of the social support that had been provided. As the Threshold organisation said in a submission which I am sure was received by all Deputies in the past few days, what is often required is more than a simple roof for people in this situation.  They very often need support.  Some of them may need sheltered accommodation. Consequently, the management which is referred to in the Bill should also be expanded to make it clear that it includes provision for finance for the social support services.  In that context, I want to reiterate that I do not believe the provision of £1 million a year will adequately allow the voluntarily organisations to expand their activities in the way which would be appropriate and which appears to be the general intention of the Government.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that if I had a regret about the time when we were in Government over the earlier years of the eighties, it is that, when substantial sums of money were being spent in the area of public housing generally, we did not divert larger proportions of those moneys to the voluntary organisations to encourage them and give them an opportunity to participate more fully in this kind of work.  Having said that, it is equally fair to point out that it is not always fully or publicly represented in the media the extent to which local authorities do house <Col N="1297" /> the categories who have come to be known as homeless.  The figure of 1,800 from such category who have been housed in local authority accommodation in recent years is a significant one.</P>
    <P>It is correct, also, that there should be an obligation placed on the housing authorities, in their preparation of an assessment and estimate of housing needs and requirements, that a special category known as homeless should be built into those assessments, that they should be carried out on a regular basis, should be communicated to the Department of the Environment and should play a much greater role in the thinking and forward planning both of the housing authority and of the Department.  In that context, the Bill is deficient in not insisting that the estimate requirement in section 8 be obligatory on the housing authority from the point of view of obliging them to carry out that estimate on a regular basis and at a defined time.</P>
    <P>There have been certain changes in the Bill from the 1985 Bill on which it is largely modelled.  I know that a number of the voluntary organisations are unhappy about some of these changes but I would like to hope that there is not a real basis for some of the concerns which have been expressed by them.  An earnest of the Government's intentions in that regard would be a commitment to a greater allocation of resources than the £1 million a year over three years which has been promised and also an amendment of certain of the sections placing an obligation on local authorities, for example, to carry out the estimate reviews at set periods and also clarifying that the money being provided to the voluntary organisations is intended to be used not just for the provision of accommodation and its management but also, where necessary, for the provision of appropriate social support services.</P>
    <P>The housing pattern has changed over recent years as the demographic makeup of society has changed.  It has been a source of concern to me that there was not quickly enough an appreciation on the part of housing authorities of that <Col N="1298" /> change and the likely change in anticipated demand.  There is an urgent obligation on housing authorities and on the Department of the Environment to realise that there needs to be a fundamental examination of the range of house type, house size, especially size of housing estates, which is sanctioned and built when the Department and the Government return to their senses and begin to build public authority housing again.</P>
    <P>There are many lessons to be learned from the type of housing, and especially the size of housing estates, which were provided in the past.  Many of them are expensive lessons.  In an effort to resolve the social problem of dreadfully inadequate housing in which many people were living, many schemes created future social problems because of their general layout and design and especially the scale of certain housing estates and perhaps the over-emphasis on endeavouring to provide such housing in green field areas on the basis that the relative cost was substantially lower than in providing infill housing in existing developed areas.  I am not sure that that transparent saving was real because it was very often achieved by not providing the additional infrastructure services that were necessary when entire new communities were transplanted out into green field areas.  There is not very much difference between the cost of infill housing and redevelopments in existing urban areas where those facilities and services are already available and the cost of building houses in green field areas and afterwards, belatedly, endeavouring to provide schools, shops, recreational facilities and so on which are so vital if the new and adequate housing estates are to be turned into a living community.</P>
    <P>In that regard there is an obvious need &mdash; the need is more obvious in some areas than in others &mdash; for a radical change in the management of local authority estates and the way in which certain local authorities manage their housing stock. It has been a cause of despair to me to see an apparently uncaring attitude adopted by some housing authorities <Col N="1299" /> towards the management of their housing estates, their apparent readiness to turn a blind eye towards the development of social problems and their inability to realise the scale of the problems, some of which have been created by the local authority themselves, which they have perpetuated by repeating them on a number of occasions.  It is not sufficient for the Department of the Environment to suggest that the approach to management of large local authority estates should improve at ground level.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Department to lay out the ground work and the principles as to the new and better standards of management that are required and, if necessary, to provide the training to ensure that management expertise, which is particularly appreciative and conscious of the social problems and social change in our society, is brought to bear in trying to solve these problems.  It is not just money that is necessary in endeavouring to address some of these problems.  Much of what is needed is understanding and basic management skills.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the phenomenon of certain people being without housing while large numbers of local authority houses are boarded up. These houses become not only unavailable for re-letting but also sources of social concern and degradation to the adjoining local authority neighbourhood and tenants.  It eventually has the knockon effect of driving tenants out of estates and it causes anguish to the people who are living there.</P>
    <P>The remedial work scheme which was set up during our time in Government is a realistic attempt to improve the fabric of older local authority housing.  It will have to be applied to some of the areas to which I have referred and which have been to a large extent abandoned by the housing authority.  These are areas of relatively new housing where the attendand community facilities were not provided and there was not enough attention given to the estates at the time of layout and planning.  The principle of the <Col N="1300" /> remedial work scheme will have to be applied to those areas if there is to be any hope of their being rescued and rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>We are at a particularly sensitive time in regard to the housing programme because of the demographic changes that are taking place.  We need to appreciate that the changes in society dictate that new and different types of housing and housing estates in new and different types of areas need to be provided, perhaps not on the same volume as before but with far greater sensitivity.  The application of new skills is needed in the provision, delivery and management of public authority housing stock.  Much has been achieved. It is wrong for us as a community not to realise the enormous scale of deprivation and degradation of so many multiple family dwellings in our cities and towns that existed in the twenties and thirties and which manifested itself again in the fifties and sixties.  Much has been achieved in the improvement of the basic facilities of housing for many of our people.  The record of achievement in the last 15 years in particular is a very proud and considerable one.</P>
    <P>It is particularly sad that, at a time when sensitivity to an adjustment in the type and range of public authority housing is so urgently necessary, we should be witnessing an abandonment &mdash; that is the only way to describe it &mdash; of the public authority housing programme.  I note that the Minister of State has listened carefully to the remarks made on Second Stage.  I would invite him to tell us how many new houses he has authorised for commencement in Dublin city and county and in the county boroughs, in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, so far this year.  His answer would indicate the uncaring approach that has been adopted to a problem that has become additionally sensitive and, for that reason, needs greater care given to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions in this Bill because they validate and expand on what we endeavoured to do successfully in the last five years.  I do not <Col N="1301" /> look forward to the future with any confidence in relation to the attention given to public authority housing.  There will be a decline in public authority housing output and an inevitable increase in waiting lists in the next few years.  The only thing that has kept those waiting lists from increasing even further is the vastly accelerated level of emigration, especially from the urban areas, in the last year and a half.  Were it not for that, the housing waiting lists would already be at crisis proportions.  Even with that, by the year 1990 we will be reading in the media again, and the term will have come back into the current parlance, of the housing crisis at least in Dublin and I suspect in other parts of the country also. It is not a proud record for a Government to look forward to in an area where so much had been done in the recent past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on behalf of my party on this Bill.  From our point of view, the two essential elements of the Bill are, first, in dealing with the area of homelessness, the housing crisis and the housing problem generally and, secondly, a number of financial elements which to a large extent are about tidying up or giving a statutory basis to some of the schemes already in existence.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in many respects, the Bill is very much a missed opportunity and I am seriously perturbed by the fact that it is likely to fail in some of its key objectives.  I have no doubt &mdash; and I am sure the Minister who has extensive experience in this area could not have any doubt &mdash; that if the purpose of the Bill is to deal with the extremely serious and growing problem of homelessness in our community, the Minister must realise that merely empowering local authorities to deal with that problem is not adequate and that that, in itself, will mean, consciously or otherwise, that the local authorities will give a vast sigh of relief because of rational reasons from their point of view they will evade their responsibilities in this area, as they have been doing in some cases down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have seen in this Bill a <Col N="1302" /> significant statement of future objectives in regard to housing policy.  The Bill is not in any way future orientated.  It does not deal with the kind of challenges which have been referred to by Deputy Boland. It does not deal with the issues that are likely to confront us or the changing nature of local authority and housing demand generally, and it does not deal with the changing social and economic expectations and possibilities for the future.  It is very much a tidying up kind of Bill and, in that respect, unfortunately, falls far short of what some of us would wish to see.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the fundamental flaw in relation to the problem of homelessness.  We will be seeking to have the Bill amended on Committee Stage to try to deal with that area, fraught as it is with problems.  The reality is if we are serious about homelessness, this is probably the only chance we will get, in a legislative context, to deal with this matter within the next five to ten years. Accordingly, we cannot afford to let the opportunity pass by letting a Bill go through which empowers local authorities to deal with this issue &mdash; the local authorities already have these powers if they wish to use them &mdash; while not insisting that they have a duty to deal with the problem of people who are marginalised, often totally inarticulate and generally unrepresented or under-represented. Naturally, they are not a lobby group and, but for the work of some voluntary organisations they would be largely unrepresented even in the context of a debate like this.  This is an opportunity to make advances for them and there is an obligation on us to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not in any sense evolutionary. It does not deal with future policy, or point to any significant change, apart from the financial side effects of the Bill, in terms of this Government's vision of how housing policy should develop over the next number of years.  That is a major and fundamental flaw.</P>
    <P>In relation to homelessness, we have a constitutional obligation to provide shelter for people.  Article 45 of the Constitution says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> The State pledges itself to safeguard with especial care the economic interest with the weaker sections of the community, and, where necessary, to contribute to the support of the infirm, the widow, the orphan and the aged.</P>
    <P>Prior to the passage of this Bill, a specific section of the Vagrancy Act made it an offence to be found wandering abroad without any visible means of support.  I am pleased to see that this is being removed from the Statute Book.  It is an abhorrent, replusive, outdated notion that because a person is destitute or poor he could break the law.  However, the constitutional obligation is not to be developed in legislative form and I regret that very much.</P>
    <P>Our failure as a society in this respect is, to some extent, understandable because much of the legislation coming before this House and the attitudes in our society are formed by major power blocs. In a book called <i>Nobody's Neighbours</i> by Kieran Furey, at page 79, he seeks to explain that.  He said:</P>
    <P>The powerful economic blocs in Ireland are the farming lobby, the trade unions, multinational corporations, private business, and the State.  Trade unions and farmers' representative bodies are preoccupied with the interests of their respective members, and have little time and enthusiasm for, or interest in, agitation on behalf of downtrodden minorities. Employers simply tend to regard the unemployable as useless.</P>
    <P>There is, in other words, no valid argument in political or economic terms for improving the lot of those condemned to life on the margin of society.  There is only a human argument. This is where the State, with its considerable resources of finance and personnel, must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>The State has yet to face up to that responsibility.  Whether or not it will do so remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>That book was published ten years ago. Unfortunately, if Mr. Furey was reissuing <Col N="1304" /> and updating that book, I am afraid he would not have any reason to change that last comment, that the State has yet to face up to this basic responsibility in this way at least by insisting that some agency &mdash; in the Bill, the local authorities &mdash; will have an obligation to deal with the problem.  Unfortunately, despite what I am sure are the good motives of the Minister, the Government and some Deputies, the reality is that the outsiders, the marginalised and the homeless will continue to be a problem.</P>
    <P>The constituency I have had the honour to represent for many years has a particular lesson to teach us in that respect.  At that cliff face, I have seen evidence regularly of that kind of problem and I have seen the efforts of voluntary organisations, like the Simon Community, Focus Point and many others, trying to deal with the issue, but the ultimate constitutional and legal responsibility, financial underpinning and statutory arrangements have to be provided by the State, and they will not be under this Bill, in my view.</P>
    <P>It is important that we put on record that there is an obligation not just on Government but on all members of society to assist in galvanising the very deep instincts of selflessness and caring that are latent in our people to tackle problems like this.  In other words, it is not merely a matter for the State.  It is a particular difficulty in a society with an education system which consistently instils and underlines the values of concern about me, a self-centred education system.  What we are saying here is that unless all of us contribute in some small way in carying for others outside our own immediate circle, the problem will not be resolved.  Those nobler instincts are to some extent constantly battered in pursuit of self-advancement.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations have a role to play, and they are playing that role as far as they can.  I regret more people are not involved in those organisations.  It is very difficult for us to lay any fault at their door when there is not, and will not be if the Bill goes through in its present form, any legislation on the Statute Book which <Col N="1305" /> says the State accepts the responsibility and the duty to deal with homeless people.  That is a fundamental problem about the Bill and I intend to try to do something about it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The founder of the Simon Community was Anton Wallich-Clifford, whom I had the great pleasure of meeting many years ago.  A paragraph in one of his works entitled <i>No Fixed Abode</i>, sums up the point I am trying to make.  He said:</P>
    <P>I feel, now no less strongly than I did ten years ago, that the responsibility for the socially handicapped in our society is one in which we must all share &mdash; and I do not mean by paying taxes.  The biggest danger in our welfare state is that it makes it too easy for us all to slip out of personal concern and care on the pretext that `We don't have to bother &mdash; the State takes care of all that'....  I believe that we should not become accustomed to practising our charity by proxy.</P>
    <P>He goes on to develop that point.  The founder of an organisation engaged in the area of voluntarism was quick to point out the role of the ordinary citizen.  We owe a substantial debt of gratitude to him and to the organisation he founded.  It is clear that the time has come for the State to become much more involved than it has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are particularly hard pressed in capital terms and I know from my experience that if the facility is afforded to choose between statutory priorities and options for investment in terms of housing development, the areas where they are empowered to act will be sidelined in favour of areas where they have a duty to act.  There is no point in the Minister's empowering local authorities to act if the capital allocations continue to diminish in real terms.  It is vain and rather hypocritical to think that because something is written into a statute or a document is drawn up in the Custom House it will change something in the real world.  Ready resources are needed to create the kind of infrastructure which is necessary and the mere <Col N="1306" /> empowering of local authorities will not bring it about.</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons the problem is getting worse.  There is an economic depression and we have an increased number of elderly people in our society, some of whom are unfortunately unable to provide for themselves.  There is a serious problem of homelessness.  It is difficult to get absolutely accurate figures in this respect but I was taken by a paper by Brian Harvey on the subject of administrative responses to the homeless.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Homeless people do exist in Ireland. They can be found on the streets, in night shelters, hostels, psychiatric institutions, county homes, and in our country lanes.</P>
    <P>The Cork Simon Community found 138 people sleeping rough in the city in 1983.  Dublin Simon found 98 people sleeping rough in the city in the same year.  Of these 98, 82 were men and 16 were women and 11 were under 18.</P>
    <P>He develops the figures in that paper, but they are probably the tip of the iceberg. Many people are homeless in the broader sense of that term, living in a form of shelter or some form of makeshift accommodation which is completely unsuitable. The dimensions of this problem are much more serious than perhaps we recognise. Some of this is because of the unfocused and rather formless shape of the problem. It does not represent a clear constituency in terms of being readily identifiable.  Mr. Harvey's paper goes on to deal with the health boards and their experiences.  It is clear that the problem is very serious. The most recent report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul points out the enormous and growing problems which they confront.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it has not been clear whose responsibility it was to deal with this problem.  In some areas local authorities and health boards, like Pontius Pilate, washed their hands of the problem and referred homeless people to each other.  No one agency would accept responsibility.  The Bill at least states that the local authority is the responsible <Col N="1307" /> agency.  Unfortunately, because of the way in which the Bill is presented &mdash; it is a significant deviation from the 1985 Bill &mdash; I believe it will fail.</P>
    <P>The State has to be the guarantor of last resort, at the very least.  There is no recourse for homeless people except to the State.  Provision should be available for them but it is not.</P>
    <P>The whole question of a housing crisis is very pertinent.  The housing problem has been tackled relatively well over the past few years but unfortunately the gaunt spectre of a housing crisis is about to re-emerge.  This will further aggravate the problem we have been talking about. The National Campaign for the Homeless have published a paper on the link between housing and homelessness by Brian Harvey and Mary Higgins.  That paper states:</P>
    <P>Just as the contraction of public housing in Ireland in the 1950s led to the housing crisis of the 1960s (and ensuing homelessness), so too is there a danger that the severe contraction in public housing anticipated over 1987-1990 is likely to provoke a crisis in the 1990s (and ensuing homelessness).</P>
    <P>It is clear there are tough days ahead in the housing area and this Bill may be the last chance to redress some of those problems.</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask to what extent we have succeeded.  In doing my research the name of the late Ian Hart cropped up on a number of occasions.  I looked at one of his works, <i>Dublin Simon Community 1971-1976</i>, published by the ESRI.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Statutory involvement should aim at reducing as far as possible the population of the large central city hostels and rough sleepers in Irish cities by a programme of research, individual assessment and resettlement on an individual or small group basis within the local community... Careful study should also be made of housing needs and ways of meeting them.  These researchers <Col N="1308" /> should be organised and co-ordinated by some central body such as the Department of the Environment. They should advert to possibilities of reducing the recruitment of new members to the central city hostels by such measures as, for example, requiring local authorities to incorporate flats, chalets or small group homes for such groups as single homeless or elderly within all new local authority housing projects.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to see his awareness of these problems some ten years ago and the need to insist that local authorities should address the problem.</P>
    <P>I will be appealing to the Minister to introduce an amendment to enable him to enforce that obligation when reviewing the scheme of letting which has to be submitted to his Department annually by each local authority.  I will be relatively satisfied if we can amend the Bill to place that duty on local authorities.  If that cannot be done, then the scheme of letting priorities must have built into it capacity for the Minister to deem a scheme insufficient because it does not deal adequately with the problem of the homeless and the marginalised.</P>
    <P>Many elements of the Bill concern the financial arrangements for some of the existing schemes.  Some of the schemes the Minister has initiated are extremely worthy in that they facilitate the possibility of more home ownership, but in reality the valuation of houses and the percentage loans involved rests ultimately with the local authority.  Some form of independent valuation is essential if we are to get meaningful valuations rather than some outdated notion which could be said to arise from a conflict of interest.  The local authority, hard strapped for cash, will inevitably be tempted consciously or otherwise to undervalue houses in order to minimise the percentage loans that will be given.  I know, from experience, that valuations are completely unrealistic in some cases. That is a difficulty which permeates housing <Col N="1309" /> loan finance relative to local authorities and it should be dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I regret the Bill does not deal with future policies because I hope and believe it is time for the old attitudes to local authority housing to be fundamentally questioned.  Why do local authorities feel obliged &mdash; and apparently are obliged &mdash; to continue to build directly and subsequently let the houses to people on their lists?  There was a time, thankfully past and I hope it will not come again, when incredible, substandard conditions were widespread and the State had to undertake the direct building of houses and flat accommodation.  To some extent, that should be reviewed because of its inherent inefficiencies and unnecessary costs, also because of the delays and divisions in society associated with that approach.  There is no reason for the Minister not to consider allowing local authorities the possibility of facilitating the people on their lists, with loans in some cases, so that they can purchase houses on the open market and become owners like anybody else.</P>
    <P>The obvious argument against that is the difficulty in regard to repayments. However, there would be a massive benefit to the State in adopting this course regardless of the repayments and how long it would take to repay them.  We should state as a policy principle that it is desirable to work towards an arrangement where there are no longer two societies, this division in the community between private estates and local authority housing.  We should not simply accept that that is the way it must always be.  There should be a healthy social mix of people who own their homes or who are tenants in them.  The ghetto mentality, which says we must have two different kinds of people in our cities and towns, must be eliminated.  There should be a move towards telling local authorities that they may use a percentage of their capital allocation for the purpose of advancing loans, subject to the terms approved by the Minister.  That is not unreasonable and would be a move away <Col N="1310" /> from the very strict arrangements at present which are extremely expensive in view of the total income from rent relative to the outgoings and the costs involved.  It would be extremely helpful and beneficial not just to local authority housing staff but to the self-image and dignity of people.  It should be their right that they should have the capacity to pursue their rights.</P>
    <P>Not everyone would take up such an option but some people would, as is evident by the response to the scheme introduced by the Government.  I could quote figures about the cost involved in maintaining dwellings and the total income from rent.  In many cases, there is an obligation on the State to house people because they cannot afford to pay significant costs for housing.  Many elderly people, the unemployed and &mdash; in some cases &mdash; the homeless are not in a position to take up that kind of option but others could and should.  A move in that respect is important and it is the kind of approach that my party would take.  We should ensure that there is genuine and adequate protection and compassion extended to those who are truly in need while making sure, as far as possible, that those who can look after themselves &mdash; as most Members in this House presumably look after themselves &mdash; should do so.  That facility is not being extended at present in a meaningful way in the context of housing policy and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Boland's suggestion about focusing on the possibility of abuse by local authority tenants. There is abuse but there is also abuse at every other level and walk of life because human nature is pretty much the same everywhere.  We get worked up about social welfare fraud and possible abuse by local authority tenants &mdash; although, God knows, while not condoning abuse I could not blame anyone for doing their best in trying to provide housing for themselves and their families &mdash; but I am not aware of a serious problem in regard to this kind of abuse.  Housing officers are vigilant and there is an extremely experienced corps of people in local authorities who deal with this area daily.  It <Col N="1311" /> is a little pernicious to single out this category of people as being, by genetic conditioning, different.  I have no experience of that and I do not accept it.  It is not in accordance with what some of us believe to be the case.</P>

      <P>We are not abusing ourselves, which is sinful even by my standards. The point is that the only time abuses are mentioned is in regard to people at the bottom of the social pile. There is no mention of abuse when it comes to powerful and wealthy people. That is somehow legitimate.  Of course there is abuse; wherever there are people there are abuses and it is wrong on any level.  However, in this case a very vigilant corps of officers minimise the abuse and, if there are specific examples of abuse charges should be laid.  It is as simple as that.  Blanket allegations about certain categories of people should not be made because they have honourably and honestly tried to get shelter for themselves and their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not start the argument. Deputy Boland had a chance to do something about these issues when he was in office but now he is moaning and groaning about the Bill.  It is very difficult to take that kind of nonsense.  I am making the point that there is abuse at every level of society but the only abuse referred to in the context of this debate is by people at the bottom of the scale. It should not be applied to everybody who is looking for a home.</P>
      <P>In section 13 of the Bill there is a reference to the travelling community and there is a facility for local authorities to be empowered to do something about it.  We know exactly what they will do unless the Government force them to address the problem.  They will do the same as they have done down through the years.  Some of them have done excellent work while others have run away from the problem.  In some cases travellers have been chased away by craven councillors. In many cases local authorities have evaded and ducked their responsibilities. The Minister has to look again at whether a section of an Act which empowers a local authority to do something will have any effect given that the natural instinct, in the context of a declining capital budget, is to run away from such responsibilities.</P>
      <P>There was comment earlier on the reluctance of the Government and previous administrations to place an obligation on local authorities because of their alleged fear that a massive fraud would be perpetrated on the Department. I do not accept that a valid argument can be made for refusing to place such an obligation on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> In this respect we can learn from the experience of other countries.  For example, there are lessons to be learned from the way in which the Homeless Persons Act of 1977 in Britain has been implemented.  That Act contains the infamous intentionality clause whereby any local authority can turn away any applicant deemed to have contributed to his own homelessness.  One of the constant fears about this particular group in society is that they are somehow likely to be corrupt.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities who have no intention in the world of housing homeless persons, either because they do not have the resources, the interest or the political will, simply deem the majority of applicants to be intentionally homeless. It would be absurd to compare Glasgow, where the local authority do not operate the clause, with Edinburgh where the intentionality clause is used in 39 per cent of cases.  The capacity of a local authority or government agency to divine intention is facilitated.  What happens is that the local authority interpret the clause in the way that suits themselves. The only other conclusion which could be drawn is that those living in Edinburgh are frauds whereas those living in Glasgow for some obscure reason are not frauds at all.</P>
    <P>The State should not make assumptions about its own people as the State is ultimately the servant of the people.  In this case it should not make any presumptions or assumptions about the likely outcome of enforcing an obligation on local authorities to carry out certain responsibilities in this respect.  Again, I am indebted to Brian Harvey for the figures which I have quoted in relation to those two cities.  They come from a document of his entitled &ldquo;Housing Policy and Homelessness&rdquo; which was published last year, the International Year of the Homeless.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill is disappointing because it does not provide a vehicle with which we can shape future housing policy.  It ducks some of the serious issues and therefore it is very likely to be a failure.  This is sad, because we are not <Col N="1314" /> taking one of the very few opportunities we are going to get to do something about these issues.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that the Bill has some commendable features.  At least the local authorities and health boards would no longer have to fight with each other about who is responsible for the homeless and people would not find themselves being charged with a crime just because they found themselves destitute. However, the fundamental challenge of assigning responsibility for the homeless and the challenge of changing the financial arrangements to facilitate people in pursuit of the ownership of their own homes have not been taken up in this Bill.  As far as my colleagues and I are concerned, an opportunity has been missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad day, the day on which this Bill has finally found its way on to the floor of this House, because the Minister for the Environment, who is not noted for his shyness or his inability to exploit what the commentators describe as a media opportunity, has chosen not to present this Bill and has sent his very earnest and very able Minister of State to do the job for him.  This amounts to a clear political and public admission that there is no political kudos to be gained from presenting this Bill in the House.  I say this with sympathy to the Minister of State who has been charged with the responsibility of introducting this Bill.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Homeless Persons Bill by Senator Brendan Ryan in 1983 there has been a struggle to see if it would be possible in this Republic, the twenty-seventh richest country in the world, to enshrine in our laws the right to shelter for every person.  That is what Senator Brendan Ryan's Bill seeks to achieve and that is the meat that is attached to this Bill which has gone through three gestation periods following which it has lost the word &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; from its title.  It is now simply called the Housing Bill, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, the Government have <Col N="1315" /> decided, with all the advice that is available to them, that this Republic is not yet ready to grant to every one of its citizens the legal right to shelter.  Unlike most other northern European countries we are not yet politically prepared to grant the right to shelter, despite our enormous riches and the fact that we have the highest home ownership, although this statistic can be misleading.  Let me make it very clear what I mean by this.  There are some people who feel that the waiting list system or the letting priority system of local authorities would be so abused that the granting of a right to shelter would cause mayhem but I am not saying that the right to shelter should automatically confer on someone the right to a particular house, of a particular size, in a particular street, in a particular district.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland effectively answered for the Minister when he explained why the right to shelter has been removed from this Bill.  Such a right was contained in the 1985 Bill.  He has outlined the arguments which have re-echoed up and down the corridors of the Custom House and elsewhere, that such a right could be interpreted in such a way as to make a nonsense of an orderly letting priority system.  That point of view is sincerely held.  Deputy Boland is someone who has the unique and unparalleled experience of having been chairman of the largest county council in this country.</P>
    <P>Although it is a point of view which I respect it is not one I agree with.  As Deputy Keating said, while there is some evidence of abuse, the scale and extent of that abuse is not sufficient to warrant our walking away or shying away from making the political decision in 1988 to grant to our citizens the basic right to shelter.  The reason the Minister of State is sitting here today with his officials beside him, Terry Prone and Carr Communications are not busy polishing a script, the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; team have not been invited to interview the Minister on bringing forward this marvellous measure and the Government Chief Whip wanted to have the Second Stage debate completed by 7 p.m. tonight is <Col N="1316" /> that the Government have decided that this sordid little business, denying the basic right to shelter, should if at all possible be got over as quickly as possible, but that is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's official explanation for the dilution of the 1985 Bill &mdash; why that basic right was removed &mdash; is continued in a very innocuous phrase at the beginning of his introductory remarks.  I commend the ability of the civil servants in the Custom House, whose skills I have frequently admired, to write such prose that covers such a depth of denial of a basic right with such a plausible explanation.  The relevant phrase is:</P>
    <P>The proposed obligation was included in section 10 of the 1985 Bill not because it was legally or otherwise</P>
    <P>&mdash; and &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; could cover a multitude &mdash;</P>
    <P>correct nor indeed because it was likely to significantly improve the lot of the homeless.  It was included basically because of commitments made by the previous Government in the course of a difficult debate on a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should seek out the author of that phrase, encourage him to take a career break, to sign up with the scriptwriters of &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; because he has a superb future ahead of him writing such scripts and explanations.  I suspect he would be much more profitably employed there than by the manner in which the Minister can afford to pay him in the Custom House at present.  It is a masterful phrase.  Effectively it says that we, the permanent Government of the State, the civil servants, who must make the managerial system at local authority level work, do not have to take account of the political debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas, that political motivations are perhaps somewhat suspect, that a political commitment given in the course of a Seanad debate was something that the permanent Government naturally <Col N="1317" /> could discard or ignore because the administration had now changed, there was a new Government in office who were not as committed politically to conferring the right of shelter on citizens of this State as had been the case previously.  I say that because I gave that political commitment in the Seanad on behalf of the previous Government.  I believe it was the correct thing to do.  Equally I believe it tragic that the Minister of State present, on behalf of his Minister, saw fit to remove it.</P>
    <P>In that scriptwriter's phrase there is an attempt to take away the sting <i>vis-à-vis</i> the removal of this possibility of a right. That attempt is contained in the clause which reads:</P>
    <P>...nor indeed because it was likely to significantly improve the lot of the homeless.</P>
    <P>Beautiful &mdash; nor indeed was it likely &mdash; beautifully qualified all the way down the line.  If one takes the example to which Deputy Keating referred in relation to a citizen of Glasgow, as compared with a citizen of Edinburgh, if the right was there, the person who was denied the opportunity of being housed by a local authority in Edinburgh could have had the right to take action against the burghers of Edinburgh who were never noted for their radicalism anyway, unlike those of Glasgow, to ensure that he would be housed.</P>
    <P>That is the first point I want to make about this entire Bill.  It is a retreat from a campaign initiated and launched by the Simon Community, led in these Houses, and still is to a large extent, by Senator Brendan Ryan.  It has gone through successive stages of debate, analyses and examination and, after more than a year, is resting in the Custom House, taking its place in the queue of legislation, not exactly generating much energy or excitement from the political point of view, whatever about the administrative commitment in terms of the resources made available to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated at the outset of his introductory remarks that this Bill was a major social measure.  I <Col N="1318" /> say: would that it were; would that the Minister's introductory remarks gave an indication of the manner in which he regards housing as a major social issue in our society at present.  Sadly, I must concur with Deputy Boland that the Minister's remarks amount to an extended explanatory memorandum rather than availing of an opportunity to outline Government thinking in relation to housing policy and its consequences in a Bill which he described as a major social measure.  The reason that very talented scriptwriter &mdash; whose skills we have already witnessed &mdash; was confined to writing an extended explanatory memorandum is that there is no Fianna Fáil housing policy, there is no major social structure or system of housing policy evident to this side of the House.  There is the guillotine housing policy emanating from Merrion Street, from the Department of Finance, the axing of moneys, grants, schemes, some of which were killed 15 months ago.  We are now being asked to authorise not their death certificate but their birth certificate under the provisions of this Bill, such is the speed with which the mechanisms of this House operate, that measures which were alive and are now dead &mdash; killed by this administration &mdash; require retrospective legalistic validation.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat absurd that the energies of this House should be usurped on this kind of exercise but it indicates the preoccupation of many civil servants and lawyers to ensure that whatever is done is done properly and correctly.  While I would encourage such an approach in general, it is to be deeply regretted that there is no effective Government policy on housing.  There are many publications now available to the public at large, in particular to the Department of the Environment and the Government in relation to the nature of housing demand in our society.  Deputy Boland made brief reference to it.  It is significant that, in his entire introductory remarks, the Minister did not give the House one statistic.  In replying at the end of Second Stage perhaps he will give us some indication of what is Government policy in relation <Col N="1319" /> to housing, what is their assessment of current housing demand.</P>
    <P>Various indications have emerged from different sources to suggest that we would need to be producing a minimum of 25,000 new dwelling units a year.  As we heard today already, the figures for this year are likely to show that the number will be fewer than 15,000.  Over a period of five years which is the kind of timescale we should be adopting for examining housing output, it is clear that the measurable demand for housing ascertained by such bodies as the National Economic and Social Council and others, as against the level of output encouraged directly by Government through the local authority budget or indirectly through the private sector, the various policy instruments available to the private sector, show that the actual output will be approximately two-thirds below what is deemed to be required. Measuring housing demand is not a perfect science, of its nature it cannot be an exact science, but we have sufficient experience in this House and country to realise that we can ascertain a fairly accurate assessment of the order or magnitude of that demand.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by Deputy Boland &mdash; in fact, I expressed it last week in a newsletter to Labour councillors &mdash; that this Government are systematically, consciously, knowingly, laying the foundations of a housing crisis that will emerge in the early years of the next decade.  By that I mean not some date in the long distant future but rather within three to four years from now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland asked what were the figures for new housing starts in the boroughs of our major cities.  The figures are zero for Dublin, for Cork city, for Waterford and for Galway.  For Dublin County Council, the local authority of which Deputy Boland was chairman on a number of occasions, the grant sum of £100,000 was allocated for this year for new houses, which would buy just about three houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The fisheries boards arrange for the sale of rod angling licences through a network of distributors throughout their regions.  Precise details of sales etc., in 1988 will be supplied in accordance with established practice by the individual regional fisheries boards after the end of the angling season.  Because of the widespread location of licence distributors it has not been the practice for the fisheries boards to make returns on <Col N="1321" /> the sales of licences etc., on an ongoing basis during the angling season.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that I am not in a position to give the details he requires at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make it clear, lest there be any misunderstandings, that the licence revenue is collected and kept by the local regional fisheries authorities. Under section 11 (6) (d) of the Fisheries Act, 1988, provision is made that the duties payable as regards licences shall be paid to the regional board.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that apart from the licences he mentioned, there are other licences, commercial licences, eel fishery licences, and salmon licences from which revenue accrues directly to the fisheries boards at local level.  The Department do not handle that money or have any responsibility for the way in which it is collected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will outline proposed improvements in the search and rescue facilities on the west coast of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Marine Rescue Co-Ordination Centre (MRCC) is responsible for the reception and dissemination of information relating to marine distress signals originating in the sea areas covered by the centre and for the co-ordination of marine rescue measures in these areas.  The centre is located at Shannon Airport and is operated on a 24-hour basis by the Department of Tourism and Transport's air traffic services.</P>
      <P>The system of marine search and rescue in the State involves a number of rescue agencies including the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the coast life saving service, the coast radio stations, a number of port installations, the Garda Síochána and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  The MRCC can also ask for assistance when needed from the British Navy, the RAF and the British coast radio stations.  In addition, shipping in the vicinity of a casualty, and in a position to assist, can be called upon by the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the west coast is concerned, the RNLI have lifeboat stations at Arranmore, County Donegal, Galway Bay and Valentia, County Kerry.  The effective range of these three stations has been doubled in recent years by the installation of fast modern craft.  The institution is carrying out trials at two new inshore lifeboat stations at Clifden and Lough Swilly.  The institution have plans for two more inshore stations on the west coast. The RNLI are at present undertaking a <Col N="1328" /> comprehensive review of their Irish service and the results will be available later this year.</P>
    <P>Fifteen of our 54 coast life saving service stations are located on the west coast, from Waterville on the south-west coast to Greencastle on the north-west coast.  All the CLSS stations have been progressively modernised in recent times and a programme has been undertaken which will provide each station with up-to-date rescue and communications equipment and train the volunteers in their use.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service and Air Corps also provide assistance when requested to do so.  Three of the five Dauphin helicopters will be devoted exclusively to search and rescue operations and these are expected to have a 24-hour capability by the end of the year.  There have been particular problems with the deployment of Dauphin helicopters.  With my colleague, the Minister for Defence, and the Minister, I am currently addressing the problem so that the maximum use may be gained from our resources in the context of marine search and rescue through the properly planned deployment of our helicopters.</P>
    <P>The maritime VHF network is being extended.  At present the stations at Crockalough and Glencolumbkille in County Donegal, at Ballybunion and Kilkeaveragh in County Kerry and at Knockgour in County Cork, cover all the west coast with the exception of the area between Slyne Head in County Galway and Eagle Island in County Mayo.  By the end of this year, however, this gap will have been substantially reduced by the opening of a station at Belmullet, County Mayo and full VHF cover is expected in 1989.</P>
    <P>As a result the 24-hour listening watch on the VHF emergency channel provided by coast radio station staff will be extended to all parts of the west coast. This will enable all boats fitted with VHF radio to make contact in an emergency. Such a listening watch is already provided on the medium frequency emergency channel throughout the area.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the search and rescue <Col N="1329" /> infrastructure on the west coast is not as developed as on the south and east coasts. I have received representations on this question from concerned individuals and groups.  I am having the situation examined urgently by my officials.  In addition, the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee, who represent the search and rescue agencies as well as fishermen and yachtsmen, are reviewing the search and rescue arrangements off the west coast and will report to me in the autumn of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's answer and the lack of any positive indication of action particularly regarding rescue facilities and the location of helicopter services to provide ambulance emergency services for our seagoing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;fishermen etc.  May I ask the Minister if the Dauphin helicopters, to which he referred, have a radius of only about 110 miles or 120 miles?  Being located in Baldonnel is it not impossible for them to fly direct to effect a successful sea rescue?  When one takes into account that some of our large fishing vessels could be fishing 100 miles, or even further, off the west coast we are leaving our fishing personnel at the mercy of the elements because there is no adequate facility to rescue them in the event of tragedy and that this is a retro-grade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Sea King, or any other helicopter, there is a limit but these helicopters were bought some five years ago.  Certainly there are limitations to the radius over which they can operate.  Discussions are taking place at present.  I attended, with a number of other Deputies, a meeting which was called in Killybegs when we met with the west coast search and rescue action committee.  I appreciate that it was difficult for all Deputies from the west coast to get there because of the distance. However, three of us from the west coast were present, Deputy Denis Gallagher and my constituency colleague, Deputy Coughlan.  There were apologies from others.  There was an opportunity last week for a full briefing.  It was important for people like myself and, indeed, other interested Deputies to have attended that briefing.  Indeed, it is ironic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a reply to my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indicating the interest.  It is ironic that there were representatives in Setanta House from all parties in the House except from the Progressive Democrats.  In answer to the Deputy's question, we have had discussions in Killybegs and in Dublin.  As I said in my reply, we are having discussions with both the Minister, Deputy Daly, and the Minister for Defence and it is hoped to meet with the west coast search and rescue action committee immediately their report is available. With reference to the allegation that the only means of communication for the MRCC is the coast radio stations to <Col N="1331" /> determine the precise details of an incident, using two-finger typing as no telex operator is there, that is not true.  The coast stations do not have to wait for confirmation in writing.  They act immediately they get a telephone call, but it is normal to send the details by telex afterwards.  Once a person is in distress all commercial communications cease at the coast radio station and a call can be made linking the vessel with the MRCC.  The only reason a delay would occur would be that a vessel in distress is already in communication with another rescue unit or vessel.  If there was direct contact and it was in communication with another vessel one still could not get through at that stage.</P>

      <P>Before any Deputies intervence, we have made very little progress at Question Time today.  It has taken over 20 minutes to deal with two questions which have not even been disposed of as yet.  This is unfair to other Members with other questions on the Order Paper.  I ask you for your co-operation in being brief and relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government propose locating helicopters in the west in order to effect immediate rescue facilities in the event of a tragedy at sea?  Will the Minister agree that the Dauphin helicopters which are based at Baldonnel are allegedly unable to fly over land in icy conditions because they have not got deicing facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be a matter for the Minister for Defence to take a decision.  I said in my reply that this question is being addressed currently so that the maximum use can be gained from our resources in the context of marine search and rescue through the properly planned development of our helicopter service.  I do not want to pre-empt any decisions that will be taken as a result of meetings with the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee.  I want to put on record my admiration for this committee and their responsible and <Col N="1332" /> professional approach to this question. We will be meeting with them in the near future and I do not want to pre-empt any decisions that may be taken by the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Defence and eventually by the Government.  I understand there are problems in relation to icy conditions when travelling across the country.  I appreciate fully the necessity for search and rescue particularly off our west coast when we are so far removed from the east coast which, of course, is quite near the west coast of the UK.  All these factors will be taken into consideration before a final decision is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question before us asks the Minister to outline proposed improvements in search and rescue.  The Minister in his reply was long on detail on the present inadequate situation but very short on proposed improvements and it is the improvements we want to hear about.  Apart from admiring the West Coast Search and Rescue Committee, does the Minister accept the case they have made for the location of Dauphins on the west coast?  Has he or his colleague, Deputy Daly, any intention of bringing to this House the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue to be ratified?  If so, when?  Does he intend to invest in up-to-date technology which is urgently required at the MRCC?  We need answers to those three questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Deputy, I do not think the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee would even expect an answer at this stage.  They have been professional and responsible about it.  They want to discuss it with us, and then we will be in a better position to answer the question.  I would like to put on record that this year, despite the constraints, the one area where there are absolutely no cutbacks is in the purchase of equipment.  There is expenditure of some £700,000 there and I hope by 1989 we will have a VHF service right around the coast.  We are fully <Col N="1333" /> aware of the problems and the Government's commitment to the £700,000 this year is an indication of how seriously we treat this problem.</P>

      <P>I have one very brief question.  The Minister in the course of his reply initially suggested that the night time or 24-hour service of the Dauphin helicopter would not be in place until the end of the year.  That is at variance with what the Minister for Defence has been telling us.  He expected it to be in place at mid-summer.  Is there now further delay in this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he has satisfied himself that the diseases which manifested themselves in the past few years in salmon and trout farms are now under control; and that there is no danger of transfer of such diseases to trout and salmon in the wild state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the restrictions on the movement of fish and the certification requirements for fish farms are sufficient on the basis of scientific research at present available to control diseases of farmed fish.  These restrictions and certification requirements are, however, being kept under close review in the light of developments generally and particularly having regard to the results of ongoing research both here in Ireland and abroad as to the causes, transmission mechanisms etc. of the diseases in question.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that there is a danger of the spread of disease from farmed salmon and trout to wild fish.  In fact, all the evidence suggests that the opposite is the case.  Some diseases have been introduced into farmed fish by wild fish whilst other diseases which are peculiar to farmed salmon and trout are never found in wild fish.  Farmed fish are more prone to these diseases because they are reared under intensive conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="1335" /> his statistical answer.  Is he aware that a certain number of applications to local authorities for fishery developments of the nature he has discussed have been refused by local authorities on the basis that water taken from the lakes or rivers in which the permissions were being sought would be deemed unsuitable for human consumption?  Has he any guidelines to give such local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these are separate questions, but the question here relates to fish diseases.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the fish pathology unit in the fisheries research centre at Abbotstown are constantly keeping up-to-date with developments in this area.  Some of the problems in relation to fish diseases are complex and the causes are not fully identified either here or internationally. The whole area is constantly kept under review and we are keeping in touch with international developments and research in this area.  As I have said, the evidence is that disease is being introduced to farmed fish from wild fish rather than the other way round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important aspects of having control of disease in this area surely must be the fish pathology service we can offer.  Is the Minister satisfied in relation to the question here which deals with control of disease, that one fish pathologist working in Abottstown at the fisheries research centre, a highly qualified, vastly experienced man but vastly over-worked, is sufficient to say we have the situation under control in relation to fish disease?  Has the Minister plans to increase the number of staff in this area?</P>

      <P>A report of the impact on marine life of the dumping of sewage sludge by Dublin Corporation has recently been provided to my Department. The report indicates that further research is necessary to establish if the dumping has deleterious effects on marine life.</P>
      <P>My Department propose, therefore, to commission a further study of the dump site in question this summer.  The dump site in question is approximately two miles east of Howth Head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his response but I suggest to him that it does not deal entirely with the subject matter of the question, the discharge of sewage.  I forgive the Minister for not appreciating that Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation dump untreated sewage at several points around the city.  That is the first major problem we have to confront.  The Minister was correct in stating that sewage sludge is taken by boat from the treatment plant at Ringsend out to sea.  Is the Minister aware that all the sewage from the north of the city is discharged raw off Howth Head?  That appears to have been overlooked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This did not start in the last year or so.  Previous Ministers for <Col N="1340" /> the Environment, and Local Government, have had responsibility for this as far back as the early seventies.  The Minister for the Environment was responsible for monitoring discharges from land based sources but the Department of the Marine are particularly anxious about the effect of this on marine life.  A report carried out by UCG, commissioned as far back as 1983 by the Department of Communications, is available and we continue to monitor the position.  This year our monitoring will involve a reconnaissance survey using the most modern remote technology, remote environmental monitoring of the sea floor.  That is a high tech optical coring device that photographs the upper 20 centimetres of the sea floor.  Information obtained from this survey will give the Department of the Marine up to date information on the impact of the dumping. It will facilitate further decision making on the licensing of the sludge dumping operation.  That work commences this summer in four areas, the one referred to by the Deputy, one off the south coast and two others off the east coast.  The report should be available in September.  I will be asking the Department of the Environment to identify further sites for monitoring.  If the reports about the seriousness of this pollution are correct I do not think we should wait too long before asking the Department of the Environment to identify further sites.  We will keep in touch with that Department in regard to this.  I fully appreciate the Deputy's anxiety because we are just as anxious.</P>

      <P>The aim of Government in establishing the Marine Institute is to bring together, under one authority, all the resources of the State which are currently allocated to marine research, and to co-ordinate the activities of marine research agencies. The objective of the institute will be to undertake, promote, co-ordinate, and assist marine research, and to provide related services.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 State-funded organisations are involved in marine research or marine-related research.  These organisations fall into four categories, viz.

    <P>I have recently undertaken a critical examination of the concept of smolt rearing in lakes generally.  The requirements for smolts of the aquaculture industry should &mdash; to the greatest extent possible &mdash; be met in the future from land based facilities using pumped or gravity fed water.  As I recently indicated to the House, there are eight applications with my Department at present for smolt rearing projects in lakes.  Each application on hands will be examined personally by me in line with the policy I have outlined above.</P>
    <P>As for aquaculture cages in estuary locations, the Deputy may be aware that I may only issue licences for marine projects in those areas which have been designated for this purpose under the Fisheries Act, 1980.  Eight such areas have been designated in Counties Galway and Mayo to date, and rigid environmental protection criteria will be applied to the issue of licences within those areas. These will be based on an assessment of the carrying capacity of each particular area and licences will limit production accordingly and will prescribe monitoring and other conditions to apply.</P>
    <P>The policy I have outlined draws a careful balance between the need to exploit all employment opportunities in aquaculture in this country while at the same time protecting, fostering and developing our valuable wild fishery resources.  The extremely tight control and monitoring procedures in place ensure that any risks due to pollution arising from aquaculture are kept to an absolute minimum and should not be any cause for concern.</P>

      <P>I was most reassured by the early part of the Minister's reply which I interpreted as saying he is totally opposed to the presence of cages in fresh water locations.  However, towards the end of his reply he seemed to indicate that a number of applications were received for fresh water cages and that he would consider each application on its <Col N="1346" /> merit.  Is the Minister aware that, despite the proven horrendous consequences for wild fish by the existence of cages in fresh water locations caused by the proven high mortality rate, the need to use pesticides, the accummulation of feeding stuffs and so on on lake beds, Galway County Council on 17 February 1988 granted a temporary licence for only five years to a company to go ahead with fish cages? There exist in Lough Inagh in County Galway 15 such cages.  I would like the Minister to reaffirm that he is not prepared to desecrate the finest trout decks in the world by allowing any cages in the lakes of Galway or Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reassure the Deputy in that regard.  The bulk of the licences that were issued, whether temporary or otherwise, were issued not by me but by my predecessors.  My predecessor in this office issued a licence for the project the Deputy is speaking about but I think that has not gone ahead, if we are speaking about the same project.  Ten cage-based salmon smolt projects have been already approved in western lakes. They were approved mainly by my predecessor. As I have said, smolt rearing operations are not fully commercial fish farming operations.  There is a distinction to be drawn between them.  Smolt rearing stations produce young stock for the aquaculture industry in the coastal areas. This is a very valuable business which has to be taken into account.  The policy which I will follow will be to phase these out gradually and replace them with the type of land-based structure I have already indicated.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the trend of the Minister's answer.  Can I ask him if in the recent past he departed from an official script to give an assurance that there would be no fish farming or cage culture in the lakes in question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A script was officially released by me through the Government Information Service about two weeks ago but it got very scant publicity.  Even though this was supposed to be one of <Col N="1347" /> the major issues in the western areas which was inhibiting the introduction of the licensing arrangements for trout and coarse fishing, it did not seem to warrant any major publicity when the statement was issued.  The statement indicated, as I have indicated now, that it is not the policy of the Department to undertake fish farming in important and valuable wild salmon and trout fisheries in the lakes.  On the other hand, there is the question of smolt rearing which I think everybody here would agree is something that has been allowed in a very limited and controlled way.  There are ten smolt rearing stations producing salmon smolts for the aquaculture industry to enable that industry to prosper and develop further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that a number of applications were granted by my predecessors in office for smolt rearing stations.  The background to that was that it was felt there was a demand for smolts for the aquaculture industry <Col N="1348" /> which could not be supplied from elsewhere. It is important to ensure that this would not do any damage to the smolt rearing stations which are licensed.  Ten of these cage-based salmon smolt rearing projects were approved by the Department in the western lakes and the Deputy is fully aware of that.  What I said is that we have received eight applications and that these will be put through the rigorous examination I have indicated, keeping in mind that my policy, as I have outlined, is to phase these out in the future so that we will have land-based facilities using pumped or gravity-fed supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies know, all the fisheries legislation, which is very complicated and involves many statutes and Acts going back over a number of years, is implemented and enforced by the statutory bodies with responsibility in that regard, the regional fisheries boards. In their ongoing protection and management operations on a day-to-day basis they have statutory responsibility and authority to do that.  They do so in relation to all the statutes for which they have responsibility to enforce.  I do not think it is possible to identify the breakdown of costs involved in operating one part of the legislation as against another. The fishery authority and the regional managers have responsibility for a whole range of areas from fishery pollution to conservation implementation, enforcement of legislation on salmon drift netting and so on, and they furnish us with details at the end of each season.  It may be possible to get an up-to-date report halfway through the season.  We will endeavour to get that and will communicate any information we have to the Deputies who are interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the Government's plan to develop our natural resources, we indicated that it was our intention to examine the structure of administration and financing of inland fisheries with a view to developing our inland fishery resource to its maximum potential.  With that in mind last year on my appointment I and the Minister of State, Deputy P. Gallagher, undertook a series of meetings with various boards and the Central Fisheries Board which had been abolished by the previous Government without making any provision for their work or how the staff might be redeployed.  We visited each regional fishery board, met representatives of the staff associations and got their views as to how best this could be done.  One of the areas identified as being in need of fairly urgent attention was the financing of regional fisheries. The question was asked if it was desirable that we have a fishery service, which would manage, conserve and develop Ireland's inland fisheries to their maximum potential and, if we did require that service, how it would be paid for, and if it was reasonable to expect the taxpayer to meet the total bill for that kind of development.  It was against that background that some of the recent measures were introduced to enable further financial support to back up the taxpayers' contribution to the development of our inland fisheries.  I believe the policy objectives we are following will, in the long run, prove to be the most successful way of tackling the problems in our inland fisheries industry which at present and in the recent past has been in decline.</P>

In that regard, we would welcome any financial support from local communities which can go towards the overall development of this very magnificent resource.  The new arrangements which I hope to put before the Government very shortly will indicate how it will be possible to undertake a programme of development of our inland fisheries resource while at the same time ensuring that we keep bureaucracy and administrative expenditure to the minimum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Daly, as a member of the Government if he is prepared to advise our representatives at the Oslo Convention, or the Joint Oslo-Paris Convention which I understand will be taking place also in June, whether we will be supporting the move to terminate ocean incineration, as eight of the other North Sea States have done, and if he will be supporting the moves of all the other North Sea States to end sea dumping of <Col N="1354" /> industrial waste by December 1989.  I would like him to be a bit more forthcoming. This is the beginning of June and the Government must have in mind what they intend to do and what advice they intend giving officials who attend these conventions.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nor how we are going to approach this.  I must point out that last year, after we assumed office, the Ministers at the North Sea Conference made a declaration agreeing to terminate the option of incineration in the North Sea by 31 December 1994. However, at our request, an addition was inserted in the declaration to the effect that none of these wastes would be incinerated in other marine areas or disposed of in manner that would cause harm to the marine environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not attend the North Sea Ministers' Conference.  We were represented by a senior official of the Department of the Marine.  This Government have adopted the view that incineration of waste should only be allowed where there is no environmentally better option available.  Up to the present we have maintained that the incineration option should remain as other land based alternative methods of disposal may in some cases be more harmful to the environment or impractical. Our technical advisers have also informed us that incineration at sea does not present a hazard to marine environment. Our views have also been influenced by the fact that there are no <Col N="1355" /> common user land incinerator sites or toxic dumps in Ireland.  Toxic waste is exported from Ireland to the United Kingdom and the continent and some of this waste has been incinerated at the North Sea incineration site.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Spanish authorities have recently notified the Oslo Commission of their proposal to designate a new marine incineration site in the Atlantic some 300 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland.  The commission in turn notified Ireland under the prior consultation procedure.  The site proposed is a circular one some 60 miles in diameter off our south-west coast.  Of course, the Spanish do not need our approval because this site will be outside our territorial waters but the Government are particularly concerned at this proposal and we are seeking further information.  Until such time as we receive further information in this regard, we can make no further comment. We are extremely worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that matter, have we, in fact, a principled stand as a nation against incineration of organo-chlorine waste generally in our waters? We objected to the Spaniards' proposal to incinerate material 300 miles south-west off our coast, but there has been a more recent application from them to incinerate in the North Sea.  Because that is further away from us and less likely to cause us problems, perhaps, we apparently have not objected.  It would look as if we are selective in our objections.  If, as the advice to the Minister suggests, incineration of organo-chlorine waste at sea causes no harm to the marine environment, why do we object to the Spanish proposal for 300 miles off our south-west coast?  There is major inconsistency and lack of principle in the Government's stance on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to reply.  We debated this question on the Adjournment some few weeks ago.  We are particularly worried about the Spanish proposals, particularly so when they are looking for permission to use an area some 300 miles south-west of Ireland. One must ask the question, why there and not nearer their own doorstep?</P>

      <P>I realise the importance of the seas around us.  We largely depend on the fishery industry in this country, after agriculture.  We are seeking further information from the Spanish authorities on the alternative land base disposal methods considered by them. We are also asking them to consider alternative sites on their own doorstep and not on ours.  We shall consider the Spanish <Col N="1357" /> response, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, the Department of Energy and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There will also be a full technical evaluation carried out by the Department of the Marine's technical experts.  It will be my intention not to agree to any proposal which would harm the marine environment around our country.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that at the forthcoming Commission meeting the support we receive from other nations in relation to our stand on the discharges from Sellafield might depend on our support for their position in relation to ocean incineration and sea dumping?  That is a most important point. Have the Minister or the Department of the Environment considered the option of recycling instead of sea dumping and incineration?

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that the Irish aquaculture industry and individual projects within it are presented in the best light when submitted for FEOGA grant aid.  I have undertaken a number of initiatives to this end.  I advised the House at the outset that I was disappointed with the level of grant aid approved for Irish aquaculture projects in the 1987 tranche and have conveyed my disappointment informally to the Commissioner on several occasions.  Together with the Minister, I also raised the matter at the Council of Fisheries Ministers' meeting on 14 and 15 December last year.  In his response, the Commissioner referred to the five year duration of the present structures regulation and suggested that funding would be over this period.  In the December 1987 tranche, Ireland secured 6 per cent of the total FEOGA aid available.  This figure has risen to 10 per cent in the most recent April tranche of 1988.  I shall, nevertheless, continue to press for an increased level of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On specifics, my Department have had detailed discussions with the European Commission in relation to the criteria and methods used in Brussels to assess projects for grant aid.  On foot of that exercise, my Department will be drawing up detailed guidelines to assist in the presentation of projects.  In addition, my Department, together with BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, will ensure that proper technical and economic evaluations of projects in Ireland are submitted to Brussels.  I am convinced that aquaculture is a candidate which sits well with the European commitment to target peripheral regions and it has been indicated that our efforts to secure adequate funding will not be spared.  In relation to the April tranche, there was no aid for construction of new vessels and this was right throughout the Community.  For boat modernisation we received £293,280.  We <Col N="1360" /> submitted 21 applications and 12 were grant-aided.  In relation to aquaculture, the total which we received was £994,761. A total of £1,288,041&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to compare those figures with the 1987 figures because the 1987 figures, as the Deputy will be aware, included only one tranche and, of course, we shall have two in 1988.  It is hoped that the total of the April and October tranches will far exceed the 1987 tranche.  That is not to say that we in the Department are happy. We shall continue to pursue the matter and to seek a reasonable percentage. There was an increase from 6 per cent to 10 per cent, but we are not happy with that and will continue, if we have an opportunity at the meeting which has been deferred until 23 June, to impress upon the Presidency, the Commission and the officials our dissatisfaction with the income from FEOGA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present strike in the company stems from a continuation of a long-running dispute between the management and the union which has its origins as far back as 1986 and led to a six month stoppage between May and November last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute has its roots in a company decision taken in August 1986 to introduce short-time working on a week-on week-off basis.  This pattern of work continued for approximately five weeks when the company informed the union that they were laying off 85 workers on a temporary basis and that the remainder of the workforce would be retained in a permanent capacity.  This was done by the company offering full-time employment to those workers whom it considered the most suitable to produce the required output.  This was unacceptable to the union which claimed that workers should be retained or laid off on the basis of seniority-service, all things being equal.  This was rejected by the company and, as no agreement could be reached at local level, the matter was referred to the conciliation service of the Labour Court.  A conciliation conference held on <Col N="1362" /> 4 February 1987 failed to resolve the dispute and the matter was referred to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation.</P>
    <P>In its recommendation of 24 March 1987 the court said that the work available should be shared among the total workforce on the basis of an undertaking given to the court that the necessary production targets would be met and the standards of quality attained by the workforce at no extra cost to the company. Should this not work out over a period of three months trial, then the existing arrangement should be reverted to.</P>
    <P>Management rejected the Labour Court recommendation claiming that the arrangements proposed would not suit production schedules and a strike began on 11 May 1987.  Management subsequently informed the workforce that unless there was a resumption of work by 2 June 1987 the plant would close and production would be transferred to Liverpool. This decision was later revoked but management insisted that it would not enter into negotiations on the dispute until there was a return to work.  A number of workers subsequently returned to work.</P>
    <P>The company were not prepared to attend a Labour Court conciliation conference until 5 September 1987.  Management proposals put forward at that conference were rejected.  Further conciliation conferences were held on 3 October, 6 October and 12 October but no basis for settlement was found.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court intervened in the dispute on 22 October 1987 under section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, and hearings took place on 28 and 29 October.  A detailed recommendation covering all aspects of the dispute was issued by the Labour Court on 30 October. This recommendation was accepted by both sides and led to the ending of the strike in early November.  Difficulties arose, however, over the return to work formula and in relation to the proposed redundancies and the Labour Court became involved again.</P>
    <P>A further Labour Court hearing was <Col N="1363" /> held on 30 March and, in a recommendation issued on the same day, the court said that the parties should meet the following day to agree the names of those to be made compulsorily redundant. The union and the company should then agree on the payment of £60,000 to be divided amongst the workers being made redundant on the basis of length of service and each individual should be informed of his entitlement.  Any worker who was not on the list and who wished to accept voluntary redundancy might do so provided he accepted the compensation payable to someone on the list and provided the switch was acceptable to management.</P>
    <P>However, the difficulties over selection for redundancy persisted and there were differences also in regard to the level of redundancy compensation.  Strike action recommenced on 11 April and despite further conciliation attempts on 15 April and 12 May no basis for settlement emerged.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court held a hearing in Longford yesterday but no progress was made.  My understanding is that the company are insisting that redundancies take place on the basis of the Labour Court recommendation of 30 March.  The company also insist on last in/first out, subject to skill requirements and that any difficulties be referred to arbitration.  The company, I understand, also want a no-strike clause.  The union are opposed to the demands of management and in particular to arbitration for selection for redundancy and a no-strike clause.</P>
    <P>It now appears to be almost inevitable that this dispute will lead to a loss of 200 jobs in Longford town.  I have, since assuming office, kept in touch with all the major disputes which have occurred in this country over the past year and I have not come across any dispute where industrial relations and trust have so completely broken down.  The solution to any dispute is ultimately up to the parties and here there does not appear to be a will to compromise or settle.  Where that happens, there is nothing anybody can do <Col N="1364" /> and this would appear to be the situation in this case.</P>
    <P>My understanding of the Labour Court's position is that a complete stalemate exists and the court feels in the circumstances that it cannot, at this stage, contribute to further progress unless the parties exhibit a will to move from entrenched positions.</P>
    <P>The management have announced the closure of the plant this week with the intention of moving production to the UK.  I can assure the House that the Labour Court is on standby if it is felt any progress can be made.</P>

      <P>This is not a frivolous matter but one of great importance for the town of Longford and, indeed, for the country.  In view of the fact that the Labour Court have intervened and that all sorts of prestigious people have attempted to arbitrate, will the Minister intervene personally?  He has a record of successful interventions in the city and, because of the very grave issue which he outlined in his reply, will he now take the initiative and meet both parties?  I was a bit depressed to hear the Minister use the word &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; as if the matter has gone beyond redemption.  I do not think it has and it needs an energetic approach. I will remind the Minister of his campaign slogan &mdash;&ldquo;When the going gets tough Bertie gets going.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should very much like to be of help to the Deputy and I know the importance of the jobs to his constituents and to Longford.  Although the 200 jobs are very important, my Cabinet colleagues, those in the constituency, Deputy Cooney, the conciliation service of the Labour Court, the Labour Court itself, the trade unions and the management have all been involved in the <Col N="1365" /> dispute.  I have spent more time on this dispute than on any other although I have not intervened directly because there would have to be a basis for doing so.  In this case, week after week, month after month, I have called on the Labour Court to try to solve the five months dispute. As late as yesterday, the Labour Court tried to resolve it.  I do not want to say too much about what happened yesterday but Members of the House and the public know that it is unusual for the Labour Court, Mr. Fitzgerald and his staff to go to the centre of the dispute.  I am afraid there is no trust involved.  Neither side in this dispute is making an effort to resolve the problem.  That is the effective position and the battle has gone on for two years.  When the outcome is as hopeless as it was yesterday, not even I can do anything to save the jobs of the management or the workers of Hanlons.  I call on both sides to come to their senses today.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive, if depressing, reply.  Will he accept that this action in closing a well established industry and transferring it to Britain has the potential to inflict very severe damage nationally? The fact that one party to this dispute is a very close associate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he has been identified as one of our most prominent businessmen and that he has been appointed to Fóir Teoranta and other State boards is bound to say something about how industrial relations work nationally.  At the very least it would be interpreted that one of our most prominent industrialists who had been singled out for advancement by the Government appears to be voting no confidence in our industrial relations machinery and this is bound to be to our detriment in other markets.  In those circumstances, however remote the prospect of a successful outcome, I ask the Minister to consider intervening in this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to put on the record that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has outlined to me the problems which could arise in this dispute.  It appeared to him a few weeks ago that this company were going to leave our shores and since then he has endeavoured, with myself, to make some progress in this dispute.  I agree with what Deputy Birmingham has said.  It would be disastrous for good industrial relations, the country and, particularly, Longford, if this company were to close down.  I know from discussions which I have had that this company has a good export market but because of the industrial relations problems in the company they are losing a considerable amount of that export market.  I do not want to attribute blame to either side in the dispute and I cannot do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The reason I have given all the facts today is to show that all the conciliation channels available within the State have been extensively used.  While I have not become directly involved in the dispute I can confirm to Deputy Cooney that I was never too far away.  This was also the <Col N="1367" /> case during the five month strike last year.  The Labour Court have done all they possibly can in this dispute.  Yesterday the court travelled down the country for a full hearing and absolutely nothing happened.  Earlier today, I heard reports that both sides had said they were prepared to talk.  All that I can say is that they could have done so in the Labour Court yesterday but no talking was done.  Instead they lectured each other and did not move an inch.  If they are prepared to move forward I will consult with the Labour Court again, who, I have no doubt, would make it clear to me that they would be prepared to go back down again tonight or tomorrow.  If the management and workforce are not prepared to move forward, and it is sad to have to say this, but we might as well say it, when the House meets again Hanlon's of Longford will no longer be in existence.  It is up to both sides to face reality and to do so now.</P>

      <P>As the Minister will be aware, I raised this issue on the Adjournment in June of last year.  It was a matter of grave concern then, as Deputy Cooney has said, for both that county and for the country.  Would the Minister accept that there is a difference between this dispute and normal industrial relations disputes?  Last year Semperit made a similar threat that they would close down if the unions would not accept a particular deal and Packard Electrical in Tallaght also said that they would close down if the unions would not accept a particular deal.  This dispute is similar, but would the Minister accept that it is different in one respect in that it is an Irish-owned factory set up with the assistance of State funds and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government should have a special role to play in endeavouring to keep the company open?  It appears that all available channels have been gone through and because of this I ask the Minister to intervene. The particular industrial relations problems which exist in the company at present make it very difficult for the <Col N="1368" /> normal industrial relations procedure to work.  Because of this, would the Minister be willing to take special measures before tomorrow in an endeavour to get both sides talking?</P>

I agree with the Deputy when he says that this dispute is bad for industrial relations, but let me say that there is no point in both sides in the dispute saying that they would love to do something but then proceeding to outline hard and fast views and not giving an inch.  Perhaps I would not have thought this 48 hours ago, but it appears that some advance plans were made about where the company were going to go when they left the country.  If there was a major change of heart following some of the meetings, which perhaps may take place this evening, or following management meetings, I will consult once more with the Labour Court who along with the conciliation service have been involved in this dispute for over two years now.  Those involved are very clear on the issues.  I have been advised that no progress has been made and that there is no willingness on either side to move forward.  Talking is easy but they should remember that it is their jobs which are at stake and their company which is closing down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to expound my views on the kind of housing policy, if any, of this Government.  The Bill before us is a miscellaneous piece of legislation with no internal coherence other than the rectification of a few issues of administration and of law.  I put it to the Minister that really what this House needs, when he is replying to this debate &mdash; I am assuming that the Minister of State present will be replying &mdash; is an indication of what is Government housing policy. Some of the problems to which he referred &mdash; for example, the large numbers of vacancies for local authority housing in some suburban estates&mdash;have arisen because of the absence of any coherent housing policy.</P>
      <P>Effectively the Government have dismantled the entire support system of housing assistance, financial and otherwise, which was intact when they assumed office.  In addition, the Department of the Environment have a number of Bills either on the Order Paper or promised by the Minister, all of which would constitute components of a housing policy.  Yet there is no coherent framework within which any of the provisions of this legislation could be operated. I might draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Building Control Bill is still at Committee Stage.  Its provisions determine the standards of construction, not just of housing, but of all buildings in this State and have major cost and energy saving implications for the building industry in the private and public sectors.  Yet there is no coherent framework within which the administration and control of building standards can be guaranteed.  Likewise, there is proposed legislation on the question of multi-storey dwellings &mdash; which arose out of the failure to adhere to such standards in a particular block of housing accommodation. That too is on the Order Paper with no indication of when it is likely to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have repeatedly promised legislation in relation to the liberalisation of the operations of the building societies, which is clearly behind schedule at present.  Indeed, this morning <Col N="1396" /> on the Order of Business the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, indicated that the relevant legislation was unlikely to be ready before late in the autumn session.  The Minister for the Environment has promised legislation in relation to planning, derelict sites and compensation, all of which impinge on the effectiveness of a housing policy.  It is not that we are putting the cart before the horse.  It is that we are trying to catch the horse and rein it into the cart without really knowing what we are at.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to report to the House that clearly there is a lack of central management and coherence, at the political level, within the Department of the Environment.  I know from my experience that there is no lack of talent, ability or resources to enable the Minister to state, in replying, what is the Government's assessment of housing demand. One of the most recent publications in this area is a National Economic and Social Council Report entitled <i>Housing Requirements and Population Change,</i> 1981-1991.  Some of the figures contained in that report have been superseded by events.  Its author, Mr. John Blackwell, is probably one of the country's better known authorities on housing policy. There is a figure in his document, in relation to housing demand, that would suggest that, in terms of numbers &mdash; in order to maintain a balance between supply and effective demand in our society &mdash; we would need to be producing approximately 25,000 to 31,000 housing units per annum and that, over a fiveyear period, one could adjust for over-supply or under-supply.  Because of the dismantlement of the previous Government's housing policy, supply this year is likely to be of the order of between 15,000 and 18,000 units.  If that trend is maintained over the next couple of years &mdash; and all indications seem to suggest that that will be the case &mdash; then we shall have the housing crisis to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The final thing I should like to hear from the Minister, on behalf of the Government, at the end of this Second Stage debate is their analysis of what is <Col N="1397" /> the effective housing demand and, as a follow-up to that, their qualitative assessment of that demand because there has been a major demographic change in our society.  There has been a change in the structure of family size.  The average household size is continuing to drop.  All the indications are that we will converge towards the northern European continental family size, which would be just under three persons per household.  That has enormous implications for a local authority housing programme in most local authority areas, where the average unit of accommodation is a five-roomed, three-bedroomed dwelling.  If we are looking at housing stock presumed to last at least 50 to 70 years &mdash; with households continuing to decline in size to the 3.2 or 3.5 figure &mdash; then we must question whether this is the type of dwelling we should be supplying.  If not, we should be examining alternative ways in which housing policy should be structured, <i>visá-vis</i> local authorities and by way of inducement to the private sector, to ensure there is a match between household size and demand.</P>
    <P>These are all matters that impact very much on the business of this House because of the massive amounts of taxpayers' money that goes into the housing market.  In this year, for example, £50 million of taxpayers' money will be spent by local authorities on capital supply construction. There are, in addition, the various grants available from the Department of the Environment for first-time house purchasers and the effective massive subsidisation of house mortgages by way of income tax relief constituting a major investment of taxpayers' money into housing supply.  It is clear, following on a 17 to 18 year period &mdash; in which we have rebuilt 40 per cent of our housing stock &mdash; there is need for a qualitative assessment and projection on the part of the Department of the Environment of the kind of housing supply now required.</P>
    <P>In carrying out that assessment we need to examine the question of obsolescence. On previous occasions in this House I have referred to a book produced by Patrick and Maura Shaffrey on the <Col N="1398" /> Irish town, which was the first book of its kind to analyse the nature of Irish towns and their structure; from memory I would say the book is about ten years old. Indeed, it accurately predicted at the time &mdash; because much of what they predicted has proven to be the case &mdash; that the core of many Irish towns, by the end of this century, if not by the middle of the next decade, will be seriously at risk because of their age.  Because of threatened obsolescence much of the residential accommodations used traditionally above shops and retail units on the streets of Irish towns is no longer so used because it was found not to be suitable for the type of family accommodation needed in the sixties and seventies. We will have obsolescence problems in our building stock and in our housing stock, particularly in local authority flats in this city many of which were built before 1940.  There is not an adequate policy in the Department of the Environment to deal with obsolescence and the cost benefit of specific programmes to rejuvenate certain areas where houses will become obsolete and come out of the housing stock altogether.</P>
    <P>We clearly need a housing policy in the form of a White Paper.  It is quite some time since we had a White Paper and an integrated policy approach which would look beyond three to five years.  While the previous Government had a very comprehensive package of financial supports most of which were remarkably successful, they have been removed and nothing has been put in their place.  A White Paper on housing should not necessarily be confined to houses, it should cover urbanisation because a lot of the problems in relation to ghettoes and vacant properties in large housing estates are really the result of a mismatch between a housing policy on the one hand and the absence of a policy of urban expansion on the other.  A paradox in this situation is that Dublin Corporation can have on the outskirts of Dublin properties which are vacant and boarded up when there are 3,900 people on the Dublin Corporation waiting list.  This is because the housing policy of Dublin Corporation <Col N="1399" /> confused the provision of shelter with the provision of homes.  The houses of good standard are located in areas where people choose not to live for a variety of reasons.  We need a White Paper on urbanisation to look at the question of housing and small housing estates in built-up areas where facilities such as shops, schools and churches already exist.  All of the things that impede a local authority from assembling small compact sites for them or for the private sector to build on need to be looked at, things such as compensation, planning and derelict sites and so on.  Neither the private sector nor the voluntary housing associations can get into action because of the absence of a clear framework.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage of the Housing Bill which is regarded as a major social measure, the absence in the opening speech of the Minister of State, of any reference to these factors and to the overall scale of housing demand is worrying.  I invite the Minister to take an opportunity during the next week to respond to these matters so that we can get some indication of the Government's thinking in this area.</P>
    <P>When there was no housing policy right through the sixties and early seventies there was a major housing crisis.  The panic reaction measures in response to that crisis when it eventually broke into the public perception and on to the political agenda was to produce inappropriate housing solutions which are now costly monuments to that failure to plan so as to enable a steady stream of capital investment to gear up the building industry in such a way that it was capable of systematically and continuously supplying the kind of housing that was required in the locations where it was required.  All the signs of the abandonment of a coherent approach to housing are implicit in the actions of this Administration today.  It is at their peril that they ignore the advice in this House coming from people with experience on local authorities.  It is at their peril that they ignore the signs coming confidentially from the local authorities <Col N="1400" /> around the country in their direct correspondence with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>We should look at the whole question of how we use existing building stock to meet housing demands.  Are the Ministers present aware that one of the reasons why large sections of the centre of Dublin and other larger cities are required to remain empty, above the level of the retail shop, is because of insurance?  The secret planning agent of Dublin city has become the fire officer and the insurance company.  In order for retailers to qualify for the appropriate insurance associated with the operation of their business they are required to have the top of their property vacant although this sort of property would be ideal for single people or for two adult households which are an increasing factor in housing demands.  Single people under the age of 50 simply do not qualify for housing assistance from the local authority unless they have serious medical or social problems. Increasingly more and more single people, because of the economic recession we have had for eight or nine years, do not have the prospect of employment and therefore they cannot get housing for themselves.  These people are being made homeless.  There are literally thousands of empty rooms throughout the city because of fire and insurance requirements.  These factors do not seem to apply in other European cities.  I do not suggest that our insurance standards are more strenuous than standards in Amsterdam or Rome or that the fire officers in these cities are less dutiful in protecting the safety of citizens than the fire department in Dublin city, but we have a growing demand for accommodation in the city centre for single and two adult households in areas where transport and access to a wide range of services is not a problem and yet people cannot get accommodation in these buildings.</P>
    <P>The old argument about the problems that landlords have in not being able to charge an economic rent do not apply, because this market is totally unregulated <Col N="1401" /> with regard to price.  There is no intervention by the State in relation to the type of rents that can be charged and yet we have this paradox of empty rooms and homeless single people.  I invite the Department to seriously analyse this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in his opening speech referred to encouraging managers to involve tenants more in the management of the local authority estates to understand the problems of the good management of a housing estate.  The Department could start with themselves. Perhaps an exchange of personnel between local and central government would be very salutary.  A number of senior officials in the Department of the Environment could go for six months to Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council to learn the real problems of trying to manage a housing stock at first hand, particularly the problem of managing a housing stock where the allocation for maintenance has been significantly reduced.  Local authority officials should go to central government in the Department of the Environment to see the broader view so as not to be locked into their own narrow experience.</P>
    <P>As you are well aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, from your own experience on Dublin Corporation the reality is that most of the officials had no previous or other work experience.  They went into the corporation at school leaving age or after leaving third level college and have remained in that job all their lives.  The learning process for both sides would be an invaluable one and one that could easily be encouraged particularly in the Dublin area where there are three housing authorities &mdash; Dún Laoghaire, Dublin city and Dublin county.</P>
    <P>We are not managing the existing housing stock as well as we should.  It is quite clear that irrespective of what Administration will be in office, the constraints on the financial resources to the Minister and to the Department of the Environment will remain for some time.  Thus it behoves us to have a more effective and efficient system of administration of <Col N="1402" /> the existing housing stock.  This Bill suggests, in some ways, that the manager will be in a position to freely intervene in certain areas to do certain things.  There should be a far greater degree of understanding and knowledge between central and local government in this area.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the question of homeless persons.  The origin of this Bill was the Bill prepared by Senator Brendan Ryan and presented to the Seanad in 1983.  It was known then as the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 and it was substantially modelled on the British equivalent, the Homeless Persons Bill, 1977.  It grew out of the experience of the Simon Community, one of the most successful and active modern housing charities we have seen here.  Senator Ryan said in his opening speech on Second Stage on 9 November 1983, Official Report, Volume 102, column 409:</P>
    <P>This Bill is not introduced lightly. Those who support me have conducted what could legitimately described as years of research, consultation and discussion with many groups, such as the Department of the Environment, many voluntary groups, groups overseas, statutory agents overseas, etc.</P>
    <P>He then proceeded to go through the experience of the Simon Community in dealing with the problem of the homeless.</P>
    <P>The first difficulty we have today, five years on, is that we still do not have a satisfactory and acceptable estimate in statistical terms of the numbers of people who are homeless.  The definition of a homeless person as used by Dublin Corporation in housing people who are deemed to be homeless is a very loose one.  Dublin Corporation would be the first to admit it is something of a catch-all definition rather than one that would coincide with either of the definitions that have surfaced in the various versions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill before us, certainly the section on homelessness, totally derives its origin from Senator Brendan Ryan's Bill.  A political commitment was rightly given to write into the law of this <Col N="1403" /> Republic the right to shelter for every citizen.  Fears were expressed in writing such a right into our laws, understandable fears but not sufficient to justify us backing away from writing in that right.  The time has come when this Republic is capable of making that right a legal entitlement, giving to every citizen the right in law to compel a local authority to provide him with shelter.</P>
    <P>We will have increasing numbers of single people and single parents with one child who, through no fault of their own, or perhaps in some cases compounded by their own inability to cope or their own difficulties &mdash; but not necessarily wilfully or knowingly &mdash; find themselves in a position, particularly in the present economic climate, where they simply cannot get housed and where they cannot, through their own efforts, house themselves. There are very few people in this House who actually house themselves through their own efforts.  All of us depend, to some degree, on State support; through income tax relief on our mortgage, through home improvement grants, when they existed and through the first-time purchaser grant, and if one is not directly buying one's own house, through the local authority subsidised differential rent scheme.</P>
    <P>There are very few people in our State who do not receive some form of assistance enabling them to house themselves. The people who support the Homeless Persons Bill and who support the right to shelter are looking for a logical extension of that right to every citizen in this Republic so that they can claim shelter. I do not think it is unreasonable or too idealistic an objective for us to seek at this stage.  I believe our society has the resources to do it.  The provisions in the 1985 Bill had sufficient safeguards.  Obviously in any legislation there could be amendments that could improve the Bill. Nobody for one moment in this House &mdash; and certainly not the people present in this Chamber who have experience of law-making over many years and of administration &mdash; would suggest that legislation cannot be improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> What is at issue here is whether local authorities &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provide accommodation or &ldquo;may&rdquo; provide accommodation. I am very much in favour of inserting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I believe local authorities can respond to that legal obligation, not necessarily directly.  The Bill never envisaged that they would do it exclusively and directly.  The present Bill, and the previous Bill, made provision to enable the local authority to seek the assistance of voluntary associations such as Simon in meeting their obligations to provide what should be a fundamental human right in this Republic.</P>
    <P>There is sufficient room in the entire building stock of this nation which has been substantially renovated and renewed over the past 20 years to enable us to supply the accommodation in one shape, size or form which would deliver the reality of shelter for people.  I want to be quite clear about what I am describing. Fears have been expressed by people that an obligation on a local authority such as is legally implied with the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, would make chaos and nonsense of an orderly system of letting priorities in that the person who was homeless &mdash; we will leave aside for the moment the question of persons who are deliberately homeless &mdash; would, effectively, queue jump people who had been waiting on the housing list for a long time, who had accumulated points and who, perhaps wanted to be housed in a certain area or locality.</P>
    <P>The delivery of the right to shelter to a person seeking it on the one hand and the provision of a home for a family on the housing list in a particular area on the other hand are not necessarily in conflict. They do not have to be in conflict.  At present the local authority, to some extent, are obliged to offer housing accommodation to a person who is made homeless. Like myself, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has had the experience of people who found themselves homeless following a private eviction case or something else, who went to their local representatives and were told the only accommodation which Dublin Corporation could offer was such and such a <Col N="1405" /> place.  If that person refuses that accommodation, and we have had the experience where they have refused &mdash; and that is their entitlement as free citizens in this Republic &mdash; then the corporation, the housing authority, are no longer under an obligation because they have complied with their part of the bargain under law in offering accommodation where a person is homeless.  The person has chosen not to accept that particular form of accommodation.  If the fear behind the inclusion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is based on the assessment that people using this right will force the corporation to give them prime accommodation, in prime locations, ahead of people who have been on the waiting list for many years, then that fear can be assuaged or eliminated.</P>
    <P>It can be eliminated because we can write the scheme of letting priorities in such a way as to meet the obligations and responsibilities of providing basic shelter for people on the one hand with a multilevelled housing policy and a system of letting priorities on the other.  There is no unnecessary conflict and we have the resources and capability to make this a fundamental human right.</P>
    <P>I say, in no partisan way, that I am saddened that the caution and conservatism inherent in any organisation, no less than is to be found in a large bureaucracy, no doubt prompted by worries on the finance side, has enabled the Minister to seek cover and remove this obligation.  We are going backwards.  The 1985 Bill was on the Minister's desk when he came into office and the changes in it are minor really in many aspects.  I appreciate there are queues in the legislative pecking order and limits to floor time, but the year's delay in the publication of this Bill effectively is an indication of the sort of arguments that went on and the fact that there has now been a retreat from the delivery of the basic right to shelter to a wishy washy kind of thing with which all people directly involved in the area are unhappy.  I am not going to read copiously into the record of this House at this stage all the representations and various submissions <Col N="1406" /> made by the voluntary bodies, but the Minister is no doubt aware of the real concerns expressed by those who are in the front line of dealing with these people, with the numbers of homeless who come to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan in his Second Stage speech moving his Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 went to considerable lengths in describing the conditions of the homeless of this State in the period 1981-83, the run-up to the introduction of his Bill.  It makes horrifying reading and should be read by everybody in this Chamber.  For the vast majority of us there has never been a ]night in our lives when we did not know where we were going to end up sleeping. We knew that wherever it was we were going to be, it would be comfortable and clean and there would be running water and all the facilities we take absolutely for granted.  On the few occasions any of us have found ourselves in total uncertainty as to where we might be or not be &mdash; I am not talking about youngsters hiking or on holidays or having a good time, I am talking about not being able to get shelter for the night and, more to the point, not being able to get shelter for oneself and whoever one's dependants are &mdash; it was a frightening, scarifying experience.  This is the daily reality of the homeless in this city today.  They do not need to be homeless because there is accommodation for them and there could be more accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>As Senator Brendan Ryan said in the same speech, in many cases because we see a number of homeless people who are drunk and suffer clearly from alcoholism we presume they are homeless because they are drunk, when detailed studies done by the Simon Community and others indicate clearly they are drunk because they are homeless.  If you have to sleep rough and to rough it through the night, particularly on cold winter nights, the only thing that will take you through the night with some degree of amelioration is a quantity of alcohol with all the consequential side effects.  Case studies by social workers with the Simon Community and other such bodies refer <Col N="1407" /> to the reliance homeless people have on alcohol as some kind of amelioration comfort to enable them to ward off the cold and put themselves into some degree of semi-oblivion until sunrise starts another day and they start to tramp and traipse around the city.</P>
    <P>The downward spiral of degeneration commences with that deprivation of the regularity of a roof over your head.  We are not talking about the Ritz, the Gresham or the Berkeley Court, but about the surety of knowing that at the end of the day there is available a room, a roof, a bed, some degree of physical comfort known as shelter.  Until this Republic can make that a basic right, citizens of this State each night will face the horror of not having anywhere to be, not knowing where they are going to be and having recourse to the miserable comforts of cheap alcohol with all the consequential damage it does to them.</P>
    <P>Other damages come as well and they are documented in all the studies and documentation that has been submitted to the Department of the Environment. There are the sicknesses and illnesses that come from lack of regular hygiene, the skin abrasions and sores that come from wearing clothes that are not properly washed, get damp and stay on the back of the homeless person.  While the person shelters in a church, a park or some public building like a library, the damp clothes become a threat to the very health of the person who is homeless and the vicious, downward spiral of degradation and denial continues until the people become incapable of trying to house themselves adequately.  They become demoralised in trying to do something for themselves. They become further and further dependent. They become vulnerable then to all the problems associated with that kind of half survival.  Vulnerability to petty crime, prostitution, abuse of one kind or another, all stem from the basic condition of homelessness and lack of regularity of shelter to which they can retire at night and within which they feel secure.  That is the core of what the Simon Community wanted to have redressed in their Bill <Col N="1408" /> which was sponsored by Senator Brendan Ryan.  That is the core of what the Labour Party want to have redressed and believe would have been redressed in the 1985 Bill.</P>
    <P>It can be redressed without unleashing the fears of reactions that are felt by some people in this House in relation to what would happen to &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; the legitimate housing list.  Perhaps one of the reasons for the retreat from the 1985 position by the present Minister is that he is well aware that, while local authorities in the last three or four years were capable of providing shelter for many people who would have been classified as homeless, they will not be able to do so in the next two or three years because of the rapid take up of vacant accommodation on the one hand and the increasing length of the queue of local authority applicants for orthodox housing.  I use the word &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; in the sense of people who are not homeless as such, but are in shared accommodation and trying to establish a household of their own.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister has been well advised by his officials and knows very well that a famine of shelter is about to stalk this land.  There will be a great scarcity of low cost local authority accommodation and people on the orthodox waiting lists of local authorities will themselves have to wait long months if not years to get satisfactory accommodation and, therefore, opening that list to provide for people who are homeless and giving them some kind of right to shelter would compound a problem which is already beginning to get worse rather rapidly.  That might be in part an explanation for the retreat from the 1985 position where people would have had the basic right to shelter.  The Minister can answer that as he so wishes, but some answer of substance is required.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party intend to table amendments to sections 2 and 10 on the question of obligations and rights.  On Committee Stage we will deal with the difficulties perceived by those who are opposed to that right.  I hope we will be able to convince those Members of the <Col N="1409" /> correctness and courage of the course we are adopting.  I should like to assure those Members that their fears are unjustified. I do not believe that any Members would deny a person the right to shelter.  I think the Minister, if he was in a position to do so, would want to give to citizens the basic right to shelter.  In my view the Minister has been advised by people who are very cautious.  They foresee problems that I do not think will arise and if they do they will not be in the form or of such a size that will totally dislodge the housing programme.</P>
    <P>As a matter of courtesy I am putting the Government on notice that we intend to introduce amendments on Committee Stage and they have an opportunity to marshal their arguments against my proposals. I hope we will have a constructive and informed debate on the issue.  Most Members are also members of local authorities and they have practical knowledge of the administrative difficulties in relation to housing.  At their clinics they have encountered all the people who have tried to manipulate the system to the best of their ability, including their guile, to maximise their chance of being housed.</P>

      <P>We have all met people who were trying to increase their number of points so as to improve their position on the waiting list.  My experience relates to Dublin Corporation.  In some cases we were given information by applicants which was not in accordance with the truth.  We were told they were sharing accommodation with in-laws when they were not and they gave certain information to local authorities which turned out to be untrue.  Time and again when people were allocated a prized flat or a good house in a particular area &mdash; it usually arises a week after the allocation and never before &mdash; people have called me to say that Mr. Flynn, Mr. Quinn or Mr. O'Brien was not entitled to the accommodation because they could not justify the points they had been given for various reasons.</P>
      <P>I was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1974 and I can only recall three cases where the local authority subsequently repossessed accommodation let to a person because wrong information had been supplied.  I do not think my experience is any different from that of Deputy O'Brien, for example.  It is not a regular occurrence and the cases I can recall followed great controversy and investigation. The abuse that people fear came from those who were already housed, who were either sharing accommodation or were in a private flat.  In family terms they were part of a stable unit.  The homeless people do not have the regularity and stability of existing accommodation. They do not have the time to play some of the games associated with manipulating the points system, like some of those on the orthodox waiting list engage in, because of the nature of their desperation and the fact that they are homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very hard for those people to deliberately make themselves homeless or to deliberately jump the queue. Such moves would be easily verified by a local authority.  My objections relate to the failure to write into the Bill the right <Col N="1411" /> to shelter.  I wonder why the Government did not write into the legislation a basic right to shelter as a fundamental human right for the citizens of this Republic, the 27th richest nation in the world with the highest level of home ownership.  Are we not capable of taking that leap forward and making that a basic fundamental right?  We should be.  I accept that there are arguments against that and I invite those who hold the opposite view to put them forward coherently on Committee Stage.  They should tell us why they feel the provisions in the 1985 Bill will not work.</P>
    <P>The need to improve the voluntary housing association sector, as it is called, has received an enormous amount of verbal support over the years from all parties and different administrations.  As a member of a former Administration I share some of the responsibility for having failed to develop that sector to the level it should be at in comparison with other northern European countries with whom we make regular comparisons and, certainly, in relation to the UK which culturally and socially is closest to us. We are considerably behind them.  There seems to be a resistance to ensuring that local voluntary housing associations or co-operatives get proper assistance.  I cannot unravel the reason why.  I have never met officials opposed to co-operative housing although I met some officials who pointed to the failure of three or four co-ops.  The failure of one co-op in Dublin seemed to damn forever the idea of co-operative housing by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is verbal support for co-operative housing but the size of the sector is too small, with the result that many people who would like to have a say in how they are housed do not have it because of the way we administer our system of support.  I appeal to the Minister to do something by way of regulation, in legislation or by policy circular, about this shared objective of promoting co-operative housing.  He should encourage that system effectively rather than rhetorically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> In section 5 local authorities are given power to provide loans and give guarantees to certain people.  It states that a housing authority may, with the consent of the Minister, assist another housing authority or a body approved of by the Minister in respect of the provision of houses by way of a loan and so on.  The difficulty that those trying to start a housing co-operative encounter is that all those involved, even if there are 30, must go through the hoop of application 30 separate times; they cannot make a group application.  They cannot, so to speak, go wholesale and make a block application. Even if the promoting agency can show that the 30 applicants qualify for loans by the HFA in that they are under the loan limit, have adequate job security, have a sufficient level of savings and intend buying a house that is in line with the valuation of the relevant body, the applicants must fill in separate forms.  They are prevented from delegating their entitlements to a single agent.  The manager of a co-operative could make one application on behalf of the 30 applicants for loan finance and could process it in such a way that cash flow problems would be eliminated or reduced and the whole administration of the co-operative would be facilitated.  Despite the fact that this problem has been asserted countless times to officials in the Department of the Environment and to successive office holders, I do not understand why the present system prevails and we cannot get block applications and block processing so that the local housing co-operatives can function efficiently.</P>
    <P>The cash flow problems associated with the provision of direct labour home ownership co-operatives are the dominant problems which in the final analysis bring about the failure of housing co-operatives. I do not want to give the impression that they all fail.  We have a very successful but far too small third sector housing co-operative movement. Those which have gone under have done so largely because of cash flow problems which were aggravated by the insistence of the bureaucracy, for which we must <Col N="1413" /> all take responsibility, on treating each application separately, thus causing unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have very little money to deal with the increasing housing demand and I appeal to him to streamline the delivery of scarce resources by eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy by virtue of one applications sufficing where currently 30 applications have to be dealt with.  Any such administrative improvement must be welcomed.  I invite the Minister to investigate the reason for this resistance in the Department of the Environment and in some local authorities. If there is no logical reason &mdash; as I believe there is not &mdash; I invite him to write into the legislation a provision whereby a properly registered and recognised housing authority will be entitled, having obtained the necessary undertakings and consents from the members, to deal in a block form for whatever financial assistance happens to be available.</P>
    <P>We will put down amendments to this effect but, knowing the practice of this House, the Minister's amendments will always be better than mine, more reasoned, better phrased and better put together.  They will be so considered by the Chair and by the House.  We can give suggestions but the Minister has the resources within his own Department. The Minister should talk to Father Harry Bohan of the Rural Housing Organisation.</P>

      <P>I know him well.  He would be able to tell the Minister that this is an improvement which should be made and <Col N="1414" /> should be included in the legislation.  This was originally a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  We are now in the process of writing death certificates for schemes whose birth certificates we have not even validated. Those measures are effectively matters of history because they are no longer operative.</P>
      <P>We must look at the whole question of promoting and developing the voluntary housing sector.  There will not be another Housing Bill here for at least 12 months or perhaps two years.  It is unlikely that the present Minister, with two Bills already on the Order Paper and three more promised, will come back again with a Housing Bill.  This is the only opportunity we will have to fine tune our housing system and it would be criminal if we did not avail of it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will soon get an opportunity to declare his position in regard to the tenant purchase scheme which is covered in part in this Bill. People in my constituency have been in contact with me in relation to this matter. People living in urban areas in large flat complexes should be able to avail of purchase schemes, particularly the present one, in the same way as tenants of local authority houses.  Despite the fact that a working party has been addressing this issue since 1985 and considering how to administer the tenant purchase scheme in regard to local authority flats, no formula has emerged which has met with satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are difficulties but I want to suggest a formula for the Minister's consideration.  I will give it to him in writing later.  The suggestion relates particularly to the Dublin area because of the large number of local authority flats, but naturally the same model would apply to any other urban area.  We should be fostering a co-operative housing movement.  If not less than 70 per cent of tenants in a complex of flats offer to buy their dwellings, the local authorities should agree not only to sell their flats to them but to transfer the management and administration of the entire block to a housing co-operative society formed by <Col N="1415" /> the 70 per cent of tenants who are applying to purchase.</P>
    <P>The remaining 30 per cent who choose not to buy their flats would remain on as protected tenants, paying the same rents as before under the differential rents scheme guaranteed by Dublin Corporation. In the event of a vacancy arising among the 30 per cent, Dublin Corporation could let that flat to somebody on their normal housing list.  Alternatively, they could offer to sell that flat to the co-operative society on the same terms and conditions as before or according to the then current tenant purchase scheme.  The rents of the 30 per cent of tenants would be paid to the co-operative housing society as a contribution towards the overall maintenance of the block, including insurance, upkeep and so on. The remaining 70 per cent of tenants who are now tenant purchasers and who have mortgage requirements or obligations with the local authority would, in addition, pay some form of service charge to cover the cost of the maintenance administration.  If that was applied on a pilot basis in a number of local authority complexes of flats we could create a successful model of co-operative housing in an area that we have not been able to deal with so far.  In so doing we would release much of the energies and resources of people to run and manage their own immediate environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, in his opening contribution to the Second Stage debate earlier today, talked about involving tenants more in the management of their own estates, about getting them more productively involved in their own immediate housing environment.  One problem that arises is that tenants cannot get so involved at present.  There is a clear demarcation between what they are and are not allowed to do, between the areas that are under their control and the areas that are not under their control.  For those of us who live in houses with front gardens, there is a very clear territorial definition between what is totally public and what is totally private.  The public domain <Col N="1416" /> starts at your gate and at the footpath.  In a local authority block of flats there is a middle area that is neither public nor private, an area that the Garda will not enter into if there is a civil disturbance because they claim it is not a public area. That has been a worry and a frustration to many tenants of local authority flats.</P>
    <P>I am thinking in particular of an area not a million miles from here, off St. Stephen's Green, where there was a problem of petty vandalism which the tenants wanted to deal with themselves. There was drug pushing and handbag snatching by a couple of bad eggs in the area and by many outsiders who are using it.  The Garda would not go into the complex of flats because the area is neither public nor private.  In turn, that area became subject to graffiti and vandalism of one kind or another.  It is depressing for many tenants whose flats are like palaces, are impeccably maintained, well-equipped and well fitted out because they, like most of us, have put time, energy, emotion and care into creating their own homes.  They are frustrated when they step outside their own flat on to a balcony that has been inadequately maintained, that has graffiti along part of it and that has youngsters sitting on the stairs with cider bottles.  In many cases these young people may not even come from that complex of flats and are not subject to any kind of control because the maintenance man or the caretaker from the corporation, due to the substantial cutbacks, has long since gone home after 5 p.m.</P>
    <P>In terms of managing the existing housing stock, particularly that of local authorities, there is an enormous problem, a problem that will get progressively worse.  If the Minister wishes to come on a walking tour to the area of Mercer House in York Street in particular and look at the rapid deterioration in the fabric of the windows of those flats he will realise that it needs a major capital investment.  To build Mercer House now, which has approximately 100 dwellings, would cost in the order of £5 million or £6 million.  That is the cost of that asset which is situated off St. Stephen's Green, with churches, schools and so on beside <Col N="1417" /> it.  There are no bus fares required to get to work, unlike the experience of people living in Tallaght.  That is why people want to live there.  They cannot do the heavy maintenance themselves.  On a fourth floor you cannot climb onto the mansard roof and replace the windows even if you wanted to and had the skills because it is too dangerous.  That sort of casual, do-it-yourself maintenance that we all engage in can be carried out in the ordinary two storey house that is the norm around the country.</P>
    <P>Massive cutbacks have been effected by the Fianna Fáil dominated city council in Dublin Corporation.  Housing maintenance in particular was singled out for a massive cut.  Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Gregory, who are members of Dublin Corporation, will confirm this and will do so with far more knowledge than I have.  The real casualty of the reduction in local authority finance in Dublin city has been the corporation tenant of a flat. These flats are not being maintained and are rapidly going downhill.  Depending on the quality of community leadership in the area and the random lottery effect of the combination of certain groups of families, the flats are either stable or are deteriorating very badly.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents in Ringsend, Pearse House, Markievicz House and Tom Kelly Road, places where the taxpayer rightly and properly has invested massive amounts of money to provide housing, want to exercise the same right as a tenant purchaser, as their cousins or their neighbours who happen to own houses.  They cannot do so because the working party in the Department of the Environment since 1985 have not yet come up with a formula.  When the people apply to Dublin Corporation to buy their flats their applications are suspended on the basis that they are premature.</P>
    <P>I have carried out a study based upon an analysis of the average maintenance charges for a block of private sector flats. The range of service charge per unit is calculated at between £250 and £350 per dwelling which covers such things as basic block insurance, fire, upkeep of the communal areas and so on.  That works <Col N="1418" /> out at between £5 and £6 a week.  On the basis of the valuation system, if we take for example O'Rahilly House on which I have just completed an exercise and apply the tenant purchase scheme that has been introduced, the market value of a one-bedroomed flat, after the 50 per cent discount and the application of the £2,000, would be £4,000 which is the minimum price.  For a two-bedroomed flat it would be about £4,500 and for the one three-bedroomed flat in Whelan House it is £14,000, a £5,000 discount on the net price.  The mortgage repayments would be £2 per £1,000 which would work out at approximately £8 or £9 per week for a one-bedroomed or two-bedroomed flat.  The addition of the service charge which, applied in this instance, would provide a much better quality of service and maintenance than is currently being provided by Dublin Corporation &mdash; I hasten to add through no fault of Dublin Corporation but through the lack of resources &mdash; would bring the repayments to £13 to £15 per week.  That is less than the rent that these people are paying at present.  A two-bedroomed flat in O'Rahilly House, which was built in 1955, under the differential rents scheme, and where the inhabitant is employed, costs in the order of £15.50 a week.  The economic difference from the point of view of the tenant is virtually negligible. They would be in a position to increase that in order to do remedial work and improvements subject to the normal planning and by-law requirements.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister avail of the opportunity in this legislation, a unique opportunity that will not return to this House for at least two years, to write into the law in unambiguous terms, positive tangible supports for the housing co-operative movement.  Until that is specifically written into the legislation we will have the cultural resistance that I have described earlier, the motivation for which I am not really sure.  We have a tradition of co-operative association in the agricultural sector which clearly has been very successful and there is no <Col N="1419" /> reason why it should not be similarly successful in relation to local authority housing and certainly in relation to flats.  I will give the Minister the document to which I have referred.  If we set up successful local authority based housing co-operatives to deal with tenant purchase of flats, the success that that model will generate elsewhere will engender new forms of association and start buildings on some of the in-fill sites that abound in Dublin city, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  A great deal of energy could be released if the co-operative voluntary housing movement got specific entitlements, particularly in block or wholesale form, with cash and loan applications.  This is a very serious impediment.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the Department initiated a scheme of assistance to voluntary housing groups, but in the main this scheme was confined to elderly persons &mdash; an example of this was seen in my constituency, Brabazon House &mdash; or alternatively for homeless persons.  The Simon Community are at present constructing a hostel to provide accommodation for those people.  The amount of money involved and the scale of operations in comparison to the total housing demand of a minimum of 25,000 units per annum is relatively small.  Notwithstanding that, a move in this direction should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Department must build on their experience from their dealings with voluntary groups in these areas.  It is only right that at this stage I should acknowledge the continued assistance the Department of the Environment are giving to bodies such as Threshold, Nattcorp, The Housing Centre, Focus Point and so on.  When we compare the total cost of providing a single local authority dwelling &mdash; from the cost of the CPO to the management service charges, the completion of the building by a private contractor and its allocation to a person on the housing list &mdash; with the amount being paid to Focus Point this year, we see Focus Point are getting less than what it cost in real terms to build that house.  Admittedly, that amount of money is not to be sneezed at, and I am not suggesting it is an <Col N="1420" /> insignificant amount, but I am looking at this in comparative terms.  There is need for far more support for this area.  The most effective support is the legislative support which could be written into this Bill which would streamline the operation and entitlement of housing co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to itinerants and travellers.  It is a matter of extreme shame that we have not effectively dealt with this problem after so many years.  This is not an easy problem to solve and anybody who stands up in this Chamber and says it is, is deluding himself and misleading the House.  Some residents who live adjacent to large concentrations of itinerant settlement camps experience difficulties. However, the fact that these difficulties exist should not prevent us from moving forward resolutely, solving the problems and trying to educate the travelling and settled communities to live side by side.</P>
    <P>The experience of local authorities around the country is very uneven in this regard.  Some local authorities have been extremely effective and successful and this is largely the result of the leadership provided by the manager &mdash; I am thinking in particular of County Meath &mdash; supported by the housing officials and crossparty political support in the council chamber.  Some councils have played politics with the question of itinerant settlement halting sites and others have not.  In the Dublin area, in particular, the problem is compounded by the sheer volume of numbers.  The last calculation showed that there were about 30,000 itinerants nationwide, and the impact and the failure to provide a system of halting sites and camping sites in certain Dublin areas has been disastrous.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in the last two years and there has been a degree of resolution and application that tragically was not there in the past, but we need the continued support from the Custom House.  The Minister needs to encourage, cajole and ensure that all local authorities respond, as housing authorities, to this situation.  Otherwise, the problem will continue and worsen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> We have all heard from people in our constituencies who are worried about the impact of an itinerant settlement adjacent to their area.  These fears are very real.  There is an obligation on the people working with itinerants, or travellers, whichever word you prefer to use &mdash; they prefer to be described as &ldquo;travellers&rdquo;&mdash; to help those who want to settle and the majority of them want to settle on halting sites.  They want to settle so that their children will have access to education. But they, too, have an obligation to their neighbours in the settled community.  It is a two-way process.  This type of legislation must be encouraged and worked at.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for a local authority simply to provide a halting site.  The site has to be adequately supplied with water and toilet facilities and there has to be a back-up system of visitation and social support to assist the traveller to settle, because his culture is totally alien in terms of permanent settlement.  The two communities will not learn to live together overnight, and in the process of acquiring this education many problems will arise.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with housing assessment.  This Bill will require local authorities to write into their list of priorities provision for homeless persons and assessments of homeless persons. The local authority must have an assessment of the housing needs in their area and an integrated part of the process of assessment will be carried out by a local authority.  It is only the local authority who can do this, and they can do it very easily within their existing resources from the planning and engineering departments.</P>
    <P>Let us take County Offaly or County Laois as typical local authorities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, would concur that they have the existing resources in staff terms to ensure that the assessment of the housing needs is matched by an assessment of housing supply.  Earlier I mentioned unoccupied houses or houses that are empty for a variety of reasons.  In some cases it might be because the title to a house is unclear, or the people who own it have moved <Col N="1422" /> away and cannot be contacted.  As the Minister is aware, the country is littered with ruins and with empty houses.  Yet we are putting substantial sums of money into building new local authority houses. Over the last 20 years I travelled to and from Cavan and I remember seeing a house slowly but surely disintegrate.  This house could not be bought because the owners were scattered to the four corners of the globe.  The obtaining of consent forms, with the cost involved, from four, five, six or seven brothers and sisters would have been more than the house was worth.  That house should, after a certain period of time, be capable of acquisition by the local authority and given to somebody, or let out, or rented as tourist accommodation if it is in a rural location until such time as the owner might surface and his or her property rights can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment must agree with me, because he travels this country a great deal, that there are numerous empty houses that are disintegrating for a variety of reasons.  It is, and should be, incumbent upon the local authority in the process of their assessment of houses that they would take stock of the actual building infrastructure of residential buildings and that any policy maker, any Minister for the Environment, in terms of allocating resources would be able to look at what he actually had.  He would know what the state of play was in relation to housing conditions and what the possibilities were in terms of dealing with certain housing demands, for example, from single people, or elderly people who can no longer live in isolated accommodation because of health problems, or access problems. There should be that sort of flexibility. Devising any kind of policy is severely inhibited if we do not have an accurate statistical base upon which to rest policy proposals.  Therefore, the requirement of a local authority to make an assessment of housing needs should be extended to include an assessment of the actual stock of dwellings in the functional area of that housing authority.</P>
    <P>I would extend this to categories of <Col N="1423" /> buildings that fall outside the normal classification of a dwelling.  Going back to a point which I made earlier, we have the example of traditional residential accommodation above shops and retail units, which accommodation now is vacant.  It is no longer required because, with improving standards of living and aspirations to higher standards, families who lived in that accommodation probably now want a house on the outskirts of the town, with a garden and garage. That accommodation, while it may no longer be suitable for families, is certainly suitable for childless couples, or single people, or people living together.  It is essential, therefore, that it be measured and assessed by the local authority and that in that process the owner of the property, if it be a shopkeeper or a financial institution like a building society that may have a shop or an office on the ground floor and have left the upstairs accommodation vacant, should be encouraged to rent that accommodation. There is such a case in Sandymount where, I gather for security reasons, the Irish Permanent Building Society have above the office a flat which was a condition of planning permission.  As a policy decision they have kept that vacant because it is less hassle, whether insurance-wise or otherwise, not to have it let out.  The owners of such potential accommodation should be asked why they are not letting it.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about obliging or forcing people to let accommodation.  They may have legitimate reasons for not wanting to do so.  However, as policy makers, the Department of the Environment and this House should be aware of the reasons for accommodation remaining vacant. Upon inquiry, in many cases the property is found not to be on the market.  It is not a question of looking for too high a rent for existing demands.  If there are impediments such as fire requirements or insurance conditions attached to liability, then these should be identified.  The Minister with responsibility for the housing stock should take effective action to ensure that these matters which are <Col N="1424" /> deemed to be impediments are effectively removed.  There are many other points which could be made but they would be more appropriately and properly made on Committee Stage where our debate can be structured.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to return to the central point of this legislation.  In the main, what has attracted the attention, the portion which has provoked correspondence from every religious organisation in the country to all politicians, centres around the right to shelter and the plight of the homeless in our society, a plight that was extremely and eloquently described in November 1983 by Senator Brendan Ryan and that is valid today.  It is a reflection on all of us that five years later we are now only at Second Stage of this debate and have not moved on from it.  This legislation is about writing into the laws of this Republic the basic right to shelter.  At its core is whether this elected Parliament of a free State, the 27th richest country in the world, can aspire to and make a reality out of the right to shelter; that we would guarantee that right in law to every one of our citizens and take upon ourselves as a community the implicit costs and, indeed extra costs if necessary, that such a formulation in legal terms would imply.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to think again in this regard.  I am asking him on the basis that I believe he would want to do this anyway but feels that he is restricted because of uncontrollable cost implications or some damage that this would do to the system of letting priorities to people on the orthodox waiting list.  I do not share that view but I know it is held by many people in his Department and it is a legitimate point of view.  However, it is not of an order or scale sufficient to hold him back from writing in the basic right to shelter so that every citizen in this Republic can, as a last resort, appeal to the courts of this land and invoke the Constitution to ensure that the housing authority provides them with shelter.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about demanding that the local authority provide them with a flat on the fourth balcony in the third block on the riverside of a particular <Col N="1425" /> location so that they can be close to their mother-in-law.  I am talking about the basic right to know that at 9 p.m. this evening they can turn the key in a door and go into a room that will be theirs, or that they can go into a place that will be secure and that they will not face another damp, uncertain evening where the only solace, the only comfort comes out of a bottle which, in turn, creates its own nightmare, not of homelessness but of destitution, despair and degradation. That is the core of what the legislation is about.  The rest of it consists of improvements to the system, the validation of schemes that have now been axed, amendments to previous legislation tidied up here and introducing new things.  The real core of the matter is: Do we have the political will, courage and guts to say to every citizen of this State: &ldquo;You belong to this community, you are a part of it and you have the basic right to shelter&rdquo;?  I believe we should have those guts, that it is time now, as if it never had been time before, for us to make that dream a reality, that aspiration a legal right.</P>
    <P>With the Minister's powers of persuasion, reputedly within the Cabinet and elsewhere, he could change this legislation if he wanted to.  He could recommend to the Cabinet that they accept this change, based on the debate on Second Stage and an analysis on Committee Stage of the fears as to what the exercise of that right might be.  Whatever fears are there, they are not sufficient in scale or quantity to justify standing back and holding back at this stage from writing that legal right into our system.</P>
    <P>The Minister once boasted in this House &mdash; I think that it was a boast; it certainly came across in that manner although a proud assertion perhaps might be a better way of describing it &mdash; that his allocation of £3 million over three years was a gesture of support to the homeless greater than anything ever done by any previous Minister.  The Minister may recall the occasion himself.  If he is <Col N="1426" /> concerned about his place in history and anxious to ensure that he does something effective for the homeless, he now has a unique opportunity.  There is a majority in support in this House if this Government change the law.  He will be doing something that £3 million could never do, or £30 million, or £300 million.  He will be giving people the legal right, as citizens of this Republic, to claim shelter as part of their basic human entitlement.  He can do it at very little real financial cost.  That is a boast that anybody would be proud to make.  He would be entitled to the respect he would earn if he were to introduce that basic right into our laws.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this legislation.  The whole question of the provision of local authority accommodation and its management has undergone major and fundamental changes, particularly over the last ten years.  For that reason, I welcome this very wide-ranging legislation which seeks to deal with the whole issue of the provision of local authority accommodation for those in need of it.  That cuts across the ordinary applicant with whom we might be familiar and goes into the area of settlement of members of the travelling community and other specific categories of housing applicants such as single-parent families and senior citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the management of local authority estates has come in for a fair degree of scrutiny, particularly in recent years, because of the difficulties highlighted in major estates in Dublin city and county council and other areas in regard to the management of housing stock.  This needs to be addressed by the Minister and local authorities in an effort to make the best possible use of the accommodation available to us.  It greatly saddens me when I see the number of houses &mdash; the best of housing stock &mdash; and flats in towns and cities around the country which are empty although there are waiting lists in housing authority areas <Col N="1427" /> and the needs of applicants are not being met.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem which has given rise to the number of empty units of accommodation has been, to some extent, the manner in which local authorities manage housing estates and other units of accommodation, such as flats. The Minister, with local authorities, will have to address this problem more firmly in the future so that there is not this tremendous waste of resources and accommodation when people are looking for houses.  Part of the problem in some of the major areas arises because applicants in need of accommodation are not prepared, in some cases, to be located in areas where the environment is not to their satisfaction because of the way they have been developed and because of dissatisfaction with the management of the housing stock.  If this aspect was improved, it would have a major effect on reducing still further our fairly low waiting lists.  One has only to go into some of our larger housing estates to see that the only thing that has been provided is good quality housing.  Other facilities have not been provided and this requires the support and commitment of other Government agencies, apart from the Department of the Environment support for housing construction.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of major housing estates, we need not only good quality accommodation but the support of the health and social welfare services, National Manpower and so on, as well as the basic needs of the schools and churches.  It is not sufficient to meet housing needs by building houses unless the services to which I have referred are added to the development.  In some of the more widely known cases, particularly on the outskirts of Dublin where there is a considerable number of vacant houses and flats, it is clear that if the services had been provided by the other agencies the problem would not have been as widespread <Col N="1428" /> as it has been in the past few years. People who are genuinely in need of accommodation take into account their family status and the support of other family members in determining whether they will be located in a specific area in terms of the local authorities meeting their housing needs.</P>
    <P>In some older housing estates, there has been a serious decline in the quality of accommodation, and housing provided in the sixties and early seventies no longer meets the standards now set in relation to the provision of local authority accommodation.  The Minister and the Department will have to become increasingly involved in upgrading the accommodation which is older but, nevertheless, still has a very useful life. That is where estate management comes very much into focus.</P>
    <P>As a public representative, I have most experience in the Dublin area, and Dublin Corporation have tried to meet the needs of those on their waiting list in the county area.  They developed some of the largest local authority housing estates in the county council functional area.  The support from Dublin Corporation for these areas has not been what it should have been.  Perhaps it was not their fault, but tenants often feel very remote from the local authority from whom they are renting accommodation. In the Dublin region, the situation could be improved quite dramatically if Dublin Corporation, for example, decentralised some of their services by locating depots which are adequately manned and supported. They could also locate substantial rent offices in the area where tenants who need to do business with the corporation could do so in their own locality without having to travel a considerable distance. I am glad that the corporation, over the last two years, have been trying to redress the balance and the difficulties which have developed in this regard.  Their support in the county council functional area has been increasing recently, which is very <Col N="1429" /> welcome.  This has a direct effect on the environment for people who have been located out of their areas and on the ability of Dublin Corporation to utilise fully to the best of their capabilities the excellent housing stock which was developed and provided over the years.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the management of housing stock and local authority estates is crucial, particularly at a time when it is obvious that it is no longer necessary to build large local authority housing estates to meet the needs of applicants.  The list has been dramatically reduced in recent times.  It gives an opportunity to local authorities to upgrade many of their housing estates and other units of accommodation.  It is very important that they upgrade the flat accommodation which they provide.  If this type of accommodation was upgraded we would find that vast numbers of flats would not remain vacant or subject to vandalism.  It would also be of benefit if Dublin Corporation supported and worked with rather than against the local community organisations in areas such as Ballymun.  This would also apply to areas which I am more familiar with &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is now an increasing demand for senior citizen accommodation, whereas the demand for the standard accommodation, either a three bedroom or four bedroom house, seems to be falling.  The waiting lists for senior citizen accommodation and suitable accommodation for single men who are unable to provide accommodation for themselves are getting longer and will continue to get longer in the years ahead. We are going to have to come to terms with this problem.</P>
      <P>The tenant purchase scheme is going to have a dramatic effect on local authority estates.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing this scheme.  There is a great deal of interest in this scheme and I am convinced that it is going to have a considerable effect on the make-up of local authority estates.  I believe that tenants who decide to purchase the homes in which they are residing will get more involved in the development of their areas.  For that reason this scheme is going to provide a new impetus in these housing estates in contrast to what happened in the past where there was an exodus from certain estates around the country.</P>
      <P>There is much for which to commend the Bill.  It deals with many issues which should have been addressed before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> It also faces up to one of the most serious bones of contention in the greater Dublin area &mdash; the provision of housing for travellers &mdash; and it will put a requirement on the local authorities to carry out regular assessments of the housing needs in their areas.  It is only right and proper that local authorities should have to assess housing needs in their areas.  Therefore, there is much for which to commend the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for bringing it forward.  Many beneficial effects will accrue from its passing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be said that it is disgraceful that it has taken so long to deal with the problem of homelessness, despite the fact that the Minister has brought forward this Bill.  The fault does not lie totally with him but when we consider that this State has been in existence since 1922 and that there is a guarantee in the Constitution that every citizen will be treated equally, it can only be regarded as a disgrace that we are now only attempting in 1988 to deal with the problem of homeless men and women.</P>
      <P>Despite the number of welcome features in the Bill it is a pity that the Minister could not find it in his heart to place an obligation on the local authorities to deal with the problem of homelessness in their areas.  It is only when we place such an obligation on local authorities that all of them will take on board the need to do so.  It is a fact that many local authorities do take their responsibilities seriously but it is also a fact, unfortunately, that many local authorities tend to dodge their responsibilities, particularly if their problem is migrating to the area of a neighbouring local authority who are dealing with a similar problem. This can clearly be seen in the case of travellers where to say the least of it there is tardiness in dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's proposal to allow the manager provide accommodation for travellers in cases where he believes there is a need to do <Col N="1432" /> so and in cases where he is not getting the co-operation he wants from the elected councillors, I have to say that to some extent this is a cop out and enables the local councillors who have been elected to provide services for all of the citizens in their areas to avoid a sensitive issue. Giving the manager the power to intervene without obtaining the sanction of the council is to some extent a cop out and providing an easy answer.  It is unfortunate that some councillors adopt positions which do not serve the best interests of either the community in general or the travelling community.</P>
    <P>We in this country tend to take a timid approach in regard to the rights of the person as distinct from the right to property. We are constantly being told that such and such a move would be deemed to be unconstitutional because in some way it infringes on the right to property. I have rarely heard the argument that such and such a move would be unconstitutional because it infringes upon the rights of the individual.  There is no doubt that homelessness infringes on the constitutional right of the individual.  For that reason I believe the Minister has been too timid in defining homelessness and not placing an obligation on the local authorities to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I put this attitude down to a kind of poor law approach to questions of homelessness, poverty, health care and a whole range of other issues which, up to recently at any rate, the State, representing the people, felt it had an obligation to deal with.  It is an approach which is growing, that we must promote the view of the survival of the fittest, that the only obligation of the State is to pick up the victims; that it is the responsibility of local authorities only to house those who, in their opinion, are homeless, or who cannot provide accommodation for themselves out of their own resources. Implicitly, that indicates that the Government do not regard it the responsibility <Col N="1433" /> of local authorities to provide accommodation and other services over a whole range of areas except to those who, for one reason or another, fall to the bottom of the pile.  I do not accept that interpretation of responsibility of Government, of those democratically elected to run a country.</P>
    <P>I have argued here before that I see no good reason local authorities should not provide housing on a fairly wide basis, regardless of income or of a person's ability to provide for themselves other than that they need housing.  I contend that would not in any way contravene any Government principles.  It would ensure the maintenance of the various local authority personnel, the various excellent expertise and services built up in a variety of areas, including housing construction, provision of amenities and services such as planning, drainage, sewerage and so on.  There is this approach demonstrated clearly in the provisions of this Bill, that the only responsibility of local authorities is to deal with those who cannot, through their own means, provide accommodation for themselves.  It is a poor law approach deriving from a view of society that charity must be available to those who cannot make it on their own, God help them.  That approach tends to shunt people off into a particular category which is not correct.</P>
    <P>While waiting to contribute to this debate I reread my contribution on the last Bill in November 1986 when it struck me that perhaps 90 per cent of what I said then could be repeated on this occasion.  I do not intend to do so but it is extraordinary the degree to which the position, by and large, remains as it was almost 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>One of the more useful exercises in which this Government engaged on assuming office was the abolition of the £5,000 local authority house surrender grant.  I was never happy with the way that grant was administered and applied. There were many Deputies on the Government side who spoke today about <Col N="1434" /> the vast numbers of local authority houses and flats lying either vacant or in a derelict state.  I attribute that fact largely to the provisions of the £5,000 local authority dwelling surrender grant. The application of that grant sucked hundreds of families &mdash; who were working, who could, with some help purchase a house for themselves &mdash; out of local authority areas.  Taking into account the £5,000 surrender grant, the new house grant and the mortgage subsidy, which amounted in total to something like £10,000, this meant a significant number of local authority tenants applied for that scheme.  The net result was that the vacant local authority dwelling, in many cases &mdash; again because of the approach that the obligation of local authorities is to house only those who cannot house themselves out of their own means &mdash; were filled largely by tenants in receipt of social welfare.  Given the nature of the jobs position at present, that meant the vast majority of them were unemployed.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation statistics indicate that 75 per cent of tenants who took up occupation of local authority dwellings as a result of vacancies arising from the application of the £5,000 surrender grant were people on social welfare.  This meant the sucking out of many working families and their replacement by those who were not working leading to an increasing level of unemployment in given areas, a decline in the community because of the loss of people who had been heavily involved in it, in developing a community spirit, particularly in the newer housing areas.  Because of that decline there was an increasing reluctance on the part of people when they had a choice to move to many areas. Indeed, even in cases where they did not have a choice, people were not prepared to move to some areas because of the bad image created &mdash; let it be said, a false one &mdash; by the more blatant media hype headlines without any foundation in many cases.  The result was that when <Col N="1435" /> people had a choice they were unwilling to move.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the view that a person because they cannot provide accommodation for themselves must automatically accept whatever is offered to them, that because a person is not willing to move to, say, Tallaght, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, or any of the other areas generally regarded as being of low demand, in some way they are being ungrateful.  There are many reasons people choose not to move to such areas. There may be family reasons, transport reasons &mdash; travel to and from their place of work &mdash; children's schooling and, not least, fears because of the image created of some of these areas.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is our function to force any housing applicant to move to an area into which they do not want to go.  It is somewhat like saying that the person who can afford to shop only in Dunnes Stores for their clothing must take what they get, must not go through the racks and choose the style and or price that suits them, and may not have the protection of consumer legislation while, on the other hand, the person who can shop in Brown Thomas can choose to their heart's content and is entitled to all of the choices and protection that their purse allows.  I do not accept that definition of the rights of the individual in our society.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also, in relation to the provisions of this Bill, at the continued <i>ad hoc</i> approach to housing policy here. It is something like 30 years since we have had a White Paper outlining Government policy on housing.  Since then we have had the 1966 Housing Act.  Since the implementation of that Act there have been a bewildering number of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions in regard to grants, housing, housing construction, house size and the provision of services.  Indeed, in this Bill the Minister is abolishing a large number of grant schemes, many of which no <Col N="1436" /> longer exist but for which we must retrospectively provide legislative validation. These decisions were made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to suit a particular prod from the construction federation who seem to have the main influence on Government policy with regard to housing construction and the construction industry generally.  I am concerned at the continued <i>ad hoc</i> approach, and I would urge the Government to initiate proposals whereby within a relatively short period we will have a White Paper on future housing policy so that we can have a reasoned and reasonable approach to the development of this whole area.  The proposals in this Bill relate to a number of areas.  They relate to practically abolishing a number of grant schemes some of which never had any legislative base and some of which have been abolished for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis of concern to this House is the provisions with regard to homelessness.  Will the Minister consider another category of person who have a roof over their heads, but the roof in many cases is so full of holes that they may as well not have one?  There must be tens of thousands of houses around the country, many of them occupied by elderly people who cannot afford repairs, rewiring, reroofing etc.  I was surprised at the number of representations I received recently from such people who are literally living in hovels, but who cannot do anything about it out of their own resources.  In many cases they bought houses from the local authority and the local authority are now no longer responsible for repairs.  The Eastern Health Board up to last year had a scheme to assist elderly people in this situation. That assistance is no longer available. What does the Minister propose to do with regard to that form of homelessness? Despite the fact that in theory these people have a home, in reality they have not.  I know of one person who is living in a caravan next to the house, because <Col N="1437" /> of the condition of the house.  That is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in this Bill the Minister is proposing to do away with the obligations on local authorities to carry out a five-yearly assessment of housing conditions.  The Minister proposes that a local authority may carry out a housing conditions survey from time to time.  That seems to be the thin end of the wedge, to hide the reality of the condition of our housing stock.  The theory seems to be that if we do not know about it, we will not be expected to do anything about it. It is essential to retain the obligation on local authorities to carry out a five-yearly survey into the condition of the housing stock.  It is now six years since the last survey was carried out.  If there is to be a serious approach to taking on board my suggestion about a White Paper on housing policy, then a housing conditions survey is essential in terms of planning for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech said that local authorities had provided accommodation for 1,800 homeless persons in the past three years.  I have the gravest suspicion about that assertion. Is the Minister using the definition of homelessness which applies in this Bill or is he simply taking on board the homeless category which local authorities have been using in the past few years because of the availability of accommodation in what has been known as low demand areas?  In the Dublin area the people listed as being homeless and as having been housed by Dublin Corporation, would not be homeless in the terms of the definition which the Minister has applied in this Bill.  The Minister might just have sought statistics from the local authorities who told him that they have housed X number of people as homeless in the past two years and that might be the basis of his figure.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in some debate at Dublin Corporation level over the past couple of years, with regard to homelessness. Because of the change in the <Col N="1438" /> nature of the housing problem, because of the decline in family sizes and the growth of single parent one child families, who in previous years would not even have got on to the housing list, many of these have been taken in under this broad category of homelessness, where the manager has the right as indeed he should have, to provide accommodation for a person whom he considers to be in need. I have my doubts that the 1,800 figure that the Minister has quoted are homeless in the terms we are discussing here today. I do not suggest that any of the people who got accommodation were not entitled to it or in need of it.  I would just like the Minister to clarify if the 1,800 homeless people he talked about in his speech today are encompassed in the definition we have before us in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new housing purchase scheme about which I am concerned.  Quite a lot of people who bought their houses under the 1986 scheme are now looking to have themselves brought in under this current scheme.  Indeed the people who bought houses under the 1982 scheme which was not as generous in terms of discount and so on and in terms of purchase price, as the 1986 scheme and the 1988 scheme are also applying to be included in the current scheme.  They have a valid point.  At the moment we are encouraging people to buy their houses from the corporation and from the local authorities under the 1988 scheme as a once-off measure.  I would make a distinction between local authority tenants and the person who has the money to buy the house of his choice in the area of his choice in the £60,000 to £100,000 bracket.  Clearly such people can adjust their housing needs and their housing acquisition to suit their own pocket.</P>
    <P>If a person bought a house ten years ago at a particular price which was not a suitable price as regards mortgage repayments there is nothing to prevent them selling and moving on to a cheaper house getting a lower mortgage.  They will also <Col N="1439" /> get a tax allowance on their mortgage. The higher one's income, the more tax one is paying and the better return one will get in terms of a mortgage benefit. We are talking here about people who are largely on fixed incomes and who do not have the flexibility of moving from house to house or from area to area as the whim grabs them or, indeed, as the bank manager might advise them.  For example, a man who recently came to me is on £58 a week supplementary welfare allowance.  His repayments on the corporation house which he is buying are just short of £20 per week.  He has £58 for himself and his wife to live on and out of that he has to pay £20 to Dublin Corporation to buy the house in which he is living.  It is not fair to expect that man to survive on that amount.  He is elderly and so is his wife.  He has no possibility of getting a job.  He is not at the age at which he could reasonably hope to get a job and he has not yet reached retirement age.  Nevertheless, he has this weight around his neck and he is not the kind of person who can sell the house and move on in order to improve his position in terms of mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>Many people in my constituency who wrote to the Minister are paying in the region of £30 per week over a 30-year period while their neighbour, who has bought under a different scheme, is paying up to £10 a week less, for a shorter period of 20 to 25 years.  There are anomalies here.  If we accept the Minister's view that local authorities intend to deal with those who cannot, out of their own means, provide for themselves and who will not have high incomes then we should adopt a much more flexible approach to those who are now caught on very high mortgage repayments over very long periods.</P>
    <P>One of the points about which I am concerned is that in the scheme announced by the Minister for 1988 he proposes that tenants, once they sign the <Col N="1440" /> contract for the purchase of the house, will not have the right to have pre-sale repairs carried out.  He argues that that is only fair because the house is being sold at market value.  In this Bill he is proposing to abolish the right of tenants for ever and a day and not just for this scheme.  Under section 23 he is proposing to abolish section 13 of the housing Act, 1979, which will do away with the right of tenants to have repairs carried out to their houses when they have bought them, or just as they are buying them, in order to have them in a habitable condition. He is abolishing that right completely not only for the 1988 scheme but completely.  Does the Minister propose to continue the 1988 scheme for 1989 and thereafter or will he revert to the 1986 scheme?  If he proposes to revert to the 1986 scheme, or the 1982 scheme, then we should retain section 13 of the 1979 Act.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which the Minister dealt with in his speech was remedial schemes and the funding available for local authorities to carry out remedial scheme works on estates.  If my recollection serves me correctly the schemes specifically referred to older houses possibly pre-1940 houses &mdash; I am not sure of the year &mdash; and also what were euphemistically called &ldquo;low cost housing&rdquo; which was built in the seventies.  There are now cost housing estates throughout the country in Finglas South, Bray, Mayfield, Togher, County Cork and in Galway. Virtually every local authority will have one or more housing estates which were built under the low cost housing scheme. They were euphemistically known as &ldquo;low cost housing&rdquo; schemes.</P>
    <P>If an audit was carried out on the maintenance of these houses, on the moneys spent resolving dampness problems, installation of fireplaces, installation of heaters, new drainage, new windows, new doors and new roofs in Finglas South there is no way they could be classified as low cost housing.  Nevertheless, the previous Government introduced this <Col N="1441" /> remedial scheme.  I am not sure to what extent it has been used by other local authorities but I know that in the Dublin area it has not been used extensively.  I have tried on a number of occasions to get Dublin Corporation to make submissions regarding Finglas South without success. There may well be good reasons for that.</P>
    <P>The planning department of Dublin Corporation have now carried out a planning study of two parts of Finglas South. They have suggested a variety of proposals which would upgrade the environment and which would provide for in-fill housing in various open spaces which are of no particular value other than as dumping grounds.  They have not addressed themselves to the condition of the houses.  I wonder whether the remedial works scheme moneys would apply to that type of proposal.  It is an area which needs to be looked at because, as the Minister is aware from discussions he has had with the Ballymun Task Force, there is agreement that there must be a comprehensive approach to the renewal of areas such as Ballymun, Finglas South and Tallaght, which will involve the people who live in the area, the various State agencies, the local authorities, voluntary bodies of one kind or another and the Department of the Environment. There must be a comprehensive approach because the problems are not just physically related to the structure of the accommodation in which people are living, they relate to the environment surrounding the accommodation, the health services which are provided, whether there are jobs, the level of unemployment, schools and the extent to which they have or have not got adequate teaching staff.  The range of needs in these areas is so vast that there must be a comprehensive approach.  Simply providing a remedial works scheme is not sufficient.  It is not good enough to say there is a scheme which a local authority can use to upgrade particular dwellings and to hope that that will lead to a solution of the problems in that area.  There <Col N="1442" /> must be a comprehensive approach encompassing all the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, for his positive response to the proposals from the Ballymun Task Force, and I am sure I echo the views of the other Deputies from that area, Deputy Tunney, Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Michael Barrett.  He has been very supportive and forthcoming in his approach to the report produced by the Ballymun Task Force.  The Ballymun Task Force consist of the local organisations, various agencies like the corporation and the health board and the four Deputies who represent the area. They have all worked very well together and produced a very good proposal, in my view, for the renewal of the Ballymun area.  It is an interim proposal and I take this opportunity, if I may be so bold, on behalf of the other Deputies in the area to urge the Minister to follow through the support he has given by pressing strongly for the funding needed to implement the proposals in the renewal plan which has been presented to him.  I know, as the Minister knows, that it does not depend entirely on the money that is needed to implement it.  It can be successful only if there is local involvement and other involvement from the statutory agencies, but with all the goodwill in the world if the people in the area and the statutory agencies have not the money to carry out the necessary work it cannot go anywhere.  It has to be a comprehensive approach.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point about the private housing sector and here I am thinking specifically about the private rented sector.  When I came into this House in 1982 a Bill was being debated with regard to private rent controlled dwellings and the Minister of the day, Deputy R. Burke, promised he would be introducing legislation which would provide for rent control in the private rented sector, to <Col N="1443" /> provide security of tenure and for arbitration for tenants who were in dispute with the landlords.  Despite that and the fact that the partners in the last Coalition Government had the same objectives, nothing has happened in that area.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the freedom with which private landlords operate has had some effect on homelessness.  Some of the dwellings provided by private landlords, are nothing short of death traps from the point of view of fire regulations and may also be criticised in regard to sanitary provisions and space provided for living in.  I would like to see this Minister making some commitment to deal with that area.  Some of the poorest in our society are living in some of the worst accommodation provided by private landlords and that matter needs to be dealt with quickly and urgently.  The Minister suggested that under section 24 assistance could be provided for organisations promoting the interests of householders and so forth.  I wonder whether he intends that to encompass organisations like the National Association of Tenants' Organisations and the Association of Combined Residents' Associations who represent tenants and residents around the country and provide them with advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of travellers. I want to come to the question of residential qualification.  I dealt with this on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It seems that this area has not received as much attention as it should have.  As I have said, some local authorities tend to dodge their responsibilities with regard to providing accommodation for what they would regard as difficult tenants on the basis that the neighbouring authority may be able to do so.  Unfortunately, in many cases because of the residential qualification which local authorities apply, somebody moving into the Dublin area from another local authority area is precluded from getting accommodation because the person has <Col N="1444" /> not been born in the city or county or has not been resident in it for at least the past six months, if he or she was born in it, or, if not born in it, has not been resident in it for at least two years.  The residential qualification varies from local authority to local authority.  It is necessary to include something in this Bill which would ensure that residential qualification would not apply at least where accommodation is being sought by a person who comes under the term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  In the Dublin area a certain flexibility is adopted but I am not too sure that the same flexibility is adopted in other areas, perhaps because they have not the same stock of housing available to them.  I wonder whether the residential qualification as applied by local authorities is in breach of EC regulations which tend to aim for freedom of movement and particularly mobility of labour. A person who has to move from Cork to Dublin because of job requirements &mdash; or, in the reverse, from Dublin to Cork &mdash; could, under residential qualifications, be precluded from getting accommodation. I think there is a case to be made for abolishing these residential qualifications entirely.</P>
    <P>Another inadequacy in the Bill is that there is no provision in it for people who may be threatened with homelessness.  I am thinking of the category I mentioned here in a previous debate, where there is marital breakdown or a battered wife or battered mother who may not be literally homeless in the sense of being without a roofover her head but may, nevertheless, be homeless in a week or two weeks depending on how long more she can endure the abuse.  I would like to deal with that on Committee Stage and see whether we can ensure that people in that situation are brought in under this Bill.  I have come across situations, as I am sure other Deputies have, of marital breakdown with husband and wife still residing together in one local authority dwelling and the corporation are precluded from including one or other on their housing <Col N="1445" /> list as long as they live together.  They have to physically move to separate accommodation before the corporation can consider them.  Even then the corporation &mdash; or local authority in other areas &mdash; may decide they cannot provide accommodation or two units of accommodation for what they still regard as one family.  Let me say in making these remarks that the corporation have always dealt with these matters very humanely and sensitively and I am not being critical of the way they have done their job in this regard.  However, there is need for more specific legislative back-up for the decisions they have to make increasingly in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister no longer has in this Bill, as was in the previous Bill, a clause which implied that a person could be held to have made himself or herself intentionally homeless. That is an advance which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes in various sections particularly section 10, that the Minister shall have power to make regulations with regard to how local authorities would implement the provision in relation to accommodation for homeless persons.  I should like to ask the Minister to produce a draft of the proposed regulations prior to Committee Stage debate so that we will have some idea of how he sees local authorities operating the provisions in regard to the homeless. Without such draft regulations we will, to some extent, be debating the issue in a vacuum.  It is fine to outline in legislation the theory of how a local authority should operate but the Minister, or his successors, may decide to change the regulations to restrict the power of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy with the following words, used in the section giving power to local authorities to decide whether a person is homeless or not, &ldquo;...where the person is, in the opinion of the local authority...&rdquo; Section 10 refers to a <Col N="1446" /> person who is regarded by a local authority as being homeless, capable of living independently in a dwelling and is, in the opinion of the local authority, unable to provide accommodation from his own resources and so on.  In my opinion the form of words is too weak and I suggest we use a phrase such as, &ldquo;where it has been established beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a decision by a local authority that was based on the opinion of an official.  Evidence was produced to undermine that opinion but the decision of the official stood.  I would prefer a form of words that would accept the evidence of a homeless person, a social worker or the person assisting the homeless person, as establishing beyond reasonable doubt that there is homelessness.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Flood mentioned housing management I got the impression that he was of the opinion that most of the problems in Tallaght arose from housing management.  Some of them arose from housing management but most of them arose because of policy-making, or the absence of it, and the lack of infrastructural plans, particularly in relation to job creation in the so-called satellite towns created in the past 15 years.  I am interested in corporation houses erected in county council areas.  Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown were planned as new towns and 90 per cent of the houses there were built by Dublin Corporation but on county council land.  The houses are managed by the corporation and I have suggested at corporation meetings that it does not make sense to have the corporation managing accommodation in a county council area.</P>
    <P>The corporation are responsible for the maintenance of the houses and the services to them while the county council are responsible for the services outside such as road sweeping, maintenance of drains, sewers and so on.  For example, a burst pipe in a house or in the pipe leading to a house could result in a corporation <Col N="1447" /> crew dealing with the fault in the house and a county council crew being called to deal with the fault outside.  Such a system leads to frustration all round, among council and corporation officials, local authority workers and householders.</P>
    <P>I do not know the solution to this problem or if the corporation would be prepared to hand over the management, ownership and headaches associated with those houses to the county council.  I am sure such a move would have implications for staff.  I wonder if the proposal introduced in the House three or four years ago to establish a greater Dublin council would be a solution to the problem? However, there is a need to tackle this problem of two local authorities dealing with one house.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies for listening with patience to the points I made.  I hope we will have sufficient time to debate the Committee Stage of this important Bill and that we will be given an opportunity to complete deliberations on it before the summer recess, whenever that will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pick up on a topic raised by Deputy De Rossa, namely housing.  That topic is near and dear to the hearts of all Dublin representatives because we have seen such dramatic growth in that sector in recent years.  A lot of old housing stock has been renewed and many new housing estates developed.  The Minister now has an opportunity to assess the achievements of the seventies and early eighties.  It is to the credit of successive Governments that they have made good use of taxpayers' money by improving the housing stock.  The houses in Dublin city and county are of good quality and many of the schemes in the pipeline will give effect to the plans adopted in the early seventies. I have no doubt that jobs will be created in the service-related industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to address at administrative level the question of local <Col N="1448" /> government reform.  I accept the good intentions of the previous Government and the present Administration to restructure local government in Dublin city and county.  It is expected that we will have three county councils and one umbrella authority in Dublin but City Hall will continue to call the shots in many areas.  There is a need at administrative level to cut through a lot of the red tape and the duplication.  The city and county manager has responsibility for running the affairs of Dublin and he has delegated responsibility to five assistant city and county managers.  I do not think there is any justification for such a system.  Dublin County Council are responsible for the most heavily populated area in the country and the recent census highlights that fact.  I hope we will achieve all-party agreement in Dublin County Council on putting a proposal to the Minister about transferring responsibility to the county council for housing in the county owned by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Another major problem in these new growth areas is that Dublin Corporation have a housing land bank overhang.  They prudently bought substantial numbers of housing sites in the county area at a time when the projections for population growth were high.  Those projections have now come down due to various factors such as emigration and smaller family units.  This land owned by the corporation had been earmarked for housing but does not seem to be needed for that purpose.  The first priority is to transfer to the county council responsibility for rented accommodation in the county in the ownership of the corporation.  This will bring a revenue flow for the county and rationalise housing maintenance operations.  It also means that people living in the area will be able to bring housing problems to local politicians and public representatives.</P>
    <P>At present people living on one side of a street may be paying rent to Dublin Corporation while those on the other side <Col N="1449" /> of the street pay their rent to Dublin County Council.  This means there are dual systems of rent collection, housing maintenance and so on.  A whole range of overhead costs has built up which we cannot afford to carry any longer.  Possibly I am going outside the core of this debate but this is a crucial issue affecting County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on bringing forward this complex Bill.  It is difficult to strike the right balance in assisting those who need help without creating so many complexities that the intent of the Bill will be frustrated.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the qualification system, which certainly needs rationalisation.  The Minister might consider setting down guidelines so as to avoid different methods of housing allocation in neighbouring local authority areas.  It is unfair that people from a rural background who come to Dublin for a variety of reasons may have to wait four years before they qualify for accommodation. I hope the Bill will address that aspect of housing policy and that the Minister will ensure that local authorities give full effect to the legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to cater for those who need local authority housing.  A rapidly changing set of circumstances in Dublin requires new directions in policy. Unfortunately there is far too much negative comment and not enough recognition of the progress which has been achieved by successive Governments in the past ten or 15 years.  Large local authority investments have been made in parts of the city which Deputy Gregory represents and although much has still to be done major improvements have been made.  The so-called better informed academics and journalistic experts often give the impression that nothing has been achieved in Dublin.  As one approaches the city centre from the airport one passes a very fine frontage of local authority dwellings in Dorset Street.  There have also been impressive developments in Clanbrassil Street, parts of the north <Col N="1450" /> inner city, the Coombe and along the South Quay.  Excellent high-quality local authority housing has been built at a cost which is justifiable because of the once-off rebuilding of the core of the capital city.</P>
    <P>In the county area vast sums of taxpayers' money have been invested in local authority housing.  The quality of that housing during the past five or ten years has been excellent.  Prior to that, attempts to solve problems quickly led to some defective housing being built, but the Minister is endeavouring to rectify the problem by the provision of funds.</P>
    <P>There are two satellite towns in my constituency in which there is an overhang of corporation local authority housing.  Because of the excellent developments in the city many people who were rehoused in the county have decided to return to their old neighbourhoods and, as a result, there are vacant local authority houses in certain parts of the county. This creates certain problems for the public representatives and the council.  I ask the Minister to look in some detail at this problem.  The responsibility rests with the local authority of which Deputy Gregory is a member, namely, Dublin Corporation.  Possibly they are unfairly criticised in County Dublin.  We believe they are responsible but not concerned about some of the problems with which we are grappling.  No doubt they would say they have enough problems of their own in the city.  Nevertheless they have the legal responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is considering the reform of local government as it relates to housing, he should bear in mind particularly the problems in Dublin.  These may not be as acute in Cork, Limerick and Waterford, although there too housing has developed beyond the traditional city boundaries.</P>
    <P>I hope that the fairness which characterises the present system of housing allocation will be retained.  People who may not be good at filling in forms may not <Col N="1451" /> be able to comply with the bureaucratic demands of the system.  These are the people that we are endeavouring to assist. There is a great need for a coming together of the various social partners operating particularly in the city of Dublin so that they will have some input at official or local authority level in regard to housing.  We should endeavour to establish the total number of people affected by the problem of homelessness. Various figures are mentioned on television programmes and in reports but it appears to be very difficult to get an accurate figure.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Kelly gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of a planning application relating to an ESB station in County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. In order to avoid all possibility of misunderstanding I want to make it clear from the outset that I have no knowledge of the concrete facts of the case involving the ESB's planning application in County Kerry and no opinion about it.  I must not be taken as expressing a view as to whether or not the application made by the ESB is justified or whether or not it should be acceded to by the planning authority.  I am concerned here only with the dimension of Government which this episode appears to reveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must admit that all I know about it is what I read in this morning's paper, plus what I have been able to gather from a couple of very informal last minute inquiries made today.  These inquiries did not involve any member of the public service, Bord Fáilte or the ESB.  I would <Col N="1452" /> not wish the Minister to imagine that I am using anything which anybody told me in breach of duty.  Anything which I have is secondhand and hearsay.  I know it will suffer from that weakness in the Minister's eyes but he is too fair-minded a man to use that as a way of insinuating that what I am saying is not true.  I believe that the people I have spoken to are telling me what they believe to be the truth.  Very often the only information which a Member of this House has is what he sees in the paper.  He feels he owes it to the public to raise what seems to him to be interesting from the public point of view, even if it is in a format which does not amount to firm evidence of a kind that would be received in court.</P>
    <P>The ESB have apparently got plans to build a certain number of small hydroelectric schemes.  This is something which, in the days of the oil crisis, I was strongly in favour of, and I still am in favour of it as long as it can be done without impairing larger national interests.  One of the schemes is for a site in County Kerry which, I must admit, I do not know.  I can imagine that opinions in the county are divided as to the desirability of this scheme and I wish to take no sides in the matter.</P>
    <P>What interests me is a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte dramatically withdrew its objection yesterday to a proposed ESB hydroelectric scheme in Kerry at a planning appeals hearing in Tralee.</P>
    <P>A Bord Fáilte spokesman told the hearing that the withdrawal followed instruction from the Department of Tourism after consultation with the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>I understand, having spoken to a person who was present on this occasion, not a member of the public service, that the member of the Bord Fáilte staff involved had travelled down to Kerry the previous evening for the purpose of this hearing. As my informant put it, &ldquo;word followed <Col N="1453" /> him&rdquo;&mdash; in other words he was ignorant, on leaving Dublin, of the intention of the board to withdraw their objection to this plan &mdash; that his brief, so to speak, was being withdrawn from him.  He very frankly told the hearing that these were now his instructions, and that he could no longer pursue the objection which the board had originally entered.  I am very interested in the word &ldquo;instruction&rdquo;.  The person I spoke to very fairly and honestly said that he could not swear that the word &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; was used, but that it was not a misrepresentation of what this gentleman had said.  He told me that he had certainly said that the reason for the withdrawal of the appeal was that the Department of Energy had been in contact with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I also understand &mdash; again I make the Minister aware that this is hearsay evidence and I do not know how good it is &mdash; that the ESB officials present in Tralee on the previous evening knew at that time, while the Bord Fáilte official was going, as fast as a 1955 CIE turbo-electric diesel could bring him, to Tralee, that the appeal was being withdrawn.  The ESB people there knew that it was a dead duck as far as Bord Fáilte were concerned and they knew in advance of the Bord Fáilte official.</P>
    <P>I consider that that is a history which would require explanation in view of a couple of matters of law.  When I say &ldquo;of law&rdquo; I hope that the Members in the House will not think I am lecturing the House as a lawyer.  I am lecturing the House, or anyone who wants to take an interest in such matters, not as a lawyer but as a citizen, and as somebody interested in the structures of Government and in making sure that these are not circumvented and that we do not have anyone cutting Gordian knots through them.  There are legal and proper ways of doing things and there are illegal and improper ways.  If there is any substance in the idea that any Government Department could lean on Bord Fáilte in such a way as to make them desist from the <Col N="1454" /> exercise of a function which not one but two statutes confer on them, we are witnessing an instance of misgovernment, an instance of a Gordian knot being cut through, an instance of a short cut being taken with procedures which we are entitled to expect will be respected.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have been operating since 1952 and have earned a great deal of credit from everybody interested in tourist development, including the Minister opposite.  Even then they inherited a certain structure in as much as they replaced an earlier organisation.  One of the functions of Bord Fáilte under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, section 5(2) is to &ldquo;protect and maintain and to aid in protecting and maintaining historic buildings, sites and shrines and places of scenic, historic, scientific or other interest to the public,&rdquo; and to facilitate that by providing information. The Dáil, as long ago as 1952, 36 years ago, conferred on this infant board the function of protecting and helping to protect scenic values in the State.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not know this area and I am not in any way taking sides about whether the objection entered by Bord Fáilte is objectively justified or whether I would agree with them about it.  I hope I do not need to stress that again.  That is one of the board's functions and if they did not take an interest in large-scale engineering operations, which naturally hydroelectric work would involve in a mountainous area of scenic value, they would be neglecting their statutory duty.  Presumably, therefore, it was in the discharge of their statutory duty that they entered this objection. Whether they were objectively justified in doing so or whether they were being needlessly pernickety I do not know and I have no view about it.  They purported to be discharging their statutory function in taking an interest in the scenic development of the country and in trying to protect it, as far as they could, by objecting to a development which they thought would impair it.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the planning law, <Col N="1455" /> Bord Fáilte are a member of a very select little club.  Not everybody has a status in the planning law to object and to pursue objections up to appeals level to proposed developments.  It is not just anybody who may do that.  It is not, for example, the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Royal Dublin Society or anybody of that sort alone who is entitled to pursue objections to what they think are undesirable developments.  There are only four such authorised bodies: the National Monuments Advisory Council, An Taisce, the Arts Council and Bord Fáilte.  In other words, their relevance, their standing in regard to the planning process is specifically recognised by the legislation and by regulations enacted under legislation.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte under two heads &mdash; in regard to the parent statute and the principal statute of the planning law &mdash; were thus exercising bona fide and conscientiously their statutory function in lodging this objection.  I consider that for that board to withdraw an objection in consequence of Ministerial representations made to them at the last moment, as appears from what I have said about the official who travelled to Tralee in ignorance of what the ESB officials on the spot knew, is quite wrong. I consider a board which is treated like that is at the receiving end of a Gordian cut.  I do not like that kind of Government, and I know the Minister opposite well enough to say with confidence that he dislikes it too.  He is not the kind of man who would instinctively reach for that kind of Government if there was a better way of doing things.  I do not like that kind of element which is beginning to surface in the Government opposite, not that it was ever truly absent &mdash; it ran underground like the Poddle for a few miles &mdash; the presidential touch, I might call it, where what the conventions which surround the Constitution require are relatively unimportant, whereby some larger, bulkier objective which has not <Col N="1456" /> yet been clothed in legal form, is the one to pursue, and must be pursued no matter what stands in the way, or whose legal rights or legal duties stand in the way.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are not just messing when it comes to intervention in the planning process.  They are not just an élitist middle-class Dublin 4-organisation who decide over needle-sharp glasses of dry sherry that they are going to object to this or that trifling development in an area which is of an immediate amenity interest to the local branch members.  It is not that.  They have intervened since March 1986 on 27 occasions by way of objecting to proposed developments and on 17 of those occasions they have intervened successfully.  In other words, anyone who takes the line &mdash; and I do not believe the Minister would do so &mdash; that Bord Fáilte are a crowd of élitist, finicky, pernickety hair-splitters who want to hold up a justifiable and reasonable development because of their commitment to unreal standards of amenity, has a very heavy onus of proof to discharge. He will have to explain how in 17 out of 27 appeals they have been successful, have lost only five appeals, the remaining five being still pending.</P>
    <P>I understand and this necessarily has to be hearsay at several removes, that the matter was before the Government last Tuesday; if that is so, it raises this matter to a far more serious plane and I intend to pursue it at that level.  The Dáil will expect, and the public ought to expect from the Minister an explanation of how it was thought proper to interfere with a statutory board in the pursuance not just of their rights but of their duties in regard to the functions for which they were created.</P>
    <P>I would like to know in a nutshell, not to hold the House up by redundant rhetoric, whether we may take it, and I would be very surprised if anybody were to say so, that Bord Fáilte withdrew their objections to this planning application because they had changed their mind on its merits.  If they had changed their mind, <Col N="1457" /> they did not find time to tell the official who travelled to Tralee at 6 p.m. the previous evening.  I would like to know that, and naturally I will accept the Minister's word, because no other explanation will justify the performance reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  If they changed their minds without any pressure being brought to bear on them, without any new information being given of a kind which might justify a second view being taken, that would lead me to regret having held the House up over this matter.  But that is the only reason which could justify them doing what they did. If there is any question of their having been leaned on, or having their arms twisted, a nudge, a wink, a nod or a sign exchanged between a Government Department and the Minister in charge of that Department, or the Taoiseach at the top of that apex, then we are seeing another exercise of bad Government.  I would be sorry to think the Minister opposite would be willing to associate himself with that, and I will listen with great interest to his comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the approach of Deputy Kelly in this matter and I can assure him that he will find no resistance from me to raising what he regards as something important and in the public interest.  When he hears the facts he may modify his views or suspicions about the procedure.</P>
      <P>This matter was not considered at Government, and it is important to make that point.  I would like to give the House a resume of the pertinent facts.  These facts were brought to my attention for the first time by my colleague, the Minister for Energy, on Tuesday last, not in Government.  He immediately contacted me and asked me to review this as a matter of urgency.  It is relevant to note when this first came to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background is that in October 1987 the Minister for Energy announced that Ireland was to receive almost £20 million <Col N="1458" /> from the EC under its Valoren programme over the next five years to finance developmental work in the areas of indigenous energy.  One of the measures included in the package was the development by the ESB of ten small-scale hydro-electric facilities in Counties Cork, Kerry, Leitrim and Donegal.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte were first informed of the ESB proposals in July 1987.  In September 1987, during discussions and correspondence on the environmental impact of the hydro programme, Bord Fáilte listed eight sites which they immediately envisaged could cause some problems.  The Glenbeigh site was not on the list.  As far as I was concerned that was the most important fact I got out of the statement from the Minister.  The ESB commissioned An Foras Forbartha &mdash; nobody could say they were not concerned &mdash; to carry out environmental impact studies on the Glenbeigh site. Their recommendations largely were subsequently made conditions of the planning permission granted by Kerry County Council.</P>
    <P>I think about 22 conditions were put in by Kerry County Council.  The ESB state that they kept Bord Fáilte informed of the proposals and that at no time did Bord Fáilte formally indicate that these were unacceptable to them, until the appeal was lodged.  The total capital cost of developing the ten sites is £6.891 million, of which £3.81 million will be received from the EC Regional Development Fund.  It is estimated that, in all, 200 people will be employed during the construction stage, very valuable jobs for areas which are already suffering high unemployment.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Kelly, in fairness to him, stated that he was not making any value judgment, or any judgment about the matter one way or the other, that he was concerned more about the procedures.  Having assessed the facts as outlined, I decided that Bord Fáilte should be requested to withdraw their appeal and instructed a senior official of <Col N="1459" /> my Department to contact that board and advise them accordingly.  I think that the Bord Fáilte official had already left Dublin some time before I was even informed about this matter at all.</P>
    <P>I must put on the record that I am more concerned than most to protect the integrity of our physical environment, which I regard as one of the cornerstones of our tourism product.  Apart altogether from the tourism product, it is a cornerstone of the enjoyment of many of our citizens who have the privilege of seeing places like Glenbeigh, which I know myself.</P>
    <P>It is surely not beyond the collective brains of three State bodies to devise a scheme which would not damage visual amenities, or the ecological balance of the area which, as I have already said, I know and which we all acknowledge is among the most beautiful in Ireland.  We can do this and at the same time reap the employment and other benefits for the areas covered by the proposed programme.</P>
    <P>I also want to emphasise again, in the context of Deputy Kelly's case, although this is hardly relevant, that if the package does not go ahead we could lose the EC funding which we negotiated for that project. There is something that puzzles me. We invest very heavily in engineering and architectural education; the taxpayers invest very heavily in those two areas. Have we not got people with the expertise to plan and execute, in particular areas, works that will not damage but could, indeed, enhance the scenic beauty of the area?  I think of what McCormack <Col N="1460" /> did in Creeslough, with Muckish in the background, or what he did at the Grianan of Aileach, where he enhanced the natural beauty of two lovely areas of Donegal.  Why this cannot be done by the experts we have in the engineering and architectural fields I do not know.  I believe it can be done.  I know that Professor Frank Mitchell is involved in this and he is a man for whom I have a great respect and with whom I have some acquaintance from some years ago.</P>
    <P>I know that the 1952 Act, that is the parent Act, indicates that Bord Fáilte can act for the preservation of scenic beauty. I am so conscious of it that on a couple of occasions since becoming Minister I have known that they made interventions and I supported and sustained them.  I know also that they have a role to play under the Planning Act.  However, I am asking the House to assess what I have said about this situation and, in particular, to assess what a normal reaction would be to the fact that initially, when Glenbeigh was mentioned, Bord Fáilte had no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me make it clear that there are no bailiffs employed by fisheries boards and that I take exception to the use of this term to describe public servants who have been engaged by boards to carry out the duties given to boards under laws enacted by the Oireachtas.  The staff of fisheries boards undertake extremely valuable work in relation to the conservation, protection and development of fisheries and they must be supported by all in this work.</P>
      <P>In this question I am asked to provide specific information for a specific period for aspects of operations which are carried out as an integral part of the main ongoing services provided by boards and the costs of which are not easily identified without diverting the boards' staff from carrying out their priority tasks.  In these circumstances I do not think that it would be reasonable for me to ask boards for operational details of the type sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that fisheries boards are funded by means of a block Exchequer allocation which is supplemented by revenue obtained by the boards from their own sources.  It is estimated that the Exchequer grant will amount to about 75 per cent of the boards' total income.  It is a matter for each board to determine how available resources are used in attending to their statutory functions.  No additional cost will directly arise for the Exchequer from the activities referred to by the Deputy as these will be met from within existing allocations.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered, of course, that the total Community catch relates also to catches in third country waters and also in waters such as the North Sea and the Mediterranean where Irish fishermen have not traditionally fished and where they do not enjoy fishing rights.

      <P>The Department of the Marine now are responsible for matters beyond fisheries such as for example commercial harbours, shipping safety, shipping policy, marine related leisure pursuits and marine related environmental aspects. The major beneficial effect of this drawing together of the various strands of marine related activities into one Department has been the adoption of a cohesive approach to marine matters.  It has also resulted in greater administrative costefficiency whereby a significant reduction in the workforce has been achieved despite additional functions being taken on.  The new arrangements now provide for a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for foreshore and aquaculture licences, the amalgamation of the commercial harbours and fishery harbours areas and the consolidation in one Department of the various disparate anti-pollution functions formerly spread over a number of Departments.  None of this could have been achieved in a Department which held a purely fisheries <Col N="1377" /> brief.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take oral Question No. 32 and written Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Based on the most recent information received from the regional fisheries boards, the total number of incidents of pollution of rivers and lakes resulting in fish kills notified to my Department during 1987 were 114 and five have been notified to date in 1988.  The vast bulk of fish kills occur during summer months. The number of fish killed is not available. The cost of restocking as a result of these incidents is therefore not available.  The regional fisheries boards carry out restocking as part of their general restocking programmes and restocking is also carried out by private groups.  It is difficult to accurately assess the costs incurred arising specifically from fish kills.  It is estimated, however, that about £11,000 was incurred in 1987 and £40,000 to date in 1988.</P>
      <P>Following the spate of fish kills last summer, I decided that legislation should be introduced to substantially increase the penalties for pollution offences under the Fisheries Acts and to provide that the polluter pays.  My Colleague, the Minister for the Environment, decided that similar changes should be made in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and he is now introducing legislation to amend both the Fisheries Acts and the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  The primary responsibility for water pollution control rests with the Minister for the Environment under the latter Act.  The fisheries boards have an independent role and function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last summer the Government set up a <Col N="1381" /> Cabinet committee under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Environment to undertake a review of water pollution control.  The committee's recommendations which involve a comprehensive and integrated programme to combat water pollution control have been adopted by the Government.  I am making copies of the press release setting out full details of these measures including the role of the task forces available to the Deputies concerned.  The regional fisheries boards are playing an active role in these task forces.  While I cannot say what anglers or others may be anticipating this summer, the position in relation to pollution of our inland waterways was let deteriorate over the period 1983-87.  It is a difficult task to rectify the situation but the measures being taken by this Government should help to reverse the decline and improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I can say that the measures taken by the Government to deal with this problem have ensured that we are in a better position to combat pollution this summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I announced last week, I have decided to accept the recommendation of the Quota Review Group to introduce a scheme for the temporary leasing of quotas for 1988-89.  Under the terms of the scheme, leases must be drawn up and completed by 31 July 1988 <Col N="1384" /> and the period of the lease will expire on 31 March 1989.  The portion of a producer's quota to be leased cannot exceed a limit of 70 per cent of his quota, except in the case of a producer whose herd was depopulated under the disease (TB and brucellosis) eradication schemes in either 1987 or in 1988 (prior to 31 July), where the portion permitted to be leased will be increased to 99 per cent.  Payments made for the leased quota shall not be more than 15 pence for each gallon leased.  The quotas offered for leasing will form a pool in each co-operative or dairy area and at least 60 per cent of this pool will be allocated to suppliers whose quotas do not exceed 25,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to anticipate the take-up of the scheme at this stage, but there should be a good response from producers, particularly from small and medium sized quota holders as the scheme offers them the prospect of acquiring additional quotas at a reasonable cost to cover themselves against possible super-levy liabilities in 1988-89.</P>

      <P>I can support the aim of a single market and, in particular, the proposal to move to one system of support throughout the Community. However, I cannot support any proposal to base the ewe premium on a single income loss since this ignores the wide divergence in Community market prices. The existing sheepmeat regime recognises Ireland's particular difficulty by virtue of its distance from and dependence on continental markets.  It is important that any new arrangements take due account of this fact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Various reports on import substitution in the food sector concluded that much of the food imported cannot be produced here for climatic and other reasons. Approximately 20 per cent of food imports could be replaced by home-produced food and the Government's strategy for the development of the food industry places special emphasis on achieving this target.  In the horticultural sector for example, measures have been taken to improve the structure of the industry to enable Irish vegetables to compete more effectively with imported produce.  This has already resulted in a decline in imports of fresh vegetables of the type grown here.  In particular, potato imports dropped by nearly 40 per cent <Col N="1387" /> last year and while there has been some increase in imports of fruit, the bulk of these were of non-competing tropical and mediterranean produce.</P>

      <P>St. Clare's Pre-school, Wexford is funded by the South Eastern Health Board and therefore the question of increasing their funding is essentially a matter for them in the first instance.  I understand that officials of the South Eastern Health Board recently met with representatives of St. Clare's and requested that they <Col N="1392" /> provide the health board with a detailed submission on their proposals.</P>

      <P>In primary schools, the role of the farmer, the patterns of the seasons, farm animals, crops and products are dealt with, <i>inter alia,</i> in the social and environmental studies programmes of the curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to take pupils out of doors to observe plants and animals.  The use of filmstrips and slides helps to create an awareness of farm life.  A nature table is a normal feature in most classrooms and practical indoor gardening is encouraged, with pupils taking an active part in the development of an outdoor school garden where this is feasible.</P>
      <P>At the post-primary level, the junior cycle syllabuses in Science A (general) and Science E (environmental) are such as to allow pupils from a non-farming background to learn the elements of agriculture. The extent to which provision is made for these subjects in the timetable of individual schools is a matter for the management authorities of the schools, who must of course have regard to local circumstances.  I do not have a proposal to introduce any additional programmes on the topic at this time.</P>
