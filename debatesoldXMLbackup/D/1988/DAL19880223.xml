      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General maintains regular contact with the Law Reform Commission regarding the areas of the law which are under examination by the commission and the relative priority which is being given to those topics.</P>

    <P>(a)  <i>First Report on Family Law:</i></P>
    <P>The Family Law Act, 1981 abolished the actions for criminal conversation, the enticement and harbouring of a spouse and breach of promise of marriage. It also provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the regulation of various questions in relation to the property of engaged and formerly engaged persons.</P>
    <P>Legislation to give spouses equal rights of ownership in the family home and contents is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Report on Civil Liability for Animals</i></P>
    <P>The Animals Act, 1985, which took account of the recommendations in the Commission's Report, was enacted on 12 June 1985 and was brought into operation by Ministerial Order on 20 September 1985.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Report on Defective Premises</i></P>
    <P>The Building Control Bill, 1984, which lapsed at the dissolution of the 24th Dáil, has been restored to the Dáil Order Paper at Committee Stage.  When the Bill is enacted and the Building Regulations and the Building Control system provided for in the Bill are in operation further consideration can be given to the proposals contained in the report.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Report on Illegitimacy</i></P>
    <P>The Status of Children Act, 1987 was enacted in December 1987 and provides comprehensively for the matters dealt with in this report.  Some provisions of the Act are already in force and the remaining ones will come into effect six months after the date of enactment, or earlier if the Minister for Justice so orders.</P>
    <P>(e)  <i>Report on Age of Majority</i></P>
    <P>The Age of Majority Act, 1985, which lowered the age of majority from 21 to 18 years (or earlier in marriage) came into effect on 1 March 1985.</P>
    <P>(f)  <i>Report on Restitution of Conjugal Rights, Jactitation of Marriage and Related Matters</i></P>
    <P>The Family Law Bill, 1987, which will abolish the action for restitution of conjugal rights, has been passed by the <Col N="486" /> Seanad and awaits Second Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(g)  <i>Report on Domicile and Habitual Residence as Connecting Factors in the Conflict of Laws</i></P>
    <P>(h)  <i>Report on Divorce a Mensa et Thoro and Related Matters</i></P>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987, which deals with matters contained in the report, was introduced as a Private Member's Bill in December 1987 and passed Second Stage on 10 February 1988.  The Government have welcomed the Bill in principle.</P>
    <P>(j)  <i>Report on Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations</i></P>
    <P>The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, which came into effect on 2 October 1986, abolished the domicile of dependency of married women and provided that a foreign divorce would be recognised if it was granted in a country where either spouse was domiciled or if it was recognised in the country or countries where the spouses are domiciled.  It also included some consequential provisions related to these changes.</P>
    <P>(k)  <i>Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences</i></P>
    <P>The Housing Bill, 1988, which is at Second Stage in the Dáil, will repeal without replacement the offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; contained in the Vagrancy Act, 1924.  Some preliminary examination of the other recommendations in the report has been carried out.</P>
    <P>(l)  <i>Report on the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and some Related Matters</i></P>
    <P>Proposals for legislation to give effect to this Convention are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>(n)  <i>Report on Offences under the Dublin Police Acts</i></P>
    <P>The Commission's recommendations in relation to the repeal of a number of obsolete provisions governing offences of a road traffic nature and their replacement where necessary by more modern provisions under the Road Traffic Code are being considered for inclusion in the next Road Traffic Bill.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>Report on the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters</i></P>
    <P>Some preliminary consideration of this report has been carried out.</P>
    <P>(w)  <i>Report on Receiving Stolen Property</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> This report, which has just been published, is being examined in the Department of Justice.  Arising from that examination, the Minister for Justice proposes to bring forward a proposal for amending legislation for the approval of the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>(3)  (i), (m), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s), (t) and (u)</P>
    <P>The recommendations in these reports will be considered as soon as practicable by the appropriate Minister as a preliminary to consideration by the Government of the recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this House is not adequately responding to the reports of the Law Reform Commission, and would he consider the establishment of an all-party committee of this House to work in conjunction with the Law Reform Commission with a view to updating in particular the criminal law?  Do the Government give the Law Reform Commission a set of priorities to work under or is it the intention that the Law Reform Commission should simply decide for themselves what is and what is not important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a combination of both.  It is really a matter for the Law Reform Commission but from time to time Governments ask the commission to consider matters on a priority basis. Perhaps the Deputy would take an opportunity to examine the statement which I am issuing and then perhaps we can discuss the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider a committee of this House to work with the commission?  A lot of Deputies agree that the commission are doing excellent work but it is outside the House and to some extent there is no role for the legislators in what they are doing. We would make better use of available resources if the commission worked as a consultative body to an all-party committee.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look into <Col N="488" /> something along those lines.  A great deal of this law is not party political, on which we would agree on a non-party basis.  I will consider whether any more can be done to expedite matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the members of the tourism task force; their function; and the terms of reference he has given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="490" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6, 12, 13, 18 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The composition of the special advisory group on tourism is as follows: Ms. Gillian Bowler, Budget Travel; Mr. Martin Dully, Aer Rianta; Mr. Conor McCarthy, Ryan Hotels plc; Mr. Michael McDonnell, Department of Tourism and Transport; Mr. Matt McNulty, Dublin Millennium; Mr. Mike Murphy, RTE; Ms. Eileen O'Mara Walsh, Irish Tourist Industry Confederation; and Mr. Patrick Teahon, Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The group which is representative of a wide cross-section of the tourism industry was asked to advise on how the £4 million provided in the 1988 budget should be allocated so as to obtain an increase in tourism numbers and revenue in 1988 in line with the targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It is expected to report by the end of February.  The establishment of the group is not a vote of no confidence in Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Apart from the £300,000 which is being provided in respect of the Swansea Cork ferry service, the increased allocation will be channelled through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that, with the removal of £4 million from the budget of Bord Fáilte and the provision of £4 million to the task force, the Minister has lost confidence in the ability of Bord Fáilte to do the job for which they were set up.  This task force obviously are engaged in the promotion of tourism which is the preserve of Bord Fáilte. Surely the Minister must indicate to the House why he has not enough confidence in Bord Fáilte not only to maintain their budget but to increase it so they can do more effectively the job they have been doing.  Instead, he has cut back their budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a misconception on the part of the Deputy.  The special advisory group were established after a very important tourism forum which was held in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. The idea was that the people involved in the tourism industry should give advice <Col N="491" /> on how the £4 million should be spent. As I indicated in my answer, with the exception of the £300,000 for the Swansea-Cork Ferries the moneys will be spent through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On whose initiative were the task force set up and who will implement their recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force, or advisory group, were set up by the Government arising out of the forum in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  As I said in my original reply, the moneys, with the exception of £300,000 for the Swansea-Cork Ferries will be spent through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the task force were set up on the initiative of the Taoiseach and the Minister and that Bord Fáilte were excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In no way.  I am a member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>But Bord Fáilte were not involved in the organisation of the forum on tourism at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  They did not organise it.  We organised it, inviting people from, so to speak, the coalface, people who are involved, such as hoteliers, travel agents, tour operators etc. and the various sectors involved in accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is general knowledge that they were set up on the initiative of the Taoiseach.  May I have an answer to the second part of my question? Who will implement the recommendations of the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Tourism, through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his reply that the task force were to be in operation only for 1988.  On that basis when does he expect that the suggestions <Col N="492" /> or recommendations will come forward from them?  Time is limited so obviously those recommendations are imminent.  Is he saying in reply to Deputy Deasy that the task force are subservient to Bord Fáilte or to the Department of Tourism and Transport?  Who will make the decisions on the recommendations of the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to one part of the Deputy's supplementary.  They are expected to report by the end of February, this month.  My Department will have a look at the recommendations and, as I have said, the expenditure will be through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister directed the task force as to any market this £4 million is aimed at?  Has a direction been given in regard to Great Britain, Germany, France or wherever?  Is there a specific recommendation of where they are to look?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in general and as of now the context of consideration will be in the light of the Price Waterhouse report and of the known policy of my Department and of the Government to target for development both specific countries and specific areas in the tourism spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's statement at that seminar, that £500 million was lost to tourism during a number of years, would the Minister not agree that in the areas he suggested but did not name, concerns like Bord Fáilte were being held up as problem areas for the promotion of tourism?  That, as well as the setting up of the task force, prompted my question.  Now he is Minister for Tourism and Transport will he indicate, if he agrees with the Taoiseach, where these areas are where money has been squandered or lost in the tourism business and the people responsible for those losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the <Col N="493" /> Taoiseach ever said money was squandered or lost.  What the Taoiseach said was that we must emphasise very strongly for the future the marketing area in the tourism industry, that there has been a weakness there, that we must step up marketing and, that whatever other cuts there may be, there should be no cuts in the marketing area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Austin Deasy for a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told this £4 million is being provided from national lottery funds to promote the tourist industry.  It is all very hazy.  I failed to get a direct answer.  I put in a question for written reply and got a very noncommital answer from the Minister.  Will the task force recommend how that £4 million is to be spent?  Are media reports correct that the chairperson, Miss Bowler, has been allocated £2.5 million to spend or to recommend.  Where it should be spent? Is there a connection between the £4 million and the task force or is there a connection between the £2.5 million and the task force?</P>

      <P>I do not think my role here is to comment on newspaper reports.  The advisory group with Miss Bowler as chairperson were set up to advise on the expenditure of the £4 million.  The <i>raison d'etre</i> for appointment of the advisory group was that there could be no criticism in future that we were not in touch with the realities of the industry.  These are people who were involved with the industry.  This advisory group were set up as a result of a very thorough, full day forum held in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham out of which hundreds of ideas came. In the context the advisory group are considering expenditure.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that the £4 million was capable of being spent in a large number of markets, which I am sure he will agree will be dissipating the money and spreading it too far. Therefore, can I take it from that that the task force have the scope to recommend the spending of this £4 million in keeping with the other moneys available within the budget to Bord Fáilte?  Will they recommend perhaps a wider spending of moneys in encompassing the £4 million and the Bord Fáilte budget?  Will they be able to do this?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister had any discussions with his colleague in the Department of the Marine who is here with us at present in acknowledging that there is a problem in some of the rivers in that there is a severe lack of fish running in the rivers?

This is happening <Col N="499" /> particularly off the south and south-east coasts which had a growing tourism angling industry but which are now suffering drastically.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 24 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants, Price Waterhouse, were employed in 1986 to carry out a review of the Air Navigation Services Office (ANSO) of my Department, which is responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for the provision of air traffic control services at the three State airports, Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  The purpose of the review was to take an objective look at the organisation of ANSO, its structures, equipment and staffing, to see how it was <Col N="502" /> performing bearing in mind the over-riding requirement of safety and taking account of technological developments.</P>
    <P>The consultants submitted a comprehensive report which covered all aspects of ANSO's operations.  The report recommended institutional and organisational changes, as well as changes of systems, work practices and procedures, training and staffing.  It also recommended a major equipment upgrading and modernisation programme involving total capital expenditure of approximately £30 million over a five year period or so.  I have accepted the consultants' recommendations and the work necessary to bring about the recommended improvements has been put in hands.  In 1988, capital expenditure of £3 million will be undertaken on the provision of new navigational and communications equipment at the three State airports.</P>
    <P>One of the institutional changes recommended by the consultants was the establishment of the Air Navigation Services Office as an executive office.  This will, however, have to await the enactment of enabling legislation in respect of executive offices generally.  While I have accepted the consultants' recommendation in this respect, I have no plans for setting up an independent civil aviation authority.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report is a confidential document and I do not propose to publish it.  A summary of the consultants' recommendations has already been supplied to staff interests and consultation with those interests about the implementation of recommendations affecting the interests of their members has already commenced.</P>
    <P>We have a proud record of air safety in Ireland and I intend maintaining that record.  I welcome the fact that the Irish Airline Pilots' Association stressed that safety in Irish airspace is not being compromised at this time.  I am satisfied that the restructured ANSO and the provision of new equipment will enable us to cater for the growth in air traffic in a safe, orderly and expeditious manner.</P>

      <P>First, I object very strongly to Question No. 9 being lumped in with Questions Nos. 24 and 27.  There might be an oblique connection but it is fairly remote.  Question No. 27 is a Priority Question and I have made no reference whatsoever to the Price Waterhouse report in it.  I had merely suggested to my colleague, Deputy Carey, that he should put down Question No. 9 because of the quota system which is in force.</P>
      <P>However, with reference to Question No. 9, why is the Price Waterhouse report on air traffic control so secretive? We have had a Price Waterhouse report on the tourism industry, an excellent report, which the Government and the Minister had no hesitation in publishing. Why is this report being kept so secret? Is it because, as the Minister announced in his reply, the cost is £30 million over five years and he does not wish to expend money of that magnitude?  Or is there some reason which would prejudice the safety of the State?  Could the Minister please answer: why the secrecy?</P>
      <P>I would have liked a separate answer to Question No. 27, which, incidently, is connected with Question No. 24.  If the people operating the air services in and out of this country are adamant that there should be a civil aviation authority surely they are the people best qualified to know what is needed.  Surely it is not correct for the Minister to say that we have an excellent record of airline and flight safety.  We had two incidents quite recently at Cork Airport and an incident as late as yesterday at the airport in County Longford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the two parts of the Deputy's supplementary questions. First, he asked why the report was not being published?  It was never said that the report would be published.  It was commissioned for the benefit and information of the people in charge of ANSO. The Price Waterhouse consultants reported to my predecessor, a member of the Government to which Deputy Deasy belonged and he took the decision that it should not be published at that particular time.  I examined the whole situation and I saw no reason to differ in my judgment from that of Deputy Mitchell, the then Minister.  That deals with the first part of the supplementary.  Second, I am confident that the system being put in place, and the amount of money being spent on new equipment, will guarantee the continuance of the excellent safety record that we have at our airports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed response.  However, I express profound regret at the suggestion that he will not be considering the establishment of an independent authority. Would the Minister not accept that one of the bedrock principles of safety in the provision of air traffic control is that it is monitored by an independent body, independent of the users and providers of the service and that that is an inherent shortcoming in the structures of our safety control system?  It is for that fundamental reason that the Irish Airline Pilots' Association are demanding, and making such a strong and forceful case for, the provision of such an authority.  It is fundamentally a principle of first order that the policing of safety is independent of considerations of costs or, indeed, of cutbacks, as seems to be the order of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that a secondary aspect of the whole problem is &mdash; to paraphrase an old legal maxim &mdash; that safety must not only be done, but must be seen to be done and that for people in the public area, the consumer and indeed the pilots, it is important to see an element of independence.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said, would he not agree that the system in operation at present &mdash; as indicated in the report, which he is guarding &mdash; is sufficient, provided that the volume of air traffic remains as it is?  However, the report indicates that if there are serious increases in the volume of air traffic &mdash; which has happened particularly in the last 18 months and, if things go right will continue &mdash; the system is insufficient to meet the demands of the increased volume.  Questions would then have to be asked because the money to be spent would be substantially larger <Col N="506" /> than the £3 million which the Minister is proposing.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Task Force have the following terms of reference as decided by the Government: first, to co-ordinate, on a non-statutory basis, traffic management and bus priority activities in the Dublin area, devising new schemes where appropriate.  They were involved in that exercise, as the Deputy knows, prior to the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority.  Second, to settle annually the priorities for funding traffic management and bus priority schemes within the budget allocation in the Tourism and Transport Vote.  The Deputy asked in his <Col N="508" /> supplementary question how much that was.  In 1988, £165,000 has been allocated.  Third, by these and any other appropriate means to pursue the stated aims of reducing traffic congestion, especially at peak times, and promoting and facilitating the use of public transport services.  They held their first meeting on 27 January last.</P>

      <P>The EC air transport package, concluded in December, 1987, presented Irish airlines with major opportunities to develop air services between Ireland and other Community states.  I have received a large number of applications to operate new services and, while I have not completed my examination of all of the applications, I have within the last few days announced approval in principle for a substantial number of services to be operated by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Club Air.  I propose to circulate a list of these services to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that I expect to be in a position shortly to give details of revised, more liberal air transport arrangements between Ireland and the UK which will facilitate further the development of new <Col N="511" /> air services between the two countries. This will enable me to announce the approval of further services for which the airlines have already made application.</P>
    <P>I have referred previously to the fact that in a number of recent years Irish residents holidaying abroad have spent more than incoming tourists spend in this country.  As you are aware, it is a major objective of tourism policy to reverse that situation.  I must, therefore, stress that I expect the airlines who are receiving these new rights to have regard to that objective and to demonstrate to me in due course the contribution they have made to the development of inward tourist traffic.</P>

      <P>Ryanair and Aer Lingus, hopefully with the agreement of the French and German Governments, will be initiating services from both France and Germany.  Aer Lingus are already providing a service from both countries and have announced a 20 per cent reduction in fares which is the most important thing of all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any applications from any airlines for fifth freedom rights in this country coming from Canada through Ireland and onwards or from Australia through Ireland and onwards?  Given that there are no direct flights from Canada to <Col N="513" /> Ireland at present, nor from Australia to Ireland, have any airlines applied or are any in discussion with the Minister's Department to open up routes of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right that there are no flights from Canada at the moment.  Discussions are going on now between us and the Canadians in regard to the development of air transport between the two countries.  Anent the Deputy's reference to Australia, we had succeeded in having an &ldquo;add on&rdquo; from Australia to London to Dublin and Dublin to Paris without extra cost to Australian travellers.  As this is a year when Ireland's links to Australia are being highlighted, we expect that we will get a tourism benefit from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that there are airlines interested in working the routes I have outlined and that one of the problems is that we are insisting that they come through Shannon rather than through Dublin and that some of these airlines feel that the business must come through the capital if it is to be viable?  The fact that we are offering them Shannon Airport as the airport in Ireland for this type of service rather than Dublin Airport which they want is a stumbling block.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the North American airlines has ceased this year to come to Dublin and are countinuing their service to Shannon.  Two airlines from the United Stated are interested in continuing the journey from Shannon to Dublin and the US Government will choose which of the two will get that facility.  With regard to the Shannon position, it has been the policy of successive Governments that Shannon is the touch-down airport for transatlantic aircraft. That policy has not been changed.</P>

      <P>Among the special measures which I announced last May to boost tourism in 1987 was a revamping and upgrading of the Interdepartmental Policy Co-ordination Committee on Tourism to help co-ordinate public sector activities in so far as they relate to tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Denis Lyons, Minister of State at my Department, has taken over the chairmanship of this committee previously held by an Assistant Secretary <Col N="516" /> in the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and representation has been raised to the level of Assistant Secretary.  The committee was mandated to identify current activities of Government Departments and State agencies which could be incorporated in attractive packages for tourism promotion; to assess the potential for increased utilisation of existing public sector resources; and to co-ordinate State activities related to environmental protection, pollution control and planning.</P>
    <P>A large number of initiatives were recommended by the committee and I have enumerated the most important of these in the attached Appendix to this reply which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, is now pursuing on a bilateral basis with the relevant Departments the proposals which arose from the committee's deliberations and is monitoring progress on their implementation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the plans the Government have drawn up so far to meet the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to create an extra 25,000 jobs in the tourism area and to attract an additional £500 million of foreign tourism revenue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already articulated on numerous occasions in this House the main constituents of Government policy for the development of Irish tourism. These are more competitive and extensive access transport, improvements in the range and quality of our products, better price competitiveness and more targeted marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the initiatives which we have taken on access fares including a very radical charter policy have been already given to this House.  Within the last few days, I announced approval in principle for the introduction of a substantial number of new services by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Club Air based on the EC air <Col N="519" /> transport package agreed in December last.  I expect very shortly to be in a position to give details of a revised bilateral agreement negotiated by my Department with the UK authorities providing for more liberal arrangements as to market access, capacity and fares than those of the EC package.  This will clear the way for the approval of further services for which our airlines have already sought approval.</P>
    <P>Investment in tourism as in all other sectors has greatly benefited from the dramatic fall in interest rates which the Government have brought about.  In addition, the extension of the business expansion scheme to tourism has increased the potential and attractiveness of the sector for increased investment. On the competitiveness front, the Government's success in reducing domestic inflation to the lowest level for many years will enhance the attraction of Ireland as a tourist destination.  On the marketing front Bord Fáilte, at the request of the Government, have adopted a more targeted approach to specific markets and to specific segments within these.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte estimates for 1987 vindicate the policy initiatives we have taken.  For the first year ever total tourism receipts exceeded £1 billion.  Total out of State receipts at £721 million were £72 million higher than in 1986.  Bord Fáilte have also estimated that over 3,800 extra jobs were directly created in tourism in 1987 while a further 3,600 extra jobs were indirectly generated as a result of the sector's performance.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government have allocated an extra £4 million in the budget for the development of tourism.  They have set up a special advisory group, representative of a wide cross section of the industry, to advise on how this £4 million should be spent with a view to achieving the targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the detailed response he has given. <Col N="520" /> The question I wish to put to him is: does he wish to estimate how much longer we have to wait to see the realisation of the very specific targets laid down in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of 25,000 extra jobs in tourism and an increase of revenue of £500 million? When does he, as Minister, anticipate that we could enjoy the benefits from all the various plans he has outlined in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the saying goes in my part of the country, <i>ceteris paribus,</i> if the Deputy has a look at the figures which resulted from an initiative taken in May 1987, for eight months of the year, and apply those to the extra jobs figure and the extra revenue that I have just mentioned he will see that what was regarded as a very ambitious programme of 25,000 extra jobs and £500 million extra revenue in tourism has got under way.  It is important to have a high objective and a high aim and that it is achievable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if his Department condone the application of fares which are not economic and which are designed to create unfair competition; and if not, the steps he intends to take to prevent such malpractice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport undertakings are expected to charge the lowest possible fares consistent with adequate service and economic operation and that is the principle which I apply in the discharge of my functions in relation to such fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would all agree that the lowest possible fares should be charged for services provided.  What I am asking the Minister is if he agrees that fares which are not economic should be tolerated?  Does he have any control over this aspect of competition in the travel business, whether by air, sea or road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is yes, I do have control in certain areas.  I have <Col N="521" /> control in regard to the air fares and, as far as CIE are concerned, in regard to rail, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath fares.  Admittedly, CIE were disappointed that I did not permit the increases in Bus Átha Cliath fares or in fares generally which they were demanding earlier in the year.  The answer in short is I do have control and have exercised such control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it is quite obvious that certain fares are not economic, where these fares are being operated by State-sponsored bodies and where it is apparent they are being operated to undermine competition from the private sector, will the Minister please take action rather than have elimination of competition because that is obviously the objective, whether in regard to the £5 return fare being charged by Bus Éireann on long provincial routes, whether it is the cheap fare being charged by B &amp; I on the Irish Sea or whether it is the fare of £35 to London which has been announced today by Aer Lingus.  That same company told us less than three years ago that the economic fare could not be less than £206 return to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The elimination of competition would worry me because competition is very important.  With regard to the reference to low fares, there are different kinds of fares.  It has been the custom for the last couple of years when a service is starting up to have promotional fares and they were often very low fares. It was never envisaged that that type of fare would last and it did not last in the case of the five airlines that are flying from London-Dublin and Dublin-London.  There is no question of that happening.  Part of the package that we will be agreeing with the United Kingdom and which I will be signing within the next couple of weeks will have a double refusal clause before a fare is refused.  In other words, both Governments will have to refuse the fare before it will have any effect on the airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="522" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that cheap promotional fares for a short period may be desirable and we could agree with that but if uneconomic fares are being charged in order to put competitors out of business we would then take action to see that that undesirable activity is stopped because it would simply be a case of using taxpayers' money to defeat the long term interests of the same taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I would step in, within the powers I have, if there was an indication that competition was being eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the terms of EC Directive 5938/84 which puts very strict limitations on the type of fare that can be charged?  The type of fares that have been announced in the media today clearly contravene the spirit and the meaning of that directive in a number of instances.

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport in considering the application for a road passenger licence under the Road Transport Act, 1932, if he takes into account the level of existing licensed services into a given area; and if so, the method by which he comes to the conclusion that services into a particular area are sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering applications for road passenger licences I am required in accordance with section 11 (3) of the Road Transport Act, 1932, to <Col N="523" /> have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed service.</P>
      <P>In determining the adequacy of services account is taken, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, of existing bus and rail services provided by CIE and of bus services provided by other licensed operators.</P>
      <P>A review of the 1932 Act has recently been concluded in my Department and proposals for updating the Act are now being finalised.  Subject to Government approval, it is my intention to introduce a more flexible system for the licensing of private bus operators.</P>

      <P>I welcome any initiatives which will update the 1932 Act. However, will the Minister accept in the present circumstances that the issuing of licences by his Department is not carried out in a fair manner?  I am sure the Minister is aware that if the rule was applied equally to everybody, CIE and hauliers licensed by the Minister's Department would not be driven crazy by unlicensed hauliers, whose reward is a licence to compete with CIE and the licensed hauliers, which is wrong.</P>

      <P>I deny the Deputy's allegations.  The principles outlined in my answer are applied in each individual case of application to my Department.

      <P>In his speech to the Chartered Institute of Transport, the Minister <Col N="524" /> spoke about updating legislation and the liberalisation involved.  However, he seemed to contradict himself because on the one hand he was talking about liberalisation and on the other he was practically apologising to CIE for not being in a position to give them more funds.  Is there a conflict of interest in regard to establishing a policy in terms of liberalisation of transport development to give real competition on the roads?  Is that how he sees his liberalisation policies going?</P>

The 1932 Act is being examined with a view to bringing legislation before the House to regularise a situation which should have been dealt with long ago.  The 1932 Act was put on the Statute Book for the purposes of preserving the railways and is now totally out of date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in the light of the total failure of negotiations between the parties to the Dublin Corporation Fire Brigade dispute, he will explain the reasons for the latest impasse; and the steps he will take with a view to bringing this dispute to an immediate end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute has been in progress now for over one month and continues despite days and nights of negotiations in the Labour Court.  No effort has been spared in attempting to find a solution.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress was achieved at those negotiations and a number of useful proposals put on the table.  The main problem seems to be a misunderstanding about the Government's voluntary retirement package.</P>
      <P>In this connection I would like to state clearly and simply the following: (1) the package is voluntary: there is no onus on staff to accept it; (2) where however it is accepted by staff &mdash; in this case members of the fire brigade &mdash; the posts that are left vacant cannot be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the fire brigade, Dublin Corporation felt the fire brigade should accept some small part of the economies which were being requested elsewhere in the knowledge that the Chief Fire Officer was satisfied that the reduction in staff would not affect the fire brigade in such a way as to bring about a deterioration in the standard and level of service.  Sixteen men took the package.  Over 400 are expected to go in the corporation due to voluntary redundancy and early retirement.  The fire brigade is not therefore, being asked to make the same sacrifices as the rest of the employees of Dublin Corporation or indeed the rest of the employees in the public service.  Nor have they been asked to do so in the past. <Col N="526" /> Since 1982, fire brigade staff has expanded from 652 to 807 while corporation numbers in total have fallen by 645 from 8,398 to 7,753.  The fire brigade have, therefore, been treated much more favourably than other corporation staff and other public employees.  Corporation numbers fell by 8 per cent while fire brigade numbers increased by 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>In terms of expenditure, expenditure on the fire brigade increased from £7.1 million in 1980 to over £20 million in 1988 and in the same period five new fire stations have been constructed.  This, again, is in strong contrast to what has happened elsewhere in the public service.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, considerable progress was achieved in the negotiations in the Labour Court.  Constructive proposals were put on the table which were turned down by an overwhelming majority.  I might mention a few: (1) eight new promotional posts were offered at station officer level which protected promotional opportunities for fire fighters and subofficers; (2) a commitment was given to retain the grades of third officer and district officer; (3) eleven firefighters were to be recruited to fill future vacancies; (4) a strong commitment was given to the development of training: staffing requirements would be reviewed after one year's operation of the training programme and staff which would be surplus to requirements on the introduction of new communications system would be retained to facilitate training and (5) full pay was offered to those removed from the payroll before the strike commenced and interest-free loans to those on strike.  A package on these lines must and should form the basis of a return to work.  I understand the unions and the men have reservations about several items in the package.  The corporation have stated they are willing to further clarify the package.  If there is a basis in that for further discussions then I think the parties should meet again under the auspices of the conciliation service of the Labour Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not asking us to accept, after all the <Col N="527" /> investment and building up of the fire service in the Dublin area, that we should now oversee a reduction of the quality of that service, which is basically what this dispute is about?  Will the Minister agree that despite the fact that the package of voluntary redundancies is referred to as redundancies the jobs are not being extinguished, that the duties are being transferred to other members of the service?  Will the Minister accept that at this point, having gone through the conciliation process on three occasions, it would be more productive for the Labour Court to have a special investigation into the dispute so that the matters outstanding can be dealt with and an early solution found to the dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see an early conclusion of the dispute but it has to be based on negotiation.  I must point out that one of the negotiating sessions took 34 hours non-stop.  I should like to tell the Deputy that two of the points he raised are more relevant to the Minister for the Environment or Dublin Corporation.  I will keep in touch with both sides in the dispute and if it is considered necessary I will go before the full Labour Court or to the conciliation services.  I must say that up to now both sides wished to deal at conciliation level and I facilitated them in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain to the House why the package that was negotiated after such a lengthy period of conciliation talks was so resoundingly rejected by the workers?  Has the Minister any views on that?  Will he agree that the threat to place pickets on State offices and at ports in Wales and so on is completely out of proportion to the difference between the sides in the dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would agree. Prior to the strike commencing there were four days of discussions and in the second week there was an afternoon of discussions.  Last Friday week the conciliation officers met both sides and again on the Saturday before adjourning.  They came forward with the proposals on last <Col N="528" /> Wednesday morning at 10.30.  They met continually from 10.30 a.m. last Wednesday until 8 p.m. and all indications, from the trade union leadership, the full-time officials, the conciliation officers, the advisers to Dublin Corporation and the Departments of the Environment and Labour as they left were that they had a solution.  That did not happen.  I cannot say what occurred between that time and when the meeting of the staff took place but there was an overwhelming change from what I understood to be the position.  If there is anything further I can do within the conciliation service, or any other service in my Department I will do so in an effort to try to resolve the dispute.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree to use his good offices again, as he has done, to bring about a resolution of this dispute now that Dublin Corporation, after one month, have conceded that there must be promotional opportunities and that they cannot abolish a district officership grade?  It appears there is not that much between the parties after four long weeks of provocative and obdurate refusal on the part of Dublin Corporation to bring the dispute to a settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The are 500 votes involved but I will do what I can to bring the sides together.  The Deputy is correct in saying that the district officership will be maintained.  If it is considered necessary that I should reclarify that position to those involved in the discussions I will do so, directly to the fire brigade staff if necessary.</P>

      <P>The terms of the motion I sent to the Ceann Comhairle are as follows:</P>
      <P>In view of the growing crisis in the health services with emergency meetings taking place in a number of health board areas, with waiting lists for even very routine procedures and with more and more public beds being privatised, Dáil Éireann resolves to establish an all-party committee to examine the health services.  The terms of reference of such a committee would include the setting out of principles to be applied to the development of a modern and efficient health service capable of delivering rapid and sustained care at the point of need to every citizen irrespective of means, examine the funding, arrangements of the best possible health care system and examine the reductions in services that are taking place at present with a view to proposing alternative methods of ensuring adequate health care.</P>
      <P>If the House is to reflect the crisis in the health services we should suspend normal business and discuss this as a matter of urgency.  There are times when the House is accused of not being in touch with reality and there is hardly a family in the country that is not affected by the mismanagement and the crisis in the health services.  On that basis I am asking for leave to suspend the business of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to make a point of order within the rules of this House which may need some clarification as we go along.  In relation to the Order of Business, Sir, is it not normal for the Taoiseach to propose and for you to put to the House the items on the Order of Business which today are Nos. 2, 13, 14 and 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Clerk of the Dáil provide a precedent or a rule to the effect that it is otherwise?  It has always been the case that you have put the items as read out by the Taoiseach to this House. I want to inform you now that we are <Col N="645" /> opposing the taking of Nos. 2, 13, 14 and 15 because we want motion No. 40 on the Order Paper dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I normally would not do this but in the circumstances I am obliged to refer to the rule in question.  Standing Order No. 25 states:</P>
      <P>Every sitting of the Dáil shall be governed by a printed Order Paper which shall be prepared under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken each day.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the prerogative to order the business of the day.  The only time the Ceann Comhairle deviates from that is when there is a recommendation, such as there is today, for a later sitting than normal.  Otherwise the business is agreed and there can be no deviations from that procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this Bill I want to restate the policy of the Labour Party in this regard, which is encapsulated in a motion tabled by the Labour Party, as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann believes adequate research and advisory services are essential to the development of our agricultural industry.  Accordingly, Dáil Éireann instructs the Government to ensure that the proposals to amalgamate An Foras Talúntais and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, is implemented in such a way as will ensure the efficient delivery of services to agriculture, and that it will maximise the capacity for independent agricultural research.  Dáil Éireann accepts that certain efficiencies in administration and delivery of services will accrue from the amalgamation of the two bodies, but does not accept that research and advisory services can continue to function if the staffing available is drastically reduced, as indicated in the Book of Estimates.  Accordingly Dáil Éireann instructs the Government to ensure that no reductions take place in the staffing of An Foras Talúntais and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, other than those that can be secured on a voluntary basis, and other than those that are consistent with the continued delivery of a high level of efficient service and research.  Dáil Éireann notes that the following alternative measures are possible:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the seeking of additional savings in Departmental administration generally;</P>
      <P>and not just the Department of Agriculture,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the cancellation of the proposed <Col N="651" /> £911,000 to be spent on office premises expenses;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the reintroduction of the land tax, in the next Budget...</P>
    <P>as proposed in motion No. 34, Private Members' Motions list No. 1.  That motion tabled by the Labour Party is on the Order Paper and encapsulates the position of the Labour Party concerning the proposed amalgamations.</P>
    <P>I want to state categorically that the Labour Party are not opposed to the proposed amalgamation between An Foras Talúntais and ACOT.  In fact, we welcome it.  However, the most important aspect, as we see it, is not the detail of the Bill itself but the funding for the new body.  What we see is a cut of £15 million from the joint budgets of ACOT and AFT, and we believe this will have the effect of neutralising, as far as the consumers of these services are concerned, the tasks of AFT and ACOT.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to respond to this. I understand the Minister has given a specific commitment to the trade unions representing the workers concerned in AFT and ACOT that additional and sufficient funding will be provided over and above the £20 million provided in the budget.  If this is not forthcoming, I am asking the other Opposition parties to take combined action to ensure that this Bill does not go through.  I am not talking about a parochial issue such as that on which we voted last week where the combined Opposition voted together, but about an issue which affects the most vital industry in the country, agriculture.  I am talking about a proposal that I believe will end effectively the training and education of young farmers who cannot afford to pay at the coalface for these services.  I believe it will end the vital independence of research in this very important area.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record that I and the Labour Party regard agriculture as our primary natural resource.  It is the area where wealth can be produced in great quantities.  It is the area where many jobs can be produced.  I recognise <Col N="652" /> that at present jobs and wealth are being produced in great quantities in this area. I want to put on the record my support and that of my party for small and family farms.  I want to nail the oft expressed lie that the Labour Party are farmer bashers. I am the son of a small farmer in the west, and proud of it.  I understand the awful degree of poverty that exists in the farming community.  I want to explain to the House that the calls from the Labour Party for an equitable tax system recognise clearly that in rural Ireland there is real poverty among members of the farming community.</P>
    <P>The objective now should be not to cut back on training and advice on education, not to cut back on research and development, but should be to do the reverse of all these things.  If this Bill goes through without adequate funding it will be impossible to do that.  In the area of agriculture there can be increased production.  Research and development should be such that we do not continue to produce high priced goods which nobody wants for storage in large warehouses until they are rotten and are of no use. In my own constituency there are often sides of beef and mountains of butter stored in large warehouses at a huge cost, next to council estates.  The residents in those houses cannot afford to buy these goods in the shops and goods are being stored at huge expense to rot.  We can improve standards by providing appropriate training and education for farmers and their families.  If we have the proper marketing, more jobs in downstream processing can be produced.  I recognise that the Government have an excellent policy in this regard, but this proposal without funding will have the opposite effect to the Government's intentions.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to a document produced by Tom Arnold, a senior economist in ACOT in which he asks: &ldquo;Is agriculture being written-off?&rdquo; I am sure it is not the Minister's intention that it should be written-off.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to his Cabinet colleagues and explain that the funding being provided is not adequate to do the job and to ask for the finance to do the <Col N="653" /> job properly as he committed himself to do to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representatives and the unions representing the employees directly.</P>
    <P>What we are facing is a 40 per cent cut, an unplanned hatchet job in research and development.  There will be redundancies of between 800 and 1,000 and redeployment of between 400 and 500 persons will now probably be required.  The effect is that we will not have an advisory service which will benefit those who need it most. About 50 per cent of farmers have below 50 acres and they require a service on a regular and organised basis, a service which they do not have to buy at the point of delivery.  If that is to be the criterion, those who pay will get the service and the people who cannot pay will not get it.</P>
    <P>A cut of £15 million makes both organisations not viable.  Those organisations are in an awful limbo.  The Minister should take the advice of Deputy O'Keeffe who spoke last week and appoint a director for Teagasc immediately so that the task in hand can be continued.  The investment in trained staff will not be lost and their redeployment into paper pushing in the Department of Agriculture and Food will not become a reality.  That must be examined and dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to research, any research programme, to be effective, must have proper funding and proper staffing and a degree of independence I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill.  My main concern is funding.  If adequate funding is not provided, this new body cannot operate effectively.  Many of my concerns can be dealt with effectively in the House by agreement and by amendment.  The cuts in State funding for research in food and agriculture are arbitrary and unplanned.  State funding for research and development in food and agriculture is much lower, by two to six times lower, in Ireland than in other European countries. Cuts in State funding for research and development are in direct contradiction to the Government's plan for development and job creation in the food and agriculture industry.  Food research is a <Col N="654" /> prerequisite for the development of this industry which must compete with highly sophisticated companies on international markets.</P>
    <P>Whatever merits there are in a merger between research and advice and education, the merged organisation has little hope of providing the expected support and services to the industry if it is starved of funds at its inception.  Over production means that the demands on research are greatly increased.  Improvement in products, efficient production processes, the development of alternative enterprises and of marketing must be achieved through research and development programmes.  There is to be a funding cut of approximately £15 million.  A re-allocation of this total amount is necessary but anything less than £10 million will make the organisation non-viable and unable to generate the required level of self-funding.  About 32 per cent of the 1986 AFT budget was generated from operating receipts and fees for services. In that situation the importance of the funding, staffing and independence of the research area is vital.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill relates to disclosure of information.  Concern is being expressed in particular by senior staff about the unnecessary regulations.  The record of AFT on confidentiality shows that they have scrupulously honoured the necessary confidentiality in their dealings.  In sections 19 and 33 the role of the Minister seems to be all-pervasive.  This policy will reduce the credibility of the researchers which will result in a reduction in their earning power.  If it is seen that the hand of the Minister or the Department is laid heavily on the researchers and what they can do and say, the possibility of the services being taken on a commercial basis will be reduced.</P>
    <P>The main concern of staff in the industry is about redundancy and the ability to deliver the service they delivered previously.  In relation to funds, if we divide the amount provided by the number of staff stated by the Minister to be required, we will find that there will be no funds left to do the things that the <Col N="655" /> body is supposed to do.  When replying will the Minister refer to the commitment made to the unions about additional funding?  If I cannot get a positive reply I intend to vote against the Bill on Second Stage to indicate my displeasure and the unacceptability of this Bill because the required funding has not been provided.</P>
    <P>We are faced also with redeployment and redundancy.  The difficulty of the limbo in which both organisations are at the moment and in which the new organisation is until they come effectively together, is that staff do not know what is the best thing for them to do.  They do not know how the new organisation will shape up, and a form of intimidation is being practised by the Department rather than by the Minister, though the Minister's name probably will be attached to what has been seen as intimidation. People are being told that they opt now or miss their chance.  We should hasten slowly in that regard because we do not want to drive out of the existing organisations the best people who will be required by the Minister if the new organisation is to be effective.</P>
    <P>There is a wide-ranging, long-standing argument between the representative bodies and the Department about the transmovement of staff between the administrative and technical grades and I am sure the Department can argue that this is a great break-through in that technical staff will be moving into the policy-making area.  That may be so, but we do not want to hasten so fast as to have the effect of denuding what should be the technical area of technical staff who will be required if we are to have an effective body.</P>
    <P>ACOT have as of right worker representatives on their board.  No facility exists for such representation on the new board.  It is highly desirable to have the involvement of the staff through their representatives on the board of the new Teagasc.  The Minister can under legislation going through the Seanad at the moment nominate Teagasc as one of the bodies who will have that representation. If we do not get a commitment from the <Col N="656" /> Minister on that before the end of Second Stage I will be tabling an amendment enabling the staff to be represented. However, I hope the Minister will take that on board and ensure that it will not be necessary to table such an amendment and will give a commitment that the new legislation going through the Seanad will be used in regard to this new body.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 8, I am concerned about the powers of the Department of Finance.  My interpretation is that the Department of Finance will be able to interfere in the most intimate way in the day-to-day workings of the new body. Not alone will they be able to decide on the number and type of employees in the new organisation, they will be able to decide how they can be moved from one area to another.  I do not think the new organisation with that type of stricture if my interpretation is correct &mdash; if it is not, I am sure the Minister will tell me so in his reply &mdash; can produce the plans required by the Minister and the Bill.</P>
    <P>In winding up I want to restate the importance I attach to the agricultural area.  It is the major resource we have, the major producer of wealth and the major earner of foreign currency.  We must recognise that and the need to develop that area not just for farmers and their families, though including farmers and their families, but for the common good.  What happens in agriculture affects every citizen of this State.  It is very much in our interest and the interest of all sections of the community to ensure that agriculture is fully, properly and thoroughly developed and marketed. Funding is required for that job and the funding at present being made available is not adequate to the needs.  Agricultural exports are worth more than all the industrial exports put together.  If we compare investment by the State in that area with the investment in job creation in the industrial sector we will see that agriculture is coming out a very poor second, or fourth or even fifth, in that category.</P>
    <P>I say positively I will support fully, as will my party, the proper funding of education and training of young farmers, the delivery of a proper advice service to <Col N="657" /> farmers and the funding and staffing of a proper research and development service.  If the Minister's reply on funding is negative I will be seeking the support of the other Opposition parties &mdash; I am not talking about shadow boxing, I do not go in for that type of play-acting &mdash; to vote down this measure until the Government are prepared to provide the proper funding.  I believe in doing that the Minister will be honouring his commitments both to the industry itself in the Government's policy position on that and to the representatives of the staff.  If that is done this Bill can go through this House with some minor amendments we hope will be acceptable, a tidying-up operation effectively.  In principle I accept the measure. It is the funding I have difficulty with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>When we look at this Bill we begin to look back at what has happened in agricultural development for a long number of years.  The Bill changes some of the old Acts going back to 1908.  It represents the first attempt to bring into line and to bring together the research and educational ends as far as agriculture is concerned.  I hope that in the future the Minister might even see it practicable to go further in that not alone should AFT and ACOT as we knew them be amalgamated but he should, as he will have power to do under this Bill, examine the possibility of taking the farm development service into this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us speaking on this Bill can but pay the highest praise to AFT and ACOT for the work done through the years.  The old committees of agriculture which existed prior to the setting up of ACOT were probably a better organisation than ACOT because their members were responsible to the electorate.  They were made up totally of county councillors who had to face the electorate at least once every five years. The work done by AFT down the years has been of great benefit to Irish agriculture.  They have been responsible for many of the developments we have seen. Their work with regard to land drainage which has taken up a major portion of their time, farm buildings and research <Col N="658" /> on animal diseases has been of enormous benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>The problems I see here are not in regard to funding which Deputy Stagg has mentioned.  I believe sufficient funds will be made available by the Minister and, while the initial sum may not be what everybody would like to see, it is there to set about getting the organisation up and running.  The work at the moment being carried out by the two organisations could better be done by one organisation. Therefore, I have to give my full support to the setting up of this new research, training and advice committee or organisation.</P>
    <P>When this merger was proposed people said that many of the people engaged in both services would leave.  Fortunately, the number of people who sought redundancy from both organisations was much smaller than many thought it would be. Under the new organisation the work being carried out by both ACOT and AFT will be better co-ordinated.  We have come a long way in agricultural development especially since we entered the EC, but now we find that many of the things we relied on for our main source of income in agriculture are over-produced.  It is time for us to put in the necessary research, to have new products researched and developed.  I welcome the fact that this Bill will give even the private sector the opportunity of making a contribution towards the work being done at the research end.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the work being done at present by AFT and in particular to the work being done at the research station at Ballinamore in my area which is probably the most deprived area of the country so far as the land quality and social structure are concerned.  That station are carrying out research in the areas of mixed stock, dairying, drainage, grassland and machine mobility on wet land. Their research and work helped many farmers in 1985 and 1986 when we had two disastrous summers.  They have also given the people in that area an opportunity to see at first hand the sort of work <Col N="659" /> that is done.  The farmers in that area have benefited from the work that has been done by AFT.  I know it will not be the Minister's responsibility to decide which stations are closed or which stations are kept open under the new scheme but I appeal to the new directors to see to it that at least one research station is maintained in that area which has suffered greatly due to climatic conditions and the natural condition of the land.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the future structure and board membership of the new body. I note that it is intended that five members will be appointed by the Minster.  I know that when it comes to appointing people to the board the Minister will appoint people who have the knowledge and ability to put the best foot forward in the development of agriculture.  I note that it will be an 11 member board and I hope that those members will be taken from the various regions of the country.  There should be no imbalance in the membership of the board, whether they are from the east or the south.  Fair representation should be given to all areas of the country.  Different areas have different problems and I hope that the new board in their wisdom will see fit to set up a regional subcommittee who might meet on a regular basis to advise the board on the problems facing the regions.</P>
    <P>If we want to compete in the future against the Danes, the Dutch or any of our agricultural competitors in Europe, it is necessary that the young people who are entering agriculture should be better trained than the people they will be competing against on the Continent.  There is a need, and it has been there down through the years, for people who are appointed to boards, to have a direct interest in what the board are about and I hope that every member of this board will have a thorough knowledge of agriculture, whether it is on the research and development side or the educational side.</P>
    <P>We should at this stage look at the need for further research in agriculture. As I said earlier, we have been looking for a number of years at the standard <Col N="660" /> type products.  Indeed, it is sad that an agricultural country like ours is still importing enormous quantities of food, food which could be produced here at home and food which we are capable of producing.  I hope the advances which have been made in research into food processing will yield benefit to us and that we will eventually become a net exporter of food products and that the enormous amounts of food which are imported will be stopped.  It is ridiculous in an agricultural based economy like ours that people are importing bacon from Denmark, slicing it and then reselling it out of the country.  That is the sort of thing we can well do without.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there will be major problems in the dairy sector, we should now be looking at alternative uses for the milk being produced at present. We are going to have quota restrictions in the short term at least and alternative products based on milk will have to be examined.  After all, there will be no way in which smaller farmers will be able to survive if they do not engage in some type of farming which will give an above average return.</P>
    <P>I note that the new organisation will have responsibility for a certain amount of veterinary research.  AFT have done a good job in this area.  They have been well funded by some organisations in the private sector and I hope that funding will continue.  I believe they will also have to deal with the enormous problems of pollution which is threatening our environment.  Agricultural pollution is something none of us wants.  If farmers are helped they will be only too willing to deal with the pollution problems which have been identified in many areas.  Many of these pollution problems have caused a certain amount of agitation between local authorities and farmers but I feel it will have to be a role of the new organisation to try to sort out these problems.</P>
    <P>The new organisation will have to do a lot of research into other forms of farm income.  They will have to be in a position to provide advice in relation to farm tourism which could become one of the major sources of income for farmers who will <Col N="661" /> not be allowed to develop in the ordinary way.  I believe there is an enormous market out there for farm holidays and angling and tourism holidays associated with farming and living on farms.  Many farmers have made a substantial amount of money from this secondary source of income and this has allowed them to maintain themselves on some of the smaller farms in some of the more scenic areas of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the new organisation will look at the need for product development in the other sectors.  The pig industry is crying out for added value products which could be sold if we were in a position to research the market for them and to produce them.  I hope the new organisation will also look at forestry which may become a source of income for farmers.  Indeed, I would say that there is no farm which does not have at least a few acres of marginal land which could be used for tree planting.  I hope advice will be available for farmers who wish to pursue this activity.</P>
    <P>I hope people who will be redeployed will understand that they are not being redeployed due to victimisation or anything else but because of the need for rationalisation.  They should understand that the Government can no longer fund organisations indefinitely.  We know that charges will be imposed for the services of the new organisation and I think farmers have come to expect this.  Many farmers, especially the larger developed farmers, for the past number of years have employed consultants to give them specialist advice on a number of areas. This could be an area where farmers could be given an incentive to use the knowledge that will be available under the new organisation.  The Government should look at the possibility of giving some assistance to smaller farmers in the disadvantaged areas to make use of the services of Teagasc.  Some farmers, especially smaller farmers, feel left out and that they do not have a role to play in agricultural development.  We all know that is not the position.  However, some small incentive should be given to them to use the services, let it be a percentage <Col N="662" /> of the fees incurred, an extra rate of headage or other grants that are paid in the disadvantaged areas so that these farmers would set about using the knowledge that has been amassed by the organisations down the years.  By doing this we could help people to become involved in producing what is wanted.  There is no use in farmers continuing to produce agricultural products which are not wanted in the market place.  It is imperative that they be trained to produce what the customer wants.</P>
    <P>In the coming years, I believe we will see shortages in certain sectors within the European Communities.  This new organisation will be in a position to help Irish agriculture to move with the times and to help it to develop to a stage where it will be able to compete with its European competitors and to make full use of the advantages which we have in this country.</P>
    <P>Recently attempts were made to use scare tactics with regard to some of the products from this country.  We must accept, and Europe must accept, that we have the cleanest air available in Europe at present.  We are in a position to produce the most natural agricultural products.  We are not like our counterparts in Germany, Holland and Denmark who are into total factory farming.  We should try to exploit the advantages we have over our competitors, and this organisation will give us the opportunity to do that.  It gives us an opportunity to become a leader in the production of quality food.  Quality food will command a premium price.  Agriculture is our number one industry and it is up to us to decide how we want it to progress.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the first attempt that has been made to link the research and training organisation with the advice organisations.  The Bill will give us within ten to 15 years the best educated and most knowledgeable farming community in Europe, because that is what we want to become.  Agriculture is our main source of foreign earnings and is our number one industry.  I was saddened to hear Deputy Stagg say that he felt the Government action with regard to funding meant <Col N="663" /> that agriculture was being pushed on to the backburner.  I think this Government, on coming to office, identified agriculture as one of the chief areas in which we could expand and create jobs.  The Government are proceeding on that line. This Bill shows their confidence in the line they have taken.  While we may have slight reservations with regard to odd sections of the Bill I believe that in general it will shape Irish agriculture for many years to come.</P>
    <P>On the one hand the Bill sets out to rationalise agriculture and on the other hand it sets out to develop agriculture. The Bill is there to help take our farmers, our farming community and the agricultural business on towards the year 2000.  It is the sort of initiative which will show dividends in the years ahead. People, for their own selfish reasons will find sections of the Bill to knock and they will find reasons to knock it.  However, let us be realistic: we cannot allow a situation to continue where two organisations such as ACOT and AFT, which are responsible for the major portion of agricultural research and training, to remain apart.  We have a unique opportunity in the Bill of taking them both together.  It is the sort of forward thinking, if used properly, which can be of enormous benefit to the agricultural community.  In addition it will be of enormous benefit to the financial state of the country and it will help to maintain the growth that we expect and need in the years ahead.  Agriculture is our prime industry and it is up to us to make sure that the people involved in it, whether it be at the farm gate end or at the processing end are market leaders.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the fact that we can sell throughout the world any knowledge gained from developments which take place under the new board.  We have had many developments down through the years which we did not make full use of.  To put it mildly, these developments were pirated by other countries. However, let us now be in a position to carry out the necessary development and to copyright it as far as international agriculture <Col N="664" /> is concerned.  If we do that we will continue to be the leading producer of prime quality unpolluted food in Europe and the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not convinced that the decision to merge ACOT and AFT was necessary or that it is going to make any difference to the efficiency of our agriculture.  However, we are not opposed to the Bill provided we are satisfied there will be no compulsory redundancies or that the quality of agricultural research and training will not be affected.</P>
      <P>The Bill is coming before the Dáil at a time when there is a greater need than ever for Irish agriculture to modernise and to adapt to the changing market needs.  The present methods of producing from the land will need to change within the next few years.  Change will also be forced on farming because of the present levels of intervention payments, which will not continue indefinitely.  Farming has been badly served by the Governments holding power since the State was established.  Since we joined the European Communities especially, farmers were very badly advised by the Department of Agriculture who told them to continue the traditional practice of producing milk with a high level of output in summer and a very much reduced level of output in the winter months.  The pattern of milk production prevented the serious development of markets for the much more valuable and saleable short life milk products.  Converting milk into long life products which were very much in over supply in every market meant that the Irish milk products were not only sold at the lowest market price but to a considerable extent below the market price, at the intervention price.</P>
      <P>The present summer-winter pattern of milk production means that beef also comes on the market in cycles.  It means that a steady market to process meat and meat meals cannot be developed. A substantial percentage of our output either follows milk into intervention storage or is shipped out on the hoof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who negotiated our agricultural interest in the EC betrayed the true <Col N="665" /> national interest, especially by, first, agreeing to the exclusion of canned and cooked meats from MCA payments; secondly, by agreeing to the payment of EC subsidies for the export of food to underdeveloped countries which facilitated the export of live meat.  This has caused serious job losses in the meat processing industry.  To all Governments holding power in this State since it was established, except in the early years in Government of Fianna Fáil, the economic war and later the World War Two period, farming meant beef and milk, and little or nothing else.  This pattern meant that ever fewer people were employed on the land.  We had fewer people employed per acre than almost every country, including the USA.  There is a need to improve the quality of our research and education services to ensure that our agricultural food industry is properly developed and to enable us to take advantage of the land and ensure that a proper food industry is established to provide jobs for our people.  We are not convinced that a simple merger of AFT and ACOT will achieve this.</P>
    <P>Land is our greatest natural resource and should be a rich source of new jobs. In fact, our land is under-used and the potential job creation from it and from the food processing of industrial crops has been developed to a marginal degree only.  The present system of financial aid to farmers, combined with the existing structure of the Common Agricultural Policy, will not bring about a substantial increase in marketable output; nor will they ensure the most productive use of our land resources.  They have also failed miserably to develop a comprehensive system of industrial and marketing linkage between the producer on the land and the consumer of food products, either timber or horticultural.</P>
    <P>Rather than a simple merger between ACOT and AFT, the Government should have gone for a single Government agency which is vital for the development of the agricultural sector as a vital industrial sector in our economy and as one with enormous job creation potential.  That agency, the Agricultural <Col N="666" /> Development Authority, would have responsibility for stimulating investment, farm modernisation, diversification of production and the development of food processing, production and marketing. They would also take over the State's role in respect of land use policy, research, development and training.  In addition, the disease eradication scheme and the various grants for infrastructural development of the land would be administered in accordance with the priorities of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation are needed to finance farm food development on a planned basis.  The sugar company should revert to their sixties role of development of a serious food industry and An Foras Talúntais to scientific research and to use land to produce and improving the quality of soil and the use of fertilisers best suited to our conditions, rainfall and so on.  There should be a central planning and development unit to plan extensive development, the growing of industrial crops &mdash; flax, bamboo, New Zealand flax and other crops of like nature.  This section would also be responsible for the developments like the manufacture of leather and rawhides.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna should be used to develop forestry and industries related to forestry.  The manufacture of paper and other wood products should be their responsibility.  An advisory council should be part of a farming and food development authority and they should be made up of the farming organisations and trade unions, with members employed in farming and food processing.  It is unfortunate that there has not been recognition of the need for this more radical approach to agriculture by the Government, but we do not propose to stand in the way of the new body and we hope it will be successful.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific points I want to make in relation to this Bill and the body that it is proposing to set up. Like many others, we believe that a better name than Teagasc could be found for the new body.  That is not a word people find easy to use and even within the Irish language I am sure that it must <Col N="667" /> have been possible to come up with a better name, or initials.  I hope the Minister will look at this question.</P>
    <P>Why should the new body not be given an active role in the campaign to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis?  The campaign to end bovine TB has been one of the greatest scandals in the history of this State.  More than £1,000 million has been spent on it in the past 20 years.  Yet we are no nearer to the elimination of these diseases.  Vets have made huge sums out of the campaign.  Are we to continue to pay them indefinitely?  Why could not this Government provide a service for the testing of animals in opposition to the vets?  This could help to fund their other work intake area of research and education.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned at the terms of section 8 of the Bill which effectively gives the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance the power to decide the number of staff to be employed by the new body.  Flexibility in this area is desirable to enable the new body to adapt to changing circumstances. We have seen in the past few months how a similar section in the Ombudsman Act, 1980, has been used to deny the Ombudsman the staff he needs and, effectively, to undermine the office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned that there is no provision for the election of worker-directors to the board of the new body.  That is a retrograde step and is in conflict with the trend in other semi-State bodies.  It is a particularly astonishing decision, as there were two staff members on the board of ACOT who, by all accounts, made a contribution to the smooth running of that body.  For a body who will be involved in research and education, staff are their most important resource.  The establishment of Teagasc will involve major changes for those who have worked for ACOT and AFT and the involvement of staff representation at board level is essential.</P>
    <P>The reduction from £35 million to £20 million is not going to mean a massive reduction in the services and affect the farming and food industry generally. <Col N="668" /> However, I should like to give one or two examples of the very valuable work done by AFT at Moorepark, near Fermoy. Under the heading of animal health, research projects at Moorepark to identify sources of calf mortality resulted in improved management and disease control programmes which, through the reduction of brucellosis and other diseases, resulted in a national calf loss cut from 14 per cent to 10 per cent.  The direct annual saving is estimated to be in the region of £24 million, with an added value of £16 million.  The researchers tell us there is still room for major improvement.  The Moorepark Research Centre in Fermoy have developed a technique for incorporating dairy produce into a chocolate bar.  The bar centre contains other dairy products and flavourings and does not contain preservatives.  The biotechnology unit there, together with UCC, has developed a commercial starter system for cheese manufacture.  I could go on and on indicating the very valuable work being done.</P>
    <P>Now we find that the research staff group at AFT are very concerned about the effect of job reductions on the essential research programme in agriculture and food.  Some 250 staff, including over 20 per cent of the research staff, have applied for the Government's voluntary early retirement scheme to date and this was offered to all staff in AFT because of the 43 per cent cut in State funding. The loss of these staff will have serious effects on research and services to farmers.  Areas particularly badly hit are dairy cow, sheep and pig husbandry, animal breeding, feed and silage analysis, vegetable crops, soils, mastitis control and agricultural waste handling.  The Government's unplanned cuts in funding to AFT have threatened these essential research services to agriculture and food.  Unless the level of State funding for research is restored further damage can be expected.</P>
    <P>For every £100 of exports generated by manufacturing industry £54 is paid for raw material imports and £17 goes overseas by way of repatriation of profits leaving £29 net in the Irish economy.  On the other hand, for every £100 of agricultural <Col N="669" /> exports, imports account for £18 and profit repatriations are negligible, leaving over £80 in the economy.  With the input content and the profit repatriation of industrial exports taken into account, we see that the net export value of agriculture, which is £20.5 billion, is very close to that of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>If cuts in the agricultural support services of the scale proposed are implemented, the prospects of generating the additional wealth and maintaining employment levels in the food sector will be greatly diminished.  These cuts could be seen as a strategic error in the quest for national recovery.  To undermine the future technological base of the major wealth producing industry in the country does not make economic sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Johnstown Castle Centre is based in my own county of Wexford I would like to say a few words on this new Bill.  At the moment agriculture is at a crossroads.  We are in an era of quotas.  Generally farmers are confused.  They do not know what road to go down.  They do not know whether to stay with milk with all its problems or look at tillage which had many disastrous years. Too much of our land is in the hands of older farmers which is not in the best interests of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to amalgamate ACOT and AFT.  It is necessary at present that farmers get the best value for money and the Minister is going about it in the right way by co-ordinating the training and education facilities available to farmers in the future.  I would like to compliment the Minister and his junior Minister for taking this decision and for the work they have been doing in agriculture in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a report some time ago, the Cashman report, which outlined the role of agriculture, training and education in the future.  The Government decided that research and advisory services should be under the control of one authority which meant the coming together of AFT and ACOT.  There is very little disagreement about this decision.  This course of action <Col N="670" /> is long overdue and will result in a more cost effective service to farmers.</P>
    <P>I come from a county which is recognised as one of the most progressive farming counties in Ireland.  One could not say that the development of farming in the last nine or ten years has been in the best interest of that county or nationally. Too many farmers are in serious financial difficulty.  Too many have not developed along the lines they should have in relation to the overall development of the industry.  The importance of agriculture to Wexford can be best gauged by the fact that recent studies there have shown that 75 per cent of economic activity in that county is dependent on agriculture, horticulture and other related industries and services.  This shows that there is a staggering dependence on agriculture as a source of employment and earnings. Although the contribution of the industrial sector is important, a major contribution from the agricultural sector is essential if significant economic growth is to be achieved.  Our dependence on agriculture stems from the fact that the country's main natural resources are a soil and a climate well suited to the development of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The milk industry has developed over the past ten years.  Unfortunately, we are now in the era of quotas and farmers must be encouraged to diversify into other products related to milk.  This is where the new training and education authority must be to the forefront.  There are tremendous opportunities for farmers in related spin-off industries if they have the advice and facilities to diversify into those areas.</P>
    <P>In sheep and tillage there have been significant developments also.  Sheep is an area where there has been tremendous development in some counties in recent years.  There is a good subsidy scheme for farmers and generally farmers have increased sheep production significantly. This is also an area where diversification into other areas is possible.</P>
    <P>Training in agriculture is vital in providing the knowledge and skills required to operate the farm business efficiently in the future and to enable farmers to <Col N="671" /> maintain viability in a highly competitive environment.  The certificate in farming has been one of the major success stories of ACOT.  The introduction of this course ensured that agricultural education in Ireland was brought in line with that of our neighbours in Europe.  We also have the 180-hour courses and the socio-economic and enterprise courses.  They will continue to be administered by ACOT and are important for the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the area of marketing this country has fallen down.  ACOT has been striving to improve the marketing of agricultural produce by giving numerous demonstrations of quality requirements for specific markets, arranging meetings of growers and grower groups with wholesalers and retail chains and liaising closely with co-operative factories and other marketing outlets.  This was important and will continue to be important.  It is important that the resources available to the Minister continue to be placed directly in the area of marketing and research.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the overall value of horticulture continues to increase year by year.  I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Séamus Kirk, the Minister with responsibility for this sector, for the effort he has put into this whole area, for striving to encourage further development of the horticultural industry in which the main products are soft fruit, mushrooms and field vegetables.  There is ongoing development in beekeeping and polythene-type glasshouse production.  Recognising the value of horticulture to the national economy this Government, in the very short time they have been in office, have established a body called An Bord Glas to look after the needs of the industry at a time when the creation of jobs, particularly those based on native raw materials, is of paramount importance.  This is an opportune time to examine the prospects for further expansion in areas where no quota restrictions exist.</P>
    <P>Alternative land-based enterprises must be established if many of our existing <Col N="672" /> farms are to be maintained as viable economic entities.  The basic fabric of agriculture in this country has been the family farm.  Unfortunately, there are not enough opportunities at present on the family farm for the son or the daughter to remain there and earn a decent standard of living.  They are competing for the small number of jobs that are available on the market.  It is important that this new Authority will encourage farming families to diversify into other areas of production so as to ensure that the son or the daughter is able to make a living and to remain part and parcel of the family farm which has always been very much to the forefront in agricultural development.  It is imperative that every possibility be examined to sustain feasible employment on family farms.</P>
    <P>The soft fruit industry has developed almost unnoticeably and with very little help from Governments and Ministers over the years.  This industry is beginning to play a role of increasing importance in the provision of extra revenue for many people and particularly in the sunny south-east.  Wexford is regarded as the home of the strawberry industry.  For many farming families or even for the person with an acre at the back of the cottage the strawberry industry is very important for economic survival.  In an average season, approximately 3,000 tonnes of soft fruit are produced by 600 growers from a total planted area of about 1,000 acres.  Of the total output about £2 million worth, or 70 per cent, is exported to England.  Most of the output is supplied locally and a large amount of the money earned finds its way back to the producers and to the thousands of people employed in the harvesting of the soft fruit crops in that area.  It is estimated that pickers alone earn in the region of £500,000 annually and this is very important to the general welfare of families in the south-eastern region.  I have seen all my life in that area of the country many families going as a group to pick the strawberries, the blackcurrants, the raspberries and so on.  The money earned helps to pay for school books, school uniforms or the education of the children <Col N="673" /> for the following year.  The soft fruit industry has proved to be a very important and very worthwhile industry in that area.</P>
    <P>The soft fruit industry has developed in an orderly fashion in response to a market opportunity based on the contract system.  Unfortunately, the price of fruit sold for processing tends to be at the lower end of the scale because it is monopolised by a certain number of fruit importers or fruit salespersons on the other side of the water.  The Minister, Deputy Kirk, and the board should consider seriously the development of the soft fruit industry and should put more and more emphasis on securing lucrative market outlets for fresh fruit, yoghurt, frozen food products and so on.  There are tremendous opportunities in that whole area for development and, if developed properly, it will give an opportunity to small farmers in particular to earn a decent living for their families in the years ahead, particularly taking into account the problems in other areas of agriculture at present.</P>
    <P>The Clonroche Research Centre is of paramount importance to the development of the soft fruit industry.  I would encourage the Minister to ensure that this research centre continues to expand and develop.  I hope he does not intend, because of the streamlined developments of the new board, to close, or to undermine the importance of, Clonroche Research Centre in County Wexford. The centre is to the forefront in developing the fruit growing industry which is constantly changing.  There is a need for the advice and for the new fruits being developed there.  The research programme at Clonroche is of an applied nature yielding practical, pragmatic information.  There are no constraints whatsoever on the production of soft fruit or honey in the EC at present.  The market is buoyant and prospects for expansion are good for home markets and especially for export markets.  There is considerable potential for soft fruit as an alternative crop.  The expansion of this industry will depend totally on our ability to compete on export markets.  The <Col N="674" /> research and development programme at Clonroche is a key element in this regard and is of immediate and applied benefit in leading growers to more cost effective methods of production.  It is also the centre of the bee-keeping research and development industry.  That is an area where there are tremendous opportunities for the development of honey. As I said earlier, I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Clonroche centre is retained for future development.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect of the new Authority is to undertake and promote agricultural research and development.  I want to emphasise that findings and recommendations must be such that they can be assimilated into existing farming techniques in a practical and down-to-earth way.  In the introduction of new legislation affecting our most important industry, the needs of the people must be the prime consideration. It is fair to say that the provision of advisory services and research backup is a prerequisite for the continued expansion of the agricultural industry.  The value of such services is well appreciated by the farming community.  To give an example of the appreciation and the interests of the farming community in that area, when ACOT found it necessary to introduce charges last year in my own county, the farmers of County Wexford came forward and paid the moneys that were being sought for the advice that was being given.</P>
    <P>Whatever charges may be introduced for services in the future it will be important to ensure that the smaller farmers, or those in serious financial difficulties, who may be in need of advice, will receive it regardless of their ability to pay, in addition to their training and educational requirements.  These services should not be provided solely to those who can afford to pay for them.  The Minister would need to examine that aspect carefully.  I know of many small farmers who could well do with the advice and services to be made available by the new authority but who may not be in a position to pay for them.  It is important that the Minister <Col N="675" /> should cater for those people in a caring, compassionate way and in the best interests of agriculture generally.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle has been part and parcel of agricultural development and research here for many years.  It was presented to the nation in 1945 by the Laken family for use as an agricultural college and research centre.  I compliment the Minister on having included Johnstown Castle in the provisions of the Bill before us, clearly demonstrating its importance to the nation and farming generally.  We could not allow this debate to conclude without paying tribute to Dr. Tom Walshe who pioneered the way for the education and training of our young farmers.  He is a national figure, with a deep love of the land and its farmers.  It was he who foresaw the need for this nation to compete and take its place on the world stage in an agricultural sense. People generally and farmers especially should be thankful for the vision he showed in the development of agriculture over many decades.  It is only right that our appreciation of his work should be placed on record in this House.</P>
    <P>The areas of work in which Johnstown Castle has engaged have included grassland since over 90 per cent of our land is grassland, in turn providing 90 per cent of the feed for our dairy cows, sheep and beef cattle.  Therefore, it will be seen that Johnstown Castle should continue to be the main research centre for this commodity with the prime objective of maximising its contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>Each year our farmers spend £300 million approximately on lime, fertilisers and trace elements, which account for approximately one-sixth of their total farm inputs.  It is important that the comprehensive research programme in these essential nutrients be continued as a basis of optimising fertiliser use strategies.  The new authority should continue to play a watchdog role in preventing spurious fertiliser products coming onto the market.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle also has the only independent professional laboratory providing soil and plant analyses in this country. <Col N="676" />  Each year 100,000 soil and 30,000 plant samples are analysed, the major objectives being to provide a scientific basis for fertiliser-lime usage and a diagnostic service for crop-animal problems. This service should be continued.  If it is found necessary to impose charges so be it.</P>
    <P>There is much talk nowadays about pollution and criticism of farmers, contending that they are polluting our soil, rivers and waterways.  I believe it is very difficult for farmers to control this problem.  Because of the general nature of our land development I believe it is a problem which will be with us for some time to come.  It is only natural that we should endeavour to combat and/or control it. However, my sympathies are with the farmers in that endeavour because they have not the resources or financial support required to counteract the pollution of our waterways.  In recent times the Johnstown Castle centre has been helping to combat this problem in County Wexford and the country generally, playing an expanding role in the areas of control of soil and water pollution.  It is a service that should be used by the Departments of Energy, Agriculture and Food and others.  The amount of work undertaken in this respect by the staff of Johnstown Castle, on their own initiative, should be recognised by the Department, extended and developed and the necessary finances given to them to continue this most important work.  Undoubtedly it is the wish of us all to maintain this country free of pollution whether of the air, soil, or water.</P>
    <P>With the advent of agricultural quotas and surpluses it should be recognised that an increasing proportion of farms will sink below the viability threshold, leading to rural depopulation.  Here I am quoting from a report of An Foras Talúntais entitled <i>A Role for the Future: Johnstown Castle Centre Wexford</i> where it is said:</P>
    <P>Programmes are required to identify areas of the country at risk, and to devise measures to solve the problem. This requires the development of computerised <Col N="677" /> databases on physical resources (e.g. soil quality, climate, nature and intensity of land use, farm structure) and on economic/social aspects which are essential for integrated rural development and planning.</P>
    <P>This report says further:</P>
    <P>Under the Johnstown Castle Act (1945), Johnstown Castle estate is to be used for agricultural education and research.  In the new organisation Johnstown Castle's role in the whole area of agricultural education can be expanded.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this centre, which has provided tremendous service to farmers over many years, is developed and expanded further in their interests.</P>
    <P>I note from the provisions of the Bill that the Minister will make ministerial appointments to the new authority.  Like Deputy Ellis I hope such appointments will be made on candidates' merits only. In the past there have been too many people appointed to various boards by Ministers of different Governments, some of whom had not the ability to run a huckster's shop, let alone enhance the relevant boards or industries.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously such appointees to the new board, ensuring that they will have a valuable input.  It should be remembered that the new authority will be enormously important to the future development of our agriculture. Indeed, I contend that the whole role of agriculture in our economy in the future will be dependent on the expertise and efficiency of this authority.  I hope all parties will give the new authority the support they deserve.  It is my hope that they will receive support from the farming organisations and people generally which will ensure a more enhanced agricultural scene in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to preface my remarks by asking the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the House if agriculture has been written off.  The recent <Col N="678" /> severe cuts in the budgets of ACOT, who provide agricultural education and advice and An Foras Talúntais, who provide agricultural research, raise some major issues of public policy.  It must be asked if those responsible for this decision have seriously underestimated the contribution which agriculture can make to economic growth.  If this is so, it may be time to remind people of the contribution which the agriculture and food industry are making to the economy.</P>
      <P>The research and development programme of An Foras Talúntais has made a significant &mdash; indeed unique &mdash; contribution to the agriculture and food industry over the past three decades.  If these industries are to continue to make progress, to prosper and develop in these competitive and technological times, a strong, efficient public funded research and development organisation is essential.</P>
      <P>The proposed cuts of 43 per cent in State funding for An Foras Talúntais, coming on top of a 25 per cent cut in real terms since 1981, will directly counteract the planned development of agriculture and food as competitive, efficient and employment-generating industries.  There is no way that the services provided by An Foras Talúntais and their ongoing research and development programme can survive the proposed cuts.  The merger of An Foras Talúntais with the educational advisory agency, ACOT, will have serious detrimental effects on research and development unless specific provisions for the support of those activities are incorporated in the new organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does Ireland need research in the food and agriculture area?  It is clearly evident to everybody concerned that it is needed to provide the basic knowledge for Irish conditions, to solve the day-to-day problems of the industry and to take immediate steps to cope with future problems.  It is also clearly evident that we need an agency to evaluate the whole range of new techniques, products and ideas coming from home and abroad. Research and development will come <Col N="679" /> to an abrupt halt if the planned cuts of 43 per cent of State funding to research in agriculture goes ahead. The vital services will be disrupted, in fact many services will be unavailable and the end result will be less money in the pockets of the farmer and less revenue for the nation.  There will also be more unsolved problems in the agriculture and food areas.  It is clear that the work of An Foras Talúntais on a daily basis covers a wide area of problems, including the best silage system for wet land, the implications of farm practices for the environment, the best crop variety for different soils, the best milking machine liner to prevent mastitis in herds, the marketing and processing of new food pellets, thorough investigation to ascertain if residues of agri-chemicals persist in food and other various problems confronting the food industry today.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister with responsibility for food is in the House. He comes from my constituency; he is a hardworking Deputy who understands the problems confronting the farming organisations but he is completely hampered by the lack of funds.  He is in charge of a vital ministry but, alas, he has not received funding from the national purse to carry out the good work he should be doing.  Does the Minister understand that we live in an era in which information is the basis of power and money?  Does he realise that the major part of research helps to generate information and, even more important for a small country such as ours, to tap into the international pool of information that is available in the EC and other organisations throughout the world?  This can only be accomplished by research workers whose experience and training enables them to accumulate the vital information that is published daily world wide.  The fundamental task facing those engaged in research is a modern, efficient and competitive food industry trading in world markets and the creation of a production industry where efficiency and low cost production of a fixed quantity of product is the main goal.  If we do not follow a vigorous, forward looking <Col N="680" /> research programme on the lines to which I referred, we will, slowly but surely, stay behind our competitors in Europe and other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Everyone with a knowledge of agriculture realises the contribution of the research and development programme of An Foras Talúntais to the promotion of our agricultural products.  The effects of the work of AFT are clearly visible to farmers, co-operatives and everyone concerned with the food industry and the national economy.  The drastic cuts in State funding act against the interests, not only of the staff of An Foras Talúntais but of farmers, the food industry, consumer interests and, ultimately, the drive for national growth.  There is no doubt concerning the intentions of the Government in relation to agriculture.  The cut in the budget for ACOT and AFT for this year clearly shows that the Government have decided that agriculture is now treated as the Cinderella industry.  To reduce the staff of both organisations by 50 per cent, while demanding much smaller reductions in the numbers of civil servants employed in the Department of Agriculture and Food is a retrograde step as far as the agricultural industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>Every industry depends to a very large degree on a research and development programme.  Without it, there will be no growth in any industry.  Cutting research for agriculture is a criminal act.  It is clearly evident that AFT in the past 30 years have built up a tremendous reputation among research personnel in many countries.  In addition they have contributed to the vast improvement in Irish farm production and brought a great many farmers from a state of mediocrity to excellence in a short period of time. The advisory services will be remembered for having motivated farmers who were reluctant to develop their farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>Since the setting up of ACOT services have improved and a good proportion of farmers have willingly paid for services. That, in itself, amounts to a confirmation of appreciation of those services by the agricultural community.  However, it <Col N="681" /> appears that both organisations are to shed a large number of personnel.  They are the people who can encourage future development in our agricultural and food industries.  It is wrong that our farmers should be deprived of their services.  I should like to know who advised the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take this daft decision, and it is a daft decision. It is very difficult to understand the thinking behind that move.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was suggested that the Department of Agriculture wanted more than 1,000 civil servants to leave. It was said that the Department were completely overstaffed.  However, it is clearly evident that that request was not heeded and that the redundancies did not materialise.  We can assume that the power of the group involved has won the day over the farming community and that those non-productive people are to remain while the number of personnel of An Foras Talúntais and ACOT, who have played such a vital role in the formation of a sound agricultural policy and imparted such wonderful advice to our farmers, will be drastically reduced.  In many cases there will not be any personnel available to provide services for the farmers.</P>
    <P>In a Government where the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are former Ministers for Agriculture it is hard to understand the attitude to the problems of Irish farmers.  It would be interesting to know if the former president of the IFA was aware of these cuts when he welcomed the famous economic three year plan.  As a Deputy from an agricultural area I would be amazed to think that any person with responsibility for agriculture, and representing the views of the farming community, would agree to an economic plan that would have detrimental effects on agriculture, the country's most important industry.  The Government seem to have written agriculture out of their records.</P>
    <P>While the majority of people agree that spending had to be curtailed in a proper fashion they would all consider it madness to cut back on a productive enterprise such as agriculture.  Money invested <Col N="682" /> in agriculture will always be repaid, unlike the investment in well subsidised foreign industries.  We all know of the huge number of foreign industrialists who were attracted here in the past two decades and given lucrative handouts.  They were set up in different regions by the Industrial Development Authority but after a few years in existence they folded up and those at the head of the concerns left the country with stuffed wallets at the expense of Irish taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that every viable farm unit here &mdash; I expect the Minister of State will agree with me &mdash; is a miniature factory generating employment from the farmyard to the mart, to the creamery, to the processing food factory and to our meat factories.  Farms contribute in a big way towards creating jobs.  Why is the Minister so naive in his comments?  Why is he turning a blind eye to this valuable industry?  Why is he killing the goose that is laying the golden egg for our economy?  Surely it is time to call a halt to this policy of fiscal rectitude when it is affecting the nucleus of our economy by cutting finance for research and advice while, at the same time, keeping desk jobs?  That is not a sound policy for any Government to pursue.  Certainly, it is not a sound agricultural policy. It is well known that there is overstaffing in many State and semi-State institutions which is being dealt with gradually.  There is little necessity to have a multitude of supervisors if the number of workers is being cut drastically.</P>
    <P>If the number of staff of ACOT and AFT is being halved, surely the number of monitoring personnel in the Department should be reduced by 90 per cent. One must question, reluctantly, the judgment of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in this instance.  Creative people are being sacrificed while those who examine reports and check expenses are being retained.  It is clearly evident that the Minister does not have the power, the courage, the tenacity or the drive to outrival his Cabinet colleagues.  It is a sad day for farming when our Government take decisions that do not benefit agriculture.  One must look with appre- <Col N="683" /> hension to the future.  Is it the intention of the Minister to push back our farmers to a subsistence level of existence?  I should like to warn the Minister that growth in agriculture planned by the Government will not materialise if the proposed cuts in the budget for ACOT and AFT go ahead.</P>
    <P>It is a waste of time for Government Ministers to refer to the development of the food industry against EC competition if farmers do not efficiently produce quality goods with the help of ACOT advice and AFT research.  The proposed cuts, if implemented, will eventually leave a topheavy bureaucracy with little to do because farming activity will grind to a halt.  I should like to warn the Minister that if he proceeds along the lines he has advocated, his action will result in 55,000 farmers being wiped off the production line here.  It will be the greatest annihilation of any industry in western Europe. The Estimate cut advocated by the Minister is the worst blow yet to the farming organisations, coming at a time when farmers had no hesitation in paying their share as requested by the Minister, for the services of AFT and ACOT instructors.  I would remind the Minister that farmers have contributed almost £1 million in charges to ACOT during the past year.  What other industries outside agriculture are contributing to the national purse for advice?  If civil servants in their inner sanctums were as adaptable as ACOT have been they would be a very dynamic group, but the annihilation of ACOT and AFT is proof of their closed minds.  It is a very limited strategy.</P>
    <P>The results of this move will soon be clearly evident.  Some 50,000 farmers with potential for development will not survive without intensive advisory efforts by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Any cutback in advice and research will have a detrimental effect on production.  If we cannot gear up to meet the competition from the Danes, the Germans, the Dutch and the French, if we kill the goose that lays the golden egg, we will annihilate the farming population and sound the death knell of the economy.  Rural <Col N="684" /> development as a whole is at stake.  The famous <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provides nothing for agriculture.  I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government are aware of the unprecedented decline in farm output and its effects on the national economy and on employment.  It is evident that they are more interested in voluntary redundancies, wiping out jobs that will never again be filled rather than creating jobs for young people who are fast disappearing to the emigrant ships and airliners.  What future can our industries offer in terms of jobs?  Jobs are being vacated under the voluntary redundancy scheme by people who are being given golden handshakes and these jobs will never again be filled.  Surely that is not a policy for prosperity.  Surely it is not the correct policy for any Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food must recognise that agriculture is in a very serious position.  The Government have failed hopelessly to capture any sizeable amount of EC regional funds for rural development.  They are pussyfooting on the very important question of the reclassification of disadvantaged areas.  By European standards the greater part of this country could be classified as a disadvantaged area but the Minister has failed hopelessly to make a break-through in this important matter.  In fact the disadvantaged areas scheme is to be cut this year from £62.6 million to £58.2 million.  Is this progress?  If we are to convince our European counterparts of the necessity to enlarge the disadvantaged areas we must be seen to be putting our own house in order and to be meeting their contributions pound for pound.  We must let them know that in relation to the disadvantaged areas we are only skimming the surface.  I am amazed that the Minister is not taking steps to rectify the serious imbalance.</P>
    <P>The committees of agriculture are being abolished.  This is the first step in the Government's plan to silence the democratically-elected voice of Irish farmers and the voice of the farming organisations who have nominated members on those bodies.  They are being <Col N="685" /> told to shut up and that the committees are to be wiped out of existence.  I have had the privilege of being a member of a committee of agriculture for the past 25 years.  These committees were watchdogs for the Irish farmers whom they served with distinction over the decades.  They paved the way for the upsurge in the agriculture industry but now they are being annihilated by a native Irish Government whose dictatorial attitudes are clearly evident.  They want to silence the hard-won privilege of freedom of speech.  Is it the intention of the Taoiseach and the Government to wipe out any forum which has the privilege of criticising their policies?  Do they think they can run the agricultural industry from their cosy, plush, carpeted offices in Kildare Street?</P>
    <P>The committees of agriculture were the main cog in the wheel of success.  They expressed the views of the farming organisations and of the people at the grassroots who were born and bred on the land of Ireland.  Who better to advise the Minister than the people at the grassroots?  What is the Minister saving by this draconian action?  Does he realise that these committees constituted a valuable forum for farmers to air their grievances so that they could be passed on to the Minister's advisers and to the Minister himself for adjudication?  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and to the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, who is a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  He has been a former chairman, like myself, of that committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to have a re-assessment of the Minister's action in abolishing those committees.  If he proceeds with the AFT-ACOT merger, he should at least make provision for the county committee to meet monthly along the same lines as the committee of agriculture and thereby play their part in formulating and implementing the future agricultural policies of this country.  I appeal to the Minister not to silence the democratically elected voice of the Irish farmers.  Do not silence the democratic voice of the farming organisations through their members on those committees.  They have played an outstanding role in furthering agricultural development in Ireland.  There is much more they can do.  Their advice could be a good guideline for the present Minister or any future Minister who follows in his footsteps.  Do not close the door on this very valuable information.  The Minister should keep it open; he has the power and the ability to do so.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that research should be separated from education and advice. The arguments for this have strengthened in recent years with the increasing emphasis on food research and the addition of value beyond the farm gate. This was one of the decisions reached in the most recent analysis by the Cashman committee in 1986.  Whatever new organisation is created to service agriculture and food, they must recognise the different natures of research, education and advice.  The independent thinking that categorises research must be fairly and squarely secured by legislation similar to that in the AFT Act of 1958, guaranteeing independence to initiate, conduct and report research, a separate budget for research and staff representation on the board of the new organisation.  There is an overwhelming call in the agricultural world for a revaluation of the proposed cuts and for the implementation of proper structures for research in a merged body if we are to have development and job creation in our main industry &mdash; that is agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be opportune for me to remind the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="687" /> and Food and the House of the real value of our agricultural industry.  Agriculture is by far our single most important industry in terms of the share of national income, exports and employment which it generates.  Exports play a vital role in paying for essential imports and earning foreign currency needed to repay our massive foreign debt.  The gross value of visible exports increased from £4.1 billion in 1980 to £9.5 billion in 1986.  Over £7 billion comes from the so-called modern industries, many of which are attracted by our low tax regime for manufacturing industry.  The remaining £2.5 billion comes from our agricultural exports.  The crucial question is, what is the relative contribution to the economy of the £2.5 billion worth of agricultural exports compared to the £7 billion of industrial exports?</P>
    <P>In assessing the real value of exports to the economy, account must be taken of the import content and the profit repatriation associated with exports.  The import content of many of the modern industries is substantial.  An IDA study on manufacturing industry in Ireland a few years ago showed that the Irish raw materials used as a proportion of total raw materials amounted to 33 per cent for chemicals, 17 per cent for electronics and 28 per cent for manufacturing industry.  By contrast, the food industry sourced 87 per cent of its raw materials domestically.  Profit repatriation from the modern industries was £1.3 billion in 1986 or 17 per cent of the total value of the exports from these industries.  High profit levels are being earned by a limited number of modern industries but some 75 per cent to 80 per cent of these profits are being repatriated to parent companies overseas.</P>
    <P>For every £100 of exports generated by the manufacturing industry, £54 is paid for raw material imports, £17 goes overseas by way of profit repatriation leaving £29 in the Irish economy.  For every £100 of agricultural exports, imports account for £18 and profit repatriation is negligible leaving over £80 to the economy of this country.  Surely, it is clearly evident <Col N="688" /> to the Ministers concerned if there is to be a future for the economy it must come from a vibrant, sound, economic agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>When the import content and profit repatriation of industrial exports are taken into account, it shows that the net export value of agriculture is £2.5 billion and the net export value of industrial exports is £2.28 billion.  Clearly it is the total spending power generated by an industry or firm which determines its value to the economy.  In this regard the IDA study referred to above shows that for 1983 the agricultural and food industry accounted for more spending power than the rest of the manufacturing industry.  The figure for the food industry was £75,000 compared to chemicals £32,000, electronics £22,000 and mechanical engineering £16,000.</P>
    <P>Some of the modern industries with the most spectacular export performance contribute rather less than is realised to overall employment.  For example, the office machine industry increased the value of its exports from about £250 million in 1980 to over £1.8 billion in 1986 and during the same period employment increased by just 2,000 to reach 6,400 in 1986.  In contrast, and this is very important, the agricultural and food industry with exports of £2.5 billion in 1985 provided employment for 214,000 people directly.  Surely, that is clear evidence of the value of the agricultural industry to this country.  The Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognised the continued importance of the agricultural and food sector to the economy.  The target of ACOT and AFT provides an opportunity to redirect agricultural research and advisory programmes so as to maximise their contribution to that recovery. However, this opportunity will be realised only if the merger is implemented in a carefully planned manner and due recognition is given to the financial needs of the new organisation &mdash; and not by the reduction of £20 million in the Estimates and in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>If the agricultural industry is to make <Col N="689" /> its maximum contribution to economic recovery, certain key developments must take place.  The most important of these are, selective expansion of the beef, sheep and horticultural sectors, a major effort to improve product quality and a serious commitment to rural development programmes.  The major policy facing Irish agriculture is the need to increase our beef cow herd.  If we do not succeed in increasing that, we will fail dismally in giving our national economy the injection it needs.</P>
    <P>Because of our reduced milk quota the number of dairy cows is expected to fall by at least 250,000 over the next couple of years.  If we do not replace them with beef cows we will end up with underutilised grazing land and idle meat plants, that is, if the Minister for Agriculture and Food does not heed the warning I am giving him here tonight.  In a recent AFT projection it is stated that the national cow herd could be increased to over 2 million by 1991 if proper consideration were given to this problem.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture and Food is genuine in his attempts to revitalise the agricultural industry let me make this appeal to him: abolish the off-farm income limit in the cattle headage and beef cow schemes which are operating in the disadvantaged areas.  Let those road workers, fishermen and others who own small farms throughout the west develop those farms to the best of their ability along the lines I have advocated.  If their incomes go over the limit, do away with the off-farm income limit and instead give them the opportunity to play their part in making those small farms viable which would help them to rear their families in rural areas where they are fast disappearing.</P>
    <P>It is a well known fact that the small farmer will be an extinct species in a few years time if the Minister for Agriculture and Food does not take steps to safeguard this very important element of Irish society.  It is also a well known fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Food reduced the off-farm income limit from £6,400 to £5,700 this year.  In other words, any farmer who has an off-farm <Col N="690" /> income of £5,700 will not be able to avail of the cattle headage or beef cow schemes.  It is actually a question of cutting a twig to beat yourself.  The Minister of State should convey this message to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Food acts as I have suggested he will give an incentive to the agricultural community to bring up the cow herd numbers.  If we do not do so now we are bound for a downward trade.  If we continue to sell off our milk cows because of over-production of milk it is clearly evident that the day will not be too far away when we will have to import cattle from Great Britain and the Continent to keep our meat factories going.</P>
    <P>Already, moves are afoot to import calves into the country and the Minister for Agriculture and Food is well aware of this fact.  Yet, he sits idly by and takes no steps whatever to rectify the serious anomaly which exists today.  If positive measures are not taken, the projected cowherd number for next year is 1.8 million.  The difference in national income between the two scenarios is almost £200 million per annum.  It is also the difference between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers remaining viable or slipping into the social welfare net.  In addition, the 1,000 extra jobs projected by the IDA for the beef industry over the 1988-92 period will not be realised.</P>
    <P>The further inevitable restrictions on output due to the CAP cutbacks and the securing of the maximum unit price through quality production will become of major importance.  Quality food production has to start on the farm and there is still a great need for improvement at this level.  Much of the investment in the facilities for food processing has been made already.  What is now needed in order to fully capitalise on this investment is a more market-led approach.  This should dictate the actions of farmers, processors and those marketing the products and should involve better communication between the different sectors in the food marketing chain.  Producer groups also have an important role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> The pay-off for achieving success in these various areas will be high.  Agricultural output could be £300 million per annum higher if such policy initiatives were taken and this money would be spent principally in the country.  It would have a highly beneficial effect on the gross national product.  Thus, far from being the Cinderella industry of the economy, the food industry would be able to give far higher and faster returns than any of the other economic sectors.  If we get an adequate response it will be translated into real wealth and jobs in the country. If cuts in the agricultural support services on the scale proposed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food are implemented, the prospect of generating additional wealth and maintaining employment levels in the food sector will be greatly diminished.  These cuts could be seen as a strategic error in the quest for national recovery.</P>
    <P>To undermine the future technological base of the major wealth producing industry in the country does not make commonsense to me.  As a Deputy who was born on a small mountain farm in south-west Cork, and I am proud to say that I still own that farm, I know only too well the hardships which farmers have to undergo in an effort to survive on such small farms.  I know only too well the vital role which these small farmers are playing in the economy today.  I know only too well how they utilise every foot and yard of ground which is available to them.  They are not like their rich neighbours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Farmers with very small incomes will be squeezed out because there will be a lack of agricultural research and advice available to them.  I have said it before and I will repeat it, I dislike the move to do away with the small man, especially the small farmer.  Why should small dairy farmers be subject to the same reduction in their milk quotas as the large farmer with a 250,000 gallon quota?  Everybody knows it is uneconomic for any dairy farmer to survive &mdash; and nobody knows this better than the Minister &mdash; on a quota of less than 30,000 gallons.  It is hypocrisy of the highest order to ask a farmer with a quota under 30,000 gallons to reduce output at the same rate as the farmer with a milk quota of 250,000 gallons.  Is there justice in that for the man who already has an uneconomic quota, who can hardly afford a pair of shoes or clothes for his children?  Is it right to ask that man to tighten his belt further?  Do the Ministers concerned want to squeeze him out of existence, because that is what they are doing as, in one case, Minister for Agriculture and Food and in the other, as Minister with responsibility for food?  If the Minister wants to make cuts in milk quotas and to create a national reserve, he should start at the top and leave the man with the uneconomic quota alone. Give him an opportunity to rear his family.  We were not all fortunate enough to be born ranchers.  We were not all fortunate enough to have been born into families with large farms and quotas of 250,000 gallons.</P>

Everybody knows when we created the health boards we created monsters which are costing the country countless millions of pounds.  The same thing will happen with the amalgamation of AFT and ACOT.  Do not let any Minister be foolish enough to amalgamate those two bodies with the Farm Development Service.  It is hard enough to get the farm development grants from the Department at the moment because there is up to nine months delay in the payment of these grants.  The farmers are told these grants will be paid when it is practical to do so.  I would like the Minister to spell out the meaning of the word &ldquo;practical&rdquo; as far as the payment of farm grants is concerned.  He must realise that farmers have to pay the contractors when work is completed.  He has to pay for material used in farm buildings but the Department tell the farmer the grant will be paid when it is practical to do so. These delays can be for nine, ten and even 12 months.</P>

      <P>With this proposed amalgamation we will be losing some of the best brains in agriculture.  The Minister knows that in the Moorepark Institute, a guiding light for agriculture, we are losing some of the best brains in agriculture today.  I believe more than 250 of these officers are seeking voluntary redundancies.  Why? Because of the unsecured tenure of office and the amalgamation of jobs as a result of the merger.  This means the agricultural industry will be much poorer and the farmers will miss the advice and guidance they have received to date.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister with responsibility for food to ensure that the best brains in those bodies are retained at all costs.  I want him to ensure that the provision of adequate funding for Darrara Agricultural College in my constituency is not impeded and that that college will continue to help young farmers play their part in the economic life of this country. Any reduction in the number of staff employed in the agricultural colleges would be a stunning blow to the agricultural industry.  When restoring the farm installation grants the Minister should reduce the qualifying criteria to 0.50 man working weeks to ensure that the people who can benefit most from that scheme will avail of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Justice, Environment and Labour to jointly set a timetable of actions to reduce insurance costs over the next eighteen months and in the light of these actions to obtain the agreement of the insurance companies to appropriate reductions in the insurance premia that would otherwise be charged to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael are deeply concerned at the high cost of insurance in Ireland.  It is a heavy burden for motorists, especially for young drivers.  It is even more serious for employment.  Many firms find the cost of <Col N="696" /> employers' and public liability insurance prohibitive.  It affects their prospects for survival.</P>
    <P>Insurance costs are influenced by a range of factors which are the responsibility of many Government Departments and agencies. This dispersion is part of the problem.  Our motion seeks an agreed action plan which will force them all to give the reduction of insurance costs a high priority.  Our motion also insists that the insurance companies respond to the improved environment by definite reductions in the premia charged.</P>
    <P>The features in the insurance industry that need to be addressed fall into a number of categories: (i) Cost; (ii) Availability; (iii) Competition; (iv) Safe Practice.  There are many things that have contributed to the high and escalating costs of insurance in Ireland.  For example: The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is paying out £18 million &mdash; equivalent to £20 on the typical insured driver &mdash; in personal injury claims to the victims of uninsured drivers.  It is claimed that up to 20-25 per cent of drivers are uninsured.  The MIBI payments cover only part of the costs of uninsured driving.  The cost of damage to property has to be met from insurance premia, and many innocent victims suffer loss with no compensation.</P>
    <P>The legal costs of wrangling over liability absorb 20 per cent of the total claims paid out by insurance companies, which is never received by the victims being compensated.</P>
    <P>Vehicle defects caused or contributed to one in 12 motor accidents.  An exercise by the Garda in 1986 checking vehicles over four days, identified 261 vehicle defects.  Of these, 192 drivers carried out the necessary repairs on request.</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance is contributed to by the fact that the public have become &ldquo;claim conscious&rdquo;.  We are told that the frequency of whiplash claims in Ireland exceeds that in the UK several times over.  The uncompetitive state of the insurance industry is also pushing up costs.  The court settlements for injuries have been very high.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Another aspect of the insurance industry which should be addressed is availability.  Difficulty in getting insurance at any sort of bearable cost is becoming very common.  In some businesses it is virtually impossible for employers to get cover for employers' liability and public liability. More and more employers are being forced to operate without any insurance. This is a frightening development, when one considers the plight of victims of industrial accidents.  There is no agreement with the insurance industry for dealing with &ldquo;declined cases&rdquo; for employers' insurance.</P>
    <P>Voluntary and sports organisations have found that it is impossible to proceed with some of their normal events because the terms recently quoted for insurance cover are entirely beyond what a non-profitmaking body could face.  The &ldquo;declined cases&rdquo; agreement with motor insurers has coped with many of the problems of availability of insurance for drivers.  However, the system is too bureaucratic and it is often difficult for drivers to get the five written refusals from companies which is usually required.  This needs to be streamlined. Lack of competition is clearly contributing to high costs of motor and other insurance.  The growth in management expenses has averaged over 20 per cent per annum in recent years, about 1.75 times the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>There is huge variation in efficiency within the industry.  Among the large motor insurers, general expenses range from 8 per cent to 20 per cent of gross premium income &mdash; equivalent to a range from £25 to £60 on a typical policy.  This means some companies are unprepared for competition, and their clients are bearing excessive costs.  Management expenses of insurers in the UK are less than two-thirds of those in Ireland.  That indicates inefficiency and lack of competition in the Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Government have probably been over-generous to the industry in the length of time they have negotiated for transition to full freedom of competition in this area.  The industry might have <Col N="698" /> been asked, and should have been asked, to bear full EC competition at an earlier date.  I recognise the Government went to great efforts to protect the insurers from EC competition in this regard but I wonder if the insurers are responding in kind to the Government's concern and if they are maintaining management expenses that are above the norm.  If they are not responding by offering the type of recognition, for instance, to young drivers with a safe driving record, do they deserve the protection of the Government from the full rigours of EC competition law?  After all, EC law is there only to protect the consumer.  There is a direct conflict of interest between the consumer here and the insurer here. Bringing in foreign competition will tend to reduce the cost to the consumer.  One wonders about the wisdom of the decision taken by the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>Along with improved efficiency, there is also a need for better services to the customer.  There are many areas for improvement.  There should be much more access for the consumer to information about the term of his policy, the structure of premiums and the level of commission and service charges so that the consumer can shop around freely.  A code of practice should be introduced for brokers and agents to protect consumers from unfair selling practices; the industry should appoint an insurance ombudsman, to provide a simple mechanism for settling complaints by clients about their treatment by insurers, a scheme that has been both cheap and highly effective in the UK; and insurance practices that unfairly victimise particular groups, for example, disabled drivers still face a 10 per cent loading that has no actuarial foundation whatever.  Even more unjust, victims of untraced drivers receive much lower compensation for personal injury than do victims of uninsured drivers, yet the injury has been the same.  This practice has no logical foundation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael favour the legislation to abolish juries in civil actions.  They urge the Government to treat this legislation as a high priority and to have it in law immediately.  When we published our <Col N="699" /> insurance discussion document last August there was a spate of commentary and media interviews from the Minister of State and other Government spokesmen promising all sorts of action about the insurance industry.  I have no doubt about the Minister's good intentions, but he might recognise that announcing something does not make it happen.  You can announce something as often as you like but it has not actually happened until it happens.  In the case of getting rid of juries in civil actions that Bill is stalled at Committee Stage still and is no further on than it was when the Minister of State made so much about it in the way of the Fine Gael discussion document being published.</P>
    <P>The operation of a new system in regard to jury trials should be closely monitored so as to ensure that it does achieve the promised cost savings, and that these are passed on in the form of reduced premia.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also favour further reforms, within the courts system, which would help reduce insurance costs.  These include: the introduction of a book of quantum of damages to guide judges in making awards and to standardise the level of awards.  This would reduce the recourse to court hearings as levels of damages likely to be obtained would be determinable in advance.  One must recognise that damages in a particular case will vary.  The loss of a limb or a faculty will have different effects on different people depending on their work.  There should be regular conferences of judges to assist in achieving uniformity of treatment of compensation claims.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would also wish to see all restrictive rules in regard to legal representation removed if these have the effect of unjustifiably increasing costs to clients.  The two senior rule is not the only instance of restrictive practices in the legal profession.  I look forward to the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the matter, which I commissioned as Minister.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that there is scope <Col N="700" /> for more preliminary meetings, with or without legal representation, of parties involved in insurance claims to reduce the frequency of recourse to court action. A forum should be established, with an independent chairman, by the insurance companies themselves to exploit such opportunities for preliminary meetings with a view to eliminating litigation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I favour the introduction of formal pre-trial procedures to reduce the costs arising at court hearings themselves.  The changes here could be along the following lines.  The Master of the High Court should be mandated to introduce a system of pre-trial directions on the following matters: (1) the introduction of certain routine evidence, such as Garda statements and sketch plans; (2) agreement on medical, actuarial, engineering and other reports so as to crystalise any area of non-agreement; (3) furnishing and/or exchange of certain witness statements in advance similar to that which applies under section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984; (4) agreement on maps and photographs and certain exhibits and their admission in evidence.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in recent times and on an informal basis, improvements in practice in these matters have been effected.  The Supreme Court itself has indicated that account should be taken of failure to exchange information when cases do come to a hearing.  An additional number of High Court judges should be appointed in order to eliminate any delays in hearing cases.  The jurisdiction of lower courts should be increased in order to arrange for the settlement of cases in a less costly fashion in those courts rather than in the higher courts. The District Court limit should be increased from £2,500 to £5,000 and the Circuit Court limit from £15,000 to £30,000.</P>
    <P>Damages awarded in cases of motor and employers' liability should be reduced in respect of the amount of any other compensation being paid to the victim, on the basis of the accident, either under statutory social insurance schemes or sick pay schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> The courts should also have the option of awarding annuities rather than lump sum damages to victims.  This might well be a more appropriate form of compensation for many victims, while limiting benefits to victims and/or to immediate dependants which does not necessarily happen in the case of a lump sum.  I would like to mention at this stage that I propose to allocate the last ten minutes of my time to Deputy Ivan Yates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of enforcement of safety regulations, and their scope, leaves much to be desired.  Fine Gael believe that industrial safety law should be extended to all places of employment, rather than confined to about 20 per cent of these places, as at the moment.  Fine Gael believe that the insurance industry should be prepared to contribute towards the cost of additional inspectors to ensure adequate enforcement of this legislation.  We also believe that where an employer has introduced an improved system of safety procedures within his premises there should be an automatic right to a discount from the insurance company reflecting this improved safety prospect.  It is not acceptable that the insurance company should wait for the actual claim record to show a decline before financially recognising the adoption of new, improved safety procedures in a place of work. Without an up-front financial incentive many employers will fail to spend money on better safety procedures and ultimately they rather than the insurance industry will be the losers from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that there are many actions that can be taken to improve road safety.  Road accidents are themselves the immediate cause of high motor insurance premia.  The high road accident record of younger drivers, in particular, is the reason for especially high insurance premia for young drivers.  Any action taken to improve road safety, therefore, <Col N="702" /> either for the generality of drivers or for young drivers in particular, will result in reduced insurance premia for motorists, both young and old.</P>
    <P>The following measures should be taken to improve road safety, and thereby reduce insurance claims: (a) The introduction of a &ldquo;restricted driving&rdquo; system, similar to that which operates in Northern Ireland.  Under such a system drivers would have certain restrictions placed on their ability to drive for the first two years after they have qualified for a full licence. Restrictions might include speed of driving, driving at peak accident hours, and a more strict blood alcohol level; (b) There should be a requirement to undertake &ldquo;off the road&rdquo; lessons at a registered driving school before issuance of even a provisional licence.  At the moment people can obtain a provisional licence without any lessons whatever and have relative freedom to go on to the road after obtaining such a licence.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the system of enforcement of road safety rules can be improved also by: (1) introducing on the spot fines for non-use of safety belts, and driving vehicles which have obvious dangerous faults; (2) extending to traffic wardens the power to detect incidents of obvious vehicle faults in vehicles parked in a traffic control zone; (3) introducing a system whereby motor cars belonging to uninsured drivers could be impounded.  This is a substitute for the imposition of fines, many of which have proved extremely difficult and costly to collect.  Mandatory disqualification from driving, save in very special circumstances, for a certain period might also be considered as a penalty for driving without insurance; (4) the introduction of a points system on people's driving licences whereby they would lose points as a result of a series of minor traffic infractions; an accumulation of minor traffic infractions, over a period, if it exceeded a certain amount, could therefore lead to the loss of a driving licence; (5) the introduction of automatic retesting of drivers after conviction for drunken or dangerous driving before they are <Col N="703" /> entitled to resume driving with a full driving licence; (6) a concerted Garda enforcement and TV advertising campaign should be initiated to stamp out uninsured driving.  Public attitudes to uninsured driving need to be changed.  A concerted campaign, over a set period, combining advertising and enforcement is likely to have the maximum effect in permanently changing public attitudes and practice.</P>
    <P>These improvements may sound somewhat radical, but it is fair to say that road safety lapses are the cause firstly of an immense number of deaths and injuries. Secondly, they are the cause of high motor insurance premia.  Any measures, however radical, that improve road safety are going to be reflected very quickly, I hope, in reduced motor insurance premia, hence the need to think about some of the rather radical measures I have proposed just now.  The insurance industry must give immediate financial recognition, in the form of reduced insurance premia, to those who adopt good safety practices.  It cannot wait for the claims record to improve before granting such recognition; otherwise the measures will never be adopted.</P>
    <P>The Government should put pressure on the insurance industry to adopt the following measures in this regard.  First, they should introduce a system of no claim bonuses for employers liability and public liability insurance which does not exist at present.  Secondly, they should introduce an &ldquo;excess claims scheme&rdquo; under which those being insured could obtain a lower premium if they undertook, under the terms of the insurance contract, to meet out of their own pocket claims below a certain amount without recourse to the insurance policy.  Thirdly, where a firm undertake agreed safety procedures within their premises they should be given the automatic right to a reduced premium.  Fourthly, there should be a discount of 5 per cent per year for young drivers who have accident free driving under the insurance policy of their parents or other adult relative.  Fifthly, there should be a 20 per cent discount on <Col N="704" /> the insurance premium for young drivers who have undertaken an advanced driving test.  Sixthly, where older cars have been subjected to a specialised MOT type test, there should be a discount on the premium that would otherwise be charged for older cars, if such a charge is made.</P>
    <P>In order to eliminate the possibility of multiple claims in respect of the same injury, the insurance industry should compile a central computerised register of individuals and motor vehicles in respect of which claims have been granted.  There is evidence that a number of people are claiming to have received the same injury a number of times and they are, because of the lack of ability to trace the different claims in respect of different accidents, paid more than once in respect of the same accident.  It is the same injury even though they claim it was caused on a number of occasions.  There should also be a liaison in this regard between the insurance industry and the Department of Social Welfare to eliminate the possibility of multiple claims.</P>
    <P>The cost of public liability insurance has been increased in recent times because the law has developed in a way that widens the grounds on which damages can be claimed against property holders where an outsider has entered on their premises and suffered an accident. Increasingly, property holders can suffer claims against them even though they have no culpability or negligence.  Fine Gael suggest that the law be amended and clarified so that such claims would be reduced, if not eliminated, to take account of the following factors: first, whether the owner had consented to the presence of the outsider on his premises or to the activities being undertaken there which led to the accident and, secondly, that the claim should be reduced in respect of any negligence on the part of the outsider which contributed to the accident.  This seems to be common sense but does not seem to be the law at present.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the adoption of the measures I have outlined in this speech would reduce insurance premia <Col N="705" /> considerably.  The following are examples of the type of cost reductions which would be likely to follow: first, the abolition of the three counsel practice which could save 2 per cent of total claims costs, or £5 million in 1987 prices; secondly, less recourse to expensive court actions and greater consistency in awards which could save at least 5 per cent in total claims costs, or £12 million in 1987 prices; thirdly, the reduction in Irish management expenses to UK levels which would save £15 million in 1987 prices &mdash; that is the insurance industry's contribution &mdash; and, fourthly, if even a modest 5 per cent reduction in road accidents occurred as a result of the series of measures I have outlined, £12 million savings in claims at 1987 prices would be achieved.  Lastly, there would be likely to be a reduction in uninsured driving from its present estimated level of 20 per cent to 5 per cent, at least thereby saving £20 million.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, the measures I have proposed would knock £65 million off motor premiums, a saving of 20 per cent.  This would be worth £80 on a typical motor insurance premium.  Besides this benefit of cash in the pocket, a fairer system of insurance would be achieved and the harrowing pain and suffering of victims of motor accidents would be reduced.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that this Dáil motion is directed both at the Government and the insurance companies.  To the Government I say: &ldquo;I know that over the past 12 months you have given repeated lip service to measures of the kind advocated in this speech.  It is time to stop talking and actually implement them.&rdquo;  To the insurance companies I say: &ldquo;Make sure that the measures you have sought, and which this motion advocates, actually result in real reductions in premia to the public.&rdquo;  If the insurance companies simply absorb all of these measures and say &ldquo;Thank you very much&rdquo; but do not give any tangible and visible recognition of the effect of these measures in the form of reduced premia then the credibility of this entire exercise will be diminished.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity <Col N="706" /> of bringing forward in the House these detailed proposals for the reduction in insurance costs.  I think the House will agree that my proposals represent a comprehensive package to deal with this problem.  They require action by the Department of Justice in regard to court costs, action by the Department of the Environment in regard to road safety, action by the Department of Labour in regard to industrial safety and action by the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to ensuring that the insurance companies pass these benefits on to the consumer.  I think it is fair to say that this will happen only if the reduction in insurance costs is put on the top of the agenda of the Ministers responsible for each of those Departments.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, or his Minister of State, who are regularly wheeled out at insurance functions and other functions when insurance costs are discussed to talk about the subject have an undoubted political interest in ensuring a reduction in insurance premia.  Nobody doubts their interest in the matter.  The problem is getting the other Departments who have other priorities, whether it be housing in the case of the Department of the Environment, labour relations, law or employment in the case of the Department of Labour or security in the case of the Department of Justice, to give the same priority to the reduction of insurance costs.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the House should pass the motion before it tonight because it will be saying thereby to all Government Departments involved &mdash; and I hope Ministers from other Departments will contribute to this debate, other than the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan &mdash;&ldquo;put this item on the top of your agenda, have all of the measures implemented within the next 18 months and insist that the insurance companies pass on the benefits in reduced premia&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Bruton for having allocated some of his time to me.  There is no doubt that <Col N="707" /> in his speech, Deputy Bruton put forward the most comprehensive series of specific recommendations to reduce insurance premiums in this country that any political party had previously put forward. If the Minister or the Government simply implemented them, we would be able to move away from this crisis &mdash; because this problem is a crisis.</P>
      <P>Even a summary look at the statistics of the Irish insurance industry will show the type of problem we are dealing with.  I will quote three simple figures.  Domestic gross premium income in Ireland went up from £377 million in 1980 to £897 million in 1986, that is, from under £400 million to almost £900 million in the space of six years.  Over the same period from 1981, claims outstanding in 1980 funded by Irish insurance were £11.5 million and at the end of 1986 they were £55.5 million.  Each year they have shown a staggering increase.  The third statistic relates to the losses in the insurance sector.  Property insurance and liability insurance have shown a steady loss over that period, reaching a high in 1983 of £97.1 million.</P>
      <P>Of course, the consequences of this crisis are very clear.  People in business cannot get insurance cover.  Young people are finding it impossible to get a reasonable quotation for motor insurance.  In the inner city areas we have restricted cover, or cover is refused because of the high level of crime.  There is no doubt that, in trying to expand and maintain employment, employers are having huge difficulties with employers' liability insurance.  Many employees went to work today who do not have insurance cover in the event of an accident, simply because it is prohibitively expensive.  We have these problems, particularly in the construction industry.  I know that Wexford County Council, for the first time this year in their Estimates, decided to cover their own insurance up to a certain level because they could not afford to pay the premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this problem is varied. We have seen a huge explosion in the level of claims.  For example, employers' liability claims shot up 35 per cent <Col N="708" /> between 1979 and 1983.  At the same time the workforce was reduced by 20,000.  I do not believe that the work place in Ireland was more unsafe to such a level over that period.  However, there is no doubt that people are more claims conscious and there is a tendency to move to what is perceived as the gravy train of claims.  The level and volume of claims are a major problem.  Another major problem is the insurance industry itself. In 1976 with the EC Non-Life Establishment Directive, 18 foreign insurance companies came into Ireland.  There was very intensive competition.  They did not get their portfolios in order and then they found they have huge losses because they had undercut each other excessively.  We saw the collapse of ICI and PMPA subsequently as a result of these heavy losses. The insurance industry have a lot to answer for in the way they tried to deal with the situation in the late seventies.</P>
    <P>The solution is quite clear cut and Deputy Bruton has outlined in some detail what needs to be done.  I would like to reiterate some of the points he raised.  There is no doubt that somewhere between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the cost of claims paid out by insurance companies in this country goes on legal expenses despite the fact that only 4 per cent of claims are actually heard in court. Why are the legal costs so high?  It is because we have the most archaic, inefficient, slow and out-dated courts and settlement system in Europe.</P>
    <P>In the Joint Committee on Small Businesses &mdash; and this is not a point that Fine Gael have emphasised because it is a more long term point &mdash; we studied most of the developed countries in the western world and found in relation to the settlement of employers' liability claims that there was compulsory insurance for employers' liability and the insurance schemes were either funded through the State or by a private insurance company and were run on a no-faults basis.  In other words, if someone fell off a ladder and broke his neck or arm, it did not matter whose fault it was and he drew compensation for that injury.  In almost <Col N="709" /> all countries compensation levels are set by a tribunal or on a workman's compensation system as it is commonly called.  The advantages of that system are that you can say to the unions and those at work that everybody will be covered and you can say to the employers they will have a reasonable, quick, fair and cheap settlement that will be fair to all.  I believe that would be equitable to all employees and would provide adjustable premiums for higher risk categories of employment and would, more essentially, widen the insurance pool of premium income to ensure that the burden is spread across the whole sector.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in the long term the whole area of international developments &mdash; and I point in particular to the Swedish no-faults system of worker compensation &mdash; is something we will have to look at. If increases in premiums for employers' liability insurance go unchecked, there will be a further cost in jobs.  As we have seen, the priority in industry today is how to reduce the labour force and to get labour costs down.  This is one of the reasons, together with employers' PRSI, why people cannot afford to bear this continuing overhead.</P>
    <P>Juries are undoubtedly erratic.  Jury cases in terms of civil liability actions take longer and there is no doubt that the British system, the Kemp and Kemp settlement system where it is so much for an arm and so much for a leg and where there is a set precedent for a certain type of claim, is a much better system.  A judge sitting alone would surely give far greater uniformity or greater consistency.  As Deputy Bruton outlined in his speech this would result in a decrease in the volume payment of claims.  I think it would be essentially fairer.  Because of the highest common denominator factor, if someone gets a very big claim from a jury, all out of court settlements are based on that claim.  This involves a cost to the insured community who are paying for that particular claim and it sets a norm which can be unduly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a commitment tonight as to when the Courts Bill abolishing juries in civil liability High <Col N="710" /> Court cases will be ready.  I know it is a matter for the Minister for Justice but in the Joint Committee on Small Businesses one of the problems we found was that everybody blamed and referred things to everybody else and nobody said he would take responsibility for this or would ensure that the Government would act in one direction to get all the different segments of legislation together.  I hope the Minister will give a specific commitment to deal with that point.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Bar Council in conjunction with the Government to abolish the three counsel rule. This was entirely unacceptable and was a grossly restrictive practice which should never have been tolerated.  I hope the same type of developments will take place with regard to pre-trial procedures. That would mean getting the medical evidence, the technical engineering evidence, out of the way so that £5,000 a day would not be spent hearing evidence in court which could have been done in an agreed fashion beforehand.</P>
    <P>I believe also that the administrative overheads of the Irish insurance sector are too high.  Technology presents new opportunities to the sector to cut costs as they have done in other countries.  I am also concerned that brokers are paid on a percentage basis for their commission. That gives them a vested interest, although they would be the first to say the opposite is the case, in higher premiums.  If a set table of fees was paid, irrespective of the scale of the premium, we might get premiums down more directly.</P>
    <P>I want to stress to the Minister the urgent need to ensure that the problem is dealt with.  Like many other problems in this country, we feel that once we have verbalised it we have solved it when, in fact, the problem is still there and everybody is agreed on what should be done but nothing has taken place.  There is an urgent need to implement all the recommendations of the Barrington commission report of 1983 with regard to safety at work.  There is no doubt that proper training and education have not been put into this whole area.  Such is the <Col N="711" /> seriousness with which we should take this matter and &mdash; I ask the Minister to take this matter up with the Minister for Labour &mdash; that in the workforce breaches of any safety code should be a disciplinary offence.  It is extremely important, and the employees' interest, that safety is taken seriously and that we have the proper type of implementation of the framework legislation already set up.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I think this motion is important, provided the Government act on it.  There is a set agenda outlined in detail in Deputy Bruton's speech and outlined in detail in the Fine Gael discussion document whereby decisions are simply required to implement what is an agreed agenda for action in this area.  By any European comparison the difference between Irish insurance costs and those of our competitor countries is unacceptable.  We will have to take on vested interests within the insurance industry and vested interests in the legal system, who are well represented in this House, to ensure that the public respond in terms of safety.  There should be new regulations for motor safety.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.  I hope the interest which the Government are showing in this motion will not be limited to these two days of debate but will extend to real action over the next year and a half and that we will see a reduction in premiums very rapidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Justice, Environment and Labour to jointly set a timetable of actions to reduce insurance costs over the next 18 months and in the light of these actions to obtain the agreement of the Insurance Companies to appropriate reductions in the insurance premia that would otherwise be charged to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say at the outset that I have no difficulty in accepting that motion.  The <Col N="712" /> view of everybody in this House must be that insurance costs are too high.  They are one element of industrial costs in this country that have gone way out of line.  I took it as one of my priorities, when coming in as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to attack the whole area of input costs into industry, recognising that the uncompetitive situation in which this economy had found itself was a major contributor to the loss of jobs &mdash; and very serious losses there have been in the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I shall go through the various initiatives we have taken and try to deal with the various positions with reference to other Departments.  Deputy Yates and Deputy Bruton recognise that we are only one Department &mdash; unfortunately, with the least clout in the areas in which action needs to be taken.  Nevertheless, we have, on behalf of the Government, a very strong vested interest in seeing that this problem is tackled and that those costs are brought down.  There is widespread agreement, not alone in this House but throughout the country, that the cost of insurance in this country is too high and has been so for far too long.  It is also generally accepted that the high cost of insurance is directly related to the number and level of claims, the underwriting losses sustained by insurers and the enormous expenses which arise when the courts are involved.  Let me state at the outset that I am committed to tackling the heavy cost burden which high insurance premia impose on both industrial and household budgets.  The cost of insurance must be reduced.  The Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> pointed out that Irish liability insurance rates place many Irish firms at a cost disadvantage, particularly in comparison with their UK competitors, and went on to state:</P>
    <P>The Government will move quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs by proceeding with legislation to abolish juries in personal injuries cases, by introducing legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on <Col N="713" /> Safety, Health and Welfare at Work and by promoting the introduction of safety audit arrangements by insurance companies.  The scope for promoting the publication of a Book of Quantum of Damages, for introducing a pre-trial procedure system and reducing the level of legal representation in the Superior Courts to help reduce legal costs will also be examined.</P>
    <P>The reduction of high insurance costs is part and parcel of the Government's overall plan to bring about a decrease in industrial costs, and to improve the cost environment for insurance generally.</P>
    <P>I will deal later with the specific measures which have been taken or are in the pipeline in order to bring about such reductions.  However, I want to dwell for a short time on the role of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to insurance and on the problems facing the insurance market in the State.  It must be emphasised that the basic role of the Minister laid down both by national and Community law is one of supervision of insurers in order to ensure that they are capable of meeting their liabilities and that they are solvent and remain solvent. It is not the Minister's function to tell insurers how to run their businesses, or to interfere with their right to accept or reject risks, to dictate the terms applicable to any insurance policy, or to interfere in their right to charge realistic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
    <P>However, insurers do have certain duties.  These duties lie in co-operating in the measures taken by the State and the Community and in the provision of their services without undue selectivity in the acceptance of risks.  It is a further concern that insurance should be provided efficiently and at reasonable cost.  The cost of insurance cover has increased steeply in recent years.  Many of the influencing factors are undoubtedly outside the control of insurers.  However, I expect insurance companies to control those factors within their ambit, so that inefficiencies in the insurance sector do not give rise to costs which have to be <Col N="714" /> borne by the community as a whole and by business in the highly competitive internationally traded sectors.</P>
    <P>Insurers are subject to very strict supervision rules and are required to maintain various categories of reserves in respect of claims which have been notified but not yet settled, claims which have arisen which are due to be notified and claims which arise in the unexpired part of the period at the financial period end of the insurance company.  The insurer must then use premium income to pay overheads and to meet due payments on claims.  The balance of the premium income received represents the underwriting profit or loss.  In addition to these requirements, the company are also obliged to maintain solvency requirements.  Insurance companies are, therefore, subject to more stringent financial requirements than is the case with commercial enterprises in general.  Insurers may legitimately require certain categories which represent a higher than average level of risk to pay higher than average premiums provided there is evidence to substantiate such loadings.</P>
    <P>Consumers are more interested, not in the supervisory aspects of insurance, except when crises arise, but in the issues of cost and availability of insurance, particularly in the motor and liability classes.  I recognise that there are problems in these areas.  The reasons for these difficulties are almost wholly outside my direct power of control.  We should, however, be aware that increased claims consciousness and a more litigious environment have a direct adverse effect on insurance costs.  The greater awareness of many citizens in claiming their full rights and entitlements to compensation under the law has meant that many more claims are made nowadays in respect of events which ten or 20 years ago would not have attracted such claims.  Undoubtedly, as citizens we value these rights and we would resist efforts to curtail their exercise.</P>
    <P>The inter-departmental committee on liability insurance, which were set up some time ago, have already reported to Government with recommendations on a <Col N="715" /> list of measures which could bring about a reduction in insurance costs.  I would like to outline the rationalisation measures already taken and those in train in relation to personal injury cases and the high costs associated therewith.</P>
    <P>Action is being taken now to change our court and legal procedures.  The most important measure is the abolition of juries in civil injury cases.  This is a matter primarily for the Minister for Justice.  The Government have already approved the amendment of the Courts Bill, 1986 to provide for: (i), the abolition of juries in personal injury cases, with effect from 31 July, 1988 and, (ii), certain pending High Court cases to be remitted where suitable to the Circuit Court after the Bill comes into effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to juries, it is understandable that ordinary jury members when deciding the level of awards in personal injury cases, (i), do not link the level of the award to the high cost of their own insurance; (ii), have a natural sympathy for plaintiffs and tend to discount any contributory negligence; (iii), perceive insurance companies as rich and well capable of paying up and, (iv), think that they could be a plaintiff some day.</P>
    <P>It is also likely that trial by a judge sitting alone will of itself restore the correct position regarding the burden of proof.  In other words, judges are more likely than juries to stick closely to the precise law in relation to the &ldquo;duty of care&rdquo; which one person owes to another, to sift evidence carefully and to make realistic deductions from awards for contributory negligence.  It is expected that, following the abolition of juries, judgments will revert to taking closer account of contributory negligence which, in turn, will lead to a reduction in the level of damages awarded.</P>
    <P>The abolition of juries in personal injury cases should also lead to, (a), more consistent and predictable awards, but not lower awards in every case, which would provide a more reliable framework <Col N="716" /> for insurers to estimate outstanding claims &mdash; thus reducing their costs; (b) earlier settlement of cases and more consistent and predictable out of court settlements thus facilitating better scheduling of court business and shorter trials; (c) lower legal costs and in particular much less justification for the engagement of more than one counsel in a particular case; (d) more successful challenges to spurious claims.</P>
    <P>The abolition of juries is not a panacea but it is an important step to controlling claims costs.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation have given a commitment to me that, &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>when the Courts Bill 1986 is enacted by the Dáil, IIF members will agree to introduce a special no-claim bonus for drivers who have been named on one of their existing motor insurance policies, subject to the following conditions.  The driver must: &mdash; hold a full driving licence for at least one year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;have been named on the policy for at least two years;</P>
    <P>&mdash;not have had any claims or driving convictions.</P>
    <P>Subject to meeting the foregoing conditions, companies would grant the person involved a special discount equivalent to at least point 1 on their normal bonus scale which in practice would represent a discount of between 10 per cent &mdash; 20 per cent of the premium which would otherwise be payable.  This is a very real and immediate benefit which will be available to young drivers later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to this specific commitment in relation to young drivers, insurers have stated publicly that whatever general savings accrue as a result of the abolition of juries will be passed on to policyholders.  Even if award levels only cease to spiral and premiums stabilise at current levels, a significant real saving for policyholders will have been achieved. Insurance industry sources have estimated that a reduction of at least 10 per cent in insurance premium levels could be the eventual outcome following the <Col N="717" /> abolition of juries.  These savings will be passed onto policyholders.  I am not saying it here in the House but I am satisfied that that will be the eventual situation.  But it is important that the Government take their actions first and then demand the appropriate reductions from the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The Government are also pressing ahead with plans to establish a book of quantum of damages.  A judge, sitting alone, with the help of a book of quantum of damages, is much more likely to deliver consistent judgment on award levels.  I know that the Minister for Justice has initiated discussions with relevant parties with a view to involving private sources in the matter as happens in the United Kingdom.  I would also hope that judges, when they start deciding these cases, will consult among themselves with the aim of fostering consistency of awards.</P>
    <P>A further measure to reduce costs is the introduction of a pre-trial procedure system in personal injury cases to shorten trial times.  Provisions along these lines are contained in the proposed Court and Court Officers Bill which is currently awaiting the views of the Attorney General.  This Bill contains provisions which will increase the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court and enable him to deal with a range of matters that at present must be dealt with by judges in court.  It is also proposed to confer further jurisdiction on the master by rules of court.  One effect of this will be that a system of pre-trial procedures may be introduced by rules of court which would provide that, before a case could be put down for trial, the master would conduct a preliminary hearing with a view to having subsidiary issues arising in the case settled, thus shortening trials.  Any streamlining of the legal system which reduces costs must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the recent voluntary decision of the Bar Council to reduce the number of counsel appearing in personal injury cases, the Government have decided to go further and give the Minister for Justice the power to limit the number of counsel in such cases.  The <Col N="718" /> norm in personal injury cases will be one except where the court certifies that a second, or in exceptional cases and for reasons stated, a third counsel is warranted.  It is to be expected that cases requiring more than one counsel would be extremely rare, as most civil injury cases turn on matters of fact rather than detailed points of law.  The legal costs of hearing claims can frequently be up to 40 per cent of the award.  It stands to reason that the passage of the Courts Bill, accompanied by the reduction in the number of legal personnel involved, will lead to substantial reductions in costs and will lead ultimately to lower premia overall.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of whether the assessment of damages could be done by a tribunal on an informal basis, the possible option of introducing a damages tribunal to determine personal injuries cases, as an alternative to the present arrangements for dealing with these cases, was considered but was rejected when proposals to modify the right to jury trial were being considered by the then Government in July 1985.  Constitutional difficulties could arise in connection with any proposal to remove personal injury cases from the courts. The introduction of damages tribunals has been rejected also in Britain following examination by the Law Commission, and by the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury &mdash; the Pearson Commission &mdash; in 1978.  A damages tribunal which was introduced in Western Australia in 1967 was subsequently disbanded.</P>
    <P>The Government are proceeding with a set of measures designed to bring about real improvements in the whole area of insurance and any further desirable changes, including changes to the legal system will be actively considered then.</P>
    <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee on Liability Insurance have put forward certain recommendations to the Government in relation to safety and health at work in order to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on these matters. The Minister for Labour will shortly be <Col N="719" /> submitting the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill to Government for approval.  Again, there is a commitment in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to introduce the necessary legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to expanding the proposed Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill to provide that safety policy statements and safety policy codes may be taken into account in establishing negligence in civil personal injuries cases as well as in criminal proceedings, subject to the advice of the Attorney General in the matter.  I see the formulation of safety policy statements as bringing about some measure of predictability and objectivity in this area.  It is inevitable, of course, that an employer's failure to achieve an objective stated in a safety statement may be regarded as a <i>prima facie</i> breach of duty. This is exactly the purpose of these safety statements as I see them, namely, to clearly set out the duties of all parties in the workplace.  Insurance companies could then, if they wished, make it a condition of cover that the employer complied with his duties as set out in the safety statement.  The concept would also bring about greater predictability, reinforce fault as the basis of liability and make it easier for the parties or the courts to apportion liability.  As regards codes of practice which would consist of authoritative documents drawn up by experts and evaluated for approval by the proposed authority, the parliamentary draftsman is considering the issues involved in including a reference to civil personal injuries cases in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the general environment in which insurance companies operate can be improved, problems of cost and availability will diminish.  With regard to employers and public liability insurance there is much that firms can do for themselves such as securing their premises from accidents, fire, theft, etc.  Insurance companies take improved risk management by firms into account in reaching underwriting decisions on the availability <Col N="720" /> of cover and its cost.  Most companies employ risk control surveyors who conduct surveys on various aspects of safety control as well as providing a loss prevention service.  Therefore, the onus must be placed on employers to provide adequate information to employees concerning the potential risks connected with their workplace and on the preventive measures to be observed by workers.  The enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, and the provision of safety policy statements and codes, should be of considerable benefit in improving matters in this area.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the vexed question of motor insurance.  This has been an area of public concern and controversy for a considerable length of time.  The high cost of motor insurance is frequently cited as a reason why some motorists disregard their compulsory duty to insure.  The cost of motor insurance is high because: (a) accident numbers are high; (b) numbers of claims are high; (c) awards are high; (d) costs of claims are high; and (e) uninsured drivers are adding substantially to each premium.</P>
    <P>While costs remain high, premia will also remain high.  Insurance companies are not providing social services.  They are commercial operations which must make money to survive.  They must, therefore, charge economic premia if they are to remain solvent and be able to meet their liabilities to policyholders and third parties.</P>
    <P>It is frequently suggested to me that as a means of reducing premia, the State should establish an insurance company which could charge lower premiums and allegedly make a fortune because every insuring member of the public would be obliged to seek insurance from it.  This is just not feasible.  If it were possible to slash premia and make a satisfactory return on capital, some insurance company would have done it by now.  A Stateowned company would have to follow the same underwriting principles as the rest of the market, that is, take in sufficient premia to pay all claims.  The existing companies have not managed to achieve <Col N="721" /> this in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would point out that since 1978 the motor insurance industry has failed to meet underwriting breakeven and has had to rely on its investment income to remain buoyant.  So the question of unwarranted levels of motor insurance premia does not arise and the fact remains that insurance premia are necessarily high to meet the high cost of claims.</P>
    <P>The cost and availability of insurance for young drivers is the most frequently discussed area of motor insurance.  Insurance companies vary in their definition of &ldquo;young&rdquo; but generally it is taken to mean under 25s.  The cost of motor insurance for young drivers is higher than for other classes because of the higher risk involved.  A 1982 report on motor insurance calculated that while the average gross premium per car insured for the under 25 age group was 62 per cent higher than that charged for the 30-69 age group the claims paid and outstanding were 200 per cent higher for under 25s.</P>
    <P>At present policyholders earn a no-claims bonus as a reward for claims free driving.  Young drivers tend not to be policyholders and therefore do not earn a no-claims bonus.  Many young drivers have several years of claims-free driving as drivers on their parents' policy, when they first take out insurance in their own name.  Many of them get no credit for this.  As I have already stated, they will reap an immediate benefit once the Courts Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, a number of insurance companies have already introduced more competitive rates for young drivers, in anticipation of the more favourable environment which the enactment of the Courts Bill will bring.  One company, in particular, has capped the rates for young drivers and is providing cover for £850 for young drivers in the Dublin area and £700 elsewhere.  This is the maximum charge.  One company has already taken the lead as a result of discussions in the Department with myself and Deputy Séamus Brennan and I would <Col N="722" /> have thought that others would follow.  If all of the market followed this lead there would be more competition and younger drivers would benefit enormously.  Obviously some companies are waiting for the implementation of the Courts Bill.</P>
    <P>Availability of cover is not a problem for any age group of drivers.  Cover is always available, if necessary via the declined cases agreement.  This agreement provides that where an individual is refused cover by five insurance companies, cover will be arranged unless it would be contrary to the public interest to do so.  Standard refusal forms have been agreed by the industry which should streamline the process further.  No case in recent times has been referred to the Declined Cases Committee solely on the basis of age.  The vast majority of individuals who are refused cover have been convicted of some offence under the Road Traffic Acts or have had an accident.  I should point out that there are those who state that insurance cover is not available when what they really mean is that cover is not available at a price they like.  We would all like to pay less for motor insurance.  Very few people &ldquo;like&rdquo; their insurance premia.  But most law abiding citizens realise that they must pay insurance premia regardless of whether they like them.  When we get to the stage when everyone pays their correct premium, maybe we will all like our premium better.</P>
    <P>One idea which has been proposed on a number of occasions is funding the present system of motor insurance by means of a tax on petrol.  Proponents of the petrol tax system argue that as no one could escape the insurance net problem of uninsured driving and the inequity whereby insured drivers effectively subsidise uninsured drivers would be eliminated.  It would also ensure that people pay only in relation to mileage driven and road usage.  While this is undoubtedly true, there would also be disadvantages. A tax on petrol would place the Government in the role of collector of insurance premia.  It would be administratively complex and would be very difficult to <Col N="723" /> police in Border areas.  It would add considerably to the existing differential between the price of a gallon of petrol in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The discrepancy in price would provide an incentive for people in the Border areas to purchase their petrol north of the Border and could give rise to serious large scale smuggling operations. Additional policing of the Border and possible monitoring of individual retail petrol outlets would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The idea of a tax on petrol is put forward as being a more equitable system. This is questionable in that it does not differentiate between the careless and careful driver.  Under the present system, the careful driver qualifies for a no-claims bonus.  The incentive to drive carefully or indeed to finance minor damages in order to preserve a no-claims bonus would be removed under the proposed new system. The element of equity introduced by having everyone included in the insurance net would be diminished by (a) the non-differentiation in the cost of premia between the more careful and careless driver, and, (b) the extent to which cross-Border smuggling is practised.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the number of uninsured drivers are many and varied.  The most common figure in recent times is 10 per cent, or maybe less of all drivers based on a preliminary roadside survey carried out by the Garda in April 1987.  We can only refer to the number of prosecutions for uninsured driving &mdash; 73,625 in 1986.</P>
    <P>The introduction of windscreen insurance discs in July 1986 was part of a continuing campaign to reduce the incidence of uninsured driving and to improve the insurance environment generally. The disc was not seen as the solution to the problem of uninsured driving but rather as an additional enforcement measure which would operate in conjunction with Garda checks on insurance certificates.  The introduction of the insurance disc is undoubtedly a help to gardaí in identifying uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984, provided for higher penalties for <Col N="724" /> offences under the road traffic code including a maximum fine of £1,000 for uninsured driving and a mandatory disqualification of one year for second or subsequent insurance offences within three years.</P>
    <P>At present there are no minimum fines for insurance offences under the Road Traffic Acts, though the PAC report had recommended a minimum fine of £100 for uninsured driving generally and a minimum fine of £350 in the case of a deliberate offence.  I am currently investigating the possibility of introducing minimum fines.  The level of fines being imposed in the Dublin Metropolitan District is being monitored and it appears that the maximum fine is imposed rarely in respect of insurance offences.  Indeed the current average level of fine is a fraction of the maximum level of fine.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that everything possible should be done to deter as many people as possible from driving uninsured and I am doubtful if the current level of fines possesses the required deterrent effect.  I have, therefore, taken up the matter of minimum fines with my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and Justice.</P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions to the problems of high cost and the difficulties some are experiencing in obtaining insurance. It is clear that the problems are a symptom of multiplicity of diseases and that insurance costs are directly related to the level and cost of claims occurring.  For example, in motor insurance a large element of the cost must be attributed to the irresponsible attitudes of many motorists to driving and to the law.  In the workplace, an improved attitude to safety by both employers and employees is needed in order to reduce the number of accidents giving rise to claims.  Wielding the big stick and issuing directions to insurers to take on risks they do not want, at premia they cannot afford to charge is not the answer.  Putting provisions in law to make it obligatory to quote for certain classes of business will drive up the cost so that the very worst risks can be provided for and quite probably result in fewer insurers wishing to compete here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> The Government have already put in train significant measures to tackle the problems of high cost and availability of insurance and we will be pressing ahead with further measures to facilitate the elimination of these problems.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the environment in which insurance companies operate to change overnight.  However, the actions already initiated by the Government, such as the abolition of juries in personal injury cases and the rationalisation of legal representation, have already produced assurances from the industry that real reductions in premia will follow once the improved framework gets underway.</P>
    <P>The next year will see concerted action on the part of this Government to reduce insurance costs.  The Minister for Justice will be tackling the sometimes exorbitant insurance awards, by abolishing juries in insurance cases through the Courts Bill. Action will also be taken to cut the quite outlandish legal costs involved in insurance claims which can amount to as much as a quarter of the total claim award.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour will be promoting radical new legislation in the area of occupational health and safety at work which will have a beneficial impact on accidents and claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will be bringing forward measures in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill to tackle the issues of uninsured, drunken and dangerous driving.  These measures will include a reduction in the blood/alcohol level and the impounding of vehicles in certain circumstances.  The Minister will be participating in this debate tomorrow night and will give full details of the measures he is undertaking.</P>
    <P>All of these measures will prove that this Government are doing their part to improve the overall environment in which insurance companies operate.  I can assure the House that I will be making sure that insurance companies play their part in this process also by passing on the benefits to consumers.</P>
    <P>I have scanned the remarks of Deputy John Bruton and have taken note of the points raised by Deputy Yates.  I have an <Col N="726" /> open mind on this matter.  Any suggestions that are feasible, constructive and can contribute to reducing insurance costs, in whatever sector, will be considered and, if considered practical, put into operation.  I can give the House an undertaking to examine every practical proposal advanced when we shall ascertain whether it is capable of implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to add to the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and calls in particular for the early reintroduction and passage of the Courts Bill 1986 to abolish juries in civil cases, a reduction in the number of lawyers in such cases, a simplification and speeding up of the procedures in such cases and consideration of whether the assessment of damages could be done by a tribunal on an informal basis, as in the Stardust and criminal injury cases, rather than by a Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the opportunity afforded to discuss this matter this evening.  We found no problems at all with the Fine Gael motion. We sought merely to tease out in a more specific way points that have been covered on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's contention that insurance companies are commercial bodies and must be viable.  With that in mind, one cannot expect them to charge premiums which would result in their being underfunded or which would place them in serious financial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the whole aspect of insurance cover and premiums in respect of young drivers in this country.  We must view this whole area in a more enlightened and educated way.  For example, in the issuing of driving licences here we adopt an approach radically different from that of other countries.  For example, in continental countries the issuing of a driving licence has a significant impact on its recipient.  In continental countries one does not undertake one simple driving test but rather a series <Col N="727" /> in very specific conditions, such as daytime driving, night-time driving, driving on wet or icy roads, all of which tend to emphasise the importance of that person being issued a driving licence, and his responsibility to his fellowman in his usage of the roads.  The Minister could well examine this area &mdash; I recognise that it does not come directly within his responsibility &mdash; ensuring a more responsible attitude on the part of young applicants for driving licences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fines imposed on those found to be driving while uninsured it should be remembered that here people who are caught on drunken driving charges automatically lose their licences.  I consider the driving of vehicles without insurance cover to be a crime of equal seriousness to that of drunken driving. I see no reason that somebody driving without insurance cover should not automatically lose their licence for 12 months, even on a first conviction, as is the case in regard to drunken driving.  I know that the high cost of insurance cover here tends to lead to this lack of cover on the part of some individuals.  Deputy John Bruton alluded to this matter in the course of his remarks.  I would agree with him that the deterrent to driving without insurance is not sufficient.  I noted that the Minister questioned the adequacy of the fines obtaining.  It is my belief that young people are fully aware of the implications of driving a car while drunk.  Equally they should be aware of the consequences of driving vehicles without insurance cover.  It is my belief that the latter is not registering with them and I think it should be made to.  We should consider whether our approach to the granting of licences is correct and question whether the penalties imposed for driving without insurance cover are adequate or sufficient to act as a deterrent to this practice.  I believe the fines are not sufficiently severe.  I believe they should be on a par with those imposed for drunken driving.</P>
    <P>There has been unanimous recommendation for the early reintroduction of the Courts Bill 1986.  The whole question <Col N="728" /> of insurance centres on the provisions of that Bill.  There is no doubt but that the abolition of the juries system is tremendously important in this respect.  One of the major contributing factors to the high cost of insurance premiums is the exorbitant jury awards.  Therefore it is of great importance that the jury system be abolished as soon as possible and the Courts Bill affords that opportunity.  We have listened for too long to various arguments advanced in this area.  While we have identified the problem we have not tackled it.  We should remember that insurance affects every aspect of every citizen's life in some way or other; there is not a citizen who has not some direct involvement in some form of insurance. The need to do something about it has been bubbling under the surface for some time but has now come to a head.  I am glad the Government have recognised the need to take urgent action in this respect.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister did not refer to product liability insurance particularly as it will be affected by the EC Directive in this regard, which I understand will come into effect here in July next.  The provisions of that directive would have a crucifying effect on manufacturers here while there is still a jury system being operated.  Premiums will go absolutely through the roof.  It should be noted that we are the only country of the Twelve with a jury system in this area.  If our manufacturing industry is to be forced to accept this product liability they will find they will be unable to afford premiums for the requisite cover, bearing in mind that awards could be outlandish. It is my contention that the jury system mitigates totally against this product liability cover.  This liability cover means that a manufacturer can be sued directly by the end user of his product.  This means that all of those involved in the distribution, handling or sale of that product are implicated.  Even were I to purchase a product and hand it on to somebody as a gift, if they, as a result, are caused injury they can sue its manufacturer directly.  From my discussions with such manufacturers they have made it quite <Col N="729" /> clear that if the provisions of the Courts Bill are not in operation, while the jury system still obtains, this product liability cover will cost them jobs, they will simply be unable to afford the premiums in addition to those already obtaining in this area.  At a time when the Government are talking about job creation &mdash; and all of us on this side of the House recognise only too well the need for such &mdash; while we can encourage core businesses to expand it is becoming more obvious that, as technology takes over, the real spin-off in terms of jobs may well come from the service industries.</P>
    <P>One of the main deterrents to young, enterprising entrepreneurs trying to set up a business is the high cost of public liability insurance.  Scores of people have come to me about this problem because, on the one hand, the Government are encouraging enterprise in this area &mdash; many schemes are in operation to do something about it &mdash; but, on the other, there is the big stumbling block of public liability insurance.  There is no problem in getting a quote but some of them are just beyond belief and are not relevant to the cost of setting up the business.</P>
    <P>This problem must be looked at in regard to the manufacturing industry because, in relation to progress in this area, there is an inter-reaction and you cannot isolate certain factors, take them out when it is time to discuss them and then put them back again, which is what we have been doing for far too long.  The question of insurance has an impact right across the board, it is not just relevant to one specific area or sector.  It has a huge impact and we must do something about it.  In regard to public liability insurance, certain companies have viable schemes which are capable of offering real employment but the problem is the development of their businesses because they are caught before they start with the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there should be an incentive scheme for those in business who have shown a good track record.  I agree, but it is only one of many factors necessary.  There must be an incentive for <Col N="730" /> companies to improve their standards of operation in many of the factories, safety guidelines in particular, which, in some instances, are adhered to at the very lowest levels.  Some companies have been innovative in enhancing safety measures in factories and it would be in the interest of the insurance companies to show the manufacturing companies that those who are prepared to invest in the safety of their workers and the future of their plant &mdash; and who have an excellent track record in regard to claims &mdash; will receive benefits.  If insurance companies offer these incentives, matters would improve because it would be in the interest of the employees to improve personal standards of safety in the factory.  It would also be in the interests of the companies instead of penalising them and making them incapable of expanding.</P>
    <P>In regard to motor insurance, the Minister outlined a number of points when he mentioned the high number of claims and the cost of awards and he said that uninsured drivers are adding substantially to the cost of each premium.  We know what causes the problems but what will we do about them?  I support the idea of a book of quantum of damages mentioned by Deputy John Bruton and the Minister because it operates in other countries.  If a codified system is evolved by the legal profession it will lay down the guidelines by which awards can be made.  One obviously recognises that the loss of an arm or leg may not be as much of a disability to some people as to others.  The same compensation will not apply because one would have to take into account whether the person was an old age pensioner, a breadwinner or a young person. However, one can certainly set down the outline of what guidelines should be, including the minimum and maximum awards.  This would have the effect of speeding up the whole process by which claims and litigation are processed.  The removal of the jury system will, inevitably, bring about that procedure and it should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We also proposed some kind of a tribunal system which should also be able to operate in this area.  For example, after <Col N="731" /> the Stardust tragedy not a single claim was met for four and a half years.  Hardship was caused to many people who had suffered serious injuries and who were in great financial difficulties.  They were entitled to compensation and a decent life.  When the tribunal was set up it took only three months to process over 200 of these claims.  There is certainly room, in certain instances, for a tribunal system where the people involved do not have to go before a court with all the fears that brings in terms of judges and barristers in wigs, solicitors and so on.  They should be able to go to a room where a judge and perhaps a barrister can simply assess the injuries, what caused them and the appropriate compensation.  In some instances they have processed a claim from start to finish in 24 hours.  We certainly should look at a tribunal system on an informal basis.  I am not suggesting that it should be the norm but the option should be there as it would be very helpful to the people involved.  The development of a book of quantum of damages would also help to speed up matters at tribunal level and the Progressive Democrats favour this approach.</P>
    <P>The development of a book of quantum of damages raises another question mark.  However, it should come into operation over a very short period because if you abolish the jury system you must have some other mechanism in place to achieve the end result.  I know it will take time but the object of the exercise is to achieve lower insurance costs. All factors must be taken into consideration in this area.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not say when he expects to bring forward the Courts Bill, 1986, as the whole debate hinges on this. None of the measures to which we referred will come into effect until the Courts Bill is passed by the House.  That is the first obvious step the Government can take and it is why we included it in our amendment as we wanted to be specific in the steps we want to see taken. Indeed, the majority of Members support the Bill.</P>

      <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy Browne, in referring to the sheep industry, told us that it was now very prosperous.  I should like to remind him that we are only skimming the surface as far as sheep production is concerned.  I am sure the Minister, and his Ministers of State, are aware that our mountain pastures are starved for the want of lime and fertilisers.  We should endeavour to get the EC to provide funds to enable us to improve the fertility of our mountain soil.  If we could improve the fertility of that soil we would be in a position to double our sheep numbers. That would prove of great benefit to our economy.  We are all aware that if the mountains from Donegal to Cork were subject to aerial fertilisation the quality of the soil would be improved and our sheep farmers would benefit.  Those people are engaged in a tremendous fight to produce fodder and food for their flock in winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food where he discovered the name for the new organisation, Teagasc.  Was it not possible to produce a more appropriate name for the new body?  How will the new name sell in EC circles?  I am amazed that the Minister could not produce a more appropriate name for a body that is expected to do so much for agriculture.  It is of vital importance that research projects which are of benefit to Irish farmers are not abandoned.  I am thinking of the research project at Moorepark to identify reasons for calf mortality.  That research could result in improved management of the disease control programme.  If we can curb brucellosis and other diseases we will succeed in reducing the natural calf loss from 14 per cent to 10 per cent. The direct annual saving from such an improvement has been estimated at £24 <Col N="733" /> million to agriculture with a further spin-off saving of £16 million.  It is felt that there is still room for further major improvements in the research programme.  I do not want to see that programme axed because of a lack of funds arising out of the Government's policy of fiscal rectitude.  I do not want to see any reduction in the processing of 100,000 soil and 30,000 plant samples annually.  I do not want our farmers to be told that there are no facilities available to test the soil of their land or to advise them about the type of artificial fertiliser they should apply.  That is not progress.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy was making progress in his Department he would not be in the position he is in now.

      <P>The difference in the price was 50 per cent in favour of sulphuric acid.  That resulted in Irish farmers saving £10 million annually in their silage operations.  Such a proposal would never have been thought of by any official in Kildare Street.  Were it not for the ability of the Grange research station Irish farmers would not be enjoying the bonanza they enjoy today.  The Moorepark research centre have developed a technique of incorporating dairy produce into a chocolate bar which I am sure will prove very popular when it is offered for sale in our supermarkets.  That product could not have been produced were it not for the fact that the Coalition Government <Col N="734" /> gave the Moorepark centre adequate funds to carry out research.

      <P>We had the future of agriculture to the fore in our policies but I am afraid that agriculture is bound for the doldrums under the present Administration.  Research is vital if we are to maintain our place in the EC and international markets.  Any let-up in our research work will have serious consequences for farming.  If the essential services for agriculture are to continue under the new merged authority the Government must provide adequate finance.  It is necessary that State funding to the new authority should be increased from the projected £20 million to at least £30 million for 1988.  A major industry such as agriculture could not survive a reduction of £10 million in its budget and hope to prosper.  Irish farmers cannot be helped to meet their EC counterparts if such a policy is pursued.  Without adequate funding the proper services cannot be provided and the development of agriculture will be seriously affected with the following consequences, (a) major damage to the economy; (b) serious loss of employment opportunities and (c) fewer safeguards for the consumer. There is no doubt that a drop in the allocation to the new authority would have serious repercussions for the country's most important industry, agriculture.  I urge the Minister to act before it is too late and to put our major industry on the pedestal where it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask him to reconsider his decision to abolish the committees of agriculture.  If he goes ahead with this decision he will be silencing the democratically elected voice of the people.  Our forefathers fought over many centuries for three Fs &mdash; freedom of speech, fixity of tenure and free sale.  By one stroke of the pen the Minister is doing away with free speech for the person who is elected to voice the grievances of his constituents at a <Col N="735" /> committee meeting.  There is much talk about the time when an alien administration affected freedom of speech in this country but today we have Ministers in a native Government doing exactly the same thing against which our forefathers fought and died.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture and Food cannot accommodate the committees of agriculture in this Bill, let him agree to my request to set up advisory agricultural bodies on a county basis to advise the new authority.  It is never too late to change one's mind.  The Government have made a few U-turns in the past 12 months.  I urge the Minister to have some respect for free speech and for farmers. He should recognise the importance of agriculture as our major industry and remember that when the last litre of oil or gas is drained from the Celtic Sea agriculture will still be the backbone of the economy.  It is vital that the Minister should accede to my request and restore the £10 million which he has hijacked from the industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The proposals contained in this Bill are fundamental to the future development of the agricultural industry and in helping us to achieve our objective of national recovery.  I thank the Minister for bringing the proposals before us an I hope Members will avail of the opportunity of making their views known to him in relation to the proposed new authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the Bill and of the cut in the budget available to the new body.  We have clearly demonstrated in areas such as health that the indiscriminate pumping of money into <Col N="736" /> any service does not always lead to a corresponding improvement in that service.  I have no doubt that the same is true of agriculture and of the funding of the services of this new authority.  I have spoken to many people within ACOT and AFT who will admit to areas where greater efficiencies could have been effected in the past.  It is a pity that it took strong and firm action on the part of the Government to compel agencies outside direct Government control such as health boards, local authorities and other local and regional bodies to look seriously at their spending patterns and to become more conscious of the need for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Those of us who are associated as public representatives with some of these bodies have not been as vigilant as we might have been in insisting that management be more cost-effective in the spending of public money.  Those days are gone and the Government are giving all of us a lesson in basic economics.  We must live within our means and do without services which we as a nation cannot afford, at least in the present difficult financial environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill will contribute to the elimination of duplication in agricultural services and will provide a greater opportunity for the co-ordination of activities in the vital areas of research and training.  It will also provide an opportunity for a closer assessment of the cost-benefit of the operation, which must be part of every public spending programme for the future.  Having set up the new structure and allowed it sufficient time to settle down in its new role, I would urge the Minister not just to be cost conscious but to consider the return which could be obtained for the nation from additional funding in certain circumstances.  I would draw a clear distinction between areas of public expenditure which could be regarded as unproductive in terms of economic return and those which are developmental and which would give a return in terms of increased output and exports, which is certainly the case in regard to the agricultural <Col N="737" /> industry.  I have said on many occasions that every pound spent on agricultural advice and training is money well spent which will undoubtedly give a worthwhile return.  I have no reason to change that view but I would add that we need to be careful that advice and training are channeled in the direction in which agriculture is likely to develop.  This is not an easy matter to predict, especially when we see proposals from the EC to pay people to leave land idle.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the operations of the new service will be closely monitored by the Minister.  If it can be seen that further investment would give a corresponding return to the nation, then I hope the Minister and the Government will respond.  The whole thrust of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is towards development. Fianna Fáil's commitment to agricultural development over the years is an indication of our awareness of the capacity of the industry to contribute to our national wellbeing.  It may well be that the commitment of previous administrations was one of funding rather than adequate programming, planning and analysis of results.  I suppose the TB eradication scheme is a classic example.  The imbalance between administration and the actual delivery of services is another example of our failure to set and achieve targets.  The big challenge facing the Minister and the new authority is, as has already been indicated, to get a reasonable balance between efficiency and output without affecting seriously the area of research in particular where returns are difficult to monitor, at least in the short term.</P>
    <P>As a veteran in the area of agricultural development, I have no hesitation in saying that if it were not for the tedious and tiring work of our researchers the dairy, beef, cereal and beet industries would not be at the level of efficiency existing today.  It is also important to note that all of this work and research was carried out specifically with an eye on Irish farming conditions and patterns.  It is not the fault of researchers if marketing <Col N="738" /> patterns have changed or some commodities are now in over supply.  I must make special mention of the agricultural advisory services.  From my experience I can say that the majority of the advisers employed in the services over the years have displayed a dedication far beyond the call of duty and have been responsible for the upgrading of farm practices, rural life and agricultural income which is now a significant factor in the development of our economy and which is planned to play an even more significant role in the Government's programme for development in the future.</P>
    <P>It is also important to acknowledge the fact that farmers were willing and eager recipients of that advice and training and, in fact, in some cases were over eager in terms of their willingness and commitment to borrow and invest in the industry.  Today many of them are paying a very high price because of the rapidity with which the economic climate changed during the period of their development programmes.</P>
    <P>In discussing a Bill dealing with agricultural research and training it is important to acknowledge the role of voluntary organisations.  I am thinking specifically of Macra na Feirme and the role which they played down through the years in providing a creative and receptive environment and very often setting up the structures for local advice and training.  I also include in that vital category the organisation of Muintir na Tíre who played such a significant role in the area of community development.  There are many homes in rural areas which would not have had the facility of a piped water supply, for example, where it not for the efforts of Muintir na Tíre.  In this the centenary year of the founding of the great organisation I ask the House to recall the dedication and vision of their founder, the late Canon John Hayes, may he rest in peace.  It is my view that if we had a renewal of the vision of Canon Hayes and the idealism which he generated the road to recovery would be that much easier.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate today tributes were paid to Dr. Tom Walshe, former <Col N="739" /> director of the Agricultural Institute, for his dedication to agricultural development.  I would like to re-echo the sentiments which were expressed by other speakers in acknowledging that wonderful contribution and to say that we are very pleased that Dr. Walshe is still around and with us from the point of view of being able to give us practical and sound advice on the future development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the area of the contribution of voluntary organisations to the role of agricultural education, mention must also be made of the farming press, in particular the <i>Irish Farmers Journal.</i> I remember it as <i>The Young Farmers Journal</i> and I was associated with its early establishment.  No other farming publication has made such a practical contribution to the development of Irish farming.  At a time when we are concerned about the cost effectiveness of public spending I feel that the role of the journal will be of greater significance in the future.  In a way it is in a better position to communicate the findings of modern research and management techniques to farmers on a weekly basis than the more formal statutory authorities.  We are lucky to have such a high quality farming publication. I made the point earlier, and I do so again now, about the need to keep the operations of the body under regular review and to ensure that it is not inhibited in its work due to inadequate finance.  If we do not do so and the organisation is unable to fulfil its role to the maximum degree possible, we will be undermining our own plan for economic development and, in particular, our commitment to the development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a hackneyed phrase to restate that agriculture is by far our single most important industry in terms of national income, exports and employment.  Total exports for 1986 amounted to about £10 billion, £7 billion coming from the so-called modern industry and the balance of £3 billion coming from agricultural exports.  However, the figures <Col N="740" /> do not reflect the true value to the economy of agriculture.  It must be borne in mind that the agricultural related food industry in Ireland uses 87 per cent Irish raw material in the production process which is also significant in terms of added value and jobs.  By comparison modern manufacturing industry used only 28 per cent Irish raw material.  One should add to this the fact that profit repatriation from industry, other than from agriculture, in 1986 amounted to £1.3 billion or 17 per cent of the total value of exports.</P>
    <P>In the light of the above facts and when one adjusts the real value of exports to the economy, you are left with a situation where industry represents 53 per cent, or £2,284 million, and agriculture 47 per cent, or £2,053 million, not a very significant difference but when one takes into account the added spending power generated by the agricultural sector, agriculture emerges as a clear winner in terms of overall contribution to national development.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I am not making a case against modern industry but I am more specifically highlighting the sometimes under-estimated value of our greatest natural resource, which is the land.  The Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; the credibility of that programme after less than one year in Government has been vindicated in terms of achievable targets &mdash; planned for a progressive agricultural industry and an expanding food related industry.  The Bill before the House provides for the structure and framework of a new dynamic research and development body.  Its success will depend on the willingness to work the new system on the part of those who are employed in research and training and on the positive commitment on our part to ensure that they will be assisted in that difficult task.</P>
    <P>The new body faces an enormous challenge in the face of a rapidly changing agricultural environment at European level.  In the face of such changes we will have to plan and adjust in a way which will enable us to maximise the income from our land resources through added <Col N="741" /> value, particularly in the food industry. We must ensure and plan that a major factor in all of that planning is the development of the industry for the purpose of creating jobs.  At the recent successful Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis the Taoiseach reiterated Government policy on food processing as part of the Government's strategy for job creation based on the development of our greatest natural resource.  I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department will pursue that objective with the same dedication and enthusiasm for development which he has displayed over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>This is a challenging time to be in public life and it is encouraging to note that national problems which up to a year ago seemed insurmountable can now be tackled and resolved.  It is also satisfying to note the goodwill existing at all levels of society in relation to the corrective action which the Government are taking in the national interest.  There can be no doubt that Government action and the positive Government policies of the past year have led to the creation of an economic environment in which agriculture can plan, expand and develop in the future.  I refer specifically to the very substantial drop in interest rates and the control of inflation, two factors which have had a detrimental effect on the development of farming over the past decade.  It now looks as if this environment will continue, and perhaps even improve, in the future and it is, therefore, a good time to plan the future development of the industry and to that extent the introduction of this Bill is timely.</P>
    <P>One of the great challenges facing the new Authority, particularly the research side, is the need for research into alternative farming enterprises and diversification and research into existing agricultural products.  Unless we succeed in meeting this challenge there is no real future for agricultural development and expansion in this country.  The oversupply of the conventional products such as milk, cereals and sugar beet &mdash; and their control under the existing quota <Col N="742" /> system &mdash; means that diversification and new product development are essential.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that the new Authority should be conscious of the social aspect in relation to retaining the maximum number of farm family units.  It is important, and socially desirable, to maintain a reasonable balance between urban and rural development and the retention of the family farm unit is an essential part of that objective.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say that if there is one single factor more than any other which is likely to undermine the short or indeed the long term development of agriculture, and consequently the economy, it is the dramatic decline in the beef cow herd.  Projections would seem to indicate that the herd will be reduced to a level of 250,000.  I do not have to remind anybody here who has an interest in the development of agriculture of the significance of that reduction so far as agriculture and the economy are concerned because it automatically leads to a corresponding reduction in terms of the number of calves born and this in turn is reflected in the beef industry, an area in which we have plans for the future development of food processing and also in relation to the contribution which the livestock exports &mdash; be they processed or otherwise &mdash; will make to the future development of our industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of saying these few brief words in relation to the Bill before the House.  I wish it success.  If properly utilised, it can be the foundation on which future agricultural development can take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to each Government speaker I am reminded of a similar situation, it is as if a dog had suddenly discovered the bone of fiscal rectitude and merrily and gaily worried it to death and with each passing day, and each passing phase, recognised more and more the merit of such a bone but having only recently discovered it I can well understand that.  I say that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because I cannot really understand how a dramatic cut in the funding of a particular industry, albeit <Col N="743" /> under the guise of increased efficiency, can improve the service or the delivery of that industry.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest on the intercom to the debate on this Bill so far and I am amazed that speakers seem to come forward, again and again, setting forth the merit of a reduced budget in order to improve the efficiency of an industry which is now recognised by everybody as a linchpin of our economy. Everybody will recognise that efficiency is called for and everybody on this side of the House will fully accept that any move towards efficiency or rationalisation or greater delivery of services to the people to whom the services are directed is to be welcomed.  However, I must ask a few pertinent questions.  It is accepted, and is repeated as often as possible, that the food industry is now of major significance to us.  I am sure the Minister of State, whom I am glad to see in the House, will explain the matter further at a later stage.  I have not yet heard an explanation as to how at this very crucial time for that industry, which is in many ways a fledgling given the competition it has to face, this so-called rationalisation will improve the situation from the industry's point of view.  I think that rationalisation in this case is another name for a dramatic reduction in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that cuts must take place if we are to live within our means but we should be very careful as to the extent we go with these cuts particularly in an industry which is very much the foundation stone of our economy.  If we are to live up to all the expectations, and the aspirations of the Ministers themselves, the proposal, in many ways, which is now before the House will do irreparable damage to achieving the goals we have set and to which we all aspire.  That being the case I would have liked to have had more information from the Minister when he spoke in the House on Thursday last.  I would like to have had more information from him on what his &ldquo;down-the-road plans&rdquo; are for the industry.  We all know about the aspirations and we can <Col N="744" /> all set out the platitudes but I would like to know what the nitty gritty is all about. I would like to know exactly what these proposals will mean in terms of the delivery of a research, education and advisory service to the industry, to the agricultural industry in general, to the farming industry and to the food processing industry. I have serious doubts as to whether it is anything more than a budgetary cut.  I think that is all it is but it is well cloaked in a proposal to rationalise and create greater efficiency within the industry.  If it is the former, the consequences will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I will now refer the House to a paper produced by Tom Arnold, senior economist in ACOT, in which he states that there is inadequate recognition of the contribution which the agricultural and food industry is making to the national economy.  He argues, and I quote, &ldquo;that the scale of the cuts in agricultural support services may represent a strategic mistake &mdash; it could undermine the contribution which the major wealth producing sector of the economy can make to national recovery.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a paper produced by Mr. Tom Arnold, Senior Economist, ACOT and is entitled &ldquo;Is Agriculture Being Written Off?&rdquo; Further bits of information emerge by perusing that paper. This was referred to by the previous speaker in a roundabout way.  Mr. Arnold goes on to say that:</P>
      <P>The gross value of visible exports increased from £4.1 billion in 1980 to about £9.5 billion in 1986.  Over £7 billion comes from so called `modern' industries, many of which were attracted by our low tax regime for manufacturing industry and the remaining £2.5 billion came from agricultural exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Critics of the agricultural industry point to that and say: &ldquo;Look how poorly agriculture is doing&rdquo;.  What they fail to recognise <Col N="745" /> is that agriculture is 85 per cent home supported.  It is self sufficient in terms of raw materials.  Everything that is called for within the industry is either produced at home or does not cost the economy a great deal.  As everybody will recognise the element of repatriation of profits in this area is very small.  The paper goes on to state and this is important in the context of the discussion which is taking place:</P>
    <P>The import content of many of the modern industries is substantial.  An IDA study of manufacturing industry in Ireland in 1983 showed that the Irish raw materials used as a proportion of total raw materials amounted to 33 per cent for chemicals, 17 per cent for electronics and 28 per cent for manufacturing industry.  By contrast, the food industry sourced 87 per cent of its raw materials domestically.</P>
    <P>Almost 90 per cent of the raw materials for that industry were sourced here at home.  That is something we might well overlook in our efforts to create an important industry and to target the markets that are available in Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I hope I am wrong but I am fearful that within the provisions of the Bill before us there could be a trap where we could find ourselves caught in a situation where insufficient finances are available to this very vital industry at a time when they are most required.  If that were to happen, and I have no wish that it would, I implore the Minister and his Minister of State to do all in their power at Cabinet level to divert the necessary funding to this industry and to ensure that we have the kind of return for effort and investment I have just mentioned, and which was outlined in Mr. Arnold's paper.</P>
    <P>Further, and much more interesting, on page 3 he says:</P>
    <P>For every £100 of exports generated by manufacturing industry, £54 is paid for raw material imports and £17 goes overseas by way of profit repatriation, leaving £29 net within the Irish economy.  For every £100 of agricultural <Col N="746" /> exports, imports account for £18 and profit repatriations are negligible, leaving over £80 in the economy.  When the import content and profit repatriation of industrial exports are taken into account, it will be seen (Table 1) that the `net exports' value of agriculture (£2.05 billion) is very close to that of industrial exports (£2.28 billion).</P>
    <P>When all the inputs, the sources of the inputs, the repatriation of profits and so on are taken into account, and one balances against the other, our agricultural industry is still on a par with all other combinations.  That is something I hope is not lost in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Let us face it.  Many products become obsolete but I doubt if food will become obsolete.  As long as there are people, they will have to eat and every passing day brings new trends and a greater emphasis on research and development. If we omit that factor or overlook any of those areas, we will leave ourselves open to the strong thrust of competition which is coming from our competitors in Europe and elsewhere.  If we are not awake to that threat at this stage, if we allow our financial position to override our judgment in terms of what is required for the industry over the next number of years, we may pay a very heavy and harsh price for it.  I would hope that within the ambit of the Bill the Minister can ensure that sufficient emphasis is placed on the importance of the industry and be in a position to make available to the industry the necessary research and advisory services that are required.  If that does not happen, another problem arises.</P>
    <P>If I might digress for a moment, many critics of agriculture and the agricultural industry &mdash; I have often heard them in this House &mdash; refer to the easy lifestyle enjoyed by the agricultural community; yet, amazingly the number of people leaving the land increases every year.  If it is such a bed of roses, why are so many people leaving?  It is not because everything is getting easier or the profits are greater.  There is a lesson to be learned if we look at the facts and figures which are available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> At this time more than ever before, it is necessary to deploy to the farming community all the research, training and advice we can.  Everything we can lay at their disposal is important so that they may adapt to the changing scene and be prepared, as our competitors are, to venture into new areas.  If they do so, they must have at their disposal the necessary back-up services and information.</P>
    <P>Another area which worries me is this. When cuts take place they appear to take place where they hurt most, where the actual delivery to the services take place, right at the delivery point; in other words, the inverted pyramid system.  This means that under various headings we can arrive at a system where we have strong administrative bodies, a huge administration but on the ground where the services are most required the numbers seem to diminish.  That is what is happening with AFT and ACOT.  On the one hand, rationalisation is proposed but, on the other hand, it is very vague.  We have a brand new rather longish name, something of a misnomer I would have thought.  If it is meant to mean doctrine, one could put various interpretations on the doctrine.  Nonetheless, the proposal is vague.  It does not set out what is likely to happen in one or two years time.  Many employees of the research stations have opted for redundancies but what will happen to the stations?  Will they be closed down?  Will they become white elephants?  What worthwhile proposals are there to utilise those stations and to continue the important work they carry out?  A number of alternatives come to mind.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the peatland experimental station at Lullymore produced a number of fine documents and papers on their research into peatland and other alternatives, such as the utilisation of the terrain for tourist purposes.  It would be a terrible pity to allow those stations to die and to allow the work and the research which were undertaken in those stations to be forgotten, to be buried in archives and never to see the light of day again.  I hope that kind of thing does not <Col N="748" /> happen.  The availability of and the advice from the officers in those stations is very well known and their willingness to become involved with the local community has been long established.  I hope whatever proposals the Minister has in mind he will take account of the tremendous work done in places like Lullymore, Moorepark and so on and that he will not dismantle these stations so that they are no longer a worthwhile entity.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday the Minister said at column 318 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The Government intend to provide our farmers, especially our younger farmers with at least as good an access to the knowledge and skills they will require as that available to their counterparts abroad.</P>
    <P>That is a point I mentioned already.  I am not so sure that is the way to do it.  I am not entirely convinced that they will have available to them the same degree of services and back-up as their counterparts.  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>That is the reason we are expressly assigning a degree of priority to training and education in the merger Bill. We are attaching a similar priority to food research and development as a responsibility of the new agency.  The two are complementary and the food processing sector is faced with ever changing consumer preferences and fierce competition on both home and foreign markets.  The priority to be given to entrants into farming will not mean the exclusion of the advisory services, as has been suggested, but rather will ensure that the advisory services will be put to best effect by fully trained farmers and utilised in a cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>It will be cost-effective anyway, because the budget will cut the allocation by 43 per cent, but the delivery of the services in tandem with that cost efficiency is the question that has yet to be answered.</P>
    <P>In general one recognises and accepts any move towards efficiency and we accept that savings must be made where possible but it should not be to the detriment <Col N="749" /> of a key industry or at a time when a greater dependency than ever is placed on that key industry in the economy.  It is important to be efficient but it does not always follow that cutting our budgets dramatically will lead to cost effectiveness.  It could lead to disaster.</P>
    <P>In relation to the delivery of services to the people for whom they were intended Ella Shanahan in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday, 1 December 1987 said:</P>
    <P>In 1987, the Department of Agriculture will have spent £58 million of its £182 million estimate on salaries, wages and allowances.  Next year, it will have £57 million for salaries, wages and allowances, a cut of just 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, ACOT, the farm advisory and education service, which this year had an £18.3 million allocation from the Department for general purposes, and the Agricultural Institute, which had an allocation of £16.7 million, must take a 43 per cent cut to £20 million between them.</P>
    <P>I have doubts as to whether progress along that road will make an improvement in the efficiency of the industry.  We could have an inverted pyramid system operating where all the administration is at the top but the Minister and the people who deliver the goods and services are at the bottom.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has already read the paper produced by Tom Arnold and I hope he will bear it in mind when considering this Bill.  I would ask him not to dismantle the research and advisory services so that they become useless.  I implore him not to proceed down the road of fiscal rectitude to the extent that he loses sight of the important contribution made by ACOT and AFT in the past.  The Minister should recognise that the replacement body should be given teeth and full powers so that its services are available for the economy.  If they are not, the economy will suffer.</P>
    <P>Anything we can do at the present time to generate employment must be welcomed.  It is generally recognised that research, marketing and product development are areas crucial to the food <Col N="750" /> industry.  That being the case, they are crucial to our exports and to the economy.  Because of that, the Government have no alternative but to continue to invest in that area in the future.  If we do not invest in that area we are cutting the proverbial stick to beat ourselves.  I am sure that on Committee Stage I will have further matters to raise on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am glad the Minister has amalgamated agricultural advisory training and research services.  While other Ministers have talked about doing this, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy has actually brought in a Bill.  This is the appropriate way to proceed with agriculture and it should have been done many years ago.  One of the philosophies of the Fianna Fáil Party is to encourage as many as possible to stay in family farming.  It is very difficult for farmers nowadays as decisions are made in Europe which put constraints on the family farm.  There are constraints on the production of milk, beef and cereals.  As the Minister said, the days of just surviving are gone.  There is fierce competition and the family farm unit must compete with the best.  Given leadership, our farmers have always been able to do a good job.  I congratulate the Minister and his Ministers of State on the leadership they are giving to agriculture.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill gives priority to training and education and to the food research and development areas.  These two areas are complementary and it is important that they be given priority.  I do not forget the whole area of advice. Perhaps the very good advice that is available has been unevenly spread: some farmers have said that they have not been able to get advice.  Farmers nowadays know that they have to look for advice. There is a question of a payment which farmers have made for this.  I hope the advice is worth paying for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest of admiration for the people who work in ACOT.  I was a member of a committee of agriculture. Under this Bill the committees of agriculture will be no more, but members of <Col N="751" /> these committees can still give a great deal of local knowledge and advice, and I hope that advice whether through a body or committee will be available for farmers.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems in agriculture is declining herd numbers which has been one of the topics in all the debates we have heard on agriculture. People involved in the meat factories and the food area have made representations to the Department concerning the suckler cow scheme and the possibility of a reduction in live exports, and have even suggested the import of calves and what is known as the once bred heifer scheme the possibility of taking a calf from a maiden heifer before she is sold off for beef, or a modified form of single suckling.  The Western Research Centre at Belclare, Tuam, have done a great deal of work on this.  People like Michael Diskin, Tom McEvoy and Dr. Joe Sreenan have carried out research on the impact on beef output and financial returns of twinning in the beef herd.  They have identified the scarcity of calves as the greatest single limitation to expanding beef production and have pointed out that increased twin calving showed increased output as well as biological and economic efficiency in suckler beef enterprises.  The An Foras Talúntais magazine indicates that at national level inducing twin calving in 100,000 beef and 100,000 dairy cows will give extra output of £92 million at the farm gate with an export value of £103 million.  Those figures show how important this type of research is.  In their conclusion they have shown how serious this whole question is to farmers.  They have carried out much research on difficult calvings and calf deaths.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out, rightly, the very great necessity for educational training.  He and many speakers in this debate have referred to the great work done by Macra na Feirme.  Recently, addressing the Macra na Feirme national council meeting, he pointed out that he as Minister sponsored vigorously the case for the reintroduction of the scheme of <Col N="752" /> installation aid for young farmers.  I am glad the budget provided for the reintroduction of that scheme and I hope the new authority, Teagasc, when up and running will put young farmers' training at the top of their priority list of tasks. Half the cost of the installation aid scheme will be met a year in arrears from the EC Guidance Fund.  The Government have stated that this scheme with the acceleration of land transfer will be of great benefit to young farmers.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging things the Minister for Agriculture and Food has done since he took office was to negotiate in the EC for extra funding for various schemes of which the installation aid scheme is only one.  I was glad to hear him announce that on 5 November 1987 he lodged a new proposal with the Commission concerning the disadvantaged areas scheme, one of the schemes which are of great benefit in the west, especially where extra headage payments are paid in severely handicapped areas.  If the Minister is sucessful in getting a 70 per cent refund other areas can be brought in.  I understand that approximately £60 million is paid out in headage payments and at the moment 50 per cent of that is refundable from Brussels.  A higher refund, which seems possible in other countries in the EC, will mean headage payments across the board can be paid in all the western counties.  The Minister has also succeeded in getting the western drainage scheme extended until the end of 1988, a considerable achievement which gives farmers to the end of this year, to finish drainage works which were held up because of the very bad weather of 1985 and 1986.  We have also a proposal for a new western package.  These are welcome announcements.  The most important point about these types of schemes is that the money is going directly to the farmers.  We have heard so often schemes announced when much of the benefit has been taken up in administration costs.</P>
    <P>One area being investigated is agri-tourism.  I was glad to hear our MEPs from all parties during recent debates in Europe talking about the way the Guidance Fund through FEOGA will enable <Col N="753" /> them to promote many tourism activities through this kind of agri-business.  I hope the idea of holiday making on farms will be promoted and taken up by farmers. We have constraints on every commodity now and new ways must be found for farmers to make income.  I heard yesterday on RTE a woman who rang in to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; and described herself as a farmer's wife.  She spoke of the difficulty of making ends meet and the whole question of farming being so time-consuming. Sometimes we forget how time-consuming it is and how a whole family can be involved in a particular farming enterprise.  Therefore, these announcements of help from the Guidance Fund for agritourism are important.</P>
    <P>In the past Ministers for Agriculture just talked about providing a great deal of money and so solving many problems in agriculture.  Surely the greatest example of that is the disease eradication programme.  I had a question down to the Minister at the end of 1987 to which he replied that gross expenditure on the whole programme up to the end of 1987 was £390 million.  Even after taking away the receipts for the sale of reactors, recoupment from the EC and the disease levies which farmers have paid, we are still talking about a net expenditure of £260 million, a very high figure.  That does not take into consideration an extra administration cost of £137 million. These figures remind us that we have spent a great deal of money on the scheme but are not making the type of progress we want on disease eradication. I hope the Minister will be able to take this on board and will be more successful than other Ministers have been in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that the merging of these two bodies, AFT and ACOT into this new body Teagasc will be very successful in giving leadership and proper direction to agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start on perhaps not the most serious point of this merger Bill before us but on one that must come between many of us &mdash; including those in the industry &mdash; and our night's sleep, and <Col N="754" /> that is, the name of the Bill.  I implore the Minister not to foist the proposed name on what I hope will be a very successfully merged support group for the most important of all our industries. Other alternatives have been suggested. I have yet to meet anybody who favours the proposed name and I have yet to meet two people who pronounce it the same. It is not likely to be one which will do credit to what we hope will be a very worthy body.</P>
      <P>Two alternative names have been suggested and I am sure that there are many more also.  I want to mention two for the record.  One is AFDA, the Agricultural Food and Development Authority, and the other is ACOTT, An Comhairle Oiliúna Taighde agus Talmhaíochta.  I like the second name because I think the present ACOT have very successfully marketed their logo and it is out there in the forefront of the public in both urban and rural Ireland.  It stands for something specifically related to what is good in agriculture.  By adding a second &ldquo;T&rdquo; it would be very easy to distinguish what this Bill is all about in the minds of the public and, in particular, the farming public.  As I said this is not the most important of issues but it is important that whatever the Bill is called readily identifies in the minds of the public what the Minister is trying to achieve.  The different pronounciations of the name Teagasc do little for the contents of the Bill which I support in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1960 to 1980 output doubled in our agricultural sphere, we quadrupled our use of fertilisers generally, we drained over one-third of our land and we modernised most of our farmyards.  By any standards this was an extremely successful achievement for our country. Now in the mid-eighties we are faced with a different situation &mdash; market saturation, super-levies, quotas and with limited ability to increase production, particularly of primary commodities. However, the farming community continue to need more than ever soundly based research and educational advice as <Col N="755" /> to how to proceed for the next few decades in relation to the most important of all our industries.</P>
    <P>To date, AFT have provided the scientific research and ACOT have given the educational advice.  We will be the only country in northern Europe who will have merged these two functions in the joint body we are now proposing.  I do not say that by way of criticism but it is a fact that other countries in northern Europe have not proceeded along this road and have not thought it necessary to do so.  I hope we have thought out clearly what we are doing and why we are doing it.  I can see substantial benefits provided the new body are not choked at the start by insufficient funding.</P>
    <P>Probably the most critical issue we have got to address in relation to this Bill is whether it can get out of the starting gate at all given the fact that there has been a reduction of over 40 per cent in funding for the two bodies for 1988.  Many of the other contributors have been over this ground in detail but I think there comes a point below which we cannot get either an efficient advisory service or research service to back up that advice to the farming community generally.  The only sin AFT committed over the years was that their public relations were extremely bad.  Perhaps those in ACOT and some of the top farmers knew exactly what was going on in An Foras Talúntais but certainly the general mass of the public had very little idea what was being done behind the doors of the various institutes around the country.  The fact is that marvellous work was done, work that kept us to the forefront in research and scientific development not just in this country but in Europe also.  It is very easy to forget exactly how far the services of ACOT reached and how many countries they were involved in.  I should like to remind the House of their achievements in that regard.</P>
    <P>I can be forgiven perhaps if I draw many of my examples and much of what I say from my experience of the institute at Johnstown Castle which is on my doorstep in County Wexford.  Anything I say <Col N="756" /> pertaining to Johnstown Castle I am sure other Deputies with a similar knowledge of their local institutes could say likewise. I want to give some examples of how far the expertise of Johnstown Castle has penetrated European markets and indeed markets further afield.  They have been involved on behalf of the EC in drawing up the forage map of Europe.  They have been involved with the EC on the feasibility of using Italian rye grass to produce sugar suitable for fermentation to ethanol.  They have been involved in projects in many other countries further afield. They have worked on agricultural projects from two months up to a year in Lesotho, Sudan, the Azores, Trinidad and Zimbabwe.  Students from some of these countries have also received specialist training at Johnstown Castle to enable them to undertake long-term management of development projects in their own countries.</P>
    <P>Our standing, particularly in the research field, is extremely high and one I am sure the Minister is as proud of as I am.  Their sin is that the rest of the country, the general public, do not know and do not appreciate the regard they have been held in by others.  Like many other issues here, perhaps they are looked on more favourably outside this country than within it.  That is their fault: they have been a little reticent in blowing their own trumpet and in telling the public in layman's terms exactly what they are doing and that what they are doing is vital for the future of the agri-economy and the agri-business generally.</P>
    <P>My colleague Deputy Jim O'Keeffe outlined his views quite clearly in relation to his support for most of the Bill and also his reservations about other issues. I should like to support his call for the inclusion of the Farm Development Service, Bord Glas and the research arm of the Department with the new farm authority.  If we can achieve the concept of a total one-stop-shop servicing the total needs of the farmers, big and small, and the agri-industry generally, this will provide the sort of service they will need to see them safely into the next century. The issues facing farmers today are <Col N="757" /> different from those they faced in the seventies and early eighties.  We will have to be highly competitive and be able to produce our primary products and value-added products with the same high technology as is being done by our main competitors, particularly those in Europe.  If the advice and research is not forthcoming, if our research arm is not ahead of the posse and our competitors, there will only be a very short time-lag before our farmers and the agri-business will pay the price.</P>
    <P>Perhaps AFT have not sold themselves as they should have.  However, we should remind ourselves of the extent of their involvement throughout the various arms of the institute.  Doctor Pierce Ryan, the present director did this in a statement he made in December.  May I say as an aside that Dr. Ryan is from Piercestown, County Wexford, virtually the same parish that Johnstown Castle is in, that he is the second director of An Foras Talúntais and it looks like he is going to be the last.  Indeed the first director of An Foras Talúntais was another Piercestown man, Dr. Tom Walsh, whose eminence has gone far and wide beyond the shores of this country.  He has been recognised in my home town of Wexford by the conferring of the freedom of the Borough for his services to agriculture and the agri-industry generally, a most deserved honour.  I think I said that Dr. Pierce Ryan was from Piercestown, he is not, but he is a Taghmon man which is not too far from Piercestown.  We are very proud of both these Wexford men and of their contribution to An Foras Talúntais over the years since it was founded in 1958.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the only hope for the agri-industry is more efficient production of better quality commodities generally together with market led development of new and improved products.  This will demand a high level of technology based on sound research.  Dr. Ryan pointed out in December the broad area that An Foras Talúntais contribute to in the research field.  Research carried out at Johnstown Castle on alternative sources of nitrogen have saved Irish farmers over £15 million per annum.  In addition <Col N="758" /> research there on sulphur has identified one million hectares of grassland which can increase production by over 15 per cent or by an extra £75 million per year for the expenditure of a mere £5 million on fertiliser.  On the dairying front, Dr. Ryan has pointed out that the low cost, highly efficient production systems developed at Moorepark, Fermoy have been worth millions of pounds to dairy farmers.  These farmers acknowledge this by their continued support to AFT on a voluntary basis to the tune of over £1 million every year.  He also mentioned the fact that research by AFT provided vital information in securing the 4.6 per cent derogation from the milk superlevy in 1984.  Indeed my colleague, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Austin Deasy, as Minister for Agriculture, pulled off what was considered a major coup at the time at the Brussels table in getting this derogation for our dairy farmers.  Again, I do not think the value of that derogation has really been appreciated.  Perhaps with the wisdom of hindsight we can all see what an achievement it was.  However, I remember at the time, if I can be forgiven for saying so, that the Minister and his colleagues when they were on this side of the House, were not rapturous about that success.  We should remind ourselves just what an achievement it was.  The country, and particularly the dairy farmers, owe a debt of gratitude to Deputy Austin Deasy for this triumph.  In fact that derogation was worth some £400 million to the nation.  It takes a lot to find £400 million.  It takes a long time to earn and takes a lot of producing in terms of GNP.  Yet over a conference table, with a few late night sessions and some hard-headed negotiations Deputy Deasy was not deflected from the path he set out on and came home with the 4.6 per cent derogation for Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must also recall research breakthroughs in silage preservation by researchers at Grange, County Meath as we discuss the proposed merger of ACOT and AFT.  The silage preservation research has saved farmers over £7 million a year and it has saved them about <Col N="759" /> £12 million in imports.  This is as a direct result of AFT's work.  Indeed it has resulted in an Irish product directly replacing an imported product, the best of what we want for Ireland in the future with regard to import substitution.</P>
    <P>With a reduction in cow numbers and the general shortage of calves the outlook for the beef industry could be disastrous. However, perhaps in the future there is light at the end of the tunnel, thanks to work being done by AFT generally.  The necessary information on once bred heifers is available and it has been pointed out to farmers the direction in which to go.  AFT's research on nutrition and feed formulation has given a 15 per cent improvement in the efficiency of pig production.  This has saved producers about £15 million in feed costs annually in terms of today's prices.  The AFT station at Oak Park has bred a new seed potato, Cara, and this has saved virtually the seed potato industry from extinction. This seed potato provides 6 per cent of the British seed potato market and it is the top variety in Israel, thanks to the work done at Oak Park.  The ordinary Irish punters and, let us be honest, most of us in this House, would not be aware of these facts if they were not drawn to our attention.  In 1985, Cara, the seed potato developed at Oak Park earned over £200,000 in plant breeders' royalties.</P>
    <P>It is not only farmers who benefit from research done by AFT.  As I have said, the dairy industry have benefited enormously.  A new cheese starter perfected and supplied by Moorepark and used to produce 70 per cent of all cheddar cheese in Ireland is now the subject of a new commercial business in Cork.  AFT research has played a vital role in the successful development of the mushroom industry.  Since 1982 1,000 new jobs have been created in the industry and exports of fresh and processed mushrooms are now valued at over £17 million per annum.  As Dr. Ryan has reminded us, for the future agricultural research and development must provide farmers, food processors and policy makers, that is us <Col N="760" /> in this House, with the knowledge needed to adjust to national and international economic forces in the future.  As the Minister is only too well aware, the international forces now more than ever dictate what the future will hold for our farmers, big and small.</P>
    <P>Research and development must be concerned also with the effects of technology on the health and safety of producers, with the nutrition and health of our consumers, with the impact of production practices on the environment and with the general quality of life.  The future for Ireland, particularly with regard to the value added in the agri-business area, the future of our tourism industry and the future of the marine industry, for example, depend to an enormous extent on how we handle our environment and how we appreciate it as a major national resource.  For many years many of us on all sides of this House have given lip service to the importance of our natural resources generally.  Far too rarely, I am afraid, have parties been able to deliver or have been able to turn aspirations into facts.  We have not been able to turn them into hard pounds, shillings and pence which create jobs and involve import sub-which create jobs and involve import substitution and generally point to what we all want for the future of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to merge these two bodies, as I said at the outset, meets with general support from most people concerned for the future of agriculture and the agri-business.  As I have said also, we are the only country in northern Europe to merge both the education and advisory service with the research wing.  I suppose it would be easy to ask how our contribution and how the money we spend on research and advice compares with that spent in other countries.  Again I refer to the recent AFT publication and a most important article on the spending of different countries and different continents on these most important facets.  In other words, what is the balance between research and advisory services in countries and what percentage of agricultural output is devoted to providing research and advice?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> Yale University has done a most interesting study on this area, going back to the fifties right through to the eighties. Most countries of northern Europe, those most akin to ourselves so perhaps we can ally ourselves to them with regard to comparisons, have had a steady increase in the percentage of agricultural output that is going on research.  Corresponding with this has been a reasonable decline in the amount of money spent in the advice area.  The reason for this is quite obvious.  However, I must say that the reverse is true in Ireland.  We have had a decline in the percentage of agricultural output which has gone on research, with a proportionate increase in the amount that has been spent on our advisory services.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  As you know, I have been seeking to raise it for the past three weeks.  First, I am rather disappointed that the Minister is not present to deal with this very serious issue for which he has direct responsibility.  I raise a matter of deep and widespread public concern. At present there seems to be a question mark over whether this State will provide the necessary number of operations to ensure that infants and children are given life-saving operations when they require them.  That this is something which has to be considered by the Minister &mdash; he indicated in the House some weeks ago that it was to be given special and urgent consideration &mdash; is an indictment of the <Col N="762" /> Government and an offence to moral conscience and the commitment to life of the Irish public.</P>
      <P>Concern was raised initially by Professor Conor Ward of Crumlin hospital who, speaking to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, stated that Our Lady's Hospital was unable to meet the demands for heart operations.  We have been witnessing cutbacks in our health services over the past two years, but the situation which has emerged in regard to Crumlin hospital is unique in that three of the senior medical people involved have put their reputations on the line and stated categorically that they are unable to deal with the situation.  Professor Ward indicated that they had need for 300 operations a year, that the 1986 level of 350 might just about enable them to deal with the seriously critical cases but that the required level to deal with the demand for a year was 300, no more.  A crisis in the hospital has resulted from the fact that only 220 operations could be provided last year.</P>
      <P>It was early in January that Professor Ward made these comments.  Very soon afterwards there was public confirmation that the situation was serious.  There was the case of Martin Weldon of Cork who was sent home from Dublin, his operation having been postponed for the third time.  This is a very critically ill child who was thus exposed to the trip up to and down from Dublin and facing unnecessary risks in a very critical condition.  The hospital had no capacity to provide him with an operation because of the limits imposed on it by budgetary restraints. There is a limit on the available number of intensive care beds and on the number of operations which may be performed. In this case, three emergency cases arrived at the hospital and his operation had to be postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael accept the need for efficiency and economy.  In our period in Government we adopted a careful and judicious pruning approach to the need for economy in the health services, but because we value the health services it was exactly that &mdash; a careful pruning. What has happened here is just the thin <Col N="763" /> end of the wedge.  It indicates that the Government's approach to the health services is having widespread consequences, consequences perhaps unseen by the Minister who I know has a commitment to child care and to child services on a personal basis.  What has happened in Crumlin has clearly put children's lives at risk and has moved the working of the hospital onto a margin where calculated risks are being taken all the time.</P>
    <P>What will happen on a day when nine emergency cases present themselves, with the absolute limit on recruitment of staff, on the provision of extra beds &mdash; each intensive care bed requiring five nurses to staff it &mdash; and with the absolute limit on operations?  The hospital could not deal with such a situation.  Because it can only deal with the emergencies, those who are at the top of the waiting list are obviously in a deteriorating medical state and their lives, I have no doubt, are put at risk.  How many of those children who are presented as emergency cases have been weeks and months on that waiting list and have jumped to the top simply because they have had a serious attack and need an emergency operation?  This is no way to manage these services.  I ask the Minister to outline to us here what has been the result of the special and urgent consideration he has given to this area.  Has he come up with proposals? Can he assure us tonight that the situation will be dealt with and that children who need these life-saving operations will be given them?</P>
    <P>A number of approaches are possible. My solution to this problem would be provision for the funding of sufficient extra operations to allow the most critical cases to be dealt with on a planned basis. This would avoid the incidence of emergency cases from among those who are waiting too long on the list and would help both to reduce the incidence of emergency cases and enable the waiting list to be dealt with in a planned fashion. People would know that within a reasonable length of time necessary operations would be provided for their children.  I believe that last year the Minister committed <Col N="764" /> himself also to a review of the situation.  The recommendation of that review by the Department was that operations and service would be restored to the 1986 level.  This would mean that in the region of 260 operations would be provided.  The Department, it seems, recommended this to the Minister and this recommendation has been with the Minister for some time.  However, he has taken no action on foot of that because we reach 1988 with the already critical situation even worsened.  Surgeons who have been told of this report by the Department have never seen it.  They believe that the situation with regard to the waiting list for paediatric surgery is at a point where they are failing to catch up because emergency operations are going to the top of the list.  Had there been, in response to that report of 1986, a restoring last year of the service to the 1986 level, the present critical situation could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I ask anybody to draw a comparison with the British situation.  It is hard to avoid doing this when we have had similar cases hitting the headlines in recent months in Thatcherite Britain.  Again, children have been sent home from hospitals without operations and there was the tragic case of a child dying postoperatively.  Whether that child would have died had his operation been performed in time is something about which people will debate.  It is tragic and totally unacceptable here in Ireland that we should expose our citizens to such conditions, those who are innocent of the economic excesses which brought us to the present problems.  These patients are totally vulnerable and totally dependent on us to give them a certain priority.  The Irish people have spoken out clearly on the value they place on life.  We, as a country, spend in the region of £4 or £5 million on a pro-life amendment which amended our Constitution to ensure protection for the life of the unborn.  There is a cruel and bitter irony about the fact that we now have to consider, however urgently and specially, whether we will spend £5,000 per life saving operation, because it has been assessed that that is <Col N="765" /> the cost of a single operation.</P>
    <P>Crumlin children's hospital has been the first to respond to the demands of the Department that hospitals should develop unit budgeting costs for clinical operations, and the cost indicated for open heart surgery can be quantified.  The figure I have heard quoted is in the order of £5,000 per operation.  This is indeed expensive if one multiplies that amount by 50, the level of increase we are talking about.  But I do not think the Minister has any mandate to do anything other than find that money and resolve that situation because this country has spoken loudly and clearly about the priority to be put on children's lives.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to be reasonable and rational in what I say.  It is not an openended problem.  There is a quantifiable need per year for operations, and hence a quantifiable amount of money that needs to be provided.  However the Minister does it, I hope he will indicate tonight that he has found a way of doing this, that he will make a provision, specifically that he will fund sufficient extra operations to allow, the most critical cases to be dealt with on a planned basis and provide the funding immediately and urgently, because if, tomorrow, nine emergency cases presented, there would be no way in which the hospital could deal with them.  The capacity to respond by specially sanctioned overtime for emergency situations, sanctioned operating time and sanctioned nursing care for intensive care beds would ensure that we would have a proper service for those who need these vital life saving operations so that these people could rest in some peace without the additional trauma over and above the medical problem they have to deal with all their lives. The additional trauma of going into hospital and coming out again, of being built up for operations and being let down again, the exposure to risks of infection and being in a less fit condition for the operation when it finally comes, could be avoided.  It is clear that this situation has deteriorated to the point that senior medical people in the field have, in the light of the cutbacks of the last two years, <Col N="766" /> expressed publicly their concern about the deteriorating situation and about their own ability to cope with it.  It demands an immediate and positive response and that is why I have sought to raise it constantly.  I have raised it because of the inadequacy of the replies which four Deputies in this House have received from the Minister when he was last before this House at Question Time on 9 February ending up with a commitment which has been repeated ever since that special and urgent consideration is being given to the problem. This is totally inadequate and I hope that here tonight the Minister will be able to expand on this and indicate that he has found a way to deal with this critical situation and outline it to us here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank Deputy Flaherty for raising this very important matter in the House tonight.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children has established an international reputation in the field of cardiac surgery for children.  The hospital has been in the forefront of medical advances in this field.  The number of cardiac operations carried out at the hospital has increased steadily, from 39 in 1974 when the cardiac unit first opened to 256 in 1986.  A recent study by Professor O'Conor Ward of results at Our Lady's over a five year period found that survival rates for a number of cardiac procedures were higher than British rates.  The hospital has been particularly successful in reducing mortality from congenital heart disease in the very young.</P>
      <P>At the end of the sixties, mortality from this disease was 40 per cent.  Today, it is only 14 per cent.  These figures not only represent a major medical advance, they also represent an unquantifiable reduction in parental anguish and heartbreak.  Children for whom there was no hope have been given life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In allocating funds to hospitals, I have been concerned to ensure that essential services were protected as far as possible. In 1987, Our Lady's took measures to <Col N="767" /> live within its allocation of £12.2 million which included a reduction in the amount of theatre time available for cardiac surgery and a temporary reduction in the bed numbers in the intensive care and special care units.</P>
    <P>When, during 1987, there was a suggestion that children were not receiving necessary heart operations, I requested the Chief Medical Officer of my Department to examine the situation at Our Lady's and to report to the Minister on his findings.  On the basis of his report, the Minister was satisfied that no child who needed a cardiac operation urgently was denied one because of shortage of funds.</P>
    <P>While the number of cardiac procedures carried out at the hospital in 1987 was slightly down on the number carried out in 1986, contributory factors included the radiographers and junior hospital doctors disputes.  These disputes had a greater impact on elective procedures which could be postponed than on other aspects of the hospital's activity.</P>
    <P>The resolution of these disputes and new work practices which have resulted in maximum use being made of intensive and special care beds, will remove problems which were specific to 1987.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are, and always have been, a feature of the health services. They reflect the gap in every health system between the level of resources required to meet need and the ability or willingness of society to fund that level of service.  We in Ireland do not differ from other countries in this respect.  We do, however, try to keep waiting lists to a minimum.  For many elective procedures, such as coronary by-pass surgery in adults, waiting lists are frequently shorter than in other countries.  At present there are 231 children awaiting heart surgery at the hospital.  This number represents a waiting period of about two years for non-urgent cases.  Urgent cases are being operated on with a minimum of delay. Children on the waiting list are regularly reviewed to ensure that no one is at risk. Even if the hospital had unlimited resources for heart surgery, it would still <Col N="768" /> be necessary to maintain a waiting list. Following diagnosis of an operable heart condition, the surgeons may defer the operation until the child has reached an optimum stage of physical development. The dramatic fall in the birth rate in recent years, suggests that the number of children presenting with operable heart conditions will decline in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate, but a normal, feature of hospital care, that nobody placed on a waiting list for surgery can be guaranteed surgery on a particular day.  A consultant presented with an emergency case, may have to give that patient priority over the patient scheduled for operation on that day.  It may be difficult for relatives of a patient, especially parents of a chronically ill child, whose operation has been postponed, to accept this situation.  However, I am sure that most responsible parents, while naturally wanting treatment for their child to go ahead without delay, would not wish that treatment to be at the expense of another child's life.</P>
    <P>Although Our Lady's Hospital have resolved difficulties which reduced the number of heart operations in 1987 and a decline can be expected in the number of children born with heart defects, I am naturally concerned that any child should have to wait unnecessarily for a heart operation.  I have asked my Department to give special and urgent consideration to how the waiting list for heart surgery at Our Lady's can be reduced.</P>
    <P>The discussions between the Department and the hospital are continuing. The Deputy can be assured that the suggestions she has made will be borne in mind by the Minister and the Department.  Everything possible will be done to bring the 1988 level of output up to that achieved in 1986.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will appreciate that it would require considerable additional resources to reduce the waiting list in this area of high technology.  The hospital and my Department will continue to explore all possible ways of easing this problem.  In the meantime, I want to reassure Deputies and, most of <Col N="769" /> all, the parents of the children involved, that no child who needs a cardiac operation urgently will be denied treatment because of the shortfall in resources.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to compliment the specialist staff and their skill and all the staff of Our Lady's Hospital for the excellent work they are carrying out.  I appreciate very much the points of view expressed by Deputy Flaherty and others in relation to this area.  I want to express the concern of Deputy O'Hanlon, myself and the Department of Health and to say that we will do our utmost to eliminate this serious difficulty. Nevertheless, the Department are limited in the resources available to them at this stage.  Our officials are having discussions with Our Lady's Hospital with a view to improving the situation, which I hope will happen in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, and perhaps up to the Minister's last point, the response was totally unsatisfactory and disappointing.  It indicates that no progress has been made.  However, in the Minister's final comments he said that discussions are ongoing and that every effort will be made to bring the level of operations up to the 1986 level.  Will the Minister undertake to keep myself and other concerned Deputies informed as to the progress being made?  I would like the Minister to make one final comment on how his assessment of the situation is so different from that of the people in charge of the units, Professor Ward and <Col N="770" /> the surgeons, Mr. Wood and Mr. Neligan, all of whom have indicated that they are unable to deal adequately with the demands made on them.  I accept that there will be waiting lists but they should be dealt with on a reasonable basis and those at the top of the list should be assured of treatment.  How does the Minister's assessment of the situation differ so greatly from that of the specialists involved in this area who, as I have said, in a singular way, above any of the other areas of cutbacks, have expressed their concern about the impact of the cutbacks in this specific area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy we will do our utmost to keep the House and the Deputy in particular, informed of developments in this area.  I want to reassure her and the House that discussions are under way between the Department and the officials of the hospital involved.  The question of a difference of opinion is not very relevant because we have responsibility from a funding point of view.  The care of children is particularly emotive and, in a sense, perhaps it is highlighted by vested interests who bring attention to particular areas.  We are very concerned, as Ministers and parents, about this problem but we have an overall budget to administer and difficulties have arisen as a result of cutbacks throughout the service.  In the circumstances we are doing our best to give the best possible service to Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.</P>

      <P>I refused to approve proposed services by Ryanair on the Cork-Dublin route, because I was satisfied with the range and quality of existing services on the route.  I also refused to approve a proposed Aer Lingus service on the Dublin-Connacht route for the same reason.

With this in mind I have indicated to the airlines involved that I proposed to review my decisions in twelve months time in the light of traffic development trends and fares initiatives taken in the meantime by the incumbent carriers.</P>
      <P>As regards fares, I should point out that there is no £89 return fare on the Dublin-Cork route.  The current return fares on the route are: an unrestricted fare of £94; a 3-day excursion fare of £65 and a 7-day pex winter fare of £39.</P>

      <P>Blockage at the December 1987 Council of Transport Ministers of the 40 per cent increase in the European Community quota of international haulage authorisations was due largely to the insistence by some of the larger member states on linking progress in liberalisation of the international road haulage authorisation quota to harmonisation of lorry weights and dimensions and social regulations.</P>
      <P>An existing EC Regulation provided for a 30 per cent increase in the 1985 quota and a 15 per cent increase in each of the subsequent four years to 1989.  We received a 15 per cent increase for 1988 which brought our quota to 420 authorisations as compared with 88 in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Transport Ministers have before them a proposal for the liberalisation of international road haulage operations by 1 January 1993 which includes an annual increase of 40 per cent in the Community quota authorisations up to 1992; thereafter the quota system would be abolished and Irish hauliers who are qualified under EC Regulations to engage in international haulage operations would be entitled to an EC licence. When the Council failed to reach agreement on the 40 per cent increase in December last Ireland subsequently applied under a special procedure for an increase in our 1988 quota.  It is expected <Col N="531" /> that this request will be discussed at the forthcoming Council of Transport Ministers on 14 March 1988.  I will, of course, be pressing for the 40 per cent increase at the Council.  I took the opportunity of a recent visit to Dublin by the Transport Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, who currently hold the EC Presidency, to stress the importance Ireland attaches to this matter.</P>
    <P>Ireland favours the removal of quantitative restrictions on international road haulage between member states, subject to qualitative controls.</P>

      <P>My Department are carefully monitoring the situation in Ethiopia by means of situation reports from the major international relief agencies, information which is made available to it by Irish NGOS involved in relief activities in Ethiopia and through media coverage of the situation.  Ireland contributed £0.369 million in funding and 3,300 tonnes of food aid in 1987 towards the relief operations launched by international organisations and Irish NGOS.</P>
      <P>The most recent reports available indicate that over 5 million Ethiopians will need famine relief assistance during 1988 and that approximately 1.3 million tonnes of food aid will be required for that purpose.  That figure is even higher than food aid receipts during the 1984-85 famine. However, we are pleased to note the recent announcement by the Secretary General of the United Nations that pledges of food aid donations have already reached 1.04 million tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the transport and logistics sector, the UN Secretary General announced that donors have contributed $30 million against overall requirements estimated at $32 million.  Similarly, the donor community is strongly backing the emergency airlift operation in the drought affected north, co-ordinated by the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator (UNDRO).  To date, $8 million has been pledged to the United Nations Emergency Transport Fund, and further funding of $6.8 million has been provided <Col N="534" /> by the European Economic Community, Caritas and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>Large consignments of food aid are currently arriving in Ethiopian ports and although there is a certain amount of port congestion the offloading of these supplies, though slow, appears to be regular.  Civil strife in the severely drought affected regions of Eritrea and Tigre has resulted in the destruction of over 90 trucks since October 1987.  Although the security situation remains tense and precarious food supplies appear to be getting through at present to the worst hit areas both by road and by airlift, but the situation could deteriorate at any time.</P>
    <P>The relief organisations are determined to prevent the formation of relief camps with their attendant risks of epidemics and good food distribution is one of the main ways of avoiding this.  The physical condition of people collecting rations at distribution points throughout the most affected areas is still relatively satisfactory.  This indicates that in these areas relief operations have been timely and effective in helping to avoid famine conditions.  As long as news of continuing food supplies continues to come through, settlement in the feeding centres should not be a major problem.  However, the relief operation is an extremely vulnerable one on account of the security and logistics situation which will face additional strains over the next few weeks as a significant increase in dependency is expected, particularly in the north, as the populations' own meagre food resources are exhausted.</P>

      <P>Some years ago, a scheme of major improvement works, designed to accommodate the run-off following drainage, at some future date, of the remainder of the Boyle catchment, was carried out by the Office of Public Works to the main channel of the Boyle River from Lough Gara to Lough Key.  This scheme entailed the removal of a rock shoal at Tinnecarra, County Roscommon, deepening and widening works up to Lough Gara and the general improvement of the river down to Lough Key.  These works will be maintained under the Boyle catchment drainage scheme currently in progress.  I have received no complaints of increased siltation or flooding of the Boyle River as a result of the current arterial drainage works.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Lung and Breedogue sub-catchments, the Drumanone, Cloonloogh-Tivanagh and Cuppenagh-Kiltybrannock groups of tributaries are included in the current scheme at a total cost, estimated at the commencement of works in 1982, at £70,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 50, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that these Questions have arisen from the proposal to open a Garda station at Dublin Airport.  This proposal does not involve any change in the roles of either the Garda Síochána or the Airport Security Force.  The Garda have responsibility for the overall prevention and detection of crime in the airport area, as in all other areas, while the Airport Security Force is, and will continue to be, responsible for the enforcement of the Airport by-laws.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 72 on 11 February and Questions Nos. 10 and 21 on 18 February 1988, I dealt with the community policing schemes recently introduced by the Garda Síochána on a pilot basis in eight areas of the Northern Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  These schemes do not involve Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice arising out of the reply to <Col N="544" /> Parliamentary Question No. 44 of 2 February 1988, if he will give details of the total amount of money paid to solicitors and barristers under the criminal legal aid scheme; and the amount paid individually to each solicitor and barrister, for the tax years 1983-84, 1985-86 and 1986-87.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the scheme of civil legal aid and advice is concerned, information in relation to the fees paid to senior counsel in the years 1986 and 1987 was given to the House in my reply to a Written Question on 18 February 1988.  I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that similar information in relation to junior counsel is not readily available, and it could not be compiled without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.  Solicitors providing services under the scheme are employed by the board, and are not paid fees.</P>
      <P>In relation to the criminal legal aid scheme the cost of the scheme since its inception in 1965, represented by payments made to solicitors and barristers in respect of fees, expenses or disbursements, is as follows:</P>

      <P>In January, 1987, the Kerry County Airport Company submitted proposals to my Department for the further development of Farranfore Airport, County Kerry.  On examination of these proposals a further grant of £15,000 was made available towards the cost of fire fighting equipment and civil works to protect the airport from river erosion.  This grant brought total Exchequer funding for the airport project to £270,263 consisting of grants of £194,979 from my Department's Vote and a grant of £75,284 from the Western Development Fund administered by the Department of Finance.  This level of assistance has been generous, especially in the prevailing budgetary circumstances.  I regret that it would not be possible for me to accede to the request for a further grant for the airport.</P>

The number operating the extended dental scheme has been steadily growing and now stands <Col N="591" /> at 150.  Some 477 dentists have not as yet agreed to provide dental treatment to dependent spouses under the extended scheme.  Three dentists have refused.

This includes the Dungarvan area.</P>

      <P>Details of the grants due to be paid directly or indirectly by my Department at the end of 1987 were given by me in a written reply to a question by Deputies John Bruton and Ted Nealon on 2 February 1988.  There has been no undue delay in making these payments.  It is in the nature of on-going grant schemes that some payments, approved towards the end of the year, are not made until the following year.  Payment has since been made of all the tree planting grants and approximately £130,000 of the private bog development grants.  The remaining such grants will be paid shortly.  Payment of the fuel efficiency survey grants must await the receipt of certain follow-up information from the applicants.  Any other moneys due at the end of 1987 were part of the on-going costs of running the Department and calculating them would involve an inordinate amount of official time.</P>

      <P>Current regulations require that every vehicle and every trailer attached to a vehicle must be equipped with wings or similar devices, to catch, as far as is practicable, mud or water thrown up by the rotation of wheels, unless adequate protection is afforded by the body of the vehicle.  Enforcement of the existing regulations is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Wings and mudflaps are checked as part of the compulsory annual roadworthiness test for heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances.</P>
      <P>On 12 August 1987, the EC Commission submitted a draft Directive to the Council of Ministers for the internal market proposing the mandatory fitting of more sophisticated spray suppression devices to new heavy goods vehicles and trailers with effect from 1 May 1989.  Reservations have been expressed about the standards for spray suppression devices specified in the draft EC Directive and the EC propose to establish an expert group to examine the draft and make recommendations.  At present the implications of this draft directive are being considered in my Department.  I propose to seek the views of interested road haulage, industrial, motoring and safety organisations about the costs and benefits of the EC draft directive and the operative date.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Employment Appeals Tribunal's practice of deducting social welfare payments from awards of compensation in cases of unfair dismissal.  I understand that the reasoning behind this is the provision in the Act that the employee should be compensated in respect of any financial loss incurred by him which is attributable to the dismissal. Clearly, the financial loss of an unfairly dismissed employee is mitigated by any other income received &mdash; such as social welfare payments or, indeed, remuneration from alternative employment &mdash; and this is simply reflected in the amount of the compensation he is awarded.</P>

      <P>Aspartame is an artificial sweetener which is marketed under the brand name &ldquo;Nutrasweet&rdquo; in Europe and North America.  Aspartame is approved in over 50 countries worldwide including Britain and the USA.</P>
      <P>The product has been examined by the EEC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) and by the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).  These Committees have advised on the basis of scientific data available, including the scientific information on side effects, that the use of Aspartame in food can be considered acceptable from a health point of view. Both committees allocated an acceptable daily intake to the substance of 0 to 40mg/kg of body weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committees also considered the effects of phenylalanine contribution, following consumption of Aspartame, on people suffering from Phenylketonuria <Col N="612" /> (PKU).  The blood levels of phenylalanine in these individuals were raised only slightly and none of them showed any neurological or other clinical abnormal findings, thus supporting the view that large intakes of aspartame in the diet would not cause any untoward effects in these people.  The committee also felt that foetal effects from excessive aspartame consumption by pregnant women, heterozygous for PKU were not likely in view of the available data on phenylalanine levels in maternal blood.</P>
    <P>My Department has forwarded these scientific conclusions to the Irish food industry and these are used as guidelines by the industry.  The Department, in line with the scientific conclusions, asked the industry to name Aspartame in lists of ingredients on food labels, because of the possibility that it may cause the problems mentioned to sufferers from Phenylketonuria.  From the 1st of July, 1988, under the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987, all artificial sweeteners will have to be identified by their specific name, or their E number where appropriate, in the list of ingredients and the labelling of foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my speech during the course of the budget debate. I indicated that the operation of the drugs refund scheme and the long-term illness scheme are being reviewed by my Department in conjunction with the health boards.  Following the review, I hope that it will be possible to make some improvements in the operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> I would also refer the Deputy to the Press Statement I issued on 16 December 1987 where I stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is no proposal to change the existing schemes on 1st January 1988. A comprehensive review of the operation of these schemes is being carried out in conjunction with other aspects of community care services.</P>
    <P>When this review is completed a statement of policy will be made in the new year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime current arrangements remain in place.  I deplore the unnecessary anxiety caused to patients by those who have misrepresented the current position.</P>

      <P>A significant number of pupils in certain classes in the school in question are in need of remedial education.</P>
      <P>For this reason, and as many of the pupils come from a disadvantaged background, this school was allocated two concessionary teaching posts over and above the staffing quota which the enrolment warrants under the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> These posts can be deployed flexibly at the discretion of the school authorities to meet the needs of the school.</P>

      <P>The following criteria apply in relation to the allocation of grants from the surplus proceeds of the national lottery:</P>
      <P>1.  Youth Services:</P>

    <P>2.  Sports Services:</P>
    <P>(i)  Applications for assistance will be considered from voluntary sporting organisations which satisfy the conditions laid down in the grant-in-aid scheme.</P>

    <P>Funding will also be provided in respect of Sport for All activities which contribute to the development of the Sport for All philosophy.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In relation to the following new projects in the sport area in respect of which funding is now being provided, such funding was allocated having regard to the need for such a service and the benefits which will accrue and the financial implications arising from the introduction of such projects.  The projects in question are:</P>
    <P>(a)  the staffing of Outdoor Education Centres:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The establishment of an Irish Coaching Bureau;</P>

    <P>The Government have allocated a total of £6.5 million in 1988 for the provision of a National Sports Centre in Dublin, five Regional Sports Centres and fourteen other Local Sports Centres at various locations throughout the country. These have been identified on the basis of the report of the National Sports Centre Committee and on the basis of applications received in the Department for the provision of such facilities.</P>

      <P>I do not envisage that the financial allocations for 1988, notification of which my Department hoped to convey to vocational education committees in the near future, will have adverse effects for any essential school activities since the priority of maintaining essential second-level school services which was set out in the context of 1987 allocations will again be emphasised to the VECs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> Likewise, I am satisfied that the application of the revised arrangements for the staffing of vocational schools will not involve undue difficulties for the school authorities in providing a suitable programme of instruction for their pupils. My Department has acknowledged on an ongoing basis the involvement of vocational schools with disadvantaged pupils in the context of the allocation of remedial and resources teacher posts to that sector.  These special additional posts will be maintained in 1988.</P>
