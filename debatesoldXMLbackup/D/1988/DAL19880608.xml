      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the guidelines which exist in relation to Government appointments to State boards; and if a maximum age limit applies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines in relation to Government appointments to the boards of commercial State-sponsored bodies were approved by the previous Government in November 1986.  These guidelines cover the competence of appointees, consultation with the chairman of the board concerned and having Ministers meet with new board appointees.  The Government in December 1973 established 70 years of age as the normal upper age limit for persons to be appointed to boards of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the upper age limit of 70 years still in operation?  Where a new chairman is to be appointed &mdash; a person who is not a member of the board &mdash; what consultations take place with board members?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware the age limit of 70 is adhered to.  I am not aware of any deviation from that rule.  I do not know exactly what is the import of the Deputy's question, but it is the duty and the right of the Government to appoint chairmen to State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept from what the Taoiseach says that the age limit is being enforced, and obviously it is the privilege and the duty of the Government to make appointments.  In relation to the recent appointment of a new Chairman to Irish Life &mdash; as the Taoiseach says, the precedent was that discussions would take place with the chairman in relation to appointments, or with board members &mdash; what negotiations took place with anybody in relation to this appointment?  Is it not quite unusual to appoint an elderly man, to say the least &mdash; I do not want to be derogatory about the person appointed &mdash; to the chairmanship of a very important large financial institution in the semi-state area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <P>The maximum lead content of petrol has been reduced, by regulation, in recent years to its present level of 0.15 grammes per litre which is approximately 82 per cent below the 1980 levels.  Regulations were also made in 1986 to allow the introduction of unleaded petrol to the Irish market.  These developments are in line with the requirements of Directive 85/210/EEC.  It is a requirement of that directive that member states should ensure the availability and balanced distribution of unleaded petrol from 1 October 1989 and, at the same time, continue to ensure the availability and balanced distribution of leaded petrol to cater for those cars which will never be able to use unleaded.  Any further proposals in this area would have to be developed in the <Col N="1605" /> context of further measures agreed at European Community level.</P>
      <P>I have set up a steering committee, representative of the Government Departments concerned, the oil companies and the motor trade to develop and to oversee a comprehensive campaign to promote the wider use and availability of unleaded petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When precisely does the Minister anticipate there will be only unleaded petrol used in Irish motor vehicles?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1989 date requires us to have a balanced distribution of unleaded petrol available from that date. There is a very high proportion of cars in this country that can use only leaded petrol.  I do not think it would be possible at this time &mdash; certainly not in the immediate future &mdash; to contemplate a situation where cars could use only unleaded petrol.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 17, 35, 41 and 183 together The Government are committed to a fundamental overhaul of the local government system which will include structures, functions, finance and legislative reform.  Since becoming Minister I have been conducting an intensive review of the system with a view to devising an appropriate package of measures which together will form the basis of a coherent and comprehensive reorganisation programme. As part of this process I have had consultations with various bodies representing local government interests including the County Council's General Council and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of local authority powers and functions is a matter of central importance to the reform programme. Local authorities already have very wide powers under the Planning Acts to <Col N="1607" /> engage directly in development and enterprise, either on their own or in combination with other interests.  The question of extending these powers still further is under examination and it is also proposed to significantly relax the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> which can at times have the effect of inhibiting local authority initiative.  Legislation will be necessary to effect these changes and this will also include the necessary provision to enable various functions to be devolved from the central to the local level.</P>
    <P>The question of changes in the local government system in the Dublin area, including the most appropriate arrangements for areas such as Howth, Baldoyle and Sutton is a matter which falls to be considered as part of the general review of local government which I have undertaken. Work on the reorganisation programme is now well advanced and full details will be announced as soon as possible. At this stage it would be premature to comment further on any individual aspect of the proposed reorganisation programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister in his Department's review of the overall functions, structures and reforms of local authorities specifically is it still intended to consider the introduction of a greater Dublin authority to oversee the three existing local authorities functions and areas?  In view of the remarks he has made regarding the <i>ultra virus</i> rule and the powers and scope of local authorities even at this moment to engage in independent activities, would the Minister consider issuing a circular of advice on his Department's views on the extent to which local authorities can or should engage in activities of this nature?  Finally, in regard to that area, and I have no doubt he is aware of the geographic nonsense &mdash; if one could use that expression &mdash; of the cutting off of the Howth, Baldoyle, Sutton areas from the greater Dublin City Council area would he consider as an interim measure, in view of the strongly held wish in those areas to be reunited with their hinterland <Col N="1608" /> in Dublin city, an amendment of the 1985 Act to enable their return in the immediate future and not await what will obviously be very long and detailed reform legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All the things referred to by the Deputy are under consideration in this review.  Regarding the question of the greater Dublin area so far as local authorities in the Dublin area are concerned, it is a very important aspect and will be part of the review.  Regarding the <i>ultra virus</i> matter, I intend to do something about it and I have given a commitment on it.  Whether it can be done immediately or whether we must wait to do it as part of a package I do not know but I will consider it further.  Representations have been received from Dublin Corporation advocating the return of the three areas referred to by the Deputy and that will be considered in connection with the reorganisation.  I do not think it would be wise to do it in a patchy way.  Requiring legislation as it does, it is better to do it as a unit.  I will consider the items referred to; they are already being considered in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Dublin is celebrating its Millennium, would the Minister agree that special attention to reform in Dublin would be justified in this year?  Would he give consideration to issuing a White Paper later in the year on the whole question of reorganisation in the Dublin region?  Would the Minister agree further that local government in Dublin is neither local nor government and would he consider the suggestion of a popular directly elected Lord Mayor as part of the considerations for inclusion in a White Paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is injecting new matter into the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right that something needs to be done about the Dublin situation.  It is a huge task and it is exercising the minds of the Department and the Minister at this time.  I do <Col N="1609" /> not know whether any useful purpose would be served in doing something immediately so far as the Millennium is concerned.  The Deputy is right that it requires attention and it is getting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about a White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be given to considering that at this time unless a very good argument was made in support of it because we are snowed under with reports and commission reports about reorganisation of local government for the past 15 years.  There are already seven there for viewing and I do not think that adding another commission report or White Paper would necessarily mean improving the situation.  All the evidence we want is there; it is a question of taking the right decisions and hopefully getting unanimous support in the House for it. It is important to get unanimous support for matters concerned with local government and I hope that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the local elections some three years ago the Minister's party indicated that grants administered from central sources in many Departments could be more effectively administered through local authorities and that these would be identified and their responsibilities transferred.  Why has no progress been made on that?  Is it absolutely necessary to wait further in view of the undertaking then given, which presumably was given on the basis of some study?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions relate to structural reform as distinct from financial arrangements so far as local authority funding is concerned but I take the point. It would be my opinion that the two should run together.  Structural reform and the financing arrangements and funding of local authorities should be taken simultaneously to get the right result. Without going too deeply into it, let me say that maybe that is what is holding up one as against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a <Col N="1610" /> fairly comprehensive reply.  Would I be right in assuming that the Government have implicitly rejected the previous Government's proposals for local government reorganisation in the Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are considering that as far as the new possible arrangements are concerned.  The previous Government announced a major devolution programme in May 1985 but little progress, if any at all, was made in the implementation of that programme before the Government left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government left on the Minister's desk a blueprint in relation to a number of local authorities in the Dublin area.  Indeed, the last local elections provided for an increase in the number of councillors throughout the city and county area.  Am I to take it that the present review as the Minister described in his reply explicitly rejects the previous Government's proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not implicitly reject it.  That is one of the things being considered and the document, as the Deputy says rightly, was there and that was the cause, I understand, of the election of 78 people anyway.  That is still being considered in the overall.  I cannot give an indication yet as to whether I will go completely with what is suggested in that but it has to be looked at.  Things as they are are unsatisfactory at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the substantive answer to the original question, can the Minister indicate whether there is any fundamental difference between what he is considering now and the general scheme of a Bill on local government reorganisation which was adopted by the previous Government in the middle of 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather not be drawn on it now.  I think that is not the way to get the best advantage from any reorganisation on local government that we have considered.  I would like to have the Government see it and clear it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I could draw on an aspect of Question No. 41 in the name of Deputy De Rossa.  There appears to be a stronger view in the original reply of the powers and functions of local authorities to engage in commercial activity.  Could I suggest that the Minister might circularise local authorities on that aspect particularly in view of the shortfall of funds for local authorities in each of the years' Estimates available?  The other matter I wanted to raise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I give an indication about that I am going to be asked every month from now on why it did not arrive on that day.  Rather than do that, the Deputy might put down a question again for the next time environmental questions are taken.  As far as job creation and promotion are concerned, I have had a close <Col N="1612" /> look at section 77 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which gives quite substantial powers to local authorities to promote, assist, and carry out developments themselves. Under section 14 of that Act they can encourage tourism and become involved with development companies. They have a wide range of powers. Maybe it is a question of <i>ultra vires</i> which has prohibited them from going the full distance in that.  I intend to remove that inhibition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will alter the regulations whereby the State grant of £2,000 for first time house purchasers could be paid with the consent of the individual assignee in the form of a block grant to a housing co-operative which is properly constituted and recognised by the local authority and by his Department for the <Col N="1616" /> purposes of housing construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Eligibility for the £2,000 grant is confined to persons who are first time house purchasers and who comply with the statutory conditions of the scheme.  It is open to any grant recipient to assign or authorise payment of their grant to a third party including a housing co-operative.  I have no proposals to alter these arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be familiar with the background to the question as a result of my contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Housing Bill. Will the Minister agree that the problem remains, that while individuals can assign in a limited fashion the block payment of four or five grants they are not facilitated in the way I am suggesting under the regulations?</P>

      <P>The Deputy made a case about this on Second Stage and I have not had time to consider his views since. I know what he is getting at, but he will understand that, under existing regulations attached to the £2,000 new house grant, the entitlement is dependent on the applicant complying with the conditions of the scheme.  Applicants can assign such grants to banks, building societies, credit unions, contractors and so on, but I have not considered it appropriate to alter the regulations in the way suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The feasibility of recycling wastes is largely dictated by the economics of materials recovery and re-use. My colleagues, the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Energy, have an interest in the matter in so far as resource and energy conservation is involved and State agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority and Eolas can give practical advice and assistance to industry in this area.  My concern with recycling arises mainly in the context of the waste collection and disposal services provided by local authorities, including the removal from the waste stream of elements which tend to create litter and degrade the environment.  Local authorities have been encouraged to provide facilities for the recovery of certain wastes and my Department operate a scheme of capital grants to encourage the development of recycling facilities.  This has contributed substantially to the development of glass recycling in the Dublin area.  I am keeping under review the possibility of developing other measures to promote recycling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from keeping the matter under review, has the Minister any other initiative in mind to encourage a positive attitude towards making maximum use of waste materials and, wherever possible, to recycle them, including separating certain kinds of waste and, perhaps, utilising some waste for district heating schemes or otherwise converting the refuse in this way?  Has the Minister any initiative in mind or will he be proposing any policy in regard to waste disposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Deputy in saying that we should do what we can to recycle waste and get some good use from it, as long as it is cost effective.  Quite a lot has been done in this regard.  The Deputy will be aware that I support Rehab in their glass recycling project. Their programme is operating in the Dublin area and local authorities have <Col N="1618" /> been very supportive.  In fact, many of the larger retail supermarket chains have been encouraging people to collect bottles for recycling.  The Dublin local authorities have provided bottle banks at their tipheads.  I have made funds available this year to give some small grants to local recycling projects run by needy groups and voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>I would like others to come forward with suggestions.  We have a little money to accommodate them if they do so.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a feasibility study in progress on the question of toxic waste disposal.  The tender date for doing that work expires shortly, if it has not already passed.  When the study is complete &mdash; I gave three months for that work to be carried out &mdash; we will be in a better position to assess the extent of the problem and how best we can dispose of waste and how much of it we can recycle.  I would be interested to hear from people, or organisations, who need help in regard to waste recycling.</P>

      <P>I welcome the interim report of the Ballymun Task Force.  The management and maintenance of their rented dwellings is a matter for the local authority concerned.  However, my Department have, in the context of the remedial works scheme, been pressing the corporation to develop, in co-operation with the residents, initiatives in relation to the improved management and maintenance of these dwellings.  The interim report of the task force, on which <Col N="1623" /> the corporation and the residents are represented, is a welcome step in this direction. It is, however, important to distinguish between the structural design and management aspects of refurbishment. In regard to structural matters, the corporation have sought financial assistance from my Department under the remedial works scheme in respect of a number of estates and an allocation of £2.3 million was made to them this year in respect of their priority projects.  It is a matter for the local authority to submit a proposal in respect of Ballymun for consideration under the scheme in the context of their priorities, the demands by other authorities and the amount of capital available.  In connection with remedial works, new approaches to the management of estates are essential to ensure that the benefits of such works would be sustained.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 22, together.  According to returns of operations under the Litter Act, 1982, furnished to my Department by local authorities in respect of the year 1987, the total cost of the litter warden service was £258,000.</P>
      <P>The number of prosecutions brought by local authorities for litter offences was 229 and convictions were secured in 138 cases.  In addition, fines-on-the-spot were imposed in 684 cases.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In making this year's amenity grant allocations, I found it possible to assist ten projects for which grants allocated by the previous Administration in 1987 had been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain or justify some grants under the existing round of allocations?  For example, grants to organisations which are carrying out substantial work in conjunction with young people were withdrawn by him early in 1987 and have not been renewed since that time.  Can he explain the basis on which he arrived at some of the conclusions which he reached in relation to this year's round of allocations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can.  I take it the Deputy is aware I gave grants to ten of those projects from which grants had been withdrawn previously.  It is to be hoped that there will be another occasion as well.  Who is to know?  I had to take cognisance of the criteria, such as desirability of the project.  I was very concerned about that.  I had also to consider the cost-effectiveness of the project being submitted for support and was very <Col N="1636" /> anxious about the number of jobs that each individual project might create.  I was particularly anxious that the available funds would be distributed on an equitable basis throughout the whole country.  The requirement in money to meet the more than 2,000 applications received would have come to £61 million approximately.  I had £6 million and it was impossible to accommodate everybody.  I know many people were disappointed and I can understand that.  However, the more than 500 applications that were successful in regard to big and small grants I am sure are a source of great pleasure in the way they were allocated.  When there are over 2,000 applications and all you can accept are 500, there will have to be disappointments.  It is not as if the lottery funds were terminating; there will be another occasion.  These projects have not been discarded.  As proof of that fact, some of those that had been given allocations under a previous Administration have found their way onto the list for funding this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that fact, credence is given to a statement which I made previously that those previous grants have been properly made to bona fide organisations that have submitted proper details.  The Minister has accepted that in relation to a number of them, but not in relation to certain organisations. In particular, I am thinking about an organisation, a rugby club in my own area, which provides considerable assistance to over 200 young people under 18 years of age.  They have been deprived of a grant which was allocated to them early in 1987, and refused a grant again during this year.  How can the Minister justify removing a grant allocated to an organisation designed to help young people while grant aiding organisations such as golf clubs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that the amount of money available to me last year was a reduced provision of £4 million.  How could I give out £10 million for the work with only £4 million available to me?  I had to withdraw the grants <Col N="1637" /> and then when the money became available from the £6 million lottery funds at this time I had another look at these projects.  They were not discarded or thrown aside just because it was the Deputy or anyone else who had put them up originally.  Ten of these projects have received an allocation.  I have sympathy for those who could not be accommodated this time.  Let us take, for example, the case of St. Bridget's GAA clubhouse to which the Deputy allocated £35,000.  I thought they could not get by on that amount and increased it to £50,000 this year.  I would have thought that the Deputy would have been much more supportive of their requirements. The applications of those who could not be accommodated this year are still in good standing and will be considered if and when further funding becomes available. More than that I cannot do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to ask this question, but feel bound to.  I cannot understand, and perhaps the Minister can explain, why it is that an organisation helping several hundred young people, the Skerries Rugby Football Club, and an organisation helping approximately 100 young people, the Skerries Sea Scouts, should have had grants withdrawn from them and are not being grant aided in this round.  Is there any significance in the fact that both of those organisations happen to be based in the town in which I live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no significance whatsoever.  I would have to put it to the Deputy that I have the same sympathy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same sympathy for the more than 1,600 applications in respect of which I could not allocate any money as I have for those from the Deputy's <Col N="1638" /> home town.  I make no secret about that.  I will ask the Deputy to bear in mind that it was extremely important, seeing that the allocation was being made from surplus lottery funds, that these be distributed in an equitable way over the whole country.  I did that and it was appreciated by everybody.  I am not so sure the Deputy was as conscious of that kind of equity when he had the opportunity to divide the money available to him, seeing that 13 counties got nothing at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the mandate which I had was different from the one that he has, in that my instructions were to see a proportion of something in the ratio of 3 or 4:1 of the Exchequer moneys available allocated to areas of high population density.  The minority was to be allocated to rural areas and that is the reason for the allocation being based as it was.  I must ask the Minister to look carefully at the organisations which remain non-grant aided from that initial allocation of 1987.  I am sorry to have to say that a disproportionate amount would seem to be based in areas contiguous to where I reside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a quick reply to the Deputy.  I have allocated money to ten projects of the kind that the Deputy is talking about, from which allocations had been withdrawn.  If the Deputy had stretched his imagination a little further when he was making the allocations, he might have considered at least one project in the 13 counties that he left without anything at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the plans, if any, he has in relation to the dumping of untreated wastes and other toxins into Irish waters, including the sea, rivers and bays; when these will be implemented; his proposals in relation to Dublin Bay; whether the present proposals include any plan to deal with untreated wastes from the whole north city area; and whether he or his Department has written to the European authorities asking them not to fund consumer-inspired or consumer association organised studies in relation to this type of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Dumping at sea is controlled by the Minister for the Marine under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 and is allowed only where this option is considered environmentally acceptable and is the only practical solution available for disposing of the material involved.  I am advised that there is no authorised dumping of industrial wastes into the Irish Sea from sources in this State.  The only dumping which occurs involves sewage sludge and dredged spoil from harbours and is subject to permits issued by the Minister for the Marine, which set conditions designed to avoid pollution. Industrial wastes are dumped at one location off the south coast in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>The input of pollutants to rivers is controlled by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 under which all point discharges of trade effluents must be in accordance with the terms of a licence issued by the relevant local authority. These licences incorporate necessary safeguards designed to protect the receiving waters.  As part of the Government's general programme to tackle water pollution, I have requested all local authorities to review existing licences and licence conditions where this is necessary, to ensure that pollution does not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While local authority sewage discharges are exempted from the licensing <Col N="1640" /> requirements of the 1977 Act, local authorities may be prosecuted under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 where such discharges cause pollution.  Moreover, I intend that investment in the provision of new and improved sewage treatment facilities will continue at a high level.</P>
    <P>As regards the situation in Dublin Bay, I hope to give a decision within a matter of weeks on proposals from Dún Laoghaire Corporation seeking approval of contract documents for a pipeline to transfer sewage which discharges off the west pier, Dún Laoghaire, to the Ringsend treatment works.</P>
    <P>Survey work in connection with the preparation of a water quality management plan for Dublin Bay is continuing. This work is designed to build up scientific data on the condition of the bay and the effects of particular inputs and it is essential for the preparation of a plan to ensure that the bay is protected on a long-term basis.  The plan will also provide the basis for an integrated approach to pollution control, including determination of the appropriate level of treatment for sewage discharges in the longer term.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor the Department have asked the European Commission not to fund pollution studies by any group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to place a great reliance on the fact that legislation and regulations exist which place specific obligations on local authorities but would he accept that these regulations are ignored to a very significant degree and that there is a great deal of illegal dumping?  I ask the Minister to refer specifically to the part of the question which refers to the present proposals in relation to Dublin Bay and to indicate whether his plan will be able to deal with the problem of discharges from the north city area, or is it simply a plan for the south side of the city?  Finally, can the Minister tell us whether he believes in principle that the discharge into water of untreated waste or sewage is wrong and repugnant from every point of view, environmentally and ecologically, and <Col N="1641" /> would he do everything possible to ensure that such discharges come to a halt?  Already we have seen over the past couple of weeks a spate of spillages poisonings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is dumping off the south coast under one licence granted by the Department of the Marine.  I concede that there is dumping of dredged spoil from a number of harbours in the Irish Sea and there is some dumping of sewage sludge from Dublin Corporation's Ringsend treatment works.  I am satisfied from the technical information available to me that the pumping of sewage from the south side of the city, from Coliemore, from the West Pier and from Bulloch Harbour across the bay to the Ringsend treatment plant will ease this problem considerably.  I am also advised that there is excess capacity in the Ringsend plant. I have given approval to the new scheme and the documentation for the pipeline arrived in my Department last week.  It is my intention to allow it go for tender in a few weeks to have this matter finally sorted out.  I accept that discharging raw sewage into receiving water is not a satisfactory way of disposing of effluent and I am doing what I can with the available resources to deal with this problem.  Over £200 million has been spent since 1983 on sewage treatment works around the country.  There has been and will continue to be a high level of investment in such treatment works.</P>

In view of the hardship which is being imposed on these people, would the Minister consider it as one of his priorities to issue as a preliminary that particular entitlement so that all tenants can benefit under the rent allowance system which is in place and being administered by his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare?</P>

I will keep his representations in mind in so far as any further action is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to these questions on behalf of the Minister for Labour who is abroad on official business.</P>
      <P>Only last Thursday, 2 June, the Minister for Labour gave the House a fully detailed account of the extent of the involvement of the conciliation service and the Labour Court in disputes in this company.</P>
      <P>In February 1987 the first conciliation conference on the dispute in progress at that time took place.  The conference failed to resolve the dispute and the issue went to the Labour Court which issued a recommendation in March 1987.  Management rejected the recommendation. It was not until September 1987 that a further conciliation conference could be arranged.  Management proposals put forward at that conference were rejected. Three further conciliation conferences were held in October 1987 and again without agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court intervened in the dispute on 22 October 1987 under section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. That section of the Act allows the court to go into a dispute on is own initiative if it considers that there are exceptional circumstances which warrant it doing so. Labour Court hearings took place on 28 and 29 October 1987 and a detailed recommendation on all aspects of the dispute was issued by the court on 30 <Col N="1644" /> October 1987.  While the recommendation led to the ending of the strike early in November 1987 problems arose over the return-to-work formula and the proposed redundancies.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court became involved again and held a further hearing into the dispute on 15 February 1988, when it issued a recommendation on the redundancy payment element of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court became involved again on 30 March 1988 and issued a recommendation the same day.  Notwithstanding the Labour Court recommendation, difficulties persisted over selection for redundancy and the level of redundancy compensation.  The strike restarted on 11 April 1988 and concilliation conferences on 15 April and 12 May failed to resolve the dispute.  On Wednesday last, 1 June, the Labour Court held a further hearing in Longford but no progress was made.</P>
    <P>I have again outlined for the benefit of the House the extent to which the conciliation service and particularly the Labour Court have been involved in this dispute.  Further intensive efforts over the holiday weekend to reach a solution have not succeeded in bringing about a return to work.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Labour indicated to the House the Labour Court is on standby if it is felt that its further involvement can help in this dispute.  The parties are aware of the availability of the court, at short notice, should they consider the court can be of any further help.  It is clear from what I have said that the court has been unstinting in its time and expertise in trying to bring about an amicable settlement in this dispute.</P>
    <P>In the light of the continued availability of the Labour Court I see no useful purpose being served by asking the court to become involved again in this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined in a very clear and concise way the history of this dispute.  Last week the Minister for Labour painted a very depressing picture when in fact there was still a possibility that something could be done.  Over the weekend discussions were <Col N="1645" /> held.  The attitude of the Minister for Labour was very depressing at that time. Could the Minister say, on behalf of the Minister for Labour, whether he has considered the implications of the dialogue that took place over the weekend, indicating whether the gap has narrowed in any way?  Furthermore, could he say if there is anything further the Minister for Labour can do in this regard in order to bring the sides together and save the factory for the town of Longford?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is fully aware of the situation and, as I have outlined, has been keeping in very close touch with developments there.  On the other hand, there must be a willingness on the part of people to find a solution, if there is to be one found to this problem, which has not proved to be the case to date.  There must be a willingness on the part of the parties involved to use the expertise and services of the Labour Court if there is to be a solution found to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most dissatisfied with the Minister's answer notwithstanding the efforts of the Labour Court and everybody else over the past weekend. Could the Minister simply address himself to this question.  First, if this factory were to close down it would be a tragedy. Would the Minister agree that what we cannot afford to allow happen is the loss of 200 jobs not only to Longford but to the country?  Is the Minister for the Marine saying that both the Ministers for Labour and Industry and Commerce have failed in their efforts and are giving up attempting to solve this dispute?  Furthermore, would the Minister say what is happening at present in these Departments with regard to this dispute?  Have any instructions been issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce to the IDA who were involved in the initial stages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Strenuous efforts have been made by the Labour Court conciliation services, the Labour Court itself, by the parties involved in the dispute and numerous other people who have endeavoured to mediate in order to find a solution to the problem but in spite of those efforts no solution has been found to date.  What I have said on behalf of the Minister for Labour is that the Labour Court is on standby and is available if the parties feel it is worth-while intervening. It is ready, willing and available to intervene in such circumstances.  There is nothing further I can add to that at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply suggested there was an unwillingness to resolve the dispute.  Could the Minister say if that unwillingness is on both sides or on one side only in view of the fact that the Labour Court, in a previous submission, said that the management was unreasonable?  Since part of my question was not answered, may I ask the Minister if he intends taking any measures to prevent the relocation of the plant in the United Kingdom?</P>

      <P>The question which has been addressed to me is in relation to the efforts which have been made, and which can be made still, because the Labour Court is available and on standby in order to be of help.  It is not for me to get into this very involved and complicated issue at this stage.  There has been much dialogue in relation to this dispute.  In circumstances in which a package put to the workers recently, and in respect of which the Labour Court went guarantor, was rejected by 155 votes to 6, it is very <Col N="1647" /> difficult to see how agreement can be reached.</P>

      <P>This is the second successive Question Time in which we have discussed the Hanlon affair.  On the last occasion the Minister for Labour indicated it was the most bitter dispute with which he has had to deal and he foresaw no prospects of an intervention by him; he saw the position as hopeless. Since then there have been attempts at mediation on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the bishop and the administrator.  In those circumstances, would the Minister for Labour reconsider his position and see a role for himself to intervene to try and succeed where others have failed, though apparently have come close in the last couple of days?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect of finding a solution to this problem, as indeed in all complicated disputes of this nature, is through the recognised procedures of conciliation in the Labour Court where there are skilled personnel available and on standby to find a solution, if possible, and if it is possible to get the parties together to reach an agreement in this dispute which has evaded resolution to <Col N="1648" /> date I must reiterate that the Labour Court is on standby to intervene, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I have a brief supplementary arising directly from the Minsiter's reply.  The Labour Court has tried valiantly to reach a solution, as he outlined in his reply.  Over the past few days there has been recourse to other channels, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the bishop and the administrator. In those circumstances does the Minister not foresee an opportunity for an approach now outside the Labour Court structures by the Minister for Labour?</P>

      <P>Portion of my question has not been answered by the Minister.

I understand there may be certain measures available to him, and to other Ministers in the Cabinet in association with him, to prevent the relocation of the plant outside the country. Is it correct that large grants, to the extent of £300,000 in the case of one company and £700,000 in the case of another &mdash; in the same name &mdash; have been given?</P>

Last November the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of European Communities reported on the Product Liability Directive from the EC and recommended that it should be introduced to the Oireachtas by primary legislation.  That report was followed up by a letter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who answered a Parliamentary Question from me on 31 May.</P>
      <P>He said he intended to introduce the legislation to this House and considered that it was very important. Unfortunately, 31 July is the implementation date which the EC has laid down for this legislation to be brought into operation in all member states and I understand our nearest neighbour Britain has already brought it in.  I want to ask the Taoiseach if this legislation will come before the House before the EC deadline; if not, have we informed the European Commission and our partners in Europe that it will not be and when will the legislation be introduced in the House?</P>

During the last fortnight there have been a number of unfortunate incidents of serious pollution, including ones in counties Longford, Kilkenny, Meath and elsewhere and the pollution of a river in County Longford by a lethal dose of cyanide. The Minister for the Environment, during the course of his contribution on the Department of the Environment Estimate on Friday, indicated that soon there would be legislation to deal with this very serious, degenerating problem.  I know he is concerned about this problem but I wonder what is the prospect of having legislation to deal with this extremely serious problem as soon as possible so that we will not have a repetition of last summer's disasters?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 26, after &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to promote the development of a community sound broadcasting service which is democratically owned and controlled by the community, has a cooperative or other non-profit distributing structure and is used as a means of community development and&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>We put down this amendment on Committee Stage.  We re-entered it on Report Stage because on further consideration of the functions of the commission and the criteria they are obliged to consider for the allocation of licences, we are not satisfied that the commission are sufficiently obliged to promote community broadcasting, particularly community radio broadcasting.  The wording of the amendment adds a further obligation on the commission in section 4 in that it shall be the function of the commission:</P>
      <P>to promote the development of a community sound broadcasting service which is democratically owned and controlled by the Community, has a co-operative or other non-profit distributing structure and is used as a means of community development.</P>
      <P>The reason we have re-entered this amendment is that we are not satisfied that the functions given to the commission under section 4 sufficiently enable them to take on the role of promoting community radio.  On Committee Stage the Minister claimed that section 6 (2) (h) gives adequate coverage for community radio.  It states:</P>
      <P>(h) the extent to which the service proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  serves recognisably local communities and is supported by the various interests in the community, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> (ii)  Serves communities of interest, and </P>
    <P>It is clear those two criteria could be met by any commercial station and that it is not adequate to enable community stations to have a reasonable chance of getting licences from the commission.  In view of the importance of community broadcasting in the development of local cohesion in the community, it is important that our amendment be accepted.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I gave examples of areas which urgently needed the kind of communication which a local broadcasting station could provide.  It is also important that adequate access is available to the means of communicating with each other in order to have a healthy democracy.  There should be communication not only from the point of view of leisure pursuits such as music and drama but from the point of view of communicating information relating to what is going on in an area and in relation to discussing issues that arise in an area. It is only through a community broadcasting station that this kind of communication can take place adequately. The commission should have the right and the power to promote community stations.</P>
    <P>Commercial interests will have the wherewithal to promote their own interests and to present a well-packaged proposal to the commission.  They will have the resources to indicate how they will provide the various systems and infrastructure required for local radio, whereas a community which will depend entirely on voluntary effort will more than likely not have available to it the same kind of expertise and support. Therefore, we argue that there should be an obligation on the commission to promote the development of community sound broadcasing on the basis that these community stations would be democratically owned and controlled by the community.  The section which the Minister regards as adequate in this regard, section 6 (2) (h) is not adequate and would, by and large, mainly assist those who have a commercial orientation.</P>

      <P>I am in general sympathy with the amendment put down by The Workers' Party in that community broadcasting is something that everybody in the House is keen to see developed and fostered.  Deputy De Rossa has spent some time outlining the form of community broadcasting he would like to see coming on stream.  I do not disagree with him and I would like to see it encouraged, but will the Minister tell me, if he believes this is catered for already in the Bill, under what section it is catered for?  I know Deputy De Rossa referred to section 6 (2) (h) which just gives an indication of the intention of the Bill, but is there a duty on the commission, particularly when they invite applications from interested parties, to involve themselves in broadcsting contracts?  Will the commission be obliged to distinguish between what is a genuine community broadcasting intention and will they be obliged to give full consideration to all genuine community broadcasting interests that are brought to their attention at the time when they do the initial trawl, when they invite applications for broadcasting contracts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  We have to recognise that when the title of the Bill was changed, any hope of introducing community radio was jettisoned.  The original Bill suggested that community broadcasting would be democratically controlled and that has been my party's position for the past ten years.  I regret that neither the Minister nor his predecessor was favourably disposed towards our draft.  I would like to see greater community involvement.  The Bill as presented will not cater for that.  There is no compulsion on the commission to ensure that there is proper community broadcasting.  The Bill largely ignores the educational role of broadcasting.  There was correspondence between the Minister and the National Association of Adult Education regarding the use of broadcasting for educational purposes but things were not resolved to the satisfaction of the National Association of <Col N="1763" /> Adult Education.  They were not happy with the communications they had with the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>Last week reservation was expressed as to whether the full news complement could be maintained in local broadcasting. I ask the Minister to consider the suggestion that some of the time intended for news coverge should be used for educational purposes.  Many of the stations will be hard-pressed to provide a news slot as provided in the Bill.  As an alternative, there could be a news and education slot and some of the time that was supposed to be spent on news coverage could be given over to educational requirements.  In doing that we would be providing a service.  This is something that deserves consideration.  It would help many people who did not have the opportunity of progressing beyond first or second level education and who may be confined to the home for one reason or another and who may not be able to partake of second level education.  I give the example of people who are handicapped and who would not have access to a school or people who are in receipt of social welfare and who are now debarred from taking courses in education on the basis that they are not available for work.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the radio system used for this purpose and I would like to ask the Minister if something could be done in this area.  It would also entail getting agreement from the other parties as to whether it could be changed at this late stage.  I feel it would go a long way towards involving the community.  I will be supporting the amendment put forward by Deputy De Rossa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was one which was discussed on Committee Stage in a number of contexts.  I put down a similar amendment.  We also discussed the whole issue of the functions of the commission and whether we should attempt to give the commission functions that would set out, in general terms, what we would like to see achieved.  At the <Col N="1764" /> time the Minister felt that this was redundant, that these were rather pious statements of intent and that everything was already contained in his criteria.  The criteria are limited to an extent in that it is only if proposals are forthcoming of a certain nature that the commission can consider this element in them.  If no proposals come forward of that nature that item becomes redundant.</P>
      <P>What many of us had in mind when we raised this issue was that there will probably be a need for the commission who will over time become the centre of a great deal of knowledge and expertise in the area of broadcasting.  There will be a need for that commission to support community groups in some small way by way of information being available to them, to meet them and discuss how they would set about putting together a package. That is why all on this side of the House felt there was a need for a more explicit statement of obligation or duty on the commission to do that.</P>
      <P>The reason there is so much concern is that at the early stage when the Minister discussed his proposals, while he clearly acknowledged the desirability of the development of community broadcasting and he provided for neighbourhood and town stations which were geared more towards community than commercial interests perhaps, it was stated in his announcement that these would be subject to their not interfering with the commercial viability of the larger stations which were being established.  That creates a doubt in my mind as to how successful this Bill will be in pushing for community involvement in broadcasting if they are going to be at a second round.  I am aware that subsequently the Minister indicated that they would not be at a second round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still an issue to be addressed. The Minister, even if he does not accept an amendment, should at the very least offer the commission some guidance because they have the right under their obligations to consider other matters or to lay down other matters that they would feel appropriate when advertising stations. They have the right to trawl for <Col N="1765" /> information.  In some way or other, the House should express its desire that community initiative in broadcasting should become a significant feature in the new broadcasting world that emerges when these Bills are passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment advocates a particular development or promotional role for the commission in relation to community broadcasting.  We had a long debate on this matter last week and I indicated then that I believe it is important that the commission be given as much flexibility as possible to develop its policies in relation to all potential forms of broadcasting and should not be constrained into focusing on one particular framework.  Furthermore, I think the function proposed is inappropriate to and out of character with the nature of the commission we are proposing in the legislation.  It is not being constructed as a promotional body <i>per se.</i> It is intended to be an objective selector of franchises and a regulator of the services it selects.  The real impetus for community broadcasting will come from within the community itself and through the organising and advisory capabilities of bodies such as the NACB, not from the top by a State agency.  In this context the best way of ensuring a community dimension to broadcasting is by including that element as one of the criteria to be used by the commission in making its selections.  This will ensure that potential applicants will have to seek to embrace this element in their applications while the commission itself will have to take it into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I am satisfied that the criteria I have specified, that is, the extent to which a service serves recognisably local communities and is supported by various interests in the community captures the essence of what community broadcasting is about.  Having a co-operative or non-profit distributing structure is not an imperative element for community broadcasting.  For example, many genuinely community provided and run facilities such as local sports complexes adopt a limited liability company form of <Col N="1766" /> structure purely in the interests of protecting the community.  Likewise, if a community run station makes a profit we should not deprive that community of using those profits in whatever way it chooses, for example, to support other community developments.  In all the circumstances, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment proposed.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I took a major step forward in encouraging the community aspect under the criteria which must be taken into account by the commission in determining applications for sound broadcasting contracts.  On Committee Stage I introduced in section 6 (2) (h) a provision which was accepted by the House as follows:</P>
    <P>The extent to which the service proposed&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  serves recognisably local communities and is supported by the various interests in the community, or,</P>
    <P>(ii)  serves communities of interest,  </P>
    <P>So far as the point made by Deputy O'Malley is concerned, the criteria in section 6 (2) (h) cover that particular genuine community involvement.  As I told the House last week, I was in discussion with the NACB on this issue. So far as Deputy O'Sullivan's point is concerned regarding the educational aspect, this item comes up under amendment No. 10 and we will then have an opportunity to speak about that aspect when we get to that amendment.  On the point made by Deputy Bruton in relation to his suggestion that we could arrive at a situation where no proposals come forward for community broadcasting and, therefore, the whole idea of community broadcasting itself would become redundant, in reality that will be very far from what will happen.</P>
    <P>The procedure which I have proposed in the legislation allows for what we now call the trawl.  At the first stage when the commission is appointed one of its functions will be to advertise and to ask in a general way, without actually looking for applications, who in the community <Col N="1767" /> is interested in establishing a station, in what areas, in what structures and to cover what districts.  I believe that trawl will bring forward considerable indications of interest from community groups in society who will be interested in applying for licences either for counties, regions, towns or neighbourhoods.</P>
    <P>There is a desire to encourage community broadcasting &mdash; that is my desire &mdash; but I want to make it clear that it is not the only form of broadcasting I want to see happening.  There is, and should be, for commercial broadcasting. In some of the types of stations, national, regional or whatever way they are going to work, there can be community involvement but they will not operate on community line alone, there will be a commercial element.  We should not tie the hands of the commission.  I am not, therefore, in a position to accept this amendment.  Since the introduction of the legislation I have tried as far as possible to take on board suggestions of Members on all sides of the House for improvement of the legislation.  I have gone quite a distance in regard to acceptance of amendments and I believe the Bill on Report Stage is generally accepted as a fair balance of all interests in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not seen fit to accept or indicate he would take on board the ideas in amendment No. 1 in my name and the names of Deputy Mac Giolla, Deputy Sherlock and Deputy McCartan.  This discussion highlights the dividing line, so to speak between the approach we have to broadcasting and the approach the Minister is promoting in this Bill.  The Minister has said he is anxious to indicate that, while he is keen that community broadcasting should develop, there should be commercial broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little doubt that anybody reading the Bill, even with the amendments the Minister accepted on Committee Stage, would find the thrust is towards commercial broadcasting.  There is a nod in the direction of community involvement &mdash; not community broadcasting <i>per <Col N="1768" /> se</i> in section 6 (2) under which the commission are obliged in determining applications for award of sound broadcasting contracts to take a list of items into account.  They have to take into account the character of the applicant, the adequacy of the expertise and experience, financial resources and the extent to which the application accords with good economic principles, the quality, range and type of programmes proposed, the quantity, quality, range and type of programmes in the Irish language, the desirability of having a diversity of services and a number of other items regarding the desirability of allowing control of the broadcasting into a person's or group of persons' hands and, at the end, the extent to which the service serves recognisably local communities and is supported by various interests in the community or serves community interests, etc.</P>
    <P>That is just a nod in the direction of community broadcasting.  It is by no means a commitment to the development of community broadcasting.  On reading all the criteria the commission have to take into account it is clear that the bulk of broadcasting will be by commercial proposers, people who have proposals with regard to profitable broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage in this debate I indicated I was not at all happy with the dominance of commercialism in broadcasting and I felt there was too much emphasis on the question of advertising, plugs and the whole ethos created by the idea of broadcasting being a product which can be sold itself or through which you can sell other products.  I was anxious to emphasise that it should be seen as a means of communication within a community, be it the small local community, the larger county area or the national community and that commercialism should be put in second place.  That, effectively, is what we are proposing in this amendment.  We would put the onus on the commission to promote the development of community sound broadcasting which is democratically owned and controlled by the community and <Col N="1769" /> has a co-operative or other non-profit distributing structure.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes issue with the form of the amendment, saying that co-operatives are not necessarily the best way of promoting community radio.  I am not arguing that they are.  He says maybe in certain circumstances a limited liability company will be necessary.  That is true but, as I understand it, co-operatives are limited liability companies and there is nothing to stop other forms of limited liability company here.  There is limited liability by guarantee where quite a number of community organisations form themselves into limited companies for the sake of protecting their committees from claims of one kind or another as a result of accidents and so forth.  Therefore, no limitation is implied in the format which I put forward here.</P>
    <P>The question of it being a non-profit distributing structure was intended to apply where a commercial organisation would distribute profits to their shareholders. This amendment is intended to prevent that kind of thing happening in a community situation and would be a means of identifying a community structured broadcasting system.  It would be quite inappropriate for a community broadcasting station to make money from its functions and then distribute the funds <Col N="1770" /> made to its own members when claiming to be a community station.  That would not prevent it from using the funds made for other community development functions. The amendment provides that the broadcasting service would be used as a means of community development.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has addressed himself to the points I have made or to the argument made on the need to promote community stations as distinct from commercial stations.  I have made the point that the commercial elements will already have the power, through their funding, through the resources they will have available to them, to promote themselves and cover all the areas the commission will be obliged to consider before they grant a licence, whereas the community organisation will not necessarily have that kind of expertise available to them.  Some of them may, but in the vast majority of cases they will need a great deal of expertise and assistance.  It is unfortunate that all the Minister is prepared to do is ensure that the commercial services which will be put forward will have some element of community involvement.  I do not regard that as adequate.  Therefore, I propose to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 29, to delete &ldquo;one television programme service&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;television programme services&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated a willingness to have a look at this whole area.  I was disappointed that he had not included this in his amendments. The intent of the amendment is to look at the way in which television is to develop.  The Minister seems to be wedded to the idea that there should be just one commercial national station.  At present there is no national network.  On technology grounds alone, if a new television station was to operate in Ireland tomorrow it would have to be on the cable networks that exist in Cork, Dublin and other smaller towns such as Waterford and Galway.  The technology, to a large extent, dictates that stations will be local in transmission at least.  It would be very sensible that we follow the technology and have all stations local in content. If that were done the stations that would emerge would be more complementary to RTE's existing national service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning of the trawl which the Minister is providing for in section 5 of the Bill, which will also apply to television, would be almost senseless if he does not consider that there should be the possibility of localised stations.  In the long term, as broadcasting evolves in the next ten to 15 years, it is almost certain that technology will make broadcasting cheaper in the television area as it has <Col N="1773" /> done in the radio area.  Ten years ago it would have been almost unthinkable that there would be a number of stations and that small community co-ops would get involved in broadcasting.  We are in a position where we could have small stations in areas such as Cork.  In time, technology will provide that much smaller areas could accommodate television stations.</P>
    <P>This legislation is drafted in a unduly restrictive fashion in envisaging only one national station.  If we look to the UK where there are television franchises in different regions we will see that some of those regions are extraordinarily small. The smallest one is in the Channel Islands where there is an independent contractor who works on the basis of an advertising revenue of under £2 million a year and provides local programming.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that he would envisage an opt out from the national commercial station with perhaps programming in the Cork region or in other regions.  There is a significant difference between the opt out being at the behest of the national commercial operator and at the behest of the commission.  If, for example, there was a body in Cork willing to provide X number of hours transmission and use the balance of the network from the Dublin operation, it would be preferable that that application be heard by the commission rather than by the national commercial programmer who might not see the desirability of having local content in his broadcasting package.  On technological gounds, on the grounds that this is the way television broadcasting will emerge in the future, the Minister is making a mistake in confining himself to one television station.  He knows that he does not yet have the network to distribute it nationally.  There is some scepticism as to whether his proposed MMDS system will get national coverage.  I share a certain amount of that scepticism as regards the areas that currently have off-air on up to six channels at present, without paying for any new MMDS system.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 3 paragraph (b) I <Col N="1774" /> have stated there should be more than one television service and that the television contractor should have the duty to provide his service as the television programme service contract specifies. This provision was included in the case of the sound broadcaster but, mysteriously, this was left out when it came to the television service contract.  The Minister suggested that that was simply an oversight. I do not see why it was included for the sound broadcaster and not for the television broadcaster.</P>
    <P>They are the reasons I believe the Minister should look favourably on these amendmednts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in my name reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 29, to delete &ldquo;one television programme service&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;television programme services&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said he would consider this matter before Report Stage.  I do not know what his intentions are in relation to this amendment, but I hope he recognises the points Deputy Bruton has just made and will make it possible to provide local television stations as distinct from one national service which the commission are confined to examining if the Bill goes through as worded.</P>
      <P>If it is the function of the commission to look at the development of sound and television broadcasting and to determine from the initial examination what is in the best interests of the development of broadcasting, why have they freedom on the sound broadcasting side to come to decisions on what is appropriate and how stations should develop, but on the television side they are confined to considerations that apply to one National television station only?  On Second Stage I queried whether that is the appropriate type of additional television service we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from RTE 1 and 2 we have cross-Channel stations, which are received generally throughout the country, and satellite stations.  I would have thought it <Col N="1775" /> more appropriate and more in line with what people want if we were to develop regional or city stations in, say, Dublin and Cork, where the programming would be much more complementary to the services already available nationally.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Minister did not address this point in the amended Bill before us.  It is very important that he should do so.  As I said, I do not understand why he has allowed the commission to consider all the proposals in the area of sound broadcasting but confined them in terms of the further and future development of television broadcasting. The technology is there to accommodate a Dublin station and a Cork station.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and to make changes so that the commission will not be confined to just looking at a national station but will have to totally disregard any proposals from promoters of a service in regional or city areas.  That restriction should be lifted and, in the best interests of overseeing the orderly development of broadcasting, they should be allowed to consider such proposals that are brought to their notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be opposing this amendment because from what both Deputies have suggested, we are already deciding who will get the franchise for Cork and Dublin.  That is contrary to the spirit of the Bill.  Deputy O'Malley suggested we already have a company in Dublin and in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped we would have Channel 3.  If I were living in Dublin I would have cable television reception for £60.90 per annum and in Cork I would pay £140 per annum.  I do not want to see further growth in this area.  There is a suggestion from the cable company in Cork that were they to provide a movie <Col N="1776" /> channel a further payment would be expected.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the difference between the commercial stations and RTE was that the commercial station would not have a licence and would be dependent solely on advertising.  If the cable company cannot provide an off-air signal similar to that provided by RTE 1 and 2, then we could be creating a monopoly.  At present this is costing approximately £130 per year, a substantial sum, and the Minister has not covered this point in the Bill.  For instance, if the company operating in the Cork area were to get the franchise they could have a monopoly.  At present they have a device known as a black box which scrambles the signal.  If you want to watch RTE 1 and record a programme on RTE 2 at the same time you cannot do it.  The people in Dublin and Cork would be at the mercy of the commercial operators. I will oppose this amendment because it will lead to the exclusion of many people from a television service.  Every person in the State must have the option of getting an off-air signal and, if we were to accept the Deputies amendments, many people would be excluded.</P>
      <P>MMDS is a separate argument and there is a great deal of confusion about it. The Department have asked for tenders from people interested in MMDS.  There is a great deal of confusion because the powers provided have not been specified and the area to be covered by a particular signal has been suggested.  However, this will have to be argued at another time. As I said, I am opposing the amendment, which will lead to a monopoly because the commercial operators will exclude many people who will not be able to afford the extra channel.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to Channel 3, and for the purpose of this discussion let us call it Channel 3. Everybody must have the opportunity to receive Channel 3, but if we go down the <Col N="1777" /> road suggested by the Deputies, there is a danger this will not happen.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at great length on Committee Stage and I promised to have a look at it.  I have given this a lot of consideration.  I am satisfied that the idea which lies behind it can be accommodated without making the change in question.  The approach I propose for the development of a television service is a more constructive and coherent one.</P>
      <P>Our primary objective is to have a third channel established which will essentially be national in nature. However, it does not preclude the type of regional services mentioned.  People can opt out as was mentioned earlier.  I believe we should go that road.  I also believe what the Deputies want is, and can be, included in the Bill as drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer some of the points made.  Deputy O'Sullivan is mistaken with regard to the intention of the amendment.  He suggests that the cost of cable in Cork might rise because of a new channel being carried on it.  There is no reason in the wide world that this should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Bruton is misquoting me. Acceptance of his amendment might lead to a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that point.  I thought he had raised the issue of cost.  The Cork network will have to carry a channel, willy-nilly.  The Minister will oblige it to do so.  It really is an issue as to whether it will be a channel with a significant local content in it, or one that is purely national.  I recognise the point that Deputy O'Sullivan is making about the danger of any cable company running a station and also controlling the network by which the channel is distributed.  I believe strongly that the commission should not give a licence to any company <Col N="1778" /> both to run a television station and to own the pitch, so to speak, on which all the other players have to play.  That would be wrong.  It is the sort of situation we have at present with Cablelink, to a large extent, where RTE own the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying there would be a danger of monopoly control if you had in Cork, or indeed anywhere else, a company distributing the signal and owning one of the channels to be distributed.  They would have the opportunity of giving favourable treatment to their channel and preventing the emergence of other packages. On the issue of whether everybody in the State should have access, I think they should have.  I have nothing against the development of a national network. Whether there is provision for localised contractors or not, there will be a national network.  That is the system in the United Kingdom, where there are localised network contractors and still a national ITV. It is a similar sort of structure that I would have in mind, that there would be network programmes for all areas and a contractor in particular areas providing programmes for particular hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister in his response did not answer the point I made regarding the desirability that it be the commission that would oversee the development of a local element in television programmes rather than the national commercial contractor.  If the Minister gives that role to the national commercial contractor, unless that contractor sees money in it for him to develop stations that would serve local interests in local regions and in that way be complementary to what we have from RTE, it will not happen.  Quite viable proposals could emerge in areas that a national broadcaster would not be interested in considering.  It would be far preferable that the commission would be the body that should decide whether we should see <Col N="1779" /> the emergence of programming in Cork or other areas.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat O'Malley, replying to his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, Deputy O'Sullivan is under the impression that what we are advocating under this amendment is that the national channel should not proceed and that we should develop some form of regional television service.  That is not the intention.  The national channel as outlined in the Bill could still proceed. With regard to the change of wording, we propose the deletion of the words &ldquo;one television programme service&rdquo; and substitution of &ldquo;television programme services&rdquo;.  It is implicit in that that what we really want to see catered for here is the possibility of development of regional television services whereas, as the Bill is at present drafted and if the amendment is not accepted, that type of development will not be allowed to happen, particularly in the way in which I want to see it happen, that is, as a result of the commission having had representations made to them about promotion of such stations and being in a position to give those representations consideration and to come to some decision on them.</P>
      <P>If the Bill goes through as at present before us, the commission effectively will be prevented from doing that, which is unfortunate.  It would be much more appropriate if the commission could take on board all advice, recommendations, or representations made to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also mentioned briefly the MMDS system.  It is now coming on stream because it is the system which will be used to distribute nationally this third television channel.  I made the point on another occasion to the Minister &mdash; and, indeed, another Deputy has reminded him of it this afternoon &mdash; that there are many reservations in regard to that transmission system.  I would remind the Minister that he undertook to issue a statement about MMDS&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In developing a network of stations, the Commission shall consider broad regions within which there should be several competing stations and which, in particular, would be capable of sustaining special interest stations.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, again, was discussed on Committee <Col N="1781" /> Stage.  The essential intention here is that in doing its trawl, as we are now describing what the commission is to do in advance of deciding on areas to be licensed, it should consider broad regions with a possibility of a number of stations operating within them, rather than being confined to a system where there would be a single holder of a franchise within a restricted county boundary, although there could be other stations with a smaller area within that.  The notion of county boundaries for the type of station we should see evolve and that there would be a single countywide station within that area is likely to stifle the sort of broadcasting that we see evolving.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister recognised the desirability of seeing special interest stations evolve.  He also recognised that those stations could not survive unless they had a broader than single county area.  If you are talking about a classical music station that would be confined to, perhaps, Tipperary South &mdash; although I suppose that there is a special case because there might be a following there &mdash; it could easily be that the area would be too small for that station to survive.  It might only survive in a broader region where it could pick up a wider listenership.  That is why I believe we should not straitjacket the geographical areas and get away from the idea of granting a franchise to only one station in each county.  The Minister may have decided that he is not going to proceed in that way but I have not heard him say as yet in so many words that that is not the way he intends to proceed.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to amendment No. 5. The wording of the present section is strange in that the commission will prepare a report but there is no reference to the way in which the commission could make known its views on how it would like to see broadcasting evolve in, say, the north west region and what licences they believe should be issued by the Minister. While the Minister will not be a party to all of the discussions which will take place, it appears that it is he who will make the final decisions on what licences should be applied for.  Of course, the <Col N="1782" /> Minister should have the right to decide on what licences should be issued as he is responsible for running the frequencies. That is why I have proposed a change in the wording which would allow for the commission to make recommendations and for the Minister to then issue licences having considered those recommendations. This would seem to be the more sensible approach and more in keeping with what I thought the Minister intended doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton in his efforts to achieve flexibility on what stations will emerge following the passage of this legislation.  I am not aware that there is a rigid requirement that licences be issued only to county stations or town stations.  I think it is good that the commission will take an overview of the requirements and will give due consideration following the receipt of submissions to community broadcasting, which we discussed earlier, to special interest stations and commercial stations. They should then be in a position to recommend what mixture of services should be provided in any given location. These should not be confined to within county boundaries or other such rigid structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Bruton is trying to achieve is already covered in the Bill.  If I were to accept amendments Nos. 4 and 5 we would direct the commission in one particular direction.  The Deputy's concern seems to arise from my preference of allowing the opportunity for county-type stations to emerge in the first instance but I have written nothing into the Bill which would constrain the commission to focus solely on this direction. Indeed, I have built in a provision, which the Deputy has acknowledged, which would allow the commission to undertake a trawl of expressions of interest as to the nature and extent of the kind of services which are likely to emerge, including the extent of interest in specialist or general stations, particularly music stations.  It would have the opportunity from this process to determine the most suitable <Col N="1783" /> geographic configurations for radio stations &mdash; it could be regional.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day any geographic configuration determined would have to marry in with the radio frequency assignments available to the country, and that is where my own role in regard to radio frequencies and international obligations comes in.  The frequency assignments of medium power level available to this country are in fact based on a county configuration.  There are lower power assignments for town stations and even lower power assignments again for neighbourhood stations.  Regional-type broadcasting is of course feasible but only by networking county transmissions.  This means if one chooses this road one is foregoing the possibility of a county level station.  It is for this reason that my preferred approach is to go for county stations at the outset.  I have no doubt that some of these stations will not prove ultimately to be viable and might find themselves integrating into or networking with other county stations to form one regional service.  This, however, is a purely personal view based <i>inter alia</i> on the technical realities of what is possible, but as I have said I am not going to restrain the commission by writing my views into the Bill.  I have not done this because I believe this is something which should be left to the commission.  By allowing the commission to undertake a trawl of expressions of interest we may come up with the regional configuration the Deputy speaks about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 5, I see no substantive difference between the current provisions in the Bill and those proposed by the Deputy.  In the circumstances I am not disposed to accept the amendments.  If I were to accept these amendments I believe we would do the reverse of what the Deputy intends. The Deputy wants it left to the commission to decide on the configurations, and so do I.  While I have my personal views in regard to county-type stations, I believe by allowing the commission to undertake a trawl of <Col N="1784" /> expressions of interest we may come up with various configurations.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 21 to 51, and in page 8, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Commission shall publish the name and address of each applicant and other details of the application, including the services proposed to be provided but excluding commercial details that should be kept private.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international trend in inviting applications for licences is that the public should have a right to know the alternatives open to them.  On Committee Stage the Minister outlined that there could be a danger that those who were refused licences would not want to have their names made public and I think the commission would respect their desire for privacy in that respect.  Obviously, they would need to have some type of <Col N="1785" /> name but more importantly they would have to make public their programming intentions.  That is what the public would have an interest in.  While the commission could protect the desire for privacy on the part of applicants where they think it is appropriate to do so, it is only reasonable that it make known to the public the different types of stations which are on offer at application stage and that in the final adjudication it be in a position to get a response from the public as to their preferences.  I am aware that in the Bill the Minister puts forward the idea of a trawl, but experience shows that those who respond to advertisements in the newspapers are those who have a very strong interest in applying.  The ordinary member of the public will not apply and will not express to the commission their views on the sort of station they would like to see emerge.</P>
    <P>The way in which the commission can get some feeling of what is needed in the area would be by means of publishing some details of the type of programming applications that are being received for stations in respect of which they have chosen to offer contracts.  The Minister is taking an unduly restrictive view, concerning himself with the danger of revealing commercial details that people will want to maintain private or with the danger of stations outbidding one another.  If, by outbidding one another, it means that an improved application is received, that would be very welcome.  If the procedure of making public the type of programming on offer ends up in a better offer coming on to the table &mdash; in the course of the commission considering the allocation of a contract &mdash; that is all to the good.  Indeed that was one of the arguments advanced by the Minister on Committee Stage, and is the reason I have tabled this amendment for the Minister's consideration at this stage.  If there is public knowledge of what is going on it will help to ensure that the best type of broadcasting evolves.</P>

      <P>I have not yet ascertained exactly what Deputy Richard Bruton is endeavouring to do in relation <Col N="1786" /> to the placement of section 6 with his amendment.  It would appear to me &mdash; and perhaps it can be confirmed whether I am correct &mdash; that he is proposing to delete all of the criteria by which the commission will determine an application and have them replaced simply by the publication of details of applications without giving the commercial details. That would not appear to me to be an appropriate amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is in the name of The Workers' Party and takes us back to the discussion we had on Committee Stage, that is the debate concerning the extent, if any, to which people who have been involved in pirate broadcasting should be allowed to get licences and enter into contracts with the commission for the provision of services.  It is our view that there should be strict scrutiny of applications for contracts to provide a service.  Indeed, in responding on Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that section 6(2) (a) which required that the commission had to have regard to the character of the applicant was adequate. The Minister said he was not keen for a variety of reasons to specifically exclude pirates.  It is my view that simply having a provision that the commission should have regard to the character of an applicant does not necessarily direct the attention of the commission to the questions we raised with regard to pirates, in particular the issue I raised on Committee Stage of ensuring that at least where pirates, or former pirates, apply for broadcasting licences and contracts, all of their accounts should be up-to-date and filed with the Revenue Commissioners. That requirement should obtain.  It appears to me that an amendment similar to what I propose here &mdash; that the extent to which an applicant has been directly involved in providing a sound broadcasting service without having been licensed to do so &mdash; should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point previously with regard to community-based, non-commercial services.  It has been suggested to me that some services described themselves as community services whereas in fact they <Col N="1787" /> were thinly disguised commercial operations. That is true.  However, we must have some confidence in the competence of the commission to differentiate between a community-based, a non-commercial service and the type of commercial pirate who may have misused the term &ldquo;community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would ask the Minister to take this amendment on board, which seeks to extend the provisions of section 6 (2) (a).</P>
    <P>The other amendment in the name of The Workers' Party is No. 10 and relates to the extent to which educational programmes are to be provided.  It is proposed that additional criteria be inserted among those to be taken into account by the commission in determining applications. I am sure the Minister and Members present will be aware of the strong representations made by Aontas, the adult education group that there be a specific reference in the Bill to the need for an educational service.  In the course of their correspondence &mdash; which I am sure all Deputies have received &mdash; they say they are not satisfied with the assurance from the Minister's Department that it is expected that educational programmes will be included among those which promoters will provide.  They argue that there is no provision in the Bill enabling the Minister or the commission to ensure that, if no applications for the provision of educational services are received, such educational services will be provided.  I should like to ask the Minister to inform the House whether he thinks &mdash; as appears to be implied in a letter from his Department &mdash; that the matter is covered already under the provisions of section 17 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by the provisions of section 13 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, or, if not covered by the provisions of those sections, he will indicate whether he will take this amendment on board, placing an obligation on the commission to take into account the extent to which educational services will be provided.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I think Deputy De Rossa adverted to this fact &mdash; the intention, in amendment No. 7, was that it would be to add that subsection rather than substitute it.  It reads wrongly on the amendment sheet.  My intention was that the following should be added:</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused about some of the sections.  Is there not provision in the Bill whereby the commission are obliged to maintain a register of applicants for broadcasting contracts? As I understand Deputy Bruton's proposal, what he wants to do is to have details of all applicants published.  My question is: is that information not already available on a public register anyway for anybody who is interested in ascertaining such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>In other words, after the decision has been taken, but, prior to that decision being taken, the public are not given an opportunity, by way of information in a public register, to ascertain details of applications forthcoming. There is much merit in Deputy Bruton's amendment.  It may be possible for groups of applicants to come together and provide a service.  At least there should be the facility by which they can become aware of what is taking place in terms of applications to the commission before decisions are taken because, once decisions are taken, it may well be too late.  I had thought that Deputy Bruton's point was that this material should be <Col N="1789" /> published, that the public should be made aware of it on that basis.  However, I had understood incorrectly that that information was available to the public anyway if they cared to visit a designated place where the information would be available on a public register.</P>
      <P>There was an amendment the Minister accepted on Committee Stage about disclosure of the beneficial ownership of shares &mdash; that that should be the case where shares are held by nominees.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has taken that suggestion into account.</P>

      <P>We must be conscious that amendment No. 8 provides a general amnesty to private operators.  For that reason I would support Deputy De Rossa.  It is wrong that licences should be granted to people who have violated the law, perhaps not paying their PAYE or PRSI contributions, people who have violated planning laws, as has been the case in many instances in my county, people generally who have disrupted our communications network, who have effectively put lives at risk through interference with the airwaves at, say, Dublin Airport, police and ambulance wavelengths and so forth.  It is wrong to take applications from people who were guilty of such crimes under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1936.  It is not good enough for them to say &ldquo;We are going to wipe the slate clean and start afresh&rdquo;.  The question of accountability has to be considered and, for that reason, I will be supporting Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 9 in the name of the Minister.  It gets us over the problem of the content clause which the Irish music industry and I requested be inserted in the legislation.  This proposal has to be welcomed by everybody who is involved in Irish music, drama and entertainment.  Irish artistes who record abroad should also be borne in mind. Other stations such as the BBC and Radio Luxembourg blatantly push their artistes.  I believe it is about time we gave our artistes the support they deserve.  We have been negligent in this regard in the past.  I am a little <Col N="1790" /> disappointed with some radio music programmes because there is very little content in the programmes which could be described as being of Irish origin.  I believe the Minister's amendment will help to reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 10 I mentioned earlier in the debate that there is a need for educational programmes.  It is a bit unrealistic to expect too much to be dedicated to news items.  I believe smaller stations will be hard-pressed to have the amount of news time necessary to comply with the Act.  It would be a good idea if some of this time could be used for educational programmes.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy Bruton proposes the publication of the details of the application before the commission grant a franchise.  We discussed this at great length last week and for the reasons I explained then this amendment is not acceptable.  In particular, I want to stress that the purpose of establishing the commission was that they could take decisions on behalf of the public, and take them in trust.  I want to emphasise that there is a degree of transparency already built into the Bill which is almost unprecedented in legislation coming before this House and to go any further would make the task of the commission impossible.  The transparency aspect written into the Bill is that the details of a contract between a successful applicant and the commission will be available on a register and copies of it can be secured from the commission.  Like any other normal tendering procedure, the only tenders that will be published will be the successful tenders; the unsuccessful tenders will not be published.  A tender for a local authority housing estate, sewerage scheme or road will be published only if it is successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the unsuccessful tenders, Deputy O'Malley made the point that if ten applications <Col N="1791" /> were in for a particular area licence it might be possible at some stage for two or three applicants to see what their competitors have in, and to withdraw their applications and amalgamate their proposals to the commission.  That would be a totally unfair form of tendering and I would not be in favour of it.  I do not think it would be right and proper if a person who had tendered could see what his competitors have tendered so that he could take out his tender and jiggle it around to try to beat somebody else's tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister does not believe I would make an improper suggestion like that.  My suggestion was designed to be helpful.  It was not as the Minister interpreted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as I interpreted it and if I made a mistake I am sorry.  The question of people tendering for particular licences is a very sensitive issue. If the commission find that there is more than one application for a Dublin licence the intention is that there could be two Dublin regional licences.  If somebody wants to apply for a licence he may get a consortium of electronics media people together and their application will be made in confidence to the commission. Their intention would be that if the application is unsuccessful they would retain their jobs in the present electronics media, in other words RTE, but if they were successful they would hand in their resignation to RTE.  If they are unsuccesful and do not get the licence they will want to retain their position with RTE and stay there.  If we publish the details of the application we would be breaking the confidentiality aspect of the application and there would be a possibility that the type and range of personalities and individuals who apply for the licences would not be the ones I want to apply.  I believe we should trust the commission and leave it to them to decide on the applications.  A call was made in this House for a commission to decide these <Col N="1792" /> matters.  I believe we have to put our faith in the commission.</P>
      <P>I believe I have met in the fullest way possible any doubts a successful applicant may have in relation to the transparency question.  I have covered this question to make sure that not only is the right thing being done but that it is also seen to be done.  However, if any successful applicant wants to publish the details of his or her application afterwards it will be up to them to do so and nothing will debar them from doing so.  This tender will be like any other tender and I do not think we should tie our hands on it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 deals with the prohibition of those who have been involved in illegal broadcasting from being considered for franchises, with the exception of those involved in &ldquo;community broadcasting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a detailed comprehensive discussion on this matter last week.  I am satisfied that this would be a inappropriate road to go down.  The discrimination which the amendment seeks to make between community and non-community pirates would probably be challenged on a legal basis, apart altogether from the practical difficulties involved in making the distinction in question.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 in my name is similar to that put down by Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage.  At that time I undertook to come back with an amendment and this is the preferred wording.  I believe it will meet the point made by Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage and it will improve the Bill considerably.  It will also confirm the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan in that it will encourage Irish talent in music, drama and entertainment.  That is a very good thing indeed.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 8, I assure Deputy O'Sullivan that it is not the intention of this legislation that the slate be wiped clean in relation to those who have been involved in pirate broadcasting.  Under section 6 there are criteria in relation to the character of the applicant and that covers this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> In relation to amendment No. 10 relating to educational programmes, I am satisfied that this is covered sufficiently well in the provisions of the Bill, specifically the mandate on the commission relating to the provision of a diversity of services, to the range, quality and type of programmes proposed and the news and current affairs obligations that will be on the stations.  In addition, there is a separate specific provision in section 8 to provide for a simple mechanism for granting contracts to educational institutions. In relation to broadcasting, there is no legal obligation on RTE, for example, to carry purely educational broadcasting.  If RTE carry purely educational programmes they insist that the Department of Education pay for the programmes.  As far as educational type programmes are concerned, the diversity of service and the range, quality and type of programme proposed under the news and current affairs obligations will cover education as broadly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not acknowledge earlier that I welcome amendment No. 9 which is on the lines I proposed on Committee Stage.  On amendment No. 8, I presume the Minister's reference to character would require that people would have clear tax affairs and things like that.  That element of what Deputy De Rossa said would have to be met.  I presume the Government rule that applies to contractors that they would have clear tax records would in this case apply automatically without this amendment. In relation to amendment No. 7 in my name, I can see the point in what the Minister is saying if the programming details include the names of personalities who would rather not see their names there.  There could be difficulty if the commission were publishing the names of presenters.  There should be a possibility of the commission making some soundings of the public and perhaps my amendment is too rigid a way of doing it.  I will not press my amendment, although I still feel that this should not be done entirely in camera and that protecting commercial privacy is one thing <Col N="1794" /> but denying the public knowledge of the types of programming, is going too far. Without the rigid obligation in my amendment which could give rise to the dangers adverted to by the Minister, I hope that the commission will see it as being appropriate to publish details of different applicants so that they could sound out local feeling about it.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendment No. 8, I regard it as unfortunate that the Minister cannot include in the Bill a specific reference to those who have for the past ten years or so been in breach of the law, not just of the law in relation to the Telegraphy Act but in breach of a whole range of other laws referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 10 the Minister says that there is no obligation on RTE to provide a service.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially there seems to be some confusion in the Bill at present as to what precise complaint procedures exist if someone is not satisfied with the way the station has treated a complaint.  The Bill provides that the commission can request the information for inspection but it does not say anything about the commission exercising any power to recommend or to say that a person was treated wrongly and that the station should broadcast a retraction.  Subsection (3) states that the Minister may, by regulation, enact the powers of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission; the alternative is to provide that the commission will enact the procedure of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 15.  I am not clear at the moment as to what happens if someone feels they have been badly done by, by a station, makes a complaint and still feels they did not get satisfaction.  It seems that unless the Minister has decided, in general terms, to implement the provision of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission that that complaint might have nowhere to go.  Obviously, it could be a long time before the Minister might get around to deciding that he would activate these complaint procedures.  It would be more sensible for the Minister to provide, as of now, that there will be recourse to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission in the same way as with RTE.  If someone feels grieved by the way in which he has been treated by RTE he has the right to go to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  The Minister may advert to the fact that the commission in this legislation has all sorts of disciplinary powers against the stations and that is undoubtedly true, but if you <Col N="1800" /> examine the records of the complaints they were not ones in which the Broadcasting Complaints Commission would consider putting RTE off the air or anything of that nature; they are much more minor or mundane complaints.  There should be some place where people can go to have those complaints heard.  I do not think this is met by the very formidable powers which the commission has in the last analysis to bring a station to heel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to make it compulsory to extend the ambit of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to cover the services proposed in the Bill.  It believe its adoption would be a grave error of judgment and would be tantamount to an expression of no confidence in the ability of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to regulate the services.  As I explained last week, there is a twofold process for dealing with complaints set out in the Bill which is even more strict than that applying for instance, to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance we are imposing fairly rigorous statutory obligations on broadcasters themselves to treat complaints fairly and satisfactorily, to maintain records of how they treat them, the action they take on foot of them and to open those records for inspection by the commission.  Second, there is the <i>de facto</i> reality that complaints will inevitably come to the commission who will then have to investigate the complaint and respond to it.  There is the first step of complaints to the station and then a complaint to the commission.  It is only in the absolute last resort, in other words if in the light of experience it is found that the mechanisms which we are proposing in the Bill fail, that I would consider resorting to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  I hope and indeed expect never to have to use the powers in question.  To have to do so from the outset, apart altogether from other considerations, would create significant logistical difficulties in terms of increasing staffing levels and other facilities of the Broadcasting Complaints <Col N="1801" /> Commission all of which would be unnecessary duplication of the resources which the Independent Radio and Television Commission will have.  I believe that if the IRTC are doing their job properly, as set down in the Bill and if the stations are meeting the obligations laid down under this legislation, it would be absolutely as a last resort that we would resort to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission procedures.  I would prefer to leave it, let us see the operation with the IRTC and if, as the very last resort it is required, the Minister of the day may bring in the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  But I would rather the flexibility of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as is proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am happy to hear the Minister say he would rather not invoke the Broadcasting Complaints Commission but, on Committee Stage, I had an amendment which proposed that the Authority would look at the complaints. If you read subsection (2) the commission has the power to look at the records kept but it does not seem to have the power to ask the station to issue a retraction or to make any recommendation on what it finds.  That is what strikes me as surprising. We neither have a Broadcasting Complaints Commission to hear the complaint nor does subsection (2) suggest that the commission will do anything about it if it hears a complaint.  That is the reason I am confused.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that subsection (2) means more than just perusing material and doing nothing about it.</P>

      <P>In page 13, between lines 2 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Commission shall develop guidelines to safeguard against a <Col N="1802" /> degree of interlocking ownership between stations, or with other sections of the media, that would be against the public interest.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister, in rejecting the idea that the commission should set guidelines, felt that in the amendment which I tabled at that stage the involvement of the Fair Trade Commission was an excessive burden in this legislation.  That may be so.  I have resubmitted for the Minister's consideration an amendment dropping the idea that the commission should have to consult with the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>I draw this issue to the Minister's attention again on the grounds that most other countries drawing up legislation of this sort found that they imposed quotas on interlocking ownership between different stations in some cases or between different sections of the media, and this has been in the public interest.  I feel that in time this will emerge here and we will see it is in the public interest that you do not have a high degree of interlocking ownership between stations for obvious reasons.  I submit to the Minister again that perhaps at the outset, before we become involved in a great many stations being set up and the commission perhaps having retrospectively to backpedal and say they want to instal guidelines having regard to the international experience and so on, we would alert them to the fact that this is the trend, that we recognise this trend and can see certain merit in having guidelines established.  It would be hard to say for every condition what the guidelines would be here and it would take some time to look and ascertain what would be appropriate.  Over time, this should be the way we are going on this issue.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the Deputy's concern is covered adequately through criteria laid down in section 6 (2) (f) and (g), which are:</P>
      <P>(f)  the desirability of allowing any person, or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue number of sound broadcasting services in respect of which a sound broadcasting contract has been awarded under this Act;</P>
      <P>(g)  the desirability of allowing any person, or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue amount of the communications media in the area specified in the notice under section 5 (5);</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy's concerns are met there and that there would have to be full disclosure of the background of applicants for franchise, particularly since the adoption of the useful amendment made last week requiring identification of persons entitled to the beneficial ownership of stations in a company seeking a franchise.  The danger of unforeseen interlocking relationships emerging in this context is negligible.  In these circumstances I see no case for imposing an obligation on the commission to draw up guidelines for a problem that is not likely to emerge.  Apart altogether from the practical considerations, I am advised by the company law experts that the term &ldquo;interlocking ownership&rdquo; has not substantive meaning in legal terms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Again this is a repeat of an amendment submitted on Committee Stage and withdrawn then.  The amendment deals with the section which allows for a derogation from the requirements to provide news and current affairs programmes on radio. Section 15, to which the amendment relates, gives the commission the power to provide a derogation from the requirement in question &ldquo;in whole or in part&rdquo;. We are arguing in this amendment that the wording &ldquo;in whole&rdquo; should be deleted &mdash; in other words, the commission should be enabled to provide a derogation only in part on the requirement to provide news and current affairs programmes. We are concerned that this kind of amendment should be included and that the obligation should be retained on all the radio stations.  Whether they be commercial radio stations of town, city, county or community broadcasting stations, there should be an obligation on them to provide news and current affairs programmes to some extent.  To provide for a derogation in whole, in our view, would be a mistake.  The provision will operate only if the committee are satisfied that there is a reasonable plurality of sources of news and current affairs programming available to the public in question from other sound broadcasting services; but that seems to provide a licence for other stations to seek derogations on the basis that their competitors are already providing these services, therefore there is no need for them to do so.  On the basis of the wording of the section here it would seem that the commission would have no cause open to them other than to agree.  For argument sake, RTE, provide a regular news service headlines on the hour and a whole plethora of current affairs programmes. Where those programmes are being received in an area the local stations could argue that because this service is being provided there is no need for them to do so.  That would be a mistake.  At <Col N="1805" /> the very least each station should be obliged to carry news headlines on a regular basis.  I went into some detail on that on Committee Stage.  The Minister knows my views on it.  I ask him to take the amendment on board at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some empathy with the idea behind this proposal. However, since the primary objective of this provision is to accommodate special interest stations and since it can be granted only if the commission are satisfied that there is already a reasonable plurality of news and current affairs programming available to the public in an area where using the derogation clause is contemplated, we should allow the commission the flexibility to determine for themselves the extent of the derogation to be granted.  I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Members of the House will recall that we had quite a valuable discussion on what is now section 18 (4) of the Bill, which deals with the Irish and EC produced programming to be included in the TV service.  We sought to achieve two objectives through this provision (1) in the totality of the TV service a reasonable proportion of the programme material <Col N="1806" /> should be of Irish or EC origin (2) of that proportion a further proportion should be original programme material produced by independent programme producers in Ireland or the EC.

      <P>The original wording was deficient or inadequate and, while I accept that the Minister has clarified the matter to some extent, I do not think he is getting across what he intends.  The governing words are &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo;, and I understand they were used by the EC and the Council of Europe.  When this amendment is adopted the section will be to the effect that the commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service is produced in the State or in another member state of the European Communities.  The same governing words, &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; apply to paragraph (b) which states:</P>
      <P>(b)  is devoted to original programme material produced therein by persons other than the contractor...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that what the Minister has in mind is that a reasonable proportion should be produced in the State or member states and that a reasonable proportion of that reasonable proportion should not be produced by the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisations.  If the Minister has that in mind it is not reflected in his amendment.  I suggest that the Minister have another look at this, perhaps when the Bill is going through the Seanad, to see if he can deal with the difficulty.  Governing subsection (a) are <Col N="1807" /> the words &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; and that means a certain percentage.  The same words are used in relation to paragraph (b).  In my view that means that a contractor might not be able to produce any programmes except in a non-viable area.</P>

The amendment refers to &ldquo;existing broadcasting organisations&rdquo;.

    <P>In amendments Nos. 1 and 2 I am putting forward a slightly revised definition of the term &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and I am also inserting the term &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;.  The revised definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is primarily of a technical nature to embrace the idea of a structure <Col N="1811" /> on an inland lake or waterway.  The introduction of the term &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; stems from the fact that it was unclear from the original Bill whether an illegal broadcast from a vehicle was covered.  This is now being put beyond doubt as is the possibility of an illegal broadcast from a structure or vessel on an inland lake or waterway.</P>
    <P>The relevant consequential changes are in amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16 to sections 3, 4 and 6. These sections are at the heart of this legislation and provide:</P>
    <P>&mdash;that it shall be an offence to make a broadcast from any premises or vehicle in the State save pursuant to a licence issued by the Minister;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that any person who owns, controls or manages a premises or vehicle and who knowingly permits an illegal broadcast to take place from them shall be guilty of an offence. </P>
    <P>The other offence created in section 3 relates to a person who operates or assists in the operation of wireless telegraphy for an illegal broadcast, while section 4 creates offences for:</P>
    <P>&mdash;making available a premises or vehicle from which such broadcasts are made;</P>
    <P>&mdash;having or keeping wireless telegraphy apparatus used for such broadcasts; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;supplying, installing or maintaining such apparatus for the purpose of making illegal broadcasts.  </P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13 and 16 relate to section 6 which deals with the withdrawal of telephones or electricity service from a premises used for illegal broadcasts and provides for the insertion of the terms &ldquo;premises&rdquo; or in one instance &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; as appropriate in place of previous references to &rdquo; premises or structure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 17 from Deputy O'Malley are also relevant in this regard.  I would like to assure the Deputy that it was not through oversight <Col N="1812" /> that the reference to &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; was excluded from the particular clauses in question.  In this regard we felt it did not make sense to be talking about a physical connection point for ESB service in a vehicle.  The only circumstances in which such an unlikely connection would be made would be if the vehicle was permanently stationary, in which case it would, for the purposes of this Act, constitute a premises.</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply to a physical connection for a telephone.  So far as mobile telephones are concerned, there is no physical connection as such save at the exchange but, apart from that consideration, a subscriber is registered for such a service by reference to his home or place of business and a prohibition notice to withdraw telephone services would relate to that address rather than the particular vehicle in question.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps take this opportunity to remind Deputies that this Act is very much complementary to the Broadcasting (Offences) Act, 1968.  That latter Act was passed to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Agreement entitled &ldquo;European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts from Stations outside National Territories&rdquo;.  It made it an offence to participate in any way in a broadcast from a ship, aircraft or marine structure in or over the State or sea waters adjacent to the State, or to supply materials or advertisements to such stations. The Act, in conjunction with similar legislation in the UK and other European coastal countries, virtually put an end to illegal broadcasting from ships.</P>

      <P>The amendments, and particularly the definition of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and the addition of the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;, are very worthwhile.  It certainly ties down the difficulties that would otherwise arise if these amendments had not been included.  I note the Minister referred to amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 17 in my name and I accept his explanation. I put them down in the interests of consistency and because I felt that the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; was very adequate and <Col N="1813" /> necessary for inclusion.  Because these are mobile and it may not be possible to provide either an ESB or a telephone service to them I accept that the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; in that instance is probably more appropriate.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's amendment No. 15 to section 6 which deals with prohibition notices, a person on whom the prohibition notice is served pursuant to the subsection of this section shall be immune from liability in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by that person in pursuance of the notice.  If it involves damage to property, does that mean that people who are executing their duty are immune from any charges?  If damage is done to property does it mean that the aggrieved person cannot claim against the Minister?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The point in publishing it in this form is to highlight the fact that at the moment we have about 170,000 unlicensed sets in this country.  An Post are doing an excellent job in increasing the number of licences collected every year, but there <Col N="1820" /> is still a major problem in relation to unlicensed sets.  By increasing the fines from £500 to £1,000 I believe we will reduce the number of 170,000 unlicensed sets &mdash; this amounts to a loss of income of about £8 million for RTE.  I am not proceeding with the minimum of three times the licence fee because, due to family circumstances, a district justice may want to impose twice or one and a half times the licence fee.  As I said, I am not proceeding with the minimum of three times the licence fee.  In other words, I am withdrawing the first part of the amendment but I am retaining the figure of £500 for the first offence and £1,000 for a second or subsequent such offence.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, this amendment provides that all illegal stations will be off the air by December 1988.  From the point of view of an orderly transition, how long of an interregnum does the Minister envisage there will be between the closing of all existing stations and the introduction of the new stations? Is he giving himself a very tight schedule expecting to have something to substitute for all the stations that will be closed down in December 1988?  What is planned is that initially we will have a trawl and subsequent applications, but will there be a very long gap, and does the Minister think that is appropriate?</P>

      <P>I do not believe there <Col N="1827" /> will be a long gap and putting 31 December as the latest date will concentrate the minds of the commission to get up and working.  The intention is that this legislation will be brought immediately to the Seanad, together with the Bill we have just passed.  The commission will do the trawl and advertise the licences, and it is intended that the new stations will be operating early next year.  I believe 31 December 1988 will give legitimate applicants an assurance that they will be operating legally and will not be in competition with illegals.  This is giving the illegal stations enough time to get off the air.</P>

    <P>Sé aidhm an Bhille seo na neart dealbhach a thabhairt do mholadh an Forsa Tasca ar Struchtúr Foirgneamh Ilstórach gur cheart measúchan d'fhail ó dhuine ábalta ar struchtúir de dheanamh áirithe atá chúig stóir no níos mó.  Tá an measúchan seo ceaptha a thaispaint má tá na struchtúir láidir go leor chun seasamh <Col N="1828" /> suas do chliseadh díréireach in am timpiste.</P>
    <P>I might briefly remind Deputies of the background to the setting up of the task force.  You will recall the gas explosions in multi-storey buildings last year, including the tragedy in Raglan House.  A report on the explosions was commissioned from consulting engineers Cremer and Warner and following its receipt the Government established a task force to consider whether there were problems related to potentially vulnerable buildings and situations and to make recommendations for action.  The task force's report has been published and copies have been presented to both Houses.</P>
    <P>The task force made a number of recommendations dealing with both structural and gas safety.  Appropriate action on implementation of these recommendations is being undertaken by my Department and by the Department of Energy.  One of the central findings of the task force was that they found no cause for general concern about the stock of multi-storey buildings in relation to vulnerability to disproportionate collapse &mdash; that is collapse which would be out of proportion to the magnitude of the accident caused to the building.  That central finding is most reassuring.</P>
    <P>The task force identified certain forms of construction of multi-storey buildings and considered it prudent that the owners of such buildings should have them appraised to determine their robustness. They gave guidelines on how this appraisal might be carried out and, if the robustness of any particular building is in doubt, they recommended actions that should be taken to minimise the risk of accidental damage to that building.  In making this recommendation the task force recognised that structural upgrading of an existing building is seldom economically viable.</P>
    <P>The particular buildings identified by the task force as needing appraisal are those of five storeys or more that are constructed using precast concrete floors, together with either precast concrete frames, or precast concrete panels, or <Col N="1829" /> masonry walls.  The Government considered that a statutory requirement to appraise these buildings and to take any necessary action was needed to reassure both the users of such buildings and the public in general.  The Bill that I have now brought before the House reflects a response to that need.  It requires the owners of all buildings of five or more storeys which were built since 1950 to have their buildings appraised by a competent person and to submit certificates of appraisal in a specified form to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill requires each local authority to prepare and maintain a register of all buildings of five storeys or more constructed since 1950 in their area.  The local authority will notify the owner of each such building completed before the legislation comes into effect of the need to submit a certificate relating to the structural appraisal of the building.  Provision is made in section 4, to which I well refer later, for the certification of multi-storey buildings completed after the legislation comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the certificates which must be submitted by owners.  Provision is made to enable a person who has been served with a notice by a local authority, but is not an owner, to make a declaration to that effect.  He will not then have to submit a certificate.  The form of the certificates will be prescribed by regulations to be made by me following the enactment of the legislation and different certificates can be provided depending on the circumstances of the building.</P>
    <P>Every building of five storeys or more built since 1950 must have a certificate submitted for it.  If the building is not one of the construction forms identified by the task force as requiring appraisal, the certificate will state that fact and nothing further will be required with regard to that building.  In other cases the Bill provides that, if the building is constructed in accordance with the relevant codes of practice and standards that take account of disproportionate collapse, or if its level of robustness compares favourably with that of such buildings, then this will be <Col N="1830" /> stated in the certificate and no further action will be required in these cases.</P>
    <P>If a building's robustness is in doubt, it may be out of the question on cost grounds, even if it is technically possible, to structurally enhance that building. This was recognised by the task force and, as an alternative, they recommended a list of actions that should be taken, in so far as they are reasonable in any particular case, to minimise the risk of accidental damage to such a building and thereby enhance its safety.  There is a full list of actions in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  Section 3 (2) (c) provides for certificates in these cases.</P>
    <P>All certificates must be signed by a competent person who is defined in section 1 of the Bill as a chartered engineer with experience related to either structures or gas, depending on what is being appraised and the actions being taken.</P>
    <P>In the case of a multi-storey building completed after the commencement of the Act, the owner will be required, without notification from the local authority, to submit the necessary certificate before the building or any part of it can be occupied. This is provided for in section 4. The need for a certificate where a local authority own a multi-storey building in their area is dealt with in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that, where action has been taken to minimise the risk of accidental damage to a building, such action cannot be changed or reversed without a new certificate being submitted to the local authority.  It will be a serious offence to breach this provision, with a maximum penalty of a fine of £10,000 and/or three years in prison.  This will provide protection for users of such buildings and the general public while, at the same time, giving a degree of flexibility to an owner who may wish, because of altered circumstances, to make changes.  Provision for rights of entry of an owner and his agent in the cases of multi-owner or multi-occupancy buildings after due notice is catered for in section 7.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections cover the usual legislative provisions for interpretation, <Col N="1831" /> service of notices, power to require information from occupiers of a building as to the owner, the making of regulations, offences and penalties.  In view of the possible implications, it is proposed to make the signing or submission of a false certificate an indictable offence, if done knowingly, with maximum penalties of a £10,000 fine or a jail sentence of up to three years, or both.  Other offences are subject to a maximum penalty of £1,000.</P>
    <P>On publication of the task force report my Department placed advertisements in the national papers advising owners of the recommendations in the report and the need for appraisal of certain buildings. Local authorities were also advised and asked to begin work on setting up their registers of multi-storey buildings. The important thing at this stage is to ensure that the buildings in question are appraised.  I know that many owners will wish to have this done as rapidly as possible.  In fact, I understand that many buildings have already been appraised.  I will be asking local authorities to notify individual owners now of the requirements provided for under the Bill and my Department will be issuing appropriate guidance documentation to the local authorities in the near future.  The intention is that, if the appropriate certificates are submitted to the local authorities in anticipation to the enactment of the Bill, they will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I am confident that implementation of the provisions in this Bill will give a greater level of reassurance to the public about the safety of multi-storey buildings. I therefore commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Bill is commendable it is a somewhat piecemeal approach to a problem which was brought on stream by the Raglan House disaster. At that time the litany of failures in regard to the building and the safety precautions taken by the Gas Company were truly of frightening proportions.  I wonder if the Bill, coming into the House without the building regulations being given statutory powers and without by-laws <Col N="1832" /> having any statutory enforcement powers, will meet only part of the problem if we want to make our buildings in the city safe for the use of natural gas.</P>
      <P>Some of the problems that emerged in the Raglan House report did not simply refer to the structural features of the building; the underground spaces where gas had been permitted to accumulate were also mentioned.  This would be a problem regardless of the structural form of the building.  In the course of the certification procedures envisaged will there be a check of the spaces underneath the buildings?  This Bill deals solely with buildings and perhaps the Minister is overlooking the fact that much of what needs to be done to make the whole procedure safe in relation to using gas in Dublin is to have an overseeing body which would make sure on behalf of the public that there is total confidence in the safety of buildings.  Is the Minister satisfied that Bord Gáis Éireann are not only to be the supplier but also the agency which will vet the supply to buildings? There is a wider issue involved which the Minister needs to address with his Cabinet colleagues before we can have complete and utter confidence in the gas system.  As a companion to this Bill, he should move on the building regulations, give firm force to the by-laws and have a proper safety authority to deal with safety in all aspects.  He should also look at the intrusion of gas to carpark surfaces and vacuums underneath buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words in relation to this Bill.  It affords us an opportunity of highlighting the serious problems that exist, particularly in many urban areas, in high-rise buildings and multi-occupancy buildings generally.  I am not convinced that the Bill goes far enough in trying to deal with the problem.  The background to the measures was a very serious series of incidents and this measure arises out of the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings.  Unfortunately, however, many of the recommendations in that report are not yet in place and this <Col N="1833" /> legislation seems to be minimalist in its approach.  I am not convinced that it meets the full legislative requirements if we are to resolve the problems which arose out of the explosion at Dolphin House, the content of the report of Cremer and Warner and the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings.</P>
      <P>There is an extremely serious problem in most urban areas and certainly in Dublin city in relation to multi-storey buildings.  The Bill is quite specific in excluding from consideration any building under five storeys and it also excludes any building built before 1950.  Therefore, it deals only with a limited range of buildings.  There are many buildings, reasonably dilapidated, about which questions could be asked in relation to their safety.  Indeed, a number of these in recent months have been the subject of demolition orders in Dublin city where aspects of public safety, not necessarily related to possible gas explosions, but issues nevertheless of fundamental importance, will not be taken into consideration in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister exempt buildings built before 1950?  I assume it has something to do with the nature of construction but I suspect that the date was not based on the findings of the reports referred to.  It would not be unreasonable, in a country which is not renowned for multi-storey buildings, to have extended the scope of the Bill to any multi-occupancy building.  I accept that in the immediate future it is reasonable to concentrate on the higher multi-storey buildings but there are whole tracts of Dublin city with multi-storey buildings which will not come within the ambit of this Bill.  That is disappointing and may mean that the Minister's presumably genuine attempt to deal with the problem will not result in the kind of outcome which everyone in the House hopes for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to extend the Bill.  If issues of public safety are at the heart of this Bill's concern, then we should not set artificial parameters or limits in terms of the life or the height of the building. All multi-occupancy buildings should be <Col N="1834" /> included.  There was a hint of complacency in the Minister's speech which is ill-founded.  He said that the task force found no cause for general concern about the stock of multi-storey buildings in relation to vulnerability to disproportionate collapse, that is, collapse which would be out of proportion to the magnitude of the accident caused to the building.  He said that that central finding was most reassuring.  However, in the summary of the report the task force qualify their support by reference to very poor co-operation and response.  They refer to the difficulty they had in making an intensive and extensive survey of such buildings.  On page 1 of the report they said that the level of response from owners and designers was disappointing and that local authorities had only limited information on buildings in their functional areas.  Further on they said that, given the limited time available to them to conclude the report, they were not in a position to identify individual buildings which might be vulnerable.  There are similar remarks throughout the report.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should not be too complacent or reassured about the findings of the report based on that, understandably and unfortunately, qualified approach to the research.  However, the report is quite comprehensive in the range and scope of the recommendations contained therein.  At the outset of his speech the Minister said that many of these recommendations are receiving &ldquo;appropriate action&rdquo; in various Departments, particularly in his own Department and the Department of Energy.  I would like the Minister when replying to this debate to deal with this report which, after all, is the basis for this legislation and with the long list of recommendations I made, many of which do not relate either to his own Department or the Department of Energy.  For example, some relate to the Gas Company which, as we all know in this House, is answerable to nobody as far as we can judge, and is almost unapproachable as far as most public representatives are concerned.  As far as I am concerned, it simply does not answer serious queries put to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> There are other recommendations which relate to a whole range of other areas.  They are serious and considered recommendations and I believe because of the work which has been done and the implications arising from the investigation of the explosion they should be implemented at the earliest possible date. The Minister did not say in his speech, but I hope I will be corrected on this, that those recommendations are to be implemented.  Rather he said that appropriate action on their implementation is being undertaken by his Department.  I am long enough in the tooth and long enough in this House to know what &ldquo;appropriate action&rdquo; means, I ask the Minister to tell us if every one of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings of August 1987 is to be implemented and, if so, how many have already been implemented given that what is at the heart of this Bill is a possible risk to life and to property.</P>
    <P>Whereas emphasis has been placed on gas safety in the Bill and in the report I am dismayed to find that there is no reference to electrical safety.  I considered that to be a serious omission for this reason.  Quite candidly, I believe if we get an opportunity, as we do now, to deal with structural safety of high-rise buildings we should deal with the issue as comprehensively as possible.  The Minister is as aware as I am that concern has been voiced for many years about the lack of accountability and the standard in the area of electrical safety.  At present any individual contractor who is interested in providing electrical installations, regardless of his or her qualifications, can do so and can sign certificates of completion.  The Minister appears to be expressing surprise about this; either he has not heard me or does not know about this and I would be appalled to find that he did not know about this.</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that what the Minister has just stated does not stand up in accordance with the facts. The Council on Electrical Safety and the Electro-Technical Council agree that there is a serious deficiency in the area of electrical safety.  There is also no register of electrical contractors.  I have dealt with a number of these people and, while the majority of electrical contractors are <Col N="1837" /> genuine and decent operators there is the opportunity for abuse.  The reality is that anyone can set themselves up as an electrical contractor, can install wiring in a house and can buy across the counter at any ESB office a pink slip known as a completion certificate which they can then sign and which will be accepted without question by the ESB.</P>
      <P>The ESB recently rewrote the conditions attaching to electrical installation and the only revision they made from the previous edition was that they would not accept responsibility for the safety of the wiring, lest there be any doubt about it. What I am saying is that while the Bill seeks to deal with gas safety I believe this opportunity should have been taken to deal also with electrical safety.  At present cowboy operators are able to operate in this area without hindrance from anybody and with the full connivance and acceptance of such standards by the ESB who are willing to accept a completed self-signed certificate which says that they have completed the wiring in accordance with the acceptable standards.  There are a number of reputable people in the business who are appalled at this omission and they have been asking successive Ministers to do something about this problem.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider before Committee Stage broadening the scope of this Bill to include electrical safety.  It is at least as serious as the question on gas safety as every house has to have electrical wiring and there has been the loss of life and property through fires. There is an example of some of the incredible wiring jobs which have been carried out in this country in recent years across the road from us which was accepted, as far as I can gather, by the ESB on the basis of signed certificates. That is not good enough and I would like the Bill to be amended to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summary of the task force report should alert us to the fact that the Minister's assurances in this area may not be totally well founded.  More importantly, the report contains a very extensive list of recommendations.  I will not delay the <Col N="1838" /> House by reading all of them but let me point out that they refer to seeking the views of international organisations, international comparisions, the technical uses of various types of equipment, machinery, installations and so on.  The committee also suggested that Dublin Gas should make major changes in their procedures, and God knows that is essential. They also recommended that practices adopted in certain areas to reduce network losses should be used all around the country; in other words, that there be consistent standards throughout the country.</P>
    <P>They are very positive recommendations and, therefore, it seems that this Bill is only a piece of the total package which is required.  I am aware that not all of the recommendations need to be implemented through legislation and it may very well be that some of them have already been implemented but I would like the Minister to tell us what his intentions are in this respect and how many of the recommendations have been implemented.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to deal with the content of the Bill.  I am not happy with one or two sections of the Bill but I will not go into them in detail now because I may have a chance on Committee Stage to do so.  Apart from the question on the overstrict and too narrow definition of multi-storey buildings contained in the Bill there is also the question of the responsibility which would be placed on local authorities to carry out the necessary assessments of local authority buildings. It is a bit much to ask the local authorities who are already very hard pressed for resources to carry out an assessment of the buildings which they own.  The Minister says that where the local authority is the owner of a multi-storey building situated in its own functional area and where a report is called for it should be signed by a competent person.  I assume it is the Minister's intention that that competent person would not be somebody associated directly or indirectly or employed directly or indirectly by the local authority concerned or indeed by any other local authority.  In other words, <Col N="1839" /> there has to be a degree of objectivity and independence about such reports. Also, generally speaking, the point about the question of the independence of the competent person to carry out such examination needs to be clearly established relative to the whole area of local authority responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are downstream responsibilities demanding some resource commitment, depending on the findings of the competent person.  For example, if the competent person in carrying out his or her examination creates circumstances in which there is an onus of responsibility resting on a local authority, they may not be able to handle that responsibility depending on the needs that arise. All of us in this Chamber realise that the law departments of many local authorities are already overstretched; many of them say they are overstretched and many seem unable to deliver on their existing obligations. There is no point in our bringing in a law if it cannot be operated.  Therefore, if there is to be a form of vested interest &mdash; I am not saying it would be exercised deliberately &mdash; which might say: &ldquo;Well, it would be helpful if we did not have a clatter of complaints arising out of these inspections&rdquo;, in some circumstances that might compromise the capacity for independent assessment by the competent person referred to in the Bill.  Therefore, the person who takes on responsibility for undertaking the evaluations should be clearly independent of the local authority, should be able to operate in a totally free and unpressured environment, allowing that person to do his or her job without any form of inhibition, any form of reference to the fact that the law department in the authority is already hard-pressed.  If that assessment is not carried out with absolute integrity, then the Bill is a sham.  I know that is not what the Minister or anybody else wants, but it is a key point.  I should like that point dealt with clearly when the Minister is responding.</P>
    <P>I also have a small worry about section <Col N="1840" /> 4 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>It shall be sufficient compliance with subsection (1) of this section for any of the persons to whom this section applies to submit a certificate in respect of the entire building.</P>
    <P>I am not clear precisely what that means and want it clarified.  Am I to understand that, if there is a multi-storey building and a certificate is got by the owner in respect of one area of the building, that there may be, without the examination being assigned or applied to the whole building, a clearance certificate issued, or that it may be given the OK on the register to be held by the local authority?  I want to ascertain what is the purpose of section 4 (3) because I am not clear as to its purpose.  It seems to me to put a certain pressure on the capacity of the individual to undertake an absolute evaluation.  It may mean that we may get, if you like, certificates in respect of a whole building on the basis of a partial examination.  I could be misreading that subsection but that is the best reading I can make of it.</P>
    <P>We all want the provisions of the Bill, in essence, to succeed.  But I am struck by the fact that we may be asking too much of local authorities, who are expected to maintain these registers when it is clear to most of us here, and, I am sure, the Minister also, that some of the registers at present supposed to be maintained by such local authorities &mdash; for example, in relation to rented accommodation in the private sector where there are by-laws in existence &mdash; do not operate.  We know they do not operate. What is the point in asking a local authority to maintain another register?  The Minister spoke today at Question Time about another register in relation to the dumping of wastes.  I know that does not operate either.  I have a worry that we are perhaps creating a solution but passing the buck to local authorities who are hard-pressed in many cases and who, at the very best, operate totally arbitrary and unco-ordinated standards.  I am fearful that we may get a very patchy, uneven <Col N="1841" /> and erratic application of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the capacity or, in some cases, the will of the local authorities involved to carry out the provisions of this Bill to their full rigour.  I am not sure how that problem can be addressed beyond saying that it is important that, above and beyond merely having a register for local authorities to operate, the Minister should have regular reports from local authorities on their performance in this respect.  I would hope also that there would be consistency in the way this register and the provisions of this Bill are to be implemented rather than each individual local authority going off and doing their own thing, as they do at present in so many cases in an area which has at its heart fundamental questions relating to public safety.</P>
    <P>The task force identified, as indeed did Cremer and Warner, the consultant engineers and scientists who reported certain forms of construction as being key to the provisions of this Bill.  They would be forms of construction that would give rise to the kind of structural problems to which Deputy Bruton referred a few moments ago.  A Bill which is entitled the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill allows us a facility to take on board the problems arising right across the urban landscape in relation to multi-storey buildings.  Another one of those, for example, is the whole area of listed old buildings which in many cases are not being maintained &mdash; in some cases because their owners simply cannot pay for their maintenance and in others because it suits the owners who want to have them developed.  The consequence of that may very well be &mdash; again, to my knowledge &mdash; many elderly people living in dangerous conditions over which there is no scrutiny and in relation to which all of us would be extremely dissatisfied.  In many cases they are five-storey buildings; they are multi-storey.  There were cases recently in Eccles Street of buildings that would fall into that category.  There are cases all around the city of buildings which give rise to serious questions with <Col N="1842" /> regard to their safety.  It is not that mysterious because many of them are very old.</P>
    <P>I have a regret that the provisions of the Bill did not say that their target was all multi-storey buildings over a period of time, beginning with those that were seen to be particularly vulnerable in the light of the report of the task force.  That would have been reasonable.  I cannot understand why the Minister sets these artificial arbitrary parameters on his right to impact on the serious problem.</P>
    <P>Of course, the local authorities constitute the agency for the Bill.  While I have significant admiration for many individuals within local authorities, in their present structure, arrangement and financing their time is running out.  It is perhaps unfair and expecting too much to impose yet another responsibility on them, as we are so willing to do so often, without giving them any guidance, resources or any clear criteria in relation to national consistency of standard application for doing that job.  I hope it is not a question simply of introducing a Bill, passing it to local authorities and hoping that it will be all right on the night.  In this case it was not all right on the night of 25 February 1987 when the explosion occurred.</P>
    <P>In my view the Bill is an attempt to go a little along the road.  I would prefer a more fulsome, comprehensive assault on a serious urban problem.  I would prefer to be getting absolute assurances that the recommendations of that task force, which were serious and considered, were being implemented in the spirit and to the letter under the watchful eye of the Minister rather than by a disparate and unevenly-operating range of local authorities all over the country, many of them preoccupied with their existing statutory responsibilities and finding it very difficult to undertake those.  I am worried that the provisions of the Bill will not be effective.  I hope the Minister can assure me to the contrary.  I hope the Bill works but I have doubts about that and I will try, in my own modest way, to improve the Bill when it comes up for discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the Deputies who has berated the Minister for being tardy in coming forward with legislation, what I have to say now is undoubtedly going to sound very ungracious.  My berating of the Minister remains constant because in this instance he has come in with the wrong Bill and it is the very last Bill which should have been brought into this House.  The Minister has left the Bill that would address this problem languishing on the shelf for the past three years, and I accept that the Minister has had responsibility for this Bill only for approximately 14 or 15 months.</P>
      <P>I have studied the Bill and I have sought professional advice from my colleagues in the engineering profession. Architects do not frequently refer to engineers as colleagues, but in this instance I recognise that it is the engineering profession who uniquely are going to be put into the firing line if this Bill becomes law.  It is an unnecessary and bad Bill and it will not solve the basic problem which the Minister thinks it is designed to do so.  I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of the Department of the Environment or of the Minister in coming forward with this measure but I think we should at the outset recognise what is at issue.  The issue is not the structural safety of the multi-storey buildings in this State.  The history of their construction and performance since 1922, if one wants to take the date of Independence, has been such that there is no need for alarm certainly for any building built after 1950.  The only building that collapsed in recent times of natural causes as distinct from an explosion was a building at the corner of Fenian Street and Holles Street of much older age which had, because of the outrageous behaviour of the landlords of the day, become a dilapidated tenement and collapsed during the summer of 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt by the Government to try to reassure public opinion with regard to the safety of the utilisation of gas.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the role and functions of the Department of the Environment.  I suggest to the Minister that it has been visited upon <Col N="1844" /> him by the Government in the recognition that if Dublin Gas in particular do not manage to continue to sell substantial quantities of gas to their consumers then an entire and substantial public investment, with which I thoroughly agree, will be somewhat in jeopardy.  I thoroughly support the objective of reassuring the people of Dublin as to the appropriateness, safety and cleanliness of our natural fuel which comes to us at a fraction of the cost of alternative fuels, which does not pollute our atmosphere, which does not cause respiratory illnesses and which can be very efficiently transported around the city.  I fully support whatever measures the Department of Energy and the Government are taking to enhance the image of natural gas and reassure the consumer in respect of that commodity which is now in public ownership and at last under the very effective management of Bord Gáis Éireann and Dublin Gas.</P>
    <P>That is the background to this Bill.  It was the explosion in Raglan House on 1 January 1987 which triggered off the fear, worry and reaction to natural gas.  The Government of the day commissioned a group of renowned international engineers, who are based in London and whose credentials in the area of gas, gas handling and gas conveyancing are second to none to carry out a survey.  They produced a substantial report in relation to Dublin Gas and the way in which gas is handled in and out of buildings.  They are not structural engineers but their terms of reference required them to look at the structure of the two buildings that were subject to explosions, Dolphin House and Raglan House.  I should say that I live in Railway Cottages which are situated across the railway tracks from Raglan House.  I was not there at the time the explosion occurred but I was there at 12.30 p.m. and during the days and weeks that followed I saw what happened to that building.</P>
    <P>Cremer and Warner and the consultants who prepared the report subcontracted in a consultant structural engineer to do the structural side of their report.  That section of the report was defective.  I am confining my remarks <Col N="1845" /> entirely to the structural design of multi-storey buildings.  In the Cremer and Warner report there were certain assumptions, a lot of non-sequiturs, no evidence of that kind of work upon which people could evaluate the quality of the conclusion.  Running through this report from British based consultants and a subcontracted consultant engineer, there was an implication that Irish engineering standards might be defective.  For example, in respect of the Raglan House explosion and the collapse of the building, the conclusion of Cremer and Warner is that because the building collapsed the structure must have been defective.  There is no structural analysis in real terms as to why it collapsed.  In fact, the building collapsed because a lake of natural gas had been allowed to accumulate in the sub-structure and surrounding area of that building and because of weather conditions at the time the processes of natural ventilation, which would have reduced that lake of natural gas, did not prevail and unfortunately &mdash; we do not know what ignited that natural gas but we do know that it was ignited &mdash; an enormous explosion took place.  In engineering design the threshold of loading or impact of 35 kN is the maximum a building is normally expected to absorb.  For example, nobody in the engineering world and no local authority would require an architect or an engineer to design a building that would be capable of sustaining a direct hit from an Exocet missile.  There are standards beyond which one simply does not design for because they are outside the reasonable expectation of the kind of wear and tear a building would be expected to endure.</P>
    <P>In their report Cremer and Warner are defective in their logical analysis in terms of the extent of the explosion that took place at Raglan House.  The net point, without being technical or boring the House, is that if the level of the explosion from that lake of gas was in excess of 35 kN then the design, defective or otherwise, of the building is irrelevant, because even if it had been a superbly constructed <Col N="1846" /> Rolls Royce, belt and braces granitefaced building, it would have been substantially damaged by the force of that explosion.  In relation to Dolphin House, which was constructed in breeze block and not in solid masonry walls and reinforced planks as was Raglan House, the level of the explosion that took place there appears to have been far less than that which took place at Raglan House and consequently the damage was less. Cremer and Warner conclude that because the damage was less at Dolphin House, it was a more robust building than Raglan House.</P>
    <P>There are many contradictions running through the structural side of the analysis of the Cremer and Warner report.  For example, they use the phrase &ldquo;progressive collapse&rdquo; right through the entire documentation, but when the task force which the Government set up looked at this they recognised there was no reference to the term &ldquo;progressive collapse&rdquo; in the codes of standards used by engineers in Ireland or in the United Kingdom.  Therefore, the phrase &ldquo;disproportionate collapse&rdquo; was used.</P>
    <P>The reason I am making this introductory point is, without any pun intended, to challenge the validity or veracity of the foundations upon which this ultimate legislative response rests.  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>The Government considered that a statutory requirement to appraise these buildings and to take any necessary action was needed to reassure both the users of such buildings and the public in general.  The Bill I have now brought before the House reflects a response to that need.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an attempt to reassure people. It is well motivated &mdash; that is not disputed &mdash; and is a genuine response to a wave of fear caused in the minds of many people who were using natural gas in their homes and which is now being effectively dealt with.  Anyone who walks around the streets of Dublin knows very well that it is being dealt with effectively because one might as well be having a stroll in the Alps due to the way the pavements have <Col N="1847" /> been dug up to reinstate the entire network of distribution of natural gas.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is so much surface disruption around the city of Dublin is testimony to the fact that we are renewing and replacing defective sections of the gas distribution system throughout our city and hence the fears that people had are not longer justified.  This Government are using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut.  They are imposing on the construction industry generally, on the professional engineers in particular and on the owners of certain buildings, a sequence of unnecessary costs and procedures which will not make their buildings any safer.</P>
    <P>If this Bill becomes law it will not make these buildings any safer.  We are talking about buildings built since 1950.  Georgian Dublin is exempt from this legislation. We are only talking about buildings over five storeys built since 1950.  None of these buildings were built by owner occupiers or jerry builders or do-it-yourself extension builders.  We are talking about elaborate construction since 1950.  These buildings were constructed and supervised under existing design criteria, the bulk of which will be in accordance with the standards set out in relation to this legislation.  The Minister recognises that in some cases if a building requires to be reinforced the cost of reinforcing it would not be economically justifiable and that other measures recommended by the task force can be implemented.</P>
    <P>There is an element of panic here.  We are walking towards a tragedy and not without the benefit of hindsight, because the same thing happened in Britain.  A system of construction borrowed from the Danes who used it for seven and eight storey constructions in the sixties was adapted by the British to build up to 20 and 22 storeys.  This system is essentially like a pack of cards house &mdash; a panel for the wall, a panel for the floor and a panel for the roof and it was as vulnerable in effect as a house of cards.  In Ronan Point, because of an accumulation of gas there was a blow-out at the 15th or 16th <Col N="1848" /> storey; it blew out two of these panels and everything above and below them started to shred.  There was a great outcry at the time.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have no buildings similar in construction to the Ronan Point buildings. The response to that tragedy, because there was a lot of local authority housing built on the same system, was a massive structural reinforcing of those buildings at enormous cost.  Yet, the statistical probability of another Ronan Point happening, once the management of the gas appliances was properly adhered to was very low.  The engineers calculated that for one life saved approximately £20 million of taxpayers' money in Britain was spent.  That was the kind of ratio.  It was very expensive and it was not cost effective, although it is not easy to attempt to put a price on a life.  This legislation is setting into law a number of costs and requirements, the full consequences of which the Minister has not thought out properly.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to this debate.</P>
    <P>On the consumer end, if a person has bought a flat or an apartment in a building of five storeys, that is four storeys with a penthouse, and wishes to sell it, that person as the owner will not be required to get a certificate of compliance.  In many cases the construction company which built the block of flats no longer exists, because most companies, on completion of a building project go into self-liquidation. In that case the owner will be required to try to get from the engineer who originally designed the block of flats a certificate to comply with this Bill.  The Bill does not require the engineer to certify that the building was designed so as to comply with the necessary standards of safety.  It requires an engineer to certify that the building was constructed so as to satisfy standards of safety in accordance with the codes.  The onus falls on the person who is certifying that this compliance has been met and it is very substantial. If he or she gets it wrong, he or she is liable to fines and in some cases to three years in prison.</P>
    <P>All professional engineers have to <Col N="1849" /> carry indemnity professional liability insurance and the first thing that will be affected by this is the cost for professional engineers of professional indemnity.  Secondly, it will make the owners of apartment buildings who wish to sell them or who want to get insurance face additional costs because the certificate will have to be acquired, presuming one can get an engineer who is prepared to lay his head on the block to certify that the building has been constructed in accordance with the regulations under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Even where an engineer supervises a building, he may not be 100 per cent sure that the work had been carried out in accordance with the design drawings.  No team of professionals can be 100 per cent sure.  Most of the time one is sure but when one comes to the point of formally certifying it to the extent required here there can be a reasonable doubt.  Whatever about a building which one designs and supervises at construction stage, there is no way in which one can certify that an existing building complies with the regulations, with the degree of certainty and authority that this Bill requires.  It would be a bit like asking some of the best chefs in the world to certify that a cake, for example, has been made strictly in accordance with the recipe.  One cannot retrospectively unscramble an egg and examine its quality and testify that the eggs were pure and organically produced before they went into the cake.</P>
    <P>These difficulties are not particular to this Bill.  They relate to the whole question of service certification.  If we had the Building Control Bill in place at this stage this issue would have been resolved.  The points I am making about certification generally and about self-certification are not specific to this Bill.  They are general to the whole area of self-certification.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech said that the regulations would prescribe the form of the certificate.  I hope when we get to the relevant section on Committee Stage we will have a draft of the form of that certificate.  I am giving the Minister notice now that I will be opposing that section unless we have a draft.  With no <Col N="1850" /> disrespect to the Minister here present the way in which our business is done in this House is that we never get to debate the regulations of much of the legislation that is enacted.  From the point of view of the concern that I am addressing at present &mdash; that of competency, engineers and certificates, their signing and their availability &mdash; it is the precise legal wording of the form of that certificate, it is the extent of the commitment you are asking an engineer to undertake in terms of profession liability costs and in terms of what they will have to answer for in a court of law should something go wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister's very able civil servants here and in the Department of the Environment are familiar with this entire field. There have been numerous draft forms of certificates submitted by the professional bodies and agencies during the last three, four and five years, so I am not asking for something to be pulled out of the hat. There are forms that have been drafted by the relevant institutes that have been discussed with groups like the insurance companies, who handle insurance, which would go a long way down the road to satisfying requirements of legislation on the one hand and fears from self-certifiers on the other.  We should see it here on the floor of this House.  I should like to say to the Minister that I could not vote in the relevant section, unopposed, unless we got sight of the kind of draft certificate that he had in mind so that we could talk about it.  Out of courtesy and out of fairness I am duty bound to signal that at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should now like to cite some of the sources and some of the assistance I got. I should like to quote from a report which was prepared by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee formed by the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland and the Institution of Structural Engineers (Republic of Ireland Branch).</P>
    <P>This <i>ad hoc</i> committee was set up as an appraisal of the official reports on the Raglan House and Dolphin House incidents by Cremer and Warner Limited with regard to aspects relating to structural engineering design of buildings to <Col N="1851" /> prevent disproportionate damage in the event of an accident.  The reason I am taking the trouble to read some of these conclusions into the record is important. We do not often get an opportunity in this House to debate something like this.</P>
    <P>What is implicitly at issue here is the technical and professional competence of our building design and construction design institutions.  If you look at the level of our investment as a community, in the education of engineers and at the part now which the building industry is beginning to play abroad &mdash; and will increasingly play in other member states of the European Community &mdash; it is absolutely essential that no suggestion of second rate performance, or inferior standards of professional design or competence, is implied or attached to Irish institutions. It is very much in our interest as a community, as a nation and as a group of taxpayers that the high standards that have been consistently achieved in the education of engineers &mdash; and in the administration of their affairs by engineers and by the local authorities be maintained, and the evidence of the adherence to those high standards is the fact that the number of buildings that actually collapse, as distinct from falling in on themselves, as a result of an enormous explosion in this country is very small. It is important to nail the Cremer and Warner report so far as it addresses itself to structural performance of Irish design. Section 3 of the report states:</P>
    <P>3.  The committee consider CWL should be congratulated for producing their Reports in such a short time. However, several aspects of the CWL Reports were of concern to the committee in its attempts to see what if any lessons can be learned from the Raglan House and Dolphin House incidents in relation to structural design of buildings.</P>
    <P> 3.1.  The committee noted that CWL apparently had no powers of discovery. This may have limited the availability of information and consequently the thoroughness of the Reports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> 3.2.  CWL's terms of reference (Main Report, page 2.1) restricted examination to similar types of buildings and occupancy.  However, it is noted that their recommendations extend to buildings of varying occupancy, height and forms of construction.  No information is given on what studies were undertaken to encompass other types of buildings.</P>
    <P>3.3.  The report does not set out the following important information concerning Raglan House:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The full design team for the project. The Architect and Consulting Structural Engineer are named but the other members, if any, are not referred to. </P>
    <P>The other members would include the mechanical engineer who would have responsibility for the installation of the gas fittings among other things.</P>
    <P>The terms and date of appointment of the design team including the Consulting Structural Engineer and the areas of authority and responsibility retained by the Client/Developer.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that this was a developer project where the builder was also the developer.  That alters considerably the relationship in professional terms between the contractor on the one hand and the design team on the other. The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>&mdash; The brief for the design team.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The actual design and supervision process.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The legal requirement for approval under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and Building Bye Laws at that time. </P>
    <P>The apparent absence of this information to CWL may have implications for their assessment of Irish design practice.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that a study on the structure of the building could have been undertaken without this basic information being obtained, studied and <Col N="1853" /> evaluated.  I am aware from one of the engineers involved that a very perfunctory attempt was made by the people involved to contact him in relation to this.  I am looking at the validity of the foundations upon which this Bill rests.  I am reading into the record some of the observations by representatives of the three engineering institutions in our society.  The report further states:</P>
    <P>3.4 The CWL Reports do not list what information they sought or obtained and what discussions they had with the building designers to ensure the information they were working with was correct and to confirm as far as possible the correctness of any assumptions they might be making. The Reports present little by way of technical description or sketches of the building structure of Raglan House (e.g. details of structural screed/floor units, control joints in masonry, strength and other details of blocks and bricks used, mortar type, type and spacing of wall ties, bearing details of slabs on walls, beam details or the general structural arrangements).  This information would be necessary to carry out a complete appraisal of the building structure.</P>
    <P>3.5 The CWL Reports present no detailed structural analysis of Raglan House or Dolphin House, nor do they imply that such analyses were carried out.  The Main Report as it relates to building structure appears to accept the premises that because Raglan House collapsed, it was not structurally adequate by normal standards.</P>
    <P>That is incredible.  That means that if a bomb were to hit &mdash; and some people in the city would not be sorry if it did &mdash; the civic offices down in Wood Quay, they were structurally inadequate because they had collapsed.  The logic of that is something that should not be let out of kindergarten schools and yet this is in the report of Cremer and Warner.  Section 3.6 of the Report states:</P>
    <P>3.6 The description of the damage <Col N="1854" /> after the first critical explosion appears contradictory.  Comparing Fig. 5.1., Fig. 6.2 and the text, it cannot be determined from the Report exactly what sections of walls or floor slabs on each floor can be said to have suffered immediate primary damage.  For instance, it is not clear how much of the outside wall of the lounge in flat 1 was damaged to the extent that it could not perform any structural function. The first paragraph of section 5.2 in the Main Report is particularly confusing.</P>
    <P>However it seems clear that several lengths of wall at least, probably all of the loadbearing walls in the front area of flat 1 (i.e. all of the loadbearing walls around the kitchen and bedrooms), were demolished by the immediate effects of the first explosion.  This is damage far in excess of that allowed for in normal design procedure and the subsequent collapse of the section of the building over this area could not therefore be considered disproportionate to the initial incident.</P>
    <P>This implies that the extent of the explosion on the one hand and the perceived performance of the building on the other were such that you could not deduce or conclude that the building was structurally faulty or badly designed.</P>
    <P>3.7 It is not pointed out in the CWL Reports that the occurrence of a second explosion shortly after the first main explosion would not be considered in the design of a building.</P>
    <P>&mdash;another important consideration&mdash;</P>
    <P>3.8 The incident was the result of an unlikely combination of circumstances. The primary cause was accumulation of gas in the building without which no accident could have occurred.  The report presents substantial evidence that the source of the gas explosion was a major factor on the external gas main.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting:</P>
      <P>Subsoil condition and lack of effective remedial action allowed an underground lake of gas to accumulate around and beneath the building... calm weather conditions prior to the explosion restricted ventilation, thus creating the most favourable conditions for the accumulation of an explosive mixture within the flats.</P>
      <P>I turn now to conclusions in this report.</P>
      <P>
        <i>A summary of Conclusions</i>
      </P>
      <P> 7.1 The primary cause of both the Raglan House and the Dolphin House incidents was leakage of gas.  The committee is satisfied that the need to control the risk of occurrence of a gas explosion is the primary lesson to be learned from the incidents.</P>
      <P>7.2 The basic aim of the relevant current structural design procedures is to prevent accidental damage to a structure which is disproportionate to the cause of the damage.  Neither Raglan House nor Dolphin House are shown to have suffered damage disproportionate to the cause of the damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> 7.3 The Raglan House and Dolphin House incidents as reported by Cremer &amp; Warner Ltd. do not indicate that the accidental damage provisions of the current structural engineering design codes need to be amended.</P>
    <P>7.4 The Raglan House and Dolphin House incidents present no new evidence to cause particular concern in relation to existing buildings and their ability to resist accidental damage. </P>
    <P>I have summarised that report for Members of the House and people reading this debate later.  The report is available in the Library.  In essence what clearly must come out of this debate is that our standards of structural design in terms of current practice and their execution are not below European standards and in many cases are in excess of them.  Therefore, we should not allow the tragedy of these two accidents to cause us, because of a badly written section of the Cremer &amp; Warner report in relation to structural design for reasons I have read into the debate, to cloud judgment or be allowed to stick.  The bottom line at the end of the day is the credibility of an Irish engineer in some years' time looking for a contract or whatever and one of the most famous international firms saying that Irish engineering standards in design and construction are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the Bill before us.  I have demonstrated that over reaction to the unfortunate accidents as demonstrated in the Government's response by way of a statutory provision is inappropriate. We need a statutory provision; but in a Building Control Bill, not this legislation.  Again, let me quote from a document which has been prepared by the Joint Committee of the Engineering Institutions on the disproportionate collapse of buildings and which contains some comments on the proposed Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill, 1988.</P>
    <P>The committee's report dated October 1987 which I have quoted presents the committee's view, with the reasons for it, <Col N="1857" /> that legislation of the type proposed is inappropriate.  The committee here deals only with the Bill as presented but the comments presented are intended to be read with the committee's earlier reports.</P>
    <P>Comments</P>
    <P> 1.  <i>&ldquo;Competent Person&rdquo;</i></P>
    <P> a.  We query the wisdom of allowing self-certification as proposed. We would again strongly urge that the offer of I.E.I. to assist in preparing a list of suitable experienced chartered engineers should be accepted.  Provision could be made, we understand, for equivalently qualified engineers from other member states of the EC.</P>
    <P>b.  In relation to the structural engineering experience of competent persons, we consider that experience should be required in structural design and (rather than or) appraisal of multi-storey buildings. We consider this to be of critical importance.  At the very least, experience should be required in structural design of multi-storey buildings and structural appraisal of existing buildings. </P>
    <P>2.  <i>&ldquo;Multi-Storey Buildings&rdquo;</i></P>
    <P> a.  We would suggest that a penthouse or other habitable top floor should be defined explicitly as being a storey.  There are a significant number of buildings that this would apply to.  Similarly, clarification in relation to basements would be advisable.</P>
    <P>b.  What will the situation be in relation to premises that were completed originally before 1950 and have since been refurbished either (a)  prior to publication of the relevant design Code in the First Schedule or (b) after publication? </P>
    <P>3.  <i>&ldquo;Robustness&rdquo;</i></P>
    <P>We consider the definition of robustness <Col N="1858" /> to be a bad one.  If robustness must be defined we suggest it be defined as the characteristic of a building which militates against disproportionate damage occuring to a building in the event of an accident.  However, in the context of legislation, it would be more pertinent to define &ldquo;disproportionate damage&rdquo; which is not defined in any of the design Codes in the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>&ldquo;Specified Building&rdquo;</i></P>
    <P>Since the word &ldquo;specified&rdquo; has other firmly established engineering connotations we suggest some other term should be used such as &ldquo;designated building&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to floors, the definition refers to buildings constructed &ldquo;wholly or in part&rdquo; using precast concrete floors.  There could be a significant number of hybrid buildings.  Thus a multi-storey building with only one floor of precast concrete units has to be subjected to the same appraisal as a building where all the floors are precast. And the preliminary cert., clause 3(I)(a), will require thorough investigation to ensure there is no area in the building where precast units were used.</P>
    <P>Does the last Section of the definition mean &ldquo;and, <i>wholly or in part,</i> either p.c. frames or p.c. wall panels or masonry walls&rdquo; i.e. is any building with some p.c. floor units and some loadbearing masonry, however limited, a &ldquo;specified building&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We assume the term &ldquo;precast concrete floors&rdquo; is intended to encompass situations where p.c. floor units were used on roofs.  </P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Chair has said but I am raising questions about definitions.  I should like to remind the Chair, whose interventions are designed to be helpful and speed up the business of the House, that there are almost two pages of definitions.  The definitions are critical to the operation of the Bill and clarification on how they will be interpreted is at the core of whether the Bill is worse than I fear it is going to be.</P>

      <P>If I had your faith in the ability of the Government and Fine Gael Whips to so arrange the programme for the House as to provide for a full Committee Stage debate without a guillotine &mdash; tragically that has not been my experience in recent weeks &mdash; I would be prepared to defer some of my comments to Committee Stage.

      <P>The Deputy will accept the Chair is not aware of that and even if that were so it would not be a justification for the Deputy trying to circumvent what is laid down in Standing Orders in respect of a Second <Col N="1860" /> Stage debate.  I know I will not have to pursue that at any great length and I ask the Deputy not to go into great detail on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Chair's point and in order to facilitate the House I will make the document I am quoting from available to the Minister.  Section 3 is the key section of the Bill and I expect we will be dealing with a similar provision in the Bill dealing with building control. Will certification be the responsibility of the firm or the individual?  Who will carry the professional liability?  What will their exposure be in terms of the courts and costs?  Many designers, architects and engineers cannot afford the cost of professional liability insurance.  The premium for large to medium-sized architectural firms for professional indemnity liability insurance can run from £5,000 to £20,000, depending on the amount of cover one tries to buy.  Many limits are imposed and fully comprehensive cover is not provided.  When the Bill is passed local authorities will demand certificates for office blocks and flats that are built.  The person who issues that certificate will have to be competent and will have to have adequate insurance cover.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the requirement to submit further certificates where a building has been altered subsequent to the issuing of the original certificate.  I should like to ask the Minister to elaborate on that provision when replying. How does he see it operating because in my view it will amount to an enormous imposition on local authorities?  Getting an engineer to move in and assess what is required is at one level an enormous task.  If it is not strictly defined in the Bill, and clearly codified in the regulations, we could have different standards of certification and investigation with different cost implications.  The report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We note there is no attempt made to define how exhaustive should be the engineer's investigations on which he bases his opinion.  Such a statement is a normal feature of all appraisal reports <Col N="1861" /> certificates and is normally determined as part of the engineer's brief by the client, or by the client and engineer by mutual agreement.  The form of the certificate should be amenable to particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I will accede to the Chair's request in regard to dealing in detail with the sections.  I understand the Minister has a copy of the document I referred to and, therefore, there is no need for me to read it into the record of the House.</P>
    <P>In my view the Bill is unnecessary.  It will not make one building in the State any safer in real terms because the standards of engineering, construction and design both in the competence of the professionals over many years and the standard of the buildings &mdash; irrespective of what may have caused explosions as dealt with by Cremer and Warner &mdash; are very high.  Our buildings are not substandard in structural stability and design.  That is particularly true of buildings of five storeys and more built since 1950.  They would have been designed and built by a competent contractor.  The need to reassure public opinion is not necessary.  In my view the Minister should have brought in a Bill dealing with building control and I should like to urge him to introduce such a Bill in the near future.  I look with horror at the waste of scarce parliamentary and drafting time in putting this Bill through the House when a Bill on building control would have been better.  A lot of time has been spent on the Bill by officials in the Department of the Environment where the embargo still applies.  The Attorney General's office have also had to devote a lot of time to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill will result in extra conveyancing and insurance costs, particularly for those who live in blocks of flats of five storeys and more.  We have a lot of that accommodation around Dublin city.  Is the Minister prepared to have discussions on this with the Incorporated Law Society and the building societies so that they will not look for certificates of compliance under the legislation every time a property changes hands, as would <Col N="1862" /> be the norm in relation to the buying and selling of apartments?  Those of us who deal in conveyancing will be aware of the amount of paperwork involved, of the assurances and reassurances that solicitors seek from time to time at the behest of a building society or other financial institution.  The Bill will add another level of bureaucracy to the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister should agree to give this scarce parliamentary time to his colleague, the Minister for Energy, so that he can reassure the House and the public that Dublin Gas, now that the structures under which it operates have been clearly rationalised, has improved.  He should assure us that the relationship between Dublin Gas and BGE has improved and that they have, however slowly and sluggishly, a new system of management and improved work practices at all levels.  He should assure us that the gas system is safe.</P>
    <P>This is a response to an unfortunate accident in which a number of people were killed and is based on a report which was seriously defective in its structural analysis as to what happened.  It seeks to impose a new level of requirements which is without precedent in Europe.  I have not been able to establish through my engineering colleagues whether the Germans, the Italians, the French or the British require this level of certification.  I am not aware of the specific type of certification as distinct from a building design code.  The construction codes in relation to engineering, which are implicit in the building regulations that come under the Building Control Bill, will address themselves to standards of safety.  Can the Minister point to any other country that has a large stock of buildings and is of the same level of economic development as ourselves, or even higher, that has sought to impose upon itself this kind of requirement?  I would be surprised if he can cite any such countries. I have made inquiries from the people to whom I have referred earlier, many of whom have international experience, and they indicate that they are not aware of any such requirement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> I have in this House berated the Minister over the last few months for his very inadequate legislative performance and track record, having regard to the enormous amount of work that was ready on his desk.  The sadness is that he comes into the House with a Bill which is not necessary and which will, unfortunately, impose additional costs on the construction industry at a time when that industry is this year recording approximately 10 per cent of a decline in output as against last year.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Quinn, I welcome this legislation, albeit legislation with certain weaknesses which need to be addressed.  I hope the Minister and the House will address those weaknesses during the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Before I comment on what I think are the weaknesses I would like to say that I have been chairman of an <i>ad hoc</i> informal committee of Dublin TDs of all parties who have been pursuing the question of gas safety in Dublin for some considerable time.  I raised in this House the question of gas safety in high rise buildings before the Raglan House explosion &mdash; from those benches over there &mdash; when very few people were interested in the subject.  Two weeks before that explosion took place I warned in this House that that was a possibility. I have pursued this matter in the House. I, more than any other Deputy, have urged the Minister to introduce this legislation as soon as possible.  Therefore I am glad that it is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reports have been referred to, specifically the Cremer and Warner report, but I have not heard any reference so far to the Dutch report, the VEG Gas Institute report, which was made public by the Minister for Energy on 20 August 1987.  It is a technical audit of the New Dublin Gas distribution system.  For some time I have suspected that the report, which was made public <Col N="1864" /> and circulated to the press, a copy of which I received on request from the Department of Energy, is an incomplete report.  It seems that either all of the report was not published or that the report is written in pidgin English, in which case it would appear that it was issued in some haste.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when replying or, if he is not in a position to tell the House tonight, on Committee Stage, having checked in the interval, if the report as published by his colleague on 20 August 1987 contains all the report of the VEG Gas Institute, the Dutch consultants, who were called in to audit the gas distribution system.  Will the Minister assure the House that there are no other sections of the report or no other secondary reports which have not been made public.</P>
    <P>The report is badly written, albeit a devastating report, which suggests the setting up of an independent inspectorate to police the safety of the gas grid.  That independent inspectorate should be set up, particularly in relation to multi-storey buildings.  I feel strongly &mdash; and I have raised the point in this House over a considerable period &mdash; that there should be a Minister responsible for the safe distribution of gas in our city.  The public and this House are not being told all the facts with regard to the gas grid in the Dublin region.  There is reason to be concerned about the safety of people on the streets, adjacent to buildings and in buildings, particularly domestic buildings and multi-storey buildings.  I am not just referring to Raglan House or Dolphin House.  No reference has been made to the fact that the only reason there was not injury or loss of life in the latter case was that it was raining and the children, who normally play in the forecourt of the flats where the explosion took place, were indoors.  It was miraculous that nobody was hurt in that case.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Nicholas Street, which I raised in the Dáil, but no reference has been made to the explosion two weeks ago in Oliver Bond flats in my own constituency where a man was severely injured in a flat which did not <Col N="1865" /> have a gas appliance and did not have in use a gas system inside the flat.  Similarly, in my constituency, in Slievenamon Road in Drimnagh, a house, which not only had no gas appliance but which had no gas pipe leading into it, was damaged. An explosion from the gas mains on the footpath outside the house blew the window frame from one end of an extension right across the extension, blowing out the front windows and thereby wrecking the house.  The people who lived there had to vacate the house for a considerable time.  In relation to domestic dwellings, and in particular multi-storey dwellings, it is time that this independent inspectorate was set up to police the safety of the grid and report to a Minister who would be responsible and who, in turn, could report to this House.  It is a serious matter and has not been taken seriously by enough people in this House.  I regret to say that I am in no doubt but that there will be further explosions.  I have been warning about this since before the explosion at Raglan House and I have given five examples of it, the most recent one in Dolphin House in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a document which was sent to me by a consultant engineer. I will quote it into the record of the House because I think the Minister will find it of interest and it is a matter which requires consideration.  It is headed: &ldquo;Submission to Mr. Gay Mitchell, T. D., in relation to structural damage to Raglan Road Flats as a result of a Gas Explosion&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>Were it not for the diligence of Mr. Denis Wall of Dublin Corporation Bye Law Department in implementing the Corporation of Dublin Bye Laws to the standard of the Proposed Building Regulations there would be no control on tall buildings of this nature in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day may have said that buildings shall be constructed in accordance with these Building Regulations but this does not have the force of law, as all of us are aware. As it stands now the only statutory instruments which we need to work <Col N="1866" /> to are the Corporation of Dublin Bye Laws which were made <i>circa</i> 1890 and adopted by Dublin City Council in 1949.  Bye Laws have only been adopted by Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Galway and do not apply elsewhere.  Nor could they be applied elsewhere as there are no officers, that we are aware of, outside these centres who have any structural engineering experience.</P>
    <P>Even so all other centres outside Dublin only request an Engineers Certificate and are normally not given any structural details with the Planning and Bye Law Applications.  This is hardly any way to control building.</P>
    <P>It has taken the Stardust fire to push for a review of the Fire Regulations and we are now obliged to design for fire in accordance with the Greater London Bye Laws.  It now takes this incident to push for a review of Structural Regulations.  Without the passing of the Building Regulations by the Oireachtas there will be no change in the control of Building Construction. Alternatively it should not take a great deal of effort to get Part E of the Proposed Building Regulations adopted into the existing Bye Laws by the various Corporations and then at least we would be working to a consistent standard in these areas.</P>
    <P>For your information the Irish Standard on Load Bearing Masonry Construction was only adopted in November 1986, prior to that Irish Structural Engineers were obliged to conform to the British Standard Code of Practice BS5628 and we still design Steel Reinforced Concrete, Timber and Foundations to British Standards. Either then strive for the adoption of the entire Proposed Building Regulations or for the adoption of Part E only and we may have some control on the Structural Design of Buildings. With regard to the structural damage caused to this structure it should be said that these structures are more soundly constructed and considerably more robust than those built to standard construction, and were an explosion of <Col N="1867" /> this magnitude to occur in a standard building it would level it to the ground.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty devastating indictment. While I believe the Building Control Bill needs to be proceeded with soon, nevertheless, the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill helps.  I hope the Building Control Bill, with a strengthened Multi-Storey Bill will be enacted by the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I understand the main problem with the Raglan Road building was the cavity beneath the building.  It is all very well to require people to submit certificates but what will be done to ensure that the reconstruction or safety work has been carried out?  That is not clear from this Bill.  There are penalties imposed for submitting false certificates or for unreasonably refusing people access to a building but in my view there do not seem to be sufficient penalties if people refuse to carry out reconstruction or safety work.</P>
    <P>I wonder why this legislation is confined to five storey buildings or higher. Dolphin House and Oliver Bond House are only four storey buildings.  In the area I live, Rathmines, there are a number of very large houses with returns to the back, which are let in flats.  It would be very difficult to get out of these houses in the event of an explosion.  Why are buildings of that kind being excluded?  A three storey building over a basement would be equivalent to a four storey building, and with returns to the back, they could be the equivalent of five storey buildings.  Many of these houses would have the possible defects and dangers of a five storey building.  That needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Another point occurs to me which is not mentioned in the legislation.  I understand that a proposal, which may be proceeded with, has been presented to the planning commission of Dublin Corporation to build an underground development under O'Connell Street in Dublin.  Presumably that development would not be covered by these regulations. In Stockholm, for instance, not just the basement of buildings are below ground.  Such developments would not be <Col N="1868" /> covered by regulations here.  The Minister might look at this because this could be the way our building developments will be going in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill refers to the appropriate codes of practice and standards relating to gas distribution, service installations and use.  There appears to be a commonly held belief that once there is no gas appliance in the home, or once there is not a gas service into the home, everything is safe.  Not only was there an explosion in a flat in Oliver Bond House where there was no gas appliance but the flats had been cleared within the previous eight months by the Gas Company's task force.  There has to be some tightening up of the supply of gas to these buildings, and furthermore there should be penalties where gas is carelessly or inadequately installed, or where the Gas Company do not meet the standards which should be set down in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to buildings owned by local authorities within their own functional area.  There are many buildings in Dublin which should come under these regulations.  For instance, Ballymun flats come under these regulations because they are five storeys or higher.  Who will be responsible for checking Dublin Corporation to ensure that they comply with the standards laid down, ensuring that the gamekeeper does not turn poacher? Who will ensure that the local authority comply with the standards laid down? There should be some form of independent check on local authorities, perhaps neighbouring local authorities should be given the statutory responsibility to examine each other, because there must be some way a local authority can be brought to task if local authority buildings which have been found to be inadequate are not put right.  This is a weakness in the Bill.  The same standards should apply to the local authority as they apply to the private sector.  It does not appear under these regulations, that that would be the case.  These regulations should be tightened up so that local authorities are required to meet these requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1869" /> It is unclear from reading section 14 what penalties will be imposed on an owner who cannot submit a certificate as required by the legislation and who does not carry out the work over a specified period.  It seems that too much emphasis is being put on the need to have a professional person supply a piece of paper. What will be done to ensure the owner of the building carries out the work? There are penalties provided in the Bill for people who prevent unreasonably the owner of a building, or a local authority, from examining the building to ensure that repairs are carried out, but what will happen to the owner of the building who refuses to carry out the work?  How long will the owner be given to put the house in order?  This is very important and is another area which needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>As regards penalties, the Bill should be stronger where work has not been done and an accident occurs due to negligence. If somebody has been told a building is faulty, if the owner does not carry out the work and subsequently there is an accident which results in serious injury or loss of life, there should be a section in the Bill laying down penalties because that is criminal negligence. However, the Bill does not refer to that matter.</P>
    <P>A section should be inserted in this Bill to the effect that owners of multi-storey buildings who do not comply with the law, where there is subsequent loss of life or injury to anybody as a result of defects in their buildings, will be prosecuted. Prison sentences should be included in the Bill for that sort of negligence, because it is criminal.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on multi-storey buildings published in August, 1987 has been mentioned.  There are a couple of matters in that report to which I should like to refer.  First, would the Minister explain to the House the meaning of the term used in the report &ldquo;disproportionate collapse&rdquo;?  What is considered disproportionate?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.2.1 of the summary of that report in Chapter 1 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> The Task Force considers that the most appropriate way to ensure that future multi-storey buildings have sufficient robustness to resist accidental damage is the introduction of a building control system.  Accordingly it is recommended that the Building Control Bill should be enacted as soon as possible so that the regulations can be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Certain amendments to the proposed building regulations have also been recommended to ensure that the regulations will include due provision for modern codes and standards dealing with the prevention of disproportionate collapse and for minimising the possibility of accidental damage. </P>
    <P>It seems very clear from this report that the Building Control Bill should be passing the Legislature in tandem with the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate when it is expected that that Bill will be brought before the House.  I would urge that it be allowed to pass before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>In the report of the task force at paragraph 1.3.2 under the heading of Gas Safety, which is an important section, it is stated:</P>
    <P>There is a lack of the necessary technical information on which to make a comprehensive assessment of the state of the gas distribution systems generally. Statistical comparisons with other networks show an unacceptably high level of leakages in the recent past in Dublin due in part to the absence of systematic repair and replacement programmes.  Recommendations are made in respect of the data collection necessary as a prerequisite to proper assessemnt of the condition of the network.</P>
    <P>This multi-storey building Bill came about largely because of the explosion in Raglan House and other high rise flat complexes in Dublin city.  It would be a weakening factor in that Bill if we did not address the question of the availability of the necessary technical information on <Col N="1871" /> which to make an assessment about the whole safety of the network.  There can be explosions from pipes adjacent to buildings.  For instance, in the case of Raglan House, if we deal with all the cavities and ensure that the building boiler regulations are complied with, where in this Bill is the DART system prevented from loosening the gas supply service which runs adjacent to the DART system and to Raglan House?  There is no such provision in this Bill.  It is very clear that the whole question of gas safety must be considered.  It is mentioned specifically and clearly in the report of the task force that this question must be addressed.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 1.3.4 of the report it is stated that the task force endorses the recommendations of Cremer and Warner in respect of training of staff with responsibility for all aspects of gas safety. This is specifically in relation to their terms of reference on multi-storey buildings. Where is the legislation to support that?  Surely we should be insisting on standards outlined in the Cremer and Warner report and strongly supported and endorsed by the Minister's own task force on multi-storey buildings.  There is no mention of that in the legislation before us tonight.  Comprehensive legislation dealing with the safety of multi-storey buildings, the safety of people living and sleeping in those buildings, in the shape of sections to deal with this matter should be incorporated.  Their omission is a defect in the legislation.  I ask the Minister to address that question on Committee Stage.  At paragraph 1.3.5 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>The absence of proper records and repair history of the layout and condition of gas distribution systems was noted.  The need for comprehensive records is emphasised.</P>
    <P>Where is the legislation compelling that? Who is requiring people to do that?  There should be a Minister responsible and an independent inspectorate and this House should be accounted to in this respect.  It is a matter of public safety and I am afraid <Col N="1872" /> that it is not being taken seriously.  The horse already has bolted, but when the whole herd of horses bolt, when something very serious happens it will be too late.  We have this Bill before us and we should be looking at the question raised in the report of the task force.  We should be compelling, by law, the keeping of comprehensive records in relation to the safe distribution of gas in this city.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.3.7 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Systematic leak surveys of all mains and services is recommended.  The continuing improvement in gas safety standards should be sustained by independent monitoring of the gas utilities performance.</P>
    <P>Independent monitoring is not provided for, and why not?  Why should the Gas Company be allowed to continue to sell and distribute gas into Raglan House, Dolphin House, Oliver Bond House, Nicholas Street or anywhere else without some sort of independent overseeing as recommended in the report of the Minister's own task force?  I am not saying that because of Raglan House, Dolphin House or Oliver Bond House.  I was saying it before any of those explosions occurred.  These matters should be in the Bill.  There is no reason that there should not be a section dealing with the need for independent monitoring, with the emphasis on the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in the report it is mentioned that certain measures should be considered, one of which being to prohibit portable LPG cylinders within certain buildings and to check, test and remedy gas installations within the buildings. There is no point in having such recommendations in the task force report if the legislation does not address them.  It is all pie in the sky.  Nobody will be compelled to do anything recommended in this report unless we in this House write it in to the legislation.  We should do so because it is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 2.4.2 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Leak surveys should be carried out annually on all multi-storey buildings in piped gas areas until the incidence <Col N="1873" /> of leaks falls to one per ten buildings surveyed.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of that in the legislation. The Bill is welcome but only in tandem with the Building Control Bill and I urge the Minister to ensure that it is passed before the summer recess.  We will certainly facilitate the introduction of that legislation.  There is also a need for a much strengthened Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I urge the Minister to take account of the matters raised here, and which were also raised by his task force report, and to strengthen the Bill so that people can sleep safely in their beds and that there will be no repetition of the tragedies.  There is no point in making sympathetic speeches in the House in relation to tragedies &mdash; now is the time to consider the safety of people living in multi-storey buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their Second Stage contributions and by and large their recognition of the need for it.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate natural gas explosion at Raglan House has been the major impetus for the Bill and, since that explosion, there have been three major reports, Cremer and Warner, VEG, and the task force on multi-storey buildings with extensive recommendations in relation to gas safety.  A comprehensive ongoing monitoring system has been established between the Department of Energy and Bord Gáis Éireann to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in these reports.  In addition, the Minister for Energy has appointed a technical officer of his Department to monitor and report on progress in these reports.  The officer has been appointed on a full-time basis and significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into detail about progress on individual recommendations except to say that special attention has been given to gas safety in multi-storey <Col N="1874" /> buildings, all of which have been surveyed, inside and out, and necessary repairs carried out.  A survey around all apartment blocks has been completed. Nearly all mains in close proximity to buildings have been surveyed, as well as bridge crossings and main network value locations.  Perhaps that is the cause of the holes to which Deputy Quinn referred but they are necessary to achieve what was required in so far as gas safety is concerned.  A second survey of all other public buildings has started and the frequency of these surveys has exceeded the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy assures me he is confident that a proper safety framework is now in place for gas distribution. It must, of course, be remembered that not all the responsibility for the safe management of natural gas &mdash; or other fuels &mdash; rests with the supplier of the fuel.  The consumer has an important role to play by way of ensuring that fuels are used safely and that appliances are properly maintained.  Many of the actions required under the Third Schedule of the Bill are specifically related to the safety of gas installations in those multi-storey buildings which require a certificate under the Bill.  The owner, in consultation with his advisers, will be responsible for carrying out those actions which are necessary.  In general, however, a major responsibility also lies with those who are responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of buildings to ensure that natural gas and other fuels are installed and used safely.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked why the report concentrated on buildings of five or more storeys.  The report by Cremer and Warner on the explosion at Raglan House recommended that the task force investigating multi-storey buildings should initially concentrate on buildings of five or more storeys and, depending on the findings, consider buildings of four or more storeys.  The task force recommendations for appraisal referred only to buildings of five storeys or more.  In framing their recommendations they considered the proposed building regulations, British and Irish codes of practice <Col N="1875" /> and standards, including Irish standard 325, Part I, which clearly distinguishes between buildings of up to four storeys and of five or more storeys.  They also considered the amendment, in the aftermath of the Ronan Point explosion, of the United Kingdom building regulations relating to the design of buildings of five or more storeys (paragraph 5.5.3) of the task force report and the report which they commissioned from the joint engineering committee.  The task force found no evidence to suggest that buildings of less than five storeys should be included in their findings and recommendations, a conclusion supported by the different treatment relating to the structure of buildings of less than five storeys and of five or more storeys in Part E of the proposed building regulations, that is, that part dealing with structural strength and stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is following an increase in a country where they are used to high rise buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of pre-1950 buildings was raised and it should be noted that the joint engineering committee consider there is no evidence that post-1950 buildings generally are less robust than pre-1950 buildings.  The task force share that view which is reflected in the proposed legislation and is concerned solely with particular construction forms about which the task force were concerned. The pre-1950 buildings would not have been constructed using any of the three construction forms of concern, and Deputy Quinn agreed in that regard. These are the only forms of construction which the task force considered it prudent to have appraised.  I mention this because Deputy Keating was concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force considered that there is no evidence of cause for general concern for earlier multi-storey buildings but the risk of accidental overload should, as with all buildings, be kept as low as possible. The question of voids under buildings was also raised.  If a building cannot <Col N="1876" /> be certified as being built in accordance with codes and standards that take into account the issue of disproportionate collapse, with which this Bill is primarily concerned, then the owner and his consultant engineer will have to see that voids under the buildings are ventilated so that there cannot be a build-up of gas which could lead to an explosion.  This is provided for in the Third Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>All the recommendations of the task force are being implemented between my Department and the Department of Energy.  One of the most important recommendations, dealing with the structural quality and safety of buildings, is the amendment of Part E of the building regulations which has been completed, and I will be publishing it within days. All the recommendations from the task force are well advanced and a number of them, which require new codes of practice, have been taken up with the gas technical standards committee to have the codes and standards changed.  Other recommendations requiring amendment to the proposed building regulations are also being implemented and, like Part E to which I referred earlier, the amendments will be published when finalised.</P>

      <P>I should like to be able to publish all the amendments together so that people who use the building regulations will not have to consult a whole series of documents.  I can assure Deputy Quinn that all these matters are being dealt with.  I does not matter whether it is through my charm, persuasion or perseverance, what I am concerned about is getting the job done in a satisfactory way in order that people would <Col N="1877" /> be able to consult a proper document to ensure that their buildings are built in accordance with proper standards.</P>

      <P>As I have already told the Deputy, Committee Stage of this Bill is listed as Item No. 27 in today's Order Paper and I am ready to go whenever the Whips agree to take it.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (3), which relates to the issuing of certificates, was referred to.  I would like to state that a certificate must be provided for the entire building but in the case of multi-ownership it would be sufficient if one of the owners provided such a certificate.  It would not be necessary for everyone who owns an apartment in a building to go out and get an independent certificate.  Deputy Quinn seemed to feel that an undue cost burden would be placed on individuals who might have part ownership or multi-ownership of a major building.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the issuing of certificates for local authority buildings. It would not matter whether the competent person to sign the certificate is employed by the local authority or not. The person is defined specifically in the legislation as someone having particular qualifications.  Where he works or whom he is employed by does not matter; it would not affect his professional competence to examine and certify a building. He has to be a competent person of a certain type and that gives the necessary credence to the certificate he would have to sign.</P>
      <P>There was one matter raised by Deputy Quinn to which I should now refer.  A number of other points were raised but really these were more appropriate to a Committee Stage debate and, rather than detain the House this evening, I will be quite happy on Committee Stage to deal with the definition of disproportionate collapse and all related matters as that is the right time in which to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the form of words used on the certificate.  I would like to say to the Deputy that we gave to the <Col N="1878" /> engineers copies of the draft certificates at a meeting which we held with them at the beginning of the month of May.  That meeting was held specifically to discuss the provisions contained in the Bill.  At that meeting we provided copies of draft certificates.  The only reply which we have received since then is the letter which was delivered today of which Deputy Quinn has a copy.  They did make one comment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That letter does not refer to the certificates as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but at that meeting we provided them with copies of draft certificates.  I would be happier at this stage if they had responded and given an indication of what might be suitable in so far as they are concerned but to date they have not done so.  I hope that they will do so in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>At that meeting they said that they want to qualify any certificate to be signed with reference to what they had done during the appraisal.  I would like to hear from them on what they would require and what they wish to see included in the certificate; but there would be a danger in allowing them to qualify the certificate which would be meaningless if qualified in a certain way. I would not be too willing to allow that to happen.  However, if Deputy Quinn could use his influence to get an early response from them on what they would like to see included in the certificate I would be grateful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Deputy would.  It could tidy up the Committee Stage and we would like to get the matter finalised.  I am not going to refer to some of the points raised by Deputy Quinn as they are more suitable for discussion on Committee Stage.  But he made one point in respect of the financial institutions requiring certificates and that point was also referred to by somebody else.  Under the Bill a certificate would <Col N="1879" /> be required for the whole building.  If someone who owns an apartment in a building wishes to sell it and the buyer or the loan company wants a certificate it would be adequate for the owner to produce a copy of the certificate provided for under the Bill.  That might put to rest some of Deputy Quinn's objections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a hypothetical situation. This can be checked with the building societies, the banks and other financial institutions at a later date, but it has not been our experience that they would see as invalid a certificate which concerns the whole building.  I do not see it as a difficulty but, now that the Deputy has raised it, I will consider it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions of definition were raised on what is the difference between &ldquo;disproportionate collapse&rdquo; and &ldquo;progressive collapse.&rdquo;  Let me say that that is a matter which could be raised on Committee Stage and I will deal with it at that time. However, I will have to respond to Deputy Mitchell's point on who is going to police the local authorities.  Under the Bill the local authorities would be treated in exactly the same way as every other owner with the single exception that they would not have to notify themselves that a certificate is required.  That would be unnecessary.  The local authorities would have to get a certificate signed by a competent person as indicated in the legislation for any of the specified buildings in their own functional area just like any other owner.  This information will be recorded in a register which will be open for inspection by any member of the public, and that is important.  If any tenant in a local authority multi-storey building has any doubts, all that they would need do is consult the register <Col N="1880" /> when they would be able to see when the certificate was provided and who signed it.  Of course, they would also be able to examine the certificate should he or she wish to do so.  Members of the public will have much of their anxiety put to rest by the fact that they know they can go along and look at the register to see if a certificate of appraisal had been signed by a competent person in respect of their building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the Cremer and Warner report at length and was particularly critical of its structural section.  He referred to it as being &ldquo;weak&rdquo; and &ldquo;badly written.&rdquo;  I am not going to challenge his attitude in this regard except to say that I do not know what is to be gained from carrying out a critical analysis of that report, unless of course he was defending some interests, which he is quite entitled to do.  But he would at least have to agree that the intentions behind this legislation are good and that this point of view is shared by all of the other Deputies who contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of anxiety has been expressed by many people on these matters over the past few years and I have been under some pressure for some time from many Deputies to bring in this legislation so that people's minds can be set at rest in so far as their homes are concerned.  It means that individuals, be they in local authority tenancies or people who have purchased apartments in multi-storey buildings or whatever now can have recourse to a register which shows that their building is of a certain type of structure, has been appraised and, in effect, is safe to the degree that any building can be safe where maintenance of existing services is attended to in a proper way.  I made the opening remark that, of course, there is a great obligation on individuals themselves, apart altogether from the nature of the building, to maintain the appliances they use to ensure that they are kept in proper condition. That is important also.  Over and above that there is a genuine public demand <Col N="1881" /> that, as such, a register would be available for public examination, that competent people would be stating that buildings of a certain kind were safe and properly constructed.</P>
    <P>In advance of all the certificates being issued &mdash; here I may be sticking my neck out somewhat &mdash; I share Deputy Quinn's view that the vast majority, if not all, of these buildings are well constructed.  I would think that would be a fair comment, that the vast majority of these buildings have been constructed in a proper fashion, in accordance with a proper code of practice and so on.  But, if there was just one building where there were voids, where gas could accumulate, or even one part of a building, that would justify the introduction of this Bill, to put the mind's of people living there at rest. I would not put a value on any life, even £20 million, in answer to Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>There are not that many buildings in this country about which we must be concerned in the total in so far as multi-storey, over-five-storeys, are concerned. It is not a great burden on owners to incur the small expense involved in getting a competent person of the kind indicated in the provisions of the Bill to issue a certificate of appraisal.  It gives the owner the comfort of knowing that when he has a property for sale it is saleable, that he can sell it as being structurally sound in accordance with good building practice and that it has been tested in every way possible to ascertain that it is robust.</P>
    <P>There are advantages for all concerned, albeit with a little cost attached in so far as the competence certificate is concerned.  In the long run, the public would think it incumbent on me to see to it that what was a very big scare in this city just a short time ago would be addressed finally by way of legislation to guarantee that proper certificates of appraisal are forthcoming for the types of buildings such as are intended to be covered under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to give a complete breakdown of information on any other matters that may be raised on Committee Stage.  I thank Members who contributed, those who welcomed the Bill.  I <Col N="1882" /> hope that Deputy Quinn &mdash; who was not as forthcoming in his welcoming of the Bill &mdash; can be convinced that there was a need for it and that its introduction emanated from a genuine response to that need.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nealon gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the proposed extension of afforestation on the shores of Lough Gill from an environmental point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, very sincerely for having allowed me to raise the matter of the proposed planting in the immediate future on the shores of Lough Gill of approximately 40 acres of plantation &mdash; overlooking the Lake Isle of Innisfree.  This is a matter of major importance for Sligo and, by its implications also, for the entire country. Because of your decision, Sir, the raising of this matter is timely and is capable of influencing the future course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, Lough Gill is one of the outstanding beauty spots of the west, indeed of the entire country.  In addition to its great natural beauty, Lough Gill and the north Sligo area was also fortunate in that it won the heart of W.B. Yeats, the greatest poet of the present century.  It was his adopted land and was <Col N="1883" /> the inspiration for many of his great works.  Several of the landmarks in the area have been immortalised in his poems &mdash; Ben Bulben, the waterfall at Glencar, the churchyard at Drumcliffe where he rests and none more so than the Lake Isle of Innisfree.  Every schoolchild in recent times has known and recited that poem.  Indeed there must be very few adults in the country who have not come across it one way or another; in the best Irish tradition we are all capable of reciting at least a couple of lines.</P>
    <P>The actual Lake Isle of Innisfree in Lough Gill can be seen reasonably well from many points around the lake but can be seen in all its glory only from a particular vantage point along the Lake Isle road in Killerry.  From here one looks down on the isle with the majestic sweep of the lake and, in the background, Ben Bulben and the north Sligo mountains. As anybody who has been there will know, it is truly a breathtaking site, undoubtedly that which inspired Yeats when he camped there.  From a presentday practical point of view it is a site that attracts visitors to Sligo to see the island itself, attracted there by the natural beauty of the scenery and the fame of the poet.  Visitors come in their thousands to this vantage point every year.  They were there in large numbers over the most recent bank holiday weekend.</P>
    <P>The area has been designated by Sligo County Council as of special landscape amenity importance in their development plan.  It was also included in a Foras Forbartha inventory in the seventies as being an area of outstanding natural beauty.  It also figured in a second inventory of An Foras Forbarha &mdash; the blue book &mdash; as an area of special scientific interest because of the location, to the east of the area about which I speak, of ancient primeval woods, intact, renewing themselves almost since the Ice Age.</P>
    <P>This is the vista we are in imminent danger of losing.  Last week contractors, on behalf of a private individual who owns the 40 acres of land there, so far as we know, descended on Killerry with their machinery and began to fence off the area with a view to subsequent planting. We were told that this planting was about to take place in the very near future.  The <Col N="1884" /> planting would be done on the open space about which I speak that affords the view of the Lake Isle itself, with the lake and the mountains in the background.  We are told the intention is to plant Sitka spruce which I understand in this type of soil and climate can grow ultimately to between 40 and 60 feet.  If they proceed with this planting they would obliterate the views of the Lake Isle itself.  In addition, part of our literary history would disappear, as the trees grew, behind a timber curtain, ironically growing on the very spot on which Yeats camped annually.</P>
    <P>The only alternative then would be to view the island from the lake shore, the water's edge.  Viewed from there the vista is entirely different, not nearly as inspirational or impressive as at present.  It would still be beautiful but would not be in the same category as from the present viewing point.  The planting would also obliterate the uninterrupted views of the lake, of Ben Bulben in the background, of Trewane Bay, Killerry and Kee-logyboy. Such an eventuality would be a tragedy, a disaster.</P>
    <P>Since the local people were alerted as to what was about to happen and the Sligo community as such became conscious of the proposed plans, there have been all sorts of soothing words uttered to the effect that due account would be taken of the amenity aspect of the area.  We were told, for example, that more broad-leaf trees would be planted, that the proposed landscaping would ensure that the island could still be viewed with the mountains in the background.  With all due respect to the people who say these things, I think this is the usual line we get on such occasions to soothe sensitivities of one kind or another.  The only answer on this occasion is that no trees should be planted in this open space.  I say this as a person who has been a great enthusiast of planting and who has advocated all my life the planting of more trees.</P>
    <P>I have seen the enhanced beauty that these trees give in many places, for example, in the Slieve Bloom area of the Minister's county and in the Ox Mountains. In the north Sligo mountains trees have been planted in many areas and in most cases they enhance the beauty of a spot rather than otherwise.  Unfortunately on this occasion they would eliminate <Col N="1885" /> an open space which is part and parcel of the beauty of this area and which gives access to the viewing of the lake which is part of our literary history and heritage.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's power in relation to this matter is rather limited and while the new Forestry Bill provides that all developments would be in sympathy with the environment, unfortunately I do not see included in it any kind of arbitration machinery as to which body would make the decision whether a plantation was in sympathy with the environment.  Perhaps the Minister in the further progress of the Bill might consider including some such machinery in view of the difficulties that have now arisen in the Sligo area.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is particularly sensitive to ensure that planting does not interfere with existing amenities and that it is in total sympathy with the environment. I also know the quality of the staff he has in the Sligo office.  During recent years they have been responsible for an enormous number of plantations which they have done extremely well and with the minimum of difficulty.  As we know the entire Sligo area is becoming a centre for forestry and is, along with Counties Leitrim and Mayo, the heart-land of the development of forestry.  I know the Minister will take due account of what the Sligo planning authority have to say in this matter and that he will, in the ordinary course of events, consult with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister to exercise the most powerful weapon he has at his disposal, and one which has fortunately not been exhausted in this case, and withhold the grant aid that is being sought for this plantation.  This would be a powerful economic weapon.  It is at the Minister's disposal and it would discourage any further ideas of planting this particular open space.  I believe that would be the most powerful weapon the Minister could use.</P>
    <P>Not even the most beautiful trees which could be planted could possibly be in sympathy with the environment in this area.  There is only one answer in this case and that is that the area should be left precisely as it was when Yeats was there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank <Col N="1886" /> the Minister for giving me some of his time.  I support what Deputy Nealon has said and I thank him for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  This is a very important question because this is a high amenity area.  It has been designated by Sligo County Council as an amenity area and I believe that if forestry is planted there it will spoil the beauty of the Isle of Innisfree.  We all know that W. B. Yeats composed the following poem:</P>
      <P>I will arise and go now, and go to Inisfree,</P>
      <P>And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:</P>
      <P>Nine bean-rows I will have there, a hive for the honey-bee, And live alone in the bee-loud glade, And I shall have some peace there...</P>
      <P>There is peace in the Isle of Innisfree and I ask the Minister not to grant aid this project to plant trees there.  If grant aid has not already been approved the Minister should not grant it.  I believe this land is owned by a German and while we are not against Germans &mdash; there are many fine Germans living in Ireland, in particular, in the County Sligo area &mdash; we are against the planting of trees in this area.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies I have been contacted by people from Killerry and Ballintoger who are totally against the planting of trees in the Isle of Innisfree. As Deputy Nealon said, it is a high amenity area which overlooks the beautiful lake of Lough Gill.  The Minister who is with us at present has responsibility for forestry and I should like to congratulate him on the excellent job he is doing. I heard him interviewed on the radio yesterday about the importation of ash from Wales which is used to make hurleys for our national game.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The forest service <Col N="1887" /> has been to the forefront in the improvement and provision of new amenity facilities in many parts of the country.  The creation of parks and picnic sites and the enhancement of our environment has been synonymous with forestry practices for a long time.  Even though we have now embarked on a much more ambitious and expanded afforestation programme, both public and private, the utmost care is being taken, and that will continue to be the case, so that the development of this resource will not be in conflict with the proper management of our environment.</P>
      <P>We have established constant liaison with the Office of Public Works to ensure that areas of scientific, cultural, historical and high amenity value are not afforested. There is a vast bank of suitable land for afforestation throughout the country without infringing on these critical areas.  There are perhaps two extreme positions one can take up: one where the planter totally ignores the landscape and the environmental value and the other where the public at large do not appreciate, as Deputy Nealon said, that the proper blending of species, and particularly the use of deciduous plants, can and has enhanced many areas throughout the country.  Obviously we are very interested in promoting that aspect.</P>
      <P>In our scheme for private grants we have included a regulation whereby an applicant carrying out the work must take all reasonable steps to avoid any adverse effects on the environment.  The Minister reserves the right to refuse grant aid where the Department consider that the work will be detrimental to the environment. Where there is the slightest doubt in regard to this matter our staff are instructed to contact the local authorities and the Office of Public Works so that a more proper adjudication can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance a request was made to our local management in Sligo by Woodland Investments Limited for an inspection by the forest service.  That is the normal practice in responding to an application for a private forestry grant.  No <Col N="1888" /> approval has issued.  In fact, our inspectors expect to have discussions with Sligo County Council and at present they await a preliminary reply in writing from the county council so that the appropriate response can be made in this way. Despite the fact that no indication was given to the applicant that he would qualify &mdash; in fact, an indication may have been given that he would not qualify &mdash; for a grant, fencing has commenced.</P>
    <P>This land was offered to the forestry service some years ago, and for obvious reasons &mdash; I do not want to prejudice the application beyond that &mdash; the forestry service were not interested in planting that land.  At present we are awaiting a reply from Sligo County Council and in the meantime I will take whatever steps are available to me to ensure that any work in relation to planting does not proceed. I am not too sure as to my powers with regard to fencing.  It is a separate matter and perhaps a matter which would not ultimately injure the environment.  I take it that the question that both Deputies are interested in is the planting on that site, so we must await the deliberations of Sligo County Council.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that not only in this case but right across the country we are concerned to continue on a major afforestation programme, to have the greatest sensitivity possible and to establish beyond doubt the best possible liaison with local authorities and with the Office of Public Works to ensure that our environment is not damaged by that development. I am conscious particularly of the site to which Deputy Nealon has referred and I am conscious of its historical and amenity value.  I assure the House that the present position is that no grant has been approved.  Any application for approval will get serious consideration.  I have already indicated to the House how I will view an application of that kind in Sligo, or in any other part of the country, where I am satisfied that the development would infringe on and damage the natural environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 18 and 181 together.  Information in the form requested is not available. However, I would refer the Deputies to the <i>Review of Water Pollution in Ireland,</i> prepared in 1983 by An Foras Forbartha for the Water Pollution Advisory Council, and which contains a schedule of the domestic waste loads discharged to rivers and seas.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for individual local authorities, in the first instance, to ensure that discharges of wastes and sewage effluent do not cause pollution and that appropriate steps are taken to remedy any defects in treatment and disposal systems. I have asked local authorities to identify those rivers and lakes that are affected by such pollution and to formulate proposals to deal with them.  In addition, I have also asked local authorities to examine their existing sewage disposal systems and to ensure that they are operating effectively and are meeting design standards.  I intend also that investment in the provision of new and improved sewage treatment facilities should be maintained at a high level.</P>

In this respect, I would refer the Deputy to my detailed statement in reply to his question of 3 February 1988 in which I listed the hazardous waste disposal outlets disclosed by a 1985 survey and explained the extensive statutory powers available to local authorities to control all aspects of hazardous waste disposal.  These powers include a permit system for the storage, treatment or deposit of toxic and dangerous wastes.</P>

      <P>In 1984, Kerry County Council submitted proposals to my Department for the improvement of the ListowelBallybunion Road, including the provision of footpaths, in the vicinity of Dirha cottages.  In February 1985, the Department informed the local authority that special road grant assistance was not being provided to meet the cost of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the road in question is a non-national main road, the cost of any improvement works would, in accordance with normal practice, fall to be <Col N="1655" /> financed by the local authority concerned from its own resources.  The local authority may also, at its discretion, use the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department to supplement any expenditure from their own resources on such roads.</P>

      <P>The present position, unchanged since 1963, is that State authorities are not subject to normal planning procedures but only to a limited consultation with the planning authority.

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the newspaper report in question.  The suggestion in a media report that Dublin inner city road plans will cost £32 million per mile is grossly exaggerated.  Actual costs of even the more expensive short sections of road have been substantially less than this rate.  I do not accept the underlying assumption that the costs associated with a relatively short stretch of road in the very heart of the city would apply to other sections of the inner tangent route.</P>

      <P>The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which was agreed in September, 1987, will limit the use of certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) internationally by stabilizing their consumption from 1989 and reducing this by 20 per cent from 1993, and by a further 30 per cent from 1998, all relative to 1986.  This will have the effect of reducing the amount of CFCs available for use in foam-packaging or in aerosols. Alternatives are already being developed by the international chemical companies and I expect this trend to accelerate.</P>

      <P>The following is the up-to-date position in respect of statistics on the grain and feed trade:</P>
      <P> 1.  External Trade &mdash; Data on the relevant commodities are released each month in the &ldquo;Trade Statistics&rdquo; publication. These statistics are classified according to the United National Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 3, but are also available at the level of detail of the Customs and Excise Tariff classification on request.</P>
      <P>2.  Crop Areas &mdash; Details of the area under various crops are collected each June.  Provisional data for 1987 were released in September 1987 followed by the issue of a detailed regional analysis in January 1988.</P>
      <P>3.  Crop Yields and Produce &mdash; Estimates of the yields and produce of various crops are published annually in the June Statistical Bulletin.  Results for 1987 were included in the recently released June 1988 Bulletin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Crop Output and Supply/Utilisation Balances of grains, etc. &mdash; Preliminary <Col N="1671" /> estimates for 1987 of quantity and value information on the output of various crops were published in February 1988. Final data should be available during July. </P>
    <P>The supply/utilisation balance for grains etc. are currently being revised back to 1973 following on the new series of output, input and income estimates.</P>
    <P>Under the old series estimates have been supplied up to 1981-82.</P>
    <P>The revision work requires a considerable staff input.  Whilst every effort is being made to complete this work, it is not yet possible to give a definite date for the release of the new series.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the risk that the funding of the Chair of Irish Studies at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, may be withdrawn.  I understand that this risk arises because of financial cutbacks at the Univeristy leading to the supression of a number of posts.</P>
      <P>The availability of Irish studies courses in Britain is important in helping to enhance understanding between our two countries.  The loss of the Chair of Irish at Aberystwyth would undoubtedly be a serious setback to plans for promoting Irish studies at university level in Britain. Our concern in the matter is being conveyed to the appropriate authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.  My Department keep in close contact with the international and other relief agencies in Mozambique and Angola and are fully aware of the very difficult conditions in these countries.  I am pleased to note that the recent United Nations pledging conference for Mozambique held on 26/27 April, 1988 raised $286.15 million in pledges for that country.  A United Nations donor conference in May raised $75.38 million in pledges for Angola.</P>
      <P>To date this year the European Community have allocated in addition to regular project aid under the Lomé Convention, 20.56 MECU in food aid plus 3 MECU in emergency aid to Mozambique, and 7.64 MECU in food aid to Angola.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In present budgetary circumstances it is not possible for my Department to allocate funds to assist relief programmes for these countries.  However, the situation in these, as in other countries with <Col N="1674" /> severe food supply difficulties and displacement of people is being kept under review including consideration of whether there is any way in which assistance could be provided.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for the year 1987/88 the taxpayer and her husband were taxed on the aggregation basis in accordance with the provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Under this system the husband is assessed in respect of the combined incomes of himself and his wife.  Accordingly, any further entitlement to a refund for 1987/88 falls to be determined by way of a review of the joint liability of both spouses for that year.  The inspector of taxes will now write to the taxpayer for the information necessary to carry out this review.</P>

      <P>The estimated seal population nationally is 3,000 of which approximately 1,900 are located in the west of Ireland.  The last full seal survey was carried out in 1983 and some monitoring has been done at selected sites annually.  The method of counting the seal population is threefold: (a) by aerial observation of seals and pups on land; (b) by observation from the sea of seals and pups on land; and (c) by on site counting of seals and pups at all sites.</P>
      <P>As only breeding females and pups can be counted by the above methods, the final estimate of population is reached by adding to the above numbers, a percentage to cover males, non-breeding females and juveniles.  The percentage added varies between 200 per cent and 750 per cent depending on the site.</P>

      <P>Enlisted personnel in the Defence Forces are insured under class H which provides cover for unemployment benefit.  Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to a person having 39 paid contributions since entry into insurable employment and at least 39 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate class in the relevant governing contribution year.  In addition a claimant must satisfy the statutory conditions of being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work and has not been disqualified under the Social Welfare Acts on the grounds of leaving employment voluntarily without just cause or losing employment through misconduct.</P>
      <P>The weekly flat rate unemployment benefit payable to a man claiming an increase in respect of his wife and two dependent children under 18 years, is £90.20.  This rate will increase to £93.00 from 21 July 1988 in accordance with the provisions of the 1988 budget.  The above rates are based on having at least 48 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>

      <P>I have not abolished any commission, committee or State-sponsored body during my term of office.</P>
      <P>I have set up one such group as follows:</P>
      <P>The Aquaculture Management Committee</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee comprises representatives of the Department of the <Col N="1707" /> Marine, Roinn na Gaeltachta, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta. Its terms of reference are:</P>
    <P>To review on a regular basis the status of aquaculture development in relation to the objectives of the Government; to co-ordinate State funding for aquaculture projects in order to maximise employment and output; to consider the means necessary to secure adequate EEC funding for aquaculture and to review the provision of grant-aid for the aquaculture industry and to advise the Minister for the Marine and the Gaeltacht of any restructuring which is considered necessary. </P>
    <P>I propose to set up a further four groups as follows:</P>
    <P> 1.  The Marine Institute</P>
    <P>The aim in establishing the institute is to bring together, under one statutory authority, all the resources of the State which are currently allocated to marine research, and to co-ordinate the activities of agencies involved in marine research.</P>
    <P>2.  The Aquaculture Advisory Committee</P>
    <P>This committee is intended, when established, to represent all facets of the aquaculture industry.  Its purpose will be to advise me on all aspects of aquaculture development in addition to formalising and rendering more efficient present consultation procedures in the industry.</P>
    <P>3.  The Shipping Advisory Committee</P>
    <P>The functions of this committee are to advise me on developing the Irish shipping industry including the cost effectiveness of re-establishing a deep-sea fleet.</P>
    <P>4.  Dún Laoghaire Planning Review Group </P>
    <P>This group will ensure that the long term as well as the short term options for the <Col N="1708" /> development of the harbour are examined and planned.</P>

I am not in a position as yet to indicate what facilities will be provided under the scheme or where they will be located.

      <P>The World Health Organisation have been compiling global statistics on cases of AIDS since 1986, on the basis of notifications by member states.  The number of cases of AIDS notified to WHO, in respect of each member state, up to 21 March, 1988 &mdash; the latest date for which figures are available &mdash; is set out in the following Table.</P>
      <P>The disease was identified for the first time in the USA in 1981.  The virus was first isolated in 1983.  The first attempt at formal notification by Member States of WHO, based on a clinical definition of AIDS, was introduced in 1984.  A HIV antibody test became available in early 1985 from which serological testing and monitoring of the virus was introduced. Retrospective data, therefore, other than that in respect of the USA and Western European countries, would be of doubtful value prior to 1984.  WHO have, however, been attempting to develop a global picture of AIDS, retrospectively, since 1984 and this shows that, for the year 1980, the total number of AIDS cases notified for that year was 70.</P>
      <P>These 70 cases were notified in respect of the following countries:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192, 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>The required information relating to infant mortality, mortality rates from cancer and circulatory disease, and to the number of doctors per 1,000 population is given in the following table.  Figures in brackets indicate the most recent year for which data is available.  In relation to cancer, circulatory disease, and total mortality the figures given are age standardised death rates per 100,000 population based on a standard European population.  To maintain comparability with the other OECD countries these rates for Ireland have not been updated.</P>

      <P>The Health Education Bureau was abolished with effect from 31 December 1987. The function of the bureau related primarily to the dissemination of information and development of education related to health.  No other bodies under the aegis of my Department have been abolished in the period March 1987 to date.</P>
      <P>I have established a number of new structures since taking up office as follows:</P>
      <P> 1.  Commission on Health Funding</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the Commission are to examine the financing of the health services and to make recommendations on the extent and source of the future funding required to provide an equitable comprehensive and cost effective public health service and on any <Col N="1733" /> changes in administration which seem desirable for that purpose.</P>
    <P>2.  Health Promotion</P>
    <P>The new structure for health promotion introduced in January 1988 operates at three levels namely: a health promotion unit within the Department of Health which apart from the development of health education is also responsible for the development of a wider policy of health promotion; an advisory council on health promotion set up to &ldquo;examine those public policies which impact on health and where desirable, to make recommendations for the re-orientation of these policies with a view to promoting the health of the Community&rdquo;; and a Committee of Ministers, chaired by the Minister for Health and including the Ministers for Agriculture, Education, Energy, the Environment and Labour, reflecting the need for an inter-sectoral approach to health problems and the collective commitment of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>3.  Drug Treatment Centre Board</P>
    <P>A body has been established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, to organise and administer an out-patient drug treatment service replacing the service previously in place at Jervis Street Hospital.  </P>

      <P>Patients with Addison's Disease who are covered by medical cards receive all their prescribed drugs and general practitioner services entirely free of charge.  Significant ongoing medical expenses on drug purchases and professional fees are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.  In the case of a family, a medical card can be issued to one member of the family only, where appropriate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> Persons whose income precludes such eligibility can avail of the benefits of the drugs refund scheme.

      <P>At present some 40 per cent of asthma patients would be covered by medical cards and, therefore, receive all their prescribed drugs and general practitioner services entirely free of charge.  Significant ongoing medical expenses (including of course expenditure incurred on the purchase of prescription medicines and on professional fees) are amongst the factors reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.

      <P>No, I have not.  The detailed apportionment of each health board's annual financial allocation is primarily a matter for that board and its management team. However, I understand that expenditure relating to these types of medical aid items has been maintained at the same level as in 1987, and there has been no reduction in the resources allocated by the health boards for these items.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the issue of a wheel-chair are based in all cases on the specific circumstances of the individual concerned. Each case is assessed on it's merits by the health board's professional staff and a decision on whether to allocate a wheelchair is based on their professional assessment.</P>

      <P>The number of superintendents from western counties has always exceeded the number of centres in those counties and surplus superintendents from those counties have traditionally been assigned to centres in other counties.  The new arrangements made this year have meant that some of the surplus superintendents from the western counties have had to be assigned farther than usual from their homes.</P>

    <P>Applications for assistance from the special fund of £4 million for disadvantaged youth, established in this Department from the proceeds of the national lottery were considered by an Inter-Departmental Committee on Disadvantaged <Col N="1751" /> Youth.  This committee was required to draw up a programme of support for disadvantaged young people on the basis of need.  Priority was given to projects which heretofore had received no support or to new services provided by existing grant assisted bodies, particularly in the following areas: young homeless, substance abuse, and special youth work services.  The committee was also concerned to ensure that a viable level of grant would be provided for projects and that a balance would be achieved among the general areas to be supported.</P>
    <P>The balance of some £237,000 has been set aside for the support of further services for disadvantaged youth mainly for young homeless and substance abusers.</P>
