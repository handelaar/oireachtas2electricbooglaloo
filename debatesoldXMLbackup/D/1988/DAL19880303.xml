      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am seeking your advice and assistance. Yesterday I tabled a question to the Taoiseach for oral reply and it was transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce; I accepted that.  I then received a reply to an oral question I had submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce which sought to elicit the number of leather footwear and sheepskin and bovine hides imported into and exported from the Republic of Ireland for the year ended 31 December 1984 and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The Minister's reply was that the statistics requested by the Deputy are published by the Central Statistics Office and are obtainable from the Trade Statistics of Ireland series.  I regard that as a disgraceful reply from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to help the Deputy to elicit information of this kind.  He must know that.  My office will be as helpful as possible to him.  But I want to make it clear to the House again that the Chair has no function whatsoever in respect of the transfer of questions from one Minister to another, never had and, I hope, never will have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

Failing that, will he say if he will take questions next week on this subject and not transfer them to the Minister for Education? Can I have an answer from the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution of £9,660,000 by the Irish Government to the Eighth Replenishment of the Resources of the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association, or IDA for short, is an affiliate of the World Bank; it was established in 1960 and membership is open to all members of the Bank.  With the World Bank, IDA is involved in providing finance to developing countries for projects that promote economic development. While the Bank lends to a wide range of developing countries on more or less commercial terms, IDA provides highly concessionary assistance and concentrates this assistance on the poorest of the developing countries.  The vast bulk of its lending goes to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income of less than $400.</P>
      <P>Financing specific investment projects has traditionally been, and continues to be, the mainstay of IDA's operations. The agricultural and rural sectors take the lion's share of investment finance, with projects ranging across a wide spectrum &mdash; from trying to tackle food scarcity and hunger emergencies to developing research and improving land management. Infrastructural, education and health projects also feature strongly in IDA's lending programmes.  While continuing to give priority to investment lending, IDA have, in recent years, also become deeply involved in lending in support of policy reform and economic adjustment and an increasing proportion of its resources are now devoted to sector and structural adjustment loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA's funding is provided primarily by grant contributions, or &ldquo;replenishments&rdquo;, from its richer member countries, known as Part I members.  The other members, the developing countries, are known as Part II members and a number of these also participate in the <Col N="1604" /> replenishments.  Between its establishment in 1960 and the end of its last financial year in June 1987, IDA had made almost 1,700 loans, totalling $44 billion.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined IDA in 1960 as a Part II member and became a Part I member in 1973.  Our membership was authorised by the International Development Association Act 1960 and our contributions to the various replenishments have each been authorised by amendments to that Act.  We made an initial subscription of $3 million on joining in 1960 and contributed $4 million to the third replenishment in 1971, although still a Part II member.  Since assuming Part I status in 1973, we have participated in all the replenishments and have contributed to two special facilities.  One was required in 1984 when the US decided to spread its contribution to IDA 6 over four years rather than the customary three; the other was set up in 1985 to provide special assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the eighth replenishment began in Paris in January 1986 and were concluded in Rome in December of the same year.  The resolution to increase IDA's resources based on the outcome of those negotiations was adopted by IDA's Board of Governors on 26 June 1987.  The provisions of the resolution will become effective as soon as donors, representing 80 per cent of the total replenishment resources, have notified IDA of their intention to participate. While waiting for member countries, like us, who have to process legislation before lodging the formal notification, IDA operates an advance contribution scheme based on notifications that have already been received.  This scheme is designed to avoid costly delays in project implementation, by ensuring that projects in the pipeline can continue to be negotiated and signed, during the period between the end of the previous replenishment and the date the new one becomes effective.</P>
    <P>At the IDA 8 negotiations, an attempt was first made to achieve the highest possible level of replenishment on the <Col N="1605" /> basis of traditional burden sharing arrangements, that is, with all donors maintaining the same <i>pro rata</i> share that they had in earlier replenishments.  The maximum figure on which agreement could be reached on this basis was $11.5 billion.  This level of replenishment disappointed many members and negotiations continued in an attempt to achieve a higher figure.  The final outcome was $12.4 billion, various member countries having agreed to make special additional contributions.  This compares with a total of $10.1 billion from the combined seventh replenishment and Special Facility for sub-Saharan Africa and is significantly higher than earlier expectations had suggested.</P>
    <P>In the effort to reach this level of replenishment, members agreed to some hardening of IDA's loan terms with a view to permitting the faster recycling of much needed funds.  Thus, the duration of IDA loans has been reduced from 50 to 40 years for the poorer developing countries and to 35 years for the others. This will not affect existing loans.  Other terms are unchanged.  IDA loans are still interest free and have a grace period of ten years.  Overall, therefore, they continue to be extremely concessionary.</P>
    <P>Agreement was also reached on a variety of other issues.  Members agreed to continue using existing criteria, such as relative poverty and population size, for allocating IDA's resources but to give greater emphasis to economic performance in order to ensure the most effective use of IDA's funds.  Between 45 and 50 per cent of IDA 8 resources will be allocated to countries in sub-Saharan Africa because of the severity of the problems in those countries.  There was also agreement that the character of IDA as a lender primarily for investment purposes should continue, but that greater emphasis should be placed on fostering policy reforms and economic adjustment through sector loans and structural adjustment operations.  Approximately one quarter of the replenishment's resources will be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We have indicated to IDA that, subject to legislative approval, Ireland would be <Col N="1606" /> willing to contribute $13 million to the new replenishment.  This amount, which represents £9,660,000 in Irish pounds, maintains our <i>pro rata</i> share of 0.11 per cent in the fifth, sixth and seventh replenishments and enables us to make the additional contribution of $350,000, to which paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill refers, towards the efforts made to raise the replenishment level above the initial $11.5 billion. As in the case of previous replenishments, donor countries have the right initially to lodge non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes in lieu of cash payments.  We and most other donors normally avail of this right.  These notes will be deposited this year and next year.  Actual cash payments under the replenishment will be phased over the years 1988 to 1999.  The rate at which funds are called on by IDA will depend on the progress made in implementing the projects financed by the replenishment.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contributions to IDA are counted as part of our official development assistance programme.  IDA's emphasis on the needs of the poorest developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, reflects the priorities of our own bilateral IDA programme. These countries have virtually no access to private financial resources, making the need for assistance from IDA and other sources all the more urgent.  For these reasons we have traditionally been a strong supporter of IDA and this Bill, when enacted, will ensure our continued support.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that we should this morning be discussing this Bill in the aftermath of the most savage cuts of official development assistance by this country since the establishment of our official development assistance programme. Let me say straight away that the Bill itself does not cause me any problem, subject to a few minor points which can be raised in detail on Committee Stage, but it does provide the opportunity <Col N="1607" /> to raise my voice in protest against the attitude of the present Government to the whole question of official aid.</P>
      <P>The background is fairly clear.  At a time when the 1981 Coalition Government appointed the first Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation, I was appointed to that portfolio.  Subsequently, when the Government changed in 1982, a similar appointment was not made by the then Taoiseach.  When I raised the issue with him at that time, he indicated that he considered such an appointment as being superfluous and supernumerary.  However, during the height of the famine in Ethiopia and in Africa in 1984 and at a time when the popular voice of the people was raised in support of the aid effort and thousands of people were rallying to the flag raised by Bob Geldof and others, then we saw what was a change of heart on the part of the Taoiseach.  At the time, as Leader of the Opposition, he considered that having a Minister of State in charge of co-operation was not sufficient at all.  He actually proposed that the Office be elevated to that of Cabinet Minister.  That was an indication of how he reacted in the face of the popular opinion at the time, which was so supportive of the efforts of those to bring some aid and comfort to the hundreds and thousands of people who were starving in Africa.  Now, at the first test of the Taoiseach's resolution as to the extent of his support for development co-operation and the official aid effort, the aid budget has been decimated, in particular bilateral aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a total of about £32 million in the aid budget at present but a very large proportion of that is consequent on our membership of the European Community and of certain United Nations bodies.  A huge proportion of the discretionary element has been slashed.  The Taoiseach and the Government consider this a soft target and I want to raise my voice in protest as these cuts are the most cruel of all.  The people affected are not, largely, in this country, they are mainly <Col N="1608" /> on other continents.  They are the poorest of the poor, especially those on the African continent, and they are not able to raise their voices in protest.  The Government are taking the crusts out of the mouths of those starving people and condemning them to starvation, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.  This cannot be allowed to pass without making the strongest possible protest.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the area of aid have protested and the voluntary organisations, who are doing such marvellous work, have also raised their voices. However, their protests have been brushed aside.  What will happen when the majority of our people again raise their voices in protest?  It usually happens when there is a major catastrophe of global dimensions as in 1984 with the African famine.  I am advised in the latest report from Ethiopia that the famine on the scale of 1984-85 is likely to happen again over the next couple of months. According to the latest FAO estimates, as many as seven million people will be affected by the famine and the general report suggests that things will be as bad &mdash; and probably worse &mdash; than they were during 1984-85.</P>
    <P>How will we respond to such a crisis? We have virtually eliminated disaster relief which was built up under the last Government to around £500,000 but which now stands at a nominal figure of £1,000.  Furthermore, at the time of the last famine, we were able to make a credible case at European Community level for a substantial improvement in the response from the EC because of our own aid performance.  We made a major case for additional support to relieve famine in Africa, culminating in a decision of the Dublin European Council which followed a visit by me in my capacity as President of the European Development Council to Ethiopia and other African countries.  There was a huge response from the European Community to the crisis in Africa but our credibility is now destroyed because we have removed the wherewithal by which we could make any contribution.  In international terms, any effort on our part to respond to the <Col N="1609" /> developing crisis in Africa will be laughed at.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the issue unduly but it is very important.  In the last century, this country saw the effects of famine stalking the land.  This can never be forgotten in the context of how we deal with the misfortunes of other countries. Do we let people starve and die and selfishly point to our own relatively inconsequential problems as an explanation or excuse for so doing?  The Minister for Finance may smile a little wryly when I refer to our problems as relatively inconsequential.  I know the awful burden that rests on his shoulders and his efforts to grapple with them but in the context of the kind of problems afflicting the most seriously affected Third World countries, ours are as nothing.  Ethiopia has a <i>per capita</i> income of about $80 per annum, which is about 5 per cent of our <i>per capita</i> income.  They do not worry there about mortgage rates because they have no roofs over their heads.  Most of the people worry about trying to obtain food to survive.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we feel that there was shame on those in the 1840s who let people die in misery and squalor but at least many of them had the excuse that they did not know or appreciate what was going on at that time.  Double shame on the people who are fully aware of the extent of the problem of world hunger and have the wherewithal to contribute towards a solution but failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of how we measure the shame of a nation whose own people cried out for help in the sad days of the last century, a nation which has in recent years tried in some small way to give leadership to its own people and internationally but which now in the full knowledge of the awful facts of world hunger and famine literally grabs the crust out of the mouths of the starving? We must face the question and it is the type of issue that the House should not avoid.  I do not wish to present that statement in a political way.  I know there are Members of all parties who feel as strongly as we on this issue.  The only solution to this problem is to tackle it on <Col N="1610" /> a non-party basis.  The voices of those who feel strongly about this issue should be raised and, hopefully, welded together eventually on an all-party basis so that pressure can be brought to bear to get a consensus on this issue.  We should get all-party agreement on this so that the nation will in future not avoid or evade its responsibilities in relation to the developing world.  We should properly and fully fulfil our commitments to the developing world and only in that way will we have a medium to long term policy on development co-operation and assistance. Without that type of commitment any efforts to establish a policy for the future will be set at nought because of the lack of assurance in regard to funding and because of the major setback that has occurred in recent months as a result of the slashing of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not present a problem for us.  We have had similar Bills before the House when we were asked to replenish the fund.  I agree with the approach of the Government in principle and I am happy to welcome the Bill in that the emphasis of the International Development Association, the soft loan arm of the World Bank, is to concentrate on the poorest of the poor.  That is where the major emphasis of development assistance should be.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of such Bills being debated in the House there is usually not an enormous attendance in the Chamber.  I have referred to that on more than one occasion.  On the surface the Bill appears to be a technical piece of legislation.  It is indeed a formal Bill like similar pieces of legislation that have been debated here.  It simply enables us to make the contribution required at this time.  Nevertheless, it raises a number of fundamental issues. On previous occasions when welcoming similar Bills I have raised a number of questions and I should like to raise them <Col N="1611" /> again.  I should like to assure the Minister that I am not opposing the Bill but a number of issues of fact could be easily hidden by the Bill and by the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the Irish contribution, with the other contributions that will be made, is in part a replenishment of the shortfall in the contribution of the United States.  Is it not true to say that both super powers at a time when they are increasing their expenditure on armaments &mdash; thankfully they have moved to the point of holding discussions on disarmament &mdash; have, since the early seventies, put a ceiling on their contributions in the area of development aid?  Will the Minister say if, since the end of the seventies, the contribution of the super powers towards the development area have fallen?  Will the Minister accept that the total fund available for development purposes has fallen?</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the least developed countries, the LDCs as they have been referred to in the technology language of development study literature.  When Tim Bergin was writing about this at the beginning of the seventies he said that we should be clear about whom we are speaking, that we were speaking about people who live on 30 cents a day or less, if one could call that living.  He also said that we were addressing countries where, in their populations, perhaps 40,000 children, if one aggregated the total child death in such countries, die every day. We are talking about countries for whom the resources necessary to produce one jet fighter would provide all the basic aids in clean water, shelter, food and education to the end of the century. There is an inextricable link between armament production and development. The resources deflected to armaments production deprive such countries of development aid.  That is not what is before us this morning but development issues are inextricably linked with issues of armaments production not least because the principal customers at the armaments production shows in the western world are Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> We are producing armaments that put the planet in danger, exporting instruments of death in the form of armaments to the Third World, and, at the same time, freezing our development aid and then allowing it to fall.  It is a long time since Willy Brandt referred to this dilemma and made an appeal to the world community from a group that included people who could hardly be described as radicals, people such as Ted Heath even though he may be perceived as wet by herself.  The fact is that the appeal was to self interest but even appeals to self interest failed.  The idea of having an impoverished south which would create a south of poor customers and so on did not budge anybody.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very specific issues which I would like the Minister to address in his reply.  What was the extent of the contribution of the United States and the USSR over the last several terms of replenishment?  What is the gap and to what extent had the other countries to come forward to fill the gap left by the super powers?  Lest we get carried away into some heady fit of self congratulation we must remember that what is required in the Bill is mandatory on us; it is not the decision of the Government of the day but represents a commitment we gave several years ago.  That commitment was in two parts, our original decision to be bound and the second decision to move from the second part to the first section of the International Development Association itself.</P>
    <P>My second question arises from the politicisation of the IDA.  The consequences of the politicisation of the IDA have been to establish principles of selectivity in selecting poorer countries and in approving projects.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Minister's speech to sub-Saharan Africa.  The people who worked in the section of the IDA dealing with the World Bank and other institutions decided on projects in terms of their development impact.  It is attested by those who worked in this section, when interviewed on worldwide television, that one of the most sordid developments of the 1980s has been the <Col N="1613" /> politicisation of the international financial structures.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech contains a reflection of the politicisation of which I speak.  It is contained in the change in terms and conditions.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>There was also agreement that the character of IDA as a lender primarily for investment purposes should continue, but that greater emphasis should be placed on fostering policy reforms and economic adjustment through sector loans and structural adjustment operations.</P>
    <P>Translated into the language of those in the field in Africa, that means that where the market economy and private enterprise are allowed to prosper, as for example in the Kenyan development area, there would be one acceptable context. I am merely using Kenya as an example.  In neighbouring Tanzania where people are pursuing the villagisation scheme of Julius Nyrere, that kind of development would be looked upon with less favour.  Hidden in that remark and in the thinking at Paris there is a non-acceptance of the rights of those countries among the LDCs who have pursued indigenous forms of development. They are being told they will have to meet new conditions and that the closer they come to meeting the conditions of the marketplace the more likely they will be to get aid.  That message was addressed to the &ldquo;37 cents a day&rdquo; population.  It was that thinking which was behind first the threat and then the reality of the reduced contribution from the United States.  We had to rush in to help fill the gap.</P>
    <P>It may be asked whether my comments are ideological.  That is a trash comment. I use my words carefully.  What we are speaking about are conditions being put into the structure and flow of aid to the least developed countries when their very poverty should justify the assistance in itself.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Minister's speech to the Paris talks.  Am I correct in interpreting the Paris talks as beginning <Col N="1614" /> with the reality of the American contribution and that the decision on that contribution affected every other discussion after the talks?  This is a question the Minister simply must answer.  My second question relates to the interpretation of the conditions.  Are they not an attempt to impose western market thinking as a condition for class II participants in the IDA?</P>
    <P>We are not here debating the whole issue of development aid, but I hope we will have an opportunity of addressing these issues on some other occasion.  I am the temporary chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on development aid.  The reality is that the Joint Committee on Development Co-operation has been abolished.  It was a committee to which every single development agency in Ireland, as well as many international agencies and a number of international experts, gave evidence.  It made contributions and published reports.  It looked at the conditions of returned development workers and at the conditions and structures of charitable gatherings and so forth.  The committee no longer exists.  I hope it will be good news to the Minister that we do not see it as our role to attack any party's policy.  We represent the fact that there is in all parts of this House an anxiety that this forum should continue, even if only on an ad hoc basis.  I hope we can go out of existence when the Taoiseach allows the Joint Committee on Development Co-operation to be established formally.  We will go out of business on the day he makes that decision.  If he does not make it, we will continue staffing the committee from our own resources so that there will be a forum to which those interested in development may come.</P>
    <P>When I look at the level of funding and think of the reports I have read on the Paris talks, I have to put matters in some context.  The electorate will ask how much our contribution enables us to help. There are three principal strangleholds of a non-military kind on the least developed countries.  The first of these concerns debt, a problem which has not <Col N="1615" /> been resolved by the international community, particularly by the lending countries. There are also issues of trade which have not been significantly improved. The relationship between energy imports and the primary commodity prices paid to the producing countries has not changed in their favour.  Some of the LDCs have no exports.  The third question is the extent to which the aid we are supposedly offering is tied aid.</P>
    <P>The IDA is reaching a crisis point but it cannot be seen to go out of existence. It must be seen to be doing something. It is in danger, however, of assuming a cosmetic status if politicisation continues, if the imposition of conditions on their loans continues and if, in addition, the overall contextual environment of trade and aid and militarisation continues to work against the LDCs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be academic about these matters.  The Irish citizen contributes heavily by comparison with citizens of other European countries.  The question the citizen asks is to what extent his or her contribution is helping.  On the debt question alone, we have had a series of individual reschedulings motivated as much by the consequences for the internal banking systems of the lending countries as by anything else.  We have seen no shift in relation to the debt itself. Debt is not a fiscal matter only.  It is the historical legacy of trade and other relationships which has accrued.  There is, therefore, a moral obligation on the developed world &mdash; if there is such a thing as international morality &mdash; to change the debt relationship in a way that is beyond rescheduling or the simple shifting of interest payments.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here mostly with sub-Saharan Africa.  Let us consider for a moment the Latin world.  We are asking the people of Brazil to pay 60 per cent of their gross domestic product to stay in the same place, even in relation to the interest payments on their debt.  The Mexican Government had to face the question of whether they would allow more than half their total product to be spent on servicing debt.  Is the problem <Col N="1616" /> therefore, the lack of developed capacity to meet interest payments?  It must not be seen in that way but rather in a wider structure.  There is no evidence, I am afraid, of such thinking.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister for Finance is present in the House and that it is always he who handles this legislation rather than the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Minister of State.  The second point I wish to make is that you have to place IDA lending in the context of the commercial banking world lending to the countries involved.  Here is my assertion and I would be glad to be proved wrong.  Is it not a fact that total commercial bank lending to the countries which will be receiving this has practically dried up, has almost totally ceased? Given that situation and with IDA money coming with increased conditions the countries involved, the least developed countries, are more and more dependent on aid.</P>
    <P>We must now move to the question of the character of that aid.  Greater reliance on aid in terms of the internal dynamics of a suffering country with very little export crops and such export crops as they have being used to pay different kinds of interest on debt has meant an increasing struggle for existence particularly by women in Third World countries who are not in that export producing sector, however tiny it may be.  Not only have we seen a decline in the super power contribution and a greater reliance on aid but also the conditions on aid are surfacing in relation to the IDA and we are now further removed from these realities.</P>
    <P>I am able to speak about a comparison with the Tanzanian and Kenyan experience because I was a member of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  I visited those countries with other Deputies including the former Deputy Nora Owen and the former Minister of State who is present in the House.  We now have no embassy in Nairobi and if you are interested in the Sudan there is no office you could go to in Khartoum even though we developed and prepared an office there and were <Col N="1617" /> ready to run it.  Therefore, we are looking at all of these problems at a distance and it behoves us to be more vigilant than ever.</P>
    <P>I remark once again on this empty Chamber when discussing an issue of such great and urgent moral importance, an issue which challenges our very humanity and challenges us to take a stand on whether we as a small Chamber in a small island country, representing a very small proportion of the world's population, are here to cast quasi-amateur eyes on the international banking system or are here to reflect the moral concern and interdependence of the world's population where so many people needlessly die but where, if every child was pre-vaccinated before the end of this century, so many would live and where 75 per cent of the world's population who have access to 17 per cent of the world's exportable resources are represented by the four Deputies who are now in this Chamber of 166.  This makes us ask questions as to where our morality of politics lies and so forth.  I must say on behalf of my party that we are not opposing this Bill.  I am simply placing it in the context of the development thinking that exists within the Labour Party to which I have been contributing for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I am raising very specific questions for the Minister.  I just want to raise a few small points now with him in connection with his own speech.  He mentioned, and this relates to one of my other questions, that while the bank lends to a wide range of developing countries more or less commercial terms &mdash; here is the paradox &mdash; the IDA provides highly concessionary assistance and concentrates this assistance on the poorest of the developing countries.  The thinking of the IDA was always seen as qualitatively different to the thinking of the general lending strategy of the World Bank.  I have stated that that core thinking has changed IDA thinking and the conditions of international aid qualitatively.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that while continuing to give priority to investment lending the IDA has in recent years also <Col N="1618" /> become deeply involved in lending in support of policy reform and economic adjustment and an increasing proportion of its resources are now devoted to sector and structural adjustment loans.  That is my evidence on the ground in relation to the change in the sovereignty of the recipient countries in terms of choosing economic development strategies.  I deal with realities and with the people who are without the wells and so forth.  The reality is what I have seen in the attitude of the international institutions to the countries of Tanzania and Kenya.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt also with the question of replenishments.  Let us hear how the gaps arose.  Let me say in this regard that our assistance in this Bill is mandatory. On another day we will debate the most shameful, disgraceful and immoral cut of all, the cut in development aid assistance in the Estimates.  It was scandalous and it was not done with the political will of the people.  It was done against the expressed will of the people because in every survey they have said that even if economic conditions were bad at home they still wanted to give to the countries which were least developed, the countries in greatest need.  There was no political mandate for such an act and I say that the real reason it happened was because the development section of the Department of Foreign Affairs had such low clout with the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance never got as far as incorporating in their thinking the thinking of the development section of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am inclined, as my former colleague Conor Cruise O'Brien used to say, to the benign model.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the occasions when special replenishments and sums were necessary in addition to the conventional or usual replenishments.  Perhaps the Minister will say what were the circumstances.  I think I know them.  I have already given them to the House. The circumstances were when some of the major donors did not meet their contributions. The Minister made specific reference to the Paris negotiations.  We do not have in this House an Oireachtas <Col N="1619" /> committee on foreign affairs, something about which I have questioned the Taoiseach ceaselessly for several weeks and months.  Therefore I have no opportunity, except on occasions such as this, to ask what was the character of the discussions which took place in Paris about this issue; as to what was the position taken by category 2 countries <i>versus</i> category 1 countries, as to what was the discussion on the question of the United States' contribution and as to what was the debate within category 2. The Minister says that he is pleased, and I agree with him, that we will move from £11.5 billion to £12.4 billion.  Yet, in proportionate terms that is very far short of what the recipient countries were asking. From sources within the recipient countries who are in contact with me I know they submitted position papers in relation to conditions that might or might not be attached to loans.  On page 3, paragraph 3 of his speech the Minister says:</P>
    <P>In the effort to reach this level of replenishment, members agreed to some hardening of IDA's loan terms with a view to permitting the faster recycling of much-needed funds.</P>
    <P>Is this not saying that what was involved in that debate was that the more there was market thinking in the recipient countries the quicker one was likely to see the money back and it could be lent out again?  It was taking the very basic needs, thinking of the least developed countries, which is reflected in the women in their villages more than in the men &mdash; because 90 per cent of the women are involved in basic needs productions and the males are overwhelmingly more involved in producing that tiny section of the export crops &mdash; and turning the thinking behind international assistance to the least developed countries into the same kind of thinking as one would have operating in a commercial bank lending to a speculative investor.  That is the drift of the argument and I want to hear more about it if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in relation to a variety of other issues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> Agreement was also reached on a variety of other issues.  Members agreed to continue using existing criteria, such as relative poverty and population size, for allocating IDA's resources but to give greater emphasis to economic performance in order to ensure the most effective use of IDA's funds.</P>
    <P>Is that not the same thing again?  It is the politicisation of these least developed countries through the imposition of economic market model thinking.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to sub-Saharan Africa.  I totally agree with the Minister and I am grateful to him for putting this in.  Within the general category of least developed countries the specific problems of sub-Saharan Africa are very severe.  One of the problems is that by the year 2,000 it might be impossible for some of these countries to be populated at all because of changing physical and climatic conditions.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>There was also agreement that the character of IDA as a lender primarily for investment purposes should continue, but that greater emphasis should be placed on fostering policy reforms and economic adjustment through sector loans and structural adjustment operations.</P>
    <P>This fills me with pessimism that I was right about what was the drift of the IDA within the World Bank.  The Minister may like to explain the implications of the right which donor countries have.  We have been a donor country since 1973. Donor countries have the right to lodge non-negotiable non-interest-bearing demand notes in lieu of cash payments. While that facilitates the donors it places short term difficulties in relation to hard currency on the recipient countries. They are under the stranglehold of debt and interest payments which require hard currency but at the same time the aid which is coming in, however twisted or conditional a form, is something to which they do not have access in relation to meeting their needs.  Given the totality <Col N="1621" /> of their relationships to the outer world, this is an advantage for the lending country but a disadvantage for the recipient country.  This is very much true in relation to the time period involved.  The Minister in his speech says:</P>
    <P>Actual cash payments under the replenishment will be phased over the years 1988 to 1999.</P>
    <P>Compare that period of time with the debt negotiating period of time on offer to these least developed countries.</P>
    <P>I have raised a number of issues.  It is not my intention to make tedious or repetitive arguments but I am very conscious of how few occasions we have to address these issues that affect the least developed countries and their relationship to the developed world.  The reason I have said so much about the financial aspects is that the Minister for Finance is here.  We are in an atmosphere in the international financial discussions in which these differences are not surfacing at all, and if they are they are highly residual to other notions.  For example, it is a curiousity that our neighbouring island, led now by this paragon of conservatism is going to run up £1.5 billion of a deficit and the US is running an enormous trade deficit, playing beggar my neighbour, between themselves and the other economies, with the reluctant Japanese economy and the West German economy occasionally emitting rumbles and saying that they refuse to take the cards that have been dealt to them and so forth.  It is under this sordid shadow that this regularly goes on.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves of the figures. About 40,000 children are needlessly dying every day and women are having one child after another hoping that a male child will live so as to become a migrant worker and bring home his earnings to the village.  We are talking about a situation where water, sanitation or housing is not available.  We are not talking about a remote depopulated place.  We are talking about the part of the planet where 75 per cent of the world live in poverty to which we the west and the north are exporting death.  We are <Col N="1622" /> exporting death to them through armaments. They have access to less than one-fifth of the world resources.  In the other part of the world 25 per cent of the world's population compete in a race of death and at the same time live in economies structured on the principles of capitalism and debt that have impoverished the other part of the world.  What we as a small country must do is not only to consider the reality of our small contribution which we repeat from time to time but to ask ourselves questions as to the framework of principles within which we make that contribution.  It is in that sense I have made this contribution.  I have asked a number of direct questions of the Minister which I hope he will find time to answer in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Higgins on his contribution to this debate.  The Deputy has set out quite a number of key issues which this country must address when considering our role in assisting the less developed countries of the world.  There is no doubt that the economic plight of the poorest countries and more particularly of the poorest people in the poorest countries is worsening. Commodity prices have declined while import bills have rocketed; indebtedness has increased, and terms of trade have worsened as protectionism rears its head in the developed economies where <i>per capita</i> food production does not increase while arms expenditure continues to spiral and the numbers caught in absolute poverty grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party do not subscribe to the facile analysis of this worsening situation and the underlying impoverishment of the developing countries, which says that the plight of these people arises from some fortuitous developments within the world economy since the Second World War.  On the contrary, just as these people suffered from the colonial policies of the old imperialist powers, the developing countries now continue to be victims of an exploitative international monetary and trade system <Col N="1623" /> shaped in the interests of monopoly capital. Indeed, the IMF is one of the instruments to ensure the continuing dominance of the developed economies and the trans-national corporations, particularly the US which has assumed the role of an international economic circus master since the 1945 era.</P>
    <P>Extending from this basic position, The Workers' Party treat with considerable scepticism so-called solutions to Third World impoverishment that rest on so-called mutual interests.  There is no doubt that between the populations of the world, north-south, there is a great deal of interdependence but that does not mean that the interests of both are mutual and that the interests particularly of the developed world automatically match the interests of the underdeveloped world. Despite the positive evangelical approach and the soundness of some of the proposals, the much vaunted Brandt report, for instance, falls into this category of assuming there are major mutual interests.  Its selling pitch to the developed countries rests on a theory of general Keynesianism that assumes that by stimulating demand in the developing countries through a redistribution of purchasing power, world economic recovery will be set in train.  However, the massive transfers called for, if carried through, would unquestionably be directed to the high earners in the south and not to the poor, ultimately being of no benefit to the poor.  Although some demand among high earners would be created, the real demand for food, housing, clothing and services among the poor would remain supressed and unfulfilled.  Furthermore those goods would not be produced by the north.  This is because recession in the developed countries is due less to lack of demand than an overaccummulation of excess productive capacity which would be at least partially alleviated by a cut in production costs and a switch in investment to high technology production. That is what we have seen in recent years. These then, rather than increased demand, are the current needs of capital <Col N="1624" /> and of powerful political circles in the north.</P>
    <P>While it can be argued that interests are common in some areas in need of urgent reform internationally, for example, the desire by both lenders and borrowers to avoid a collapse of the borrowing system as a result of a major default by one of the larger developing countries, the fact of the matter remains that fundamental clashes of interest are more likely than spontaneous accords in the years ahead.  These clashes will occur not only between countries of the north and south but between the economic and social forces within each developing country.  The tendency to regard the developing countries as a collection of existing national governments obscures one of the central reasons for the perpetuation of inequalities among these populations.  The Workers' Party for their part proceed from the basic premise that development means the harnessing of productive power in the interests of all the inhabitants of the states of the developing world.  In this process existing elites and outmoded social structures must not only be confronted but the systems of privilege they have given rise to must be uprooted.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to consider briefly at this point the official Government reaction of Ireland to the developments in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.  In the case of Nicaragua the elite has been uprooted.  What do we see? One of the most powerful nations in the world is attempting to undo the great work which has been done in challenging the elite of that country and establishing a system whereby the population as a whole can benefit from development.  In El Salvador a struggle between the poor and the elite results in the assassination of the poor and in death squads yet while Ireland has a positive approach in terms of its support of the Esquipulas II Accord it does not take a very strong line internationally and independently in relation to these countries.  Therefore, as Deputy Michael Higgins said very eloquently, there is need for Ireland to redefine its approach to developing countries and <Col N="1625" /> the role it plays in providing aid for those countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill before us, because we are Part 1 members in this regard we are obliged to make this contribution and increase our contribution in line with the agreement reached.  Because the payments under these obligations are for multilateral aid the cuts which have been introduced by the present Government in our ODA have largely fallen on our bilateral aid, and this has had the effect of ensuring that many worthy efforts on the part of non-governmental organisations in particular have been hit very hard.  Cuts from £14.5 million to £10 million in the Estimates mean only three countries, Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia, now receive priority status and the Sudan has no longer priority status despite its problems of civil war, famine and very high debt burden.</P>
    <P>The HEDCO scheme, a very cost effective scheme of funding non-governmental organisations, particularly Concern, on a 50-50 basis for volunteer workers, travel, housing, insurance etc., has been scrapped at a saving of £1 million and this means Ireland has no aid afoot to Latin America or Asia.  Bilateral aid generally is more cost effective than multilateral aid, therefore we are reducing spending on the most effective means of aiding developing countries.  An example of the cost effectiveness is that while multilateral agencies have large offices and staff, Ireland's aid programme to Lesotho, Tanzania and Kenya is controlled by one development officer in each country who co-ordinates personnel, budgets etc.  Bilateral aid also accords generally with the internal wishes of the recipient countries.  World Bank systems often attach severe preconditions, as Deputy Higgins has said, to the aid they offer.  Ireland's aid has tended to be more multilateral in the past.  It had moved towards being half and half for multilateral aid and bilateral aid but because of the recent cuts this has shifted back towards 60-40 in favour of multilateral aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> I want to finish on a point that I ask the Minister to respond to.  There is a very worrying rumour that aid in next year's Estimates will be eliminated entirely and it has been said quite freely in some circles that in the Department of Foreign Affairs there are people who would prefer to see the aid budget disappear rather than have cutbacks in the Diplomatic Service, embassy staffing and so forth.  I ask the Minister to give the House a categorical assurance that not only will the ODA be maintained but that it will be increased and brought into line with our obligations in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief but I would not like the occasion to pass without at least welcoming this Bill to the House and assuring the Minister that he has the full support of the Fine Gael Party on its introduction. We are pleased to note that £9.6 million will be contributed by the Irish Government to the replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association.  We regret the figure is not much greater but, taking cognisance of the economic recession through which the country is passing, it is understandable. However, I would not like to let this opportunity pass without being critical of the Minister and his Government in reducing our ODA contribution. Ireland had established a reputation for itself in the contributions they have given in the past to overseas development aid. Regrettably, in this year's budget that contribution was cut by a further £12 million.  The United Nations have set a standard, an optimum contribution from Ireland, of 0.7 per cent of gross national product.  The Coalition Government had raised the contribution to the highest point, of 0.26 per cent of gross national product but regrettably this Minister and his Government have reduced that by a further £12 million to 0.18 per cent, making it a miserable contribution on behalf of the Irish people.  I assure the Minister that he would have had the full support of the Irish people had he increased the ODA contribution rather than decreased it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> I have always insisted that support to the Third World strikes a very sympathetic vein among the Irish people.  I suppose it is an historic throwback to the famine over 100 years ago that we have that sympathy and support for the Third World.  The huge support given to Live Aid, Band Aid, GORTA, Trocaire, Concern, Goal and a host of other voluntary groups working for the Third World, that unstinted support given by the Irish people, indicates that had the Minister requested it he would have got undoubted support and permission from the Irish people to contribute further.  I hope, as has been said, that his Department have no intention to phase out the contribution completely and I hope the Minister will give us that assurance when he replies to this debate.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Taoiseach recently asking him if he would ask the Heads of Government of all the different international associations such as the United Nations, the EC, NATO and so on to declare next year Third World hunger year.  It is only by an international concerted effort that this problem can be at least alleviated.  It is amazing that with modern technology we can send men to the moon and we can send satellites around the earth but on this small universe we cannot solve the problems of hunger in the Third World.  I maintain that the will is not there.  There is not that full commitment by international organisations or associations.  People are scandalised that so much money is spent on armaments, nuclear warfare, aircraft, tanks and other weapons of destruction. If a small proportion of that money was contributed to world aid or if the time, effort, talent and ability which is put into these weapons of destruction was concentrated on solving the problems of the Third World it could be done.</P>
    <P>We have the added scandal now in the EC &mdash; it has existed for years in the United States and in other countries &mdash; of farmers being encouraged to leave their land fallow while, at the same time, on the other side of the world, in <Col N="1628" /> the sub-Saharan Africa, people are dying of hunger.  A quarter of a million children die weekly throughout the world of malnutrition and disease while, at the same time, grain is being burnt and land is being deliberately kept fallow in order to keep up this artificial price scheme. Surely if any person were to stand back and look at that dispassionately they would see the scandal of it.  While the World Bank and other institutions prattle and preach about their commitment to get aid of world hunger, on closer examination we can see that their words are empty and that deep down it is just a cosmetic exercise.  I urge the Minister to take up that theme, to see that a concerted united international effort is made to approach this subject once and for all. There is a lot of duplication and triplication by many well-meaning and sincere groups who are attempting to solve this problem but ultimately there is wastage and triplication.  If for one year the full resources of all these institutions were concentrated on the problem some worthwhile headway would be made.  At present progress is very slow.  If we consider the World Development Bank report, 1986, at the present rate of improvement it will take the best part of another century before there are any worthwhile improvements.</P>
    <P>We are also reminded that the indebtedness of the Third World this year is expected to be $1.19 trillion.  That is an outrageously high figure.  The poorer countries are getting deeper and deeper in debt.  I know many of the problems are internal, such as warfare, mismanagement, dictatorial government abusing their own people and using the finances made available to them by organisations for other purposes than what they were intended.  In the light of magnitude of that figure &mdash; £1.19 trillion &mdash; we can see the huge problem that faces the Third World.  Without total commitment by all international institutions and groupings working towards alleviation of the problem, rather than improving the situation those people will get deeper in debt.  We have seen in some instances that countries have not been <Col N="1629" /> able to repay their interest charges.  In Ethiopia and in sub-Saharan Africa people are exporting foodstuffs so as to gain a currency to pay off their debt while, at the same time, the people in those countries are dying of starvation.</P>
    <P>These are just a few comments on the problem.  I hope at some later date we will have time to have a full discussion on our ODA contributions rather than trying to deal with it in this Bill which does not deal specifically with our contribution. I commend this Bill to the House, I assure the Minister that whatever increased funding he gives to the Third World we, on this side of the House, will fully support him.  We will give him every encouragement to increase our national contribution yearly to bring it level with the desired United Nations figure of 0.7 per cent of gross national product.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us is one which commands the support of the House.  What is a matter of concern is that while the Government are taking up their obligations through the United Nations organisations &mdash; and this is an example of that process &mdash; in other parts of our development aid programme there have been very severe cuts.  Over the years the pattern has been a fairly consistent one, with one exception.  Year by year since 1973, when overseas development aid began to be taken seriously in this country at Government level, the share of our national output devoted to helping people in other countries whose living standards are often a tiny fraction of ours has risen.  It has not always risen as fast as some of us would like and it has not always achieved the targets we set ourselves.  We have fallen short of it from time to time.  Provisionally we envisaged an increase of .05 per cent GNP to bring us up from the miserable figure of .035 per cent in 1972 towards the United Nations target of .7 per cent of GNP. The average for industrialised countries is only half that target, about .35 per cent, and it is less today.  We made progress towards that and year by year the share rose until by 1979 we had moved up to <Col N="1630" /> .185 of GNP, about five times what it had been in 1972.</P>
      <P>There was a severe setback in 1980 when very serious cuts were imposed at a time when the Government were being extraordinarily profligate with expenditure at home.  That was the year we raised public service pay by 35 per cent and cut aid to the Third World from .185 per cent of GNP to .17 per cent of GNP. It was our most inglorious year to date in our performance in this area.  In fairness to the Government, the following year there were second and better thoughts and the figure attained in 1979 was restored with a substantial increase in the total amount in current money terms in aid being provided.  In the years that followed, despite changes of Government after three general elections, that process continued until 1985 when we got up to a figure of .256 per cent of GNP.  We remained around that figure in 1986 and 1987.</P>
      <P>That performance of increasing the share of our national output dedicated to this purpose was an honourable one but it was not as much as many of us would have liked.  It fell short of some of the targets we set ourselves, but in years of great financial difficulty when cuts were being imposed elsewhere, in every year except 1980, we increased the share of our resources dedicated to the needs of the most impoverished people in the world, many of them living at or below the level of hunger.  In most years something like 0.5 per cent of our GNP is devoted to aid through the United Nations Organisation and the World Bank.  That figure has been constant over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aid through the EC has risen.  The EC has become increasingly generous with its resources and aid through the EC is now a substantial proportion of what we provide, and in some years sudden increases in EC aid have squeezed our capacity to provide bilateral aid ourselves. Nevertheless, with some ups and downs our bilateral aid programme was non-existent in 1972-73 and has developed to a significant programme which in 1987 involved £17.5 million.  The <Col N="1631" /> fact that even in times of great financial difficulties we achieved this was certainly to our credit and to the credit of successive Governments &mdash; except for the year 1980.</P>
    <P>In the present year there has been a dramatic cut, not merely in the percentage of GNP devoted to this purpose, but in the actual amounts.  The Oireachtas Library does not seem to have available the data in question.  I understand the figure is a drop from £43 million to £32 million.  If I am incorrect the Minister will put me right.  I am working from hearsay since the information has not been furnished to the House in accordance with normal procedure.  A cut of that magnitude means that the share of our GNP devoted to development aid has been reduced in one year by such an amount as to bring it back to where it was in 1979.  The work over nine years of four Governments and in 1987 of this Government, which maintained the figure we had provided in the budget, has been undone in a single year.</P>
    <P>The Minister opposite must be the person primarily responsible for this because it is his Department which propose cuts in spending.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the problems the Minister faces, and of all Ministers, he has my sympathy more than any other because he has had to carry on the process of reducing spending and borrowing which we undertook when we came into office in 1971.  I know what a painful task it is.  When we came into office the level of Exchequer borrowing was 23 per cent of GNP.  In our first and second budgets &mdash; we fell on the latter &mdash; we got it down to about 18 per cent.  We kept up that process thereafter in Government and when we handed over in March of last year the figure was down to between 10.5 per cent and 11 per cent.  The target this Government have set themselves is to get it down to 6 per cent at which point the burden of debt will cease to rise as a share of GNP and the burden of interest payments will cease to rise as a share of the total level of taxation.  I think the <Col N="1632" /> target is broadly correct.  I know the Minister has inherited a problem because while we had resolved virtually three quarters of that problem &mdash; from 23 per cent to 10.5 per cent &mdash; he had the last 4.5 per cent to deal with.  Sometimes to listen to this Government one would think they had to do the whole job.  They were left with the job of undoing a small part of the appalling profligacy of the years up to 1981, but the Minister is doing it.  It is a difficult task and I do not envy him.  While a number of the individual decisions he has taken, put to the Government and been adopted by them, are ones I would quarrel with, I would be reluctant to be too critical in too many areas knowing how few and difficult the choices are.</P>
    <P>The one thing that particularly disappointed me was that he considered it necessary to put it to the Government that there should be a dramatic, drastic, unprecedented cut in the level of development aid to countries so much less well off than we are.  Whatever our problems and God knows we have them, whatever cuts we have to impose in any area, none of those cuts, even those we object to and think are most damaging, bear any resemblance to the effect on the countries we help of withdrawing the aid we give them.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see from the figures &mdash; I am faced with a difficulty in not having the official figures in front of me because they are not available &mdash; the effect of the massive cut this year is effectively to virtually eliminate our bilateral aid programmes.  It seems the Government are on course to eliminate them completely, to limit our contribution to what we have to contribute to the United Nations or the EC as part of the international organisations, and not to give a penny more than we have to under international obligations.  No element of generosity will remain.</P>
    <P>There will be nothing to reflect the generous spirit of the Irish people which has been demonstrated so dramatically on many occasions year after year.  Our figures for official development aid do not represent the full measure of what <Col N="1633" /> this country does to help other countries. In fact, when we add the voluntary aid given, the figure we arrive at is something like the .35 per cent which much richer countries than ourselves, on average, provide.  In those countries voluntary aid rarely represents more than 10 per cent of official aid.  In our case the figure is much greater.  The spirit of generosity which moves our people to provide voluntarily &mdash; out of their own pockets and not through taxation &mdash; such massive amounts of aid, not merely in times of disaster and famine but year after year, is not moving the Minister.  He has decided to put to the Government, and they adopted them, decisions which involved reducing, as far as I can make out, the share of GNP devoted to development aid from something like .25 per cent to .18 per cent, a reduction of almost 30 per cent in one year.  This brings us back to the 1979 figure.</P>
    <P>I speak rarely in the House now.  In my case silence is a virtue, one I have difficulty in practising, but there are occasions when I feel it is not inappropriate to say a few words and this is one of them.  I would urge the Minister to look again next year, just as a predecessor of his, who took very drastic action in 1980, looked again at the picture in 1981 and restored the cuts that had been made.  Whatever further cuts in spending are needed next year &mdash; and it is likely there will be further cuts in spending required over and above those accomplished this year with such difficulty and pain &mdash; let them be such as to leave leeway to restore the aid provided. Let us not destroy the international reputation of our country which stands so high in this sphere worldwide, not because the share of our GNP we have designated is so great &mdash; it is still low by comparison with other countries &mdash; but because we have, year after year, in a period of difficulty, when other countries were cutting back, increased our aid.  When other countries' GNP was rising and they were cutting back we, with a GNP that was static or falling, increased our share of aid year after year with that single exception of 1980.  Let us not destroy that <Col N="1634" /> record.  Let us not damage our reputation in this area.  Let us not have to feel &mdash; as we all have to feel at this moment &mdash; that we have let ourselves down, that we are acting without humanity, that we are taking out on others the mistakes we made ourselves.  It is the people of Lesotho, Zambia, the Sudan, Tanzania, countries like that, who will now suffer.  The kind of assistance we were giving them, not by way of vast financial grants but by sending people out there to help them with their problems, to help solve them in their context, in their way, not imposing our solutions on them, is the kind of aid that means so much to them, which has saved so many lives, together with disaster relief and the other assistance we have given.  It is that aid that we are hitting, that we are withdrawing.  I do not think there is anyone in this House who wants to have that on their conscience. I do not think the Minister does. I know that, under pressure in preparing the Estimates this year, at a certain point he must have reached the stage at which there were so many millions missing. Here is something that could be done easily with the stroke of a pen, but not with humanity, not in the way that he can defend.</P>
    <P>I regret that there has not been more of an outcry about this.  I am afraid that the cuts domestically have gone so deep and, in some cases, have been ill-judged to the point at which they have aroused furores in different quarters.  This has distracted attention from this key area. We have become inward looking this year because so many of our concerns in health and education are affected by what the Government have had to do.  We have taken our eye off the ball in terms of development aid and allowed ourselves, for the first time in very many years, to let pass something which we should not have let pass.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise my voice in this House and ask the Minister, when he comes to preparing next year's Estimates, to review this aid.  I know how difficult is his task.  I know he approaches it with great determination and, I think, with success in the overall result of what <Col N="1635" /> he is trying to achieve.  But it was inevitable that, in attempting to do so much in one year &mdash; he was right to do so &mdash; some of the things he did, at the margins in one or other case, would be mistaken. This is a mistake.  Therefore I would appeal to him that, when he comes to the preparation of next year's Estimates &mdash; when the Minister for Foreign Affairs puts forward, as I hope he will, proposals for development aid &mdash; to bring it up at least to the level it was at in 1985, 1986 and 1987 under this Minister's control, he would restore it at least to that level and hold it there at least for a year or two until we reach the point at which we can begin again to move forward toward the target we set ourselves and the target which the obligations of humanity require us to try to reach.  Do not let us make the mistake of failing to put right what has gone wrong this year under the pressure of events.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look next year.  I do not ask him to change it this year; he cannot; he must stick to his figures and hold his ground; too much is at stake.  If a mistake has been made, it has to rest for the moment but next year is the time to put it right.  Let him do next year what his predecessor did in 1981 in putting right the mistake made in 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Deputies who have spoken.  Everybody has welcomed and is supportive of the Bill before the House. Very few points were raised on its content. The whole debate, or most of it, strayed into the area of ODA which is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, as such, not the subject of discussion today.  There were a number of points raised that I will do my utmost to respond to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I want to say is that everybody, including the last speaker, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, has spoken about the savings made on this Vote or Votes in relation to ODA generally.  I want to put on the record of the House that the commitments we have entered <Col N="1636" /> into will be honoured this year.  That is a fact.  I want to take exception &mdash; though I suppose I should be the last man in the country to do so &mdash; with Deputy FitzGerald and his knowledge and expert use of figures and give the House the facts. Deputy FitzGerald did say he did not have the facts, so I am taking the opportunity of giving them.  He should have had the facts, particularly in relation to the year on which he placed much emphasis, 1980.</P>
    <P>The figure for 1979 was 0.19 per cent, the figure for 1980 was 0.18 per cent and for 1981, on which he placed so much emphasis because he happened to be the then Taoiseach, the figure was 0.17 per cent.  It was not until 1982 when the Minister for Finance he has criticised today came to office made that figure 0.21 per cent.  I should say that, for Deputy FitzGerald's years as Taoiseach, the figure was 0.25 per cent.  That is just to put the record straight.  I am sure the Deputy would be anxious that that be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me, the figures I have differ three decimal places from his.  I think we should try to reconcile them.  I have: 1979, 0.185 per cent; 1980, 0.170 per cent; and 1981, 0.187 per cent.  Perhaps we can reconcile them afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is and it was a very good speech the Deputy made today also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may finish on the point Deputy FitzGerald was making, the figure for 1987 was £43,320,000 and in 1988 it will be approximately £32,241,000, a <Col N="1637" /> reduction of £11 million.  When one hears this criticism &mdash; and we have listened to it now since budget day &mdash; I should say I have not heard one suggestion from anybody here, including a former Taoiseach like Deputy FitzGerald, as to how we might get some resources.  Almost every saving this Government effected last year, and even more so this year, has been the subject of debate and criticism here.  Yet I do not hear anybody coming along and saying: listen, Minister, even for next year &mdash; so that we will restore those £11 million &mdash; we are going to increase taxes on something else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will, and indeed in other areas where he sought increased expenditure because, as he rightly said, the national debt is there, the borrowing requirement is there.  Just to correct the Deputy on another series of figures he used, I should say that the borrowing requirement was 13.2 per cent when I assumed office last March, just 12 months ago.  We got that figure down to 10.4 per cent at the end of 1987 and are endeavouring to reduce it further this year to approximately 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I can only go on the facts, the outturn, and that was 13.2 per cent at the end of 1986 when the Deputy had responsibility.  I do not want to get into argument I merely want &mdash; as the Deputy would like to do himself &mdash; to put the facts on the record and not have distorted figures appearing.</P>
      <P>I will finish on a number of questions and points raised by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remain committed to providing as much as they can to official development assistance when circumstances allow us &mdash; which they do not at present &mdash; to continue to have restored the growing contribution to ODA to which Deputy FitzGerald referred.  I hope that point will be reached.  I want <Col N="1638" /> to state categorically that &mdash; and this is not my responsibility but rather that of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; on the question raised by Deputy De Rossa about aid for next year being wiped out completely, that is nonsense. To make statements of that nature is absolute rubbish.  It is a matter for budgetary decison and will be discussed when those discussions arise.</P>
    <P>In so far as there has been reference to the starving community in the world I should say that everybody is concerned about that.  It is easy to pick out a particular reduction in expenditure and maintain that a Minister, or a Government, has been responsible and contributed to the starving people in the world.  That is not the case and any Deputy who has suggested that knows that that is not the case.  As I said earlier, we are honouring all commitments to this sort of aid.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised by Deputy Higgins.  One could go into a long debate on these but as I said they are not really the subject of discussion before us. Deputy Higgins said that the increase we and other countries had to give was because of the shortfall in the contribution from the United States or the USSR.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins' question in relation to the US contribution to the IDA, I am not here to defend the role of the USA in any particular activity.  Their contribution is 25 per cent or $2.875 billion.  I do not know whether that is up or down on the previous amount because I do not have the figures in front of me.  I will give the Deputy the figures I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The ODA is the basis on which it should be examined.  The USA have gone from $8.7 billion in 1984, to $9.4 billion in 1985 and to $9.7 billion in 1986.  Their ODA contribution has been increasing in real terms.  Their contribution as a percentage of GNP for the three years I have given would be 0.24 per cent, 0.24 per cent and 0.23 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Specific legislation was brought in here to enable the shortfall to be made up by countries including ourselves.  I congratulated the Government of the day at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent that that may be the case, and also in so far as the difference between the $11.5 million and $12.4 million is concerned, we would be contributing $350,000 extra.  Perhaps that answers the Deputy's question.  I wanted to put on the record the facts and figures I have in relation to the contribution made by the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins spent a lot of his time <Col N="1640" /> discussing the conditions for those loans. I should like to say quite clearly that there are no ideological conditions laid down for IDA loans.  The Deputy referred to what I had said in my speech.  I said that while the bank lends to a wide range of developing countries on more or less commercial terms, which is true, I went on immediately to say that the IDA provide highly concessionary loans, interest free and with a moratorium for ten years. Therefore, there is a difference between what the bank does and the IDA do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted to that and said that the bank's thinking had gone into the IDA thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true and I want to go into that in some more detail so as to give all the facts I have in relation to structural adjustment and where it may be said that is where the conditions do lie.  Structural or economic adjustment refers to adjustments to the structure of a country's economy in response to changes in its external or domestic environment. In the context of the developing world, structural adjustment usually involves a very painful adjustment aimed at bringing a country's economy into line with its economic fundamentals and creating the conditions for sustainable growth in the future.  In recent years most developing countries have suffered a major deterioration in their terms of trade due to huge drops in the prices of their exports, which consist mainly of primary commodities &mdash; agricultural produce, minerals, etc.  They have also faced increasing protection on their main markets as Governments in developed countries strive to protect employment. To add to their problems many incurred high debts to foreign banks and governments in the boom years of the seventies. Deputy O'Keeffe, Deputy Griffin and Deputy Higgins referred to this.  Some countries, including some of the poorest, borrowed moderately and wisely.  Many others borrowed heavily, for example, to expand social services and commodity processing facilities on the assumption, which seemed reasonable at the time, <Col N="1641" /> that favourable growth conditions in the world economy would continue.  When conditions in the external environment began to turn sour, some countries delayed the necessary adjustments to their economies and continued to borrow to this end.</P>
      <P>Structural adjustment in developing countries became an issue on the international agenda from 1982 onwards as an increasing number of these countries began to have difficulty servicing their external debts.  Because of these difficulties many had recourse initially to the IMF which, in accordance with its mandate, extended short term loan facilities on conditions that the counry involved implemented, under its guidance, a limited but intensive programme of structural reform aimed at restoring the country's capacity to meet its external obligations.  They even did that to England not so many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Third World debt problem worsened the fire brigade type exercise involved in quickly restoring order on a country's external account was replaced, particularly in the low income countries, with the more medium-term strategy of structural adjustment with growth, with the World Bank complementing the work of the IMF.  The IMF concentrated on the balance of payments while the World Bank concentrated on reform within the domestic economy aimed at restoring growth.  With the increasing evidence of the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes on the poorer segments of the population, the strategy is now being further modified to one of structural adjustment with growth and with a &ldquo;human face&rdquo;.  Developing countries, in general, and African countries, in particular, have publicly acknowledged the need for economic reform to be achieved through policies of structural adjustment with growth but they have some reservations.  Some of these were mentioned by Deputy Higgins and I sympathise with these.  Because the Deputy made a very important contribution to this whole question, I will go through these so as to give the full picture.  Their <Col N="1642" /> reservations are: the difficulty of servicing their debt and carrying out structural adjustment at the same time; the pace of structural adjustment being wished upon them is too fast; conditionality infringes their sovereignty and philosophy of development; the amount of resources available as assistance is inadequate and real growth and protectionism in the developed countries hamper the efforts of developing countries. Ireland's general position has been one of sympathy for the difficulties facing the developing countries in implementing structural reforms.  We support the need for more resources for the poorest countries and believe that their structural adjustment efforts should not be prejudiced by debt repayments.</P>
    <P>That covers in general the main points that have been made.  When we talk about the IDA contribution we cannot just take it in isolation; we have to look at the overall ODA contribution.  I will finish on the main points again.  We are, as I said, going to honour the commitment to existing projects and consider, as I have been asked by all Deputies, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has most of the responsibility in this area, the provision for ODA generally, what can be done in the context of the budgetary situation for 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This topic has been reasonably well aired in the House on a fairly positive note and I should like to maintain that trend.  I am in favour of the Bill.  When Mark Clinton opted for this merger in the early seventies I supported it at that stage because I felt then, and still do, that both organisations had so much in common they should have been together long ago, but we shall not go into any recriminations &mdash; there are enough of those going around.</P>
      <P>One of the problems of this country is that there are so many people doing the same thing.  I remember a stage when the universities, the Sugar Company, ACOT, AFT and even co-operative movements were all carrying out the same type of experiment.  That certainly was a waste of resources.  This type of getting together is vital in a scenario where resources are very scarce, or non-existent. The Minister of State has been quite positive and understands the scene, but I must tell him that I do not see the merger succeeding without some extra money.  That is a prerequisite, a minimal requirement, for success without which we shall have massive lay-offs and massive closures.</P>
      <P>Parochialism was mentioned this morning and I am not going to become parochial but, as Minister, I knew quite well the good work that was going on at Moorepark and Kinsealy, Oak Park and, indeed, on the ACOT site at Kildalton, where we persuaded the people to become involved in convincing overseas processors that Ireland could produce potatoes suitable for chips.  One would imagine that would not take proving, but they did need to be convinced.  At that time we were dealing in many varieties of potato most of which, like Kerr Pinks and Golden Wonders, were not suitable. We embarked on a very long programme and it took us about three seasons before we got it right and we had a variety called Pentland Dell.  That would not have been possible without all the co-operation we received, not only from Kildalton and Moorepark but with the product being taken up at Kinsealy and processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> We produced chips for visiting processors. They sampled them and admitted that our potatoes were as good as, if not better than, those they had been using.  When you are talking about processing, you are talking about offering comparatively low prices so we had to be talking about totally different tonnages. The brilliant history of Moorepark has yet to be written.  In the past ACOT and AFT were working so hard, like many others, that they did not have time to talk about themselves and a great deal of their work is not recognised.</P>
    <P>We must remember the old days of dairying and the clean milk campaign. That is now in the history books but it was a massive campaign.  Subsequently, we had the dairy programme for the control of antiobiotics, ensuring that we produced good quality milk and that the product was suited to the various byproducts such as butter, cheese, yoghourt, ice cream and so forth.  All that work is ongoing and side-by-side with it there has been a great deal of research into silage and silage additives and types of cows.  One might think that all that work has been done and that there is no need for any more; far from it.  In this whole area of co-operatives &mdash; and this is a nice change &mdash; these bodies now find themselves no longer able to expand to pay for the higher costs and wage bills. They are locked into a situation where they may have to lay-off people unless they take up the challenge of creating more downstream products, new ideas like more soft cheeses, more of what is going on at Imokilly co-operative in regard to Regatta cheese.  That whole area must be explored if the co-operatives are to stay in business and maintain a reasonable level of employment.</P>
    <P>This shows how vital Moorepark is and that is where the work done there scored in the past.  They have products waiting to be marketed but they are not going to be able to continue that work without resources.  I am not saying that they had all the necessary resources when we were in office &mdash; they always had to operate on a shoestring budget but at least they had that budget.  That is something we <Col N="1645" /> must bear in mind.  More than ever, we need the research and development facilities of Moorepark and the dairy industry if our major co-operatives are to continue and get more and more into the marketplace.  Perhaps in the past intervention was a lazy way out.  We could glibly and gladly put our butter and milk powder into intervention.  In some cases we could be said to have mistaken intervention for the marketplace.  The big advantage was that we did not need to have marketing people.  One could put the product straight in and be paid, but that is no longer the case.  Now more than ever it will be much tougher and tighter, not merely for dairying people but for people in the meat business also, to survive and expand.</P>
    <P>The whole meat vacuum pack scene is changing so quickly.  I remember a time when one could get rid of ordinary frozen carcases anywhere in the world, but now because there are some entrepreneurs who are getting into the top of the market we are regarded in Germany as the highest of high-class producers.  That would not have been attained without the help of AFT and ACOT in producing the right animal, in developing it along the lines of high quality and very selective breeding.  Legislation was introduced and the whole breeding programme is now controlled.  An Foras Talúntais and ACOT are doing a very good job.  Some despondent people say that we are at the end of the line with regard to beef production but nothing could be further from the truth.  It is an area in which there is plenty of room at the top.  In Germany in particular we are very highly respected in regard to quality although I am not so sure that we deserve all the praise we get. At least we have a reputation for very high class, hormone free beef, free from all sorts of additives.  There is the wonderful CBF image of grass and clover which enhances that feeling.  However, to maintain and develop our position, it will be necessary to take a lot of care. We must protect the market and the way to do so is to have an independent agency working side by side with the industry <Col N="1646" /> and doing the job it was set up to do at farm level from production to processing.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom went down a different road from us in regard to breeding programmes and they went completely overboard on Holstein.  Now, because of the hormone problems, they find that that breed is not suitable for the purposes they originally intended.  More through good luck than good judgment we are fortunate in that we stayed with the old British Friesian because that is the basic animal used here for the production of beef which has proved more than satisfactory when crossed with various beef breeds.</P>
    <P>We all know what the Department of Agriculture, ACOT and AFT have done in regard to the sheep industry.  Ten or 15 years ago you could not persuade a farmer to depart one inch from Suffolk and Oxford Down carcases which they thought were the be-all and end-all of the industry.  Indeed, the local butcher thought the same but when we expanded into the French market, there was a total revolution.  Much smaller sheep were involved; I heard a farmer ask if they were rabbits, but that is the sort of animal which is now required and which makes money.  Thanks to ACOT and AFT we worked on that breed and quite a number of farmers are making a lot of money.  Of course, some farmers went into it too quickly and are not making so much money and this is where ACOT and AFT come in.  Figures in a farming newspaper or leaflets do not give enough information in regard to sheep farming.  There is much more to breeding sheep and this is where day-to-day attention by ACOT and AFT is vital.</P>
    <P>Grain is a difficult area and it is not so long since we were talking about good yields of barley at around 38 cwt. to two tonnes.  We must thank the people in the institute and the Department of Agriculture who have worked so well in this area.  However, there are now cutbacks, price restrictions and levies and we seem to have got the worst of both worlds. Perhaps we could have borne a levy on milk if we were allowed to produce more of it and we would be quite happy to have <Col N="1647" /> quotas in grain if we were allowed to maintain the price.  It is not too late for the Government and the Minister to look at exemptions for malting barley because there is an unlimited market for top class Irish malting barley in the European market place and there is no justification for imposing levies or penalties.</P>
    <P>We are an island nation and we are entitled to be self-sufficient and to be allowed to produce sufficient quantities of milling wheat for our own requirements without incurring any penalty. That applies to the six Northern counties as well.  We are also taking a hammering in regard to sugar quotas and that should not be tolerated.  We must point out to the people in Brussels that we should be allowed to expand our sugar acreage to cover the requirements of the six Northern counties, as much of the sugar is coming from outside the Community. ACOT and AFT have done good work in the past and have co-operated with farmers and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my pet hobby of producer groups, some of whom were quite successful.  However, they are the way forward.  I am not casting aspersions on An Bord Glás and I am prepared to examine any programme which, if it works, should be supported.  However, we should not lose sight of what has been done since 1982-83.  At that time, farmers were literally throwing the Dutch potatoes into the sea and there was open war.  I had to answer some very difficult questions in the House and I decided to set up producer groups.  Legislation was introduced covering the registration of potato growers and packers and, thanks to that, we now have the basis of an organised potato industry.  Before these groups were set up, you could not trace a culprit grower but now the legislation ensures that only good potatoes come on the market.  However, we have a miserably small market for our potatoes and indeed there is a glut.  Supermarkets and others do not appear to be able to differentiate between varieties of <Col N="1648" /> potatoes.  In other words, if a housewife wants Golden Wonders she must be prepared to pay for them and the same applies to Kerr Pinks.  On the other hand if she is prepared to settle for Pentland Dells she will buy them at a reduced price because it is possible to get double deals on them.</P>
    <P>The system was working out very nicely and the national potato co-op was set up under the aegis of the IFA and supported by the Department.  However, the marketing arrangement did not work out.  Those involved in marketing pulled out and left potato growers high and dry. I should like to appeal to the Minister once more to look at this matter.  I welcome the potato promotion that is in operation at present but something more is necessary.  We must remember that the horticultural co-op, established at the same time as the potato co-op, proved very successful.  That group have progressed to such an extent that they can boast of being able to get their produce into the four corners of Ireland at reasonable prices.  They can claim that they are able to satisfy the demand of supermarkets and please consumers.  That great achievement is due to the efforts of people like Michael Mahon of the IFA and Colm Warren chief executive of the group.  Their achievement is all the more noteworthy when one considers that they were given a pittance to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as the potato co-op proved to be, at least we succeeded in selling the concept of co-operation to farmers. Farmers are slow enough to get together when produce is scarce and they can have separate deals with their local supermarkets but in the long term it is important that they co-operate.  This year is an ideal time for them to get together again while we have a glut on the market.  I suggest that the Minister, those involved in horticulture and the farming organisations should get together to discuss potato production.  The only reason potato growers got together was that they were so far down the road, but they were passed out by those involved in horticulture. It is important that potato <Col N="1649" /> growers and those involved in horticulture join forces and take over the entire scene.</P>
    <P>We will not solve the problem by establishing new boards or leaving it to the Department.  The only people who can sort out the mess that occurs annually are those who are involved in potato growing and the horticultural sector.  People must try to work out contracts based on market requirements.  We must also aim to have a processing outlet in the future but it is important that we do not concentrate on processing because the farmer supplying those factories will be growing for that market only.  We cannot say that the surplus from potato production could be taken up by processors.  That will not happen.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the campaign started some years ago by ACOT and AFT.  It is a pity that it did not continue because it concentrated on an area where the industry has failed.  We are all aware of the campaign at present against what I call wholesome food, the campaign against dairy products and meat.  Many people say that sugar is bad but if we were to accept that and other advice we would not be eating anything at all.  In my view we were not aggressive enough against those campaigns.  Our dairy coops produced dairy spreads and so on but did not mount an aggressive campaign. ACOT and AFT got involved in a campaign but they did not get the type of support they were entitled to.  Our dairy co-ops should have spelled out the advantages of their products.  The human race has survived by consuming large quantities of the products that are being condemned today and nobody will convince me, and many others, that a change in our diet will mean we will live any longer. A healthy lifestyle is what this is all about. Our forefathers lived for a long time on a diet of large quantities of salty beef, spuds and cabbage.  They also consumed plenty of milk and country butter, which did them no harm.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the merger, of a tightly knit organisation working on the development and production side. However, I am worried about the <Col N="1650" /> number of personnel that will be left in the new organisation.  The Minister did not tell us if 1,000 or 500 officials will lose their jobs.  I am concerned that we will lose the top officials in those organisations to other countries because of all the uncertainty about the merger.  Such highly qualified people are scarce and it is worth noting that the top officials in the institute have a worldwide reputation.  I can recall visiting the breeding station at Beltsville in Washington and hearing of the reputation of ACOT and AFT officials.  If the uncertainty is allowed to continue I do not think those officials will stay.</P>
    <P>The Minister should state clearly the proposals he has in mind.  It is irrelevant what the new organisation is called because it can survive irrespective of the name.  In the past some of the names of similar organisations could not be pronounced but at least the name of the new organisation, Teagasc, is easy to pronounce and spell.  It is important that the new organisation is properly funded and if the Minister considers it necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to do so he will have my support.  There is little point in proposing a revolutionary organisation if it is not funded properly.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of glib talk in recent months about the income of farmers increasing by 17 per cent.  Years ago when I was arguing about the price of green peas with the Sugar Company I was told that I was getting 7 per cent more from them than was available on the market but my response to that was that 7 per cent of nothing was nothing.  Farmers are working from a very bad base after the disastrous years of 1985 and 1986.  We had to rescue farmers in those years.  The House had to give support to farmers who could not work their farms.  I accept that the dairy farmer who has a reasonable quota is doing fairly well and that those who have set up beef units will survive but tillage farmers are having a rough time.  They have not had a 17 per cent increase in their income.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to stress that farmers can move into other areas of <Col N="1651" /> production and that is fortunate.  We salvaged the remnants of an Irish food processing industry.  I am not taking much credit for that.  We all recall that Erin Foods closed down Midleton and Mallow.  The plant in Carlow, an excellent one serviced by farmers owning the best horticultural land in the world, has closed.  However, we salvaged the nucleus of that industry and I worked hard on that.  I see no reason why we should not expand into the midlands where we have the finest farmland in Europe for this sort of development.  We must find out how best to help farmers to stay in business and give young farmers some encouragement to stay here.  It is hard to convince them that there is a future at home.</P>
    <P>I am very encouraged by the company established in Midleton and Mallow who have an entrée to the British market.  I should like to see that company expanding further with the help of farmers in the region.  There is a market of 50 million across the water and this company probably ranks at number two or three in that market.  Acreage does not really matter. It is a question of motivating them to expand.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to establish a new enterprise.  I must be the greatest living expert on the problems encountered when starting something new.  I am not blaming the Department but there is a number of people in high places who have a problem for every solution.  Perhaps these people have a place but it is a pity we do not have more positive thinking. The system is partly to blame.  A person who looks for some financial assistance will be told to wait until the Book of Estimates has been prepared, but at that stage all the State funds have already been allocated.  What the nation needs is an investment policy.  We have the National Development Corporation, the IDA and other agencies who are doing a good job but when a group of people come together with an idea which requires a lot of money they run into difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let us take the flax industry as an <Col N="1652" /> example.  About three years ago I was in Brussels deputising for the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  A document had been produced on the flax industry and it was decided, because of its potential, to support the industry to the tune of £250 per hectare for the foreseeable future.  This was music to my ears and those of many others.  We set up a programme with the help of the Department of Agriculture, ACOT and AFT and carried out some trials.  The second year trials were perhaps too ambitious in that we grew 150 acres.  However, we proved that we can do what was done in the 1890s when 70,000 or 80,000 acres of flax were grown.  A change occurred when manmade fibres took over but demand is growing again.  We spent approximately £80,000 on these experiments but last year the Germans spent £2.4 million on experiments in flax.  Our budget was tiny in comparison but we achieved enough to convince everybody that we can do it.  How do we get this enterprise going?  Who will set up a plant? I do not believe it should be a textile factory.  The initial stage is agri-related business.  We are having discussions with Waterford Co-operative to see if they will take it on and I hope a small project will start this year.  Certainly I will persevere. We must have a policy whereby people with the right ideas will be funded on an equity basis and allowed to start this type of business, forming a co-operative of farmers and growers.  We are not talking about making linen.  There are groups in the north of Ireland screaming for Irish scutch flax.  There is no such thing as Irish linen.  All the flax used in the linen industry here comes from Normandy.  If for no other reason we should put a lot of effort into this project.</P>
    <P>There are other possible enterprises which could be established.  There is a market in Paris for 2 million rabbits per annum.  We will have a small project ready in the near future but we are experiencing great difficulty in setting it up.  We keep meeting the guy with the problem for every solution.  Of course, such people have responsibilities but it is vital to give new enterprises the support they need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> The CAP is coming under unnecessary criticism from uninformed people.  Basically it was designed to bring up living standards in Ireland and other regions of the Community to proper levels.  That has been achieved and if there is one criticism which could be levelled at the CAP it is that it has been too successful. It achieved its objective too quickly and some people may have got the wrong ideas.  Provision was made for intervention but it was never intended that intervention would be the market-place. On the whole, however, the CAP has been a success.  FEOGA, which is an aspect of the CAP, is vital to the survival of this economy.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that we should be so tolerant of some of the GATT agreements. The nations who negotiated these agreements contribute much to Community funding and have a lot of muscle. Because of GATT agreements we are being asked to cut back and farmers are going out of business.  If we made one mistake in the sixties and seventies it was that we did not look more to the Dutch and other Europeans and adopt their methods of production.  We were trying at that time to find out how much milk we could get from an acre of grass, but the Dutch were pumping sugar beet pulp from Sacramento into their cows to bring up gallonages in readiness for the time when there would be a quota system.  As a grass producing nation we should have nearly double our present quota.</P>
    <P>Earlier this morning we had a debate on funding for the Third World.  I have some knowledge of the famine in Ethiopia because I worked on the FAO Committee of the Council of Europe for a number of years and I was appalled at the amount of waste in the distribution of food to Third World countries.  While people are starving it is wrong for a Christian community, as the European Community professes to be, to tell us to set aside land and not use it.  These are wealthy nations which spend plenty of money on armaments and yet they tell us that this is costing too much.  Surely, if Third World countries in a time of famine cannot use frozen beef and butter they <Col N="1654" /> could use grain.  Let us use the land that is to be set aside for Third World countries and let us show some real concern.</P>
    <P>Another way of using the land to be set aside in this small country of ours is to get into forestry.  There are parts of the country which are totally unsuited for anything else.  There are many a husband and wife team who would love to get into forestry but they have to wait 30 years for a return.  With the money they will receive for setting aside land along with help from investment companies they will have a terrific opportunity for doing so.</P>
    <P>I have made a few positive points this morning just to prove that we are not at the end of the line as far as agriculture is concerned.  I hope I have made that clear. One might think that at my time of life I should be getting a bit despondent; on the contrary, I now feel stronger than ever that this island has always benefited from adversity.  We never rolled up our sleeves until our backs were to the wall. I will not listen to platitudes from any side of the House about how well we are doing.  Our backs are to the wall and there is only one way we can get out of our difficulties and that is to produce competent, well educated top-class young farmers and we will not do so without ACOT and AFT.</P>
    <P>I will not even mention that Fianna Fáil objected to the legislation I brought in to impose a charge for the services provided.  Basically, I saw nothing wrong in doing so.  The good fellows were already going elsewhere for services and paying for them.  I do not think that is important but what is important is that top class and specialist services should be available to young farmers.  Those services are now available.  A few moments ago I referred to rabbit production. ACOT provide a specialised service to producers in the initial stages in order to see if it can be done.  We need ACOT advisers who can assist a young farmer, if he has a programme for his bank manager, by going through that programme line by line, if necessary telling him he is being far too optimistic and does not know what he is talking about and then <Col N="1655" /> drawing up a programme which will succeed.</P>
    <P>We now need An Foras Talúntais more than ever.  Consumer patterns are always changing and the housewife is supreme. There is no point in telling a housewife from Berlin there are no hormones in the meat or that they will not do her any harm.  That does not matter, it is her perception of things which counts.  That is why it is so vitally important that we adhere to all of the things that will ensure we produce top quality food.  I am a long time around and I know that we will not do it without expert advice and the devotion of people who work in the laboratories. The programme must be ongoing and I can assure the Minister I will be very co-operative.  If anything occurs which affects the future of ACOT and AFT I will come into this House and scream at the Minister.  I appeal to him to find sufficient funds to keep that organisation going in this most crucial of times for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is refreshing to hear contributions from people who have some association with agriculture. Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Doyle who spoke before him have an interest in agriculture and I want to approach this debate as a farmer.  Many of the contributions in this debate have been made by solicitors, barristers and schoolteachers. My fear at present is that not only will farmers become extinct in Leinster House but also if the Minister has his way they will become extinct in the country.  I consider these proposals as the Government abandoning agriculture which, I might add, is untypical of Fianna Fáil who in the past always treated agriculture with the importance it deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue here is not one of amalgamation but rather that this is a cheap way of trying to cut funds.  This is very ironic because ten years ago Fianna Fáil wanted to keep research and advice separate. I can see the arguments for that. I would find it much easier to advance arguments in favour of keeping them separate rather than for amalgamating them. <Col N="1656" /> In Europe research is kept independent of advice and training.  Even in big companies or corporations such as ICI research is kept independent of advice. Agriculture is only 40 per cent developed in this country and if it is to play its part in the economic recovery of this country how do we propose to succeed with this act of butchery?</P>
    <P>There are only two explanations for this savage attack &mdash; either the Minister does not understand farming and agriculture or he is not in charge of his Department.  As a farmer I know and appreciate the excellent work which is being carried out by AFT and ACOT.  A recent AFT magazine contains an article on &ldquo;Research and value for money&rdquo; by Pierce Ryan.  The article stated that people are now beginning to realise what would be at stake if the new organisation formed from the merger of AFT and ACOT does not have a strong vigorous research arm.  Dr. Ryan pointed out that the technology based on the research of AFT has saved farmers and other users millions of pounds every year.  For instance, research at Johnstown Castle on alternative sources of nitrogen saves Irish farmers about £15 million per annum.  Research in sulphur has identified one million hectares of grassland which could increase production by about 15 per cent or an extra £75 million worth per annum for an extra expenditure of £5 million on fertiliser.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan also mentioned the fact that research by AFT provided vital information in securing the 4 per cent derogation from the milk super levy in 1984. This was worth £400 million.  Since 1975 AFT research on nutrition and feed formulation has gained a 15 per cent improvement in the efficiency of pig production, saving producers about £15 million in feed costs annually at present prices.  On potato breeding Dr. Ryan claims that the AFT Oak Park bred Cara variety of seed potatoes has saved our seed industry.  It provides 6 per cent of the British seed potato market and is the top variety in Israel.  In 1985 Cara alone earned over £200,000 in plant breeders' royalties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> The farmer is not the only one to benefit from AFT research.  The dairy industy has benefited tremendously from its work.  The new cheese starter perfected and supplied by Moorepark and used to produce 70 per cent of all cheddar cheese in Ireland is now the subject of a new commercial business in Cork.  This is just one of the examples from a long list of successes.</P>
    <P>Our research into agriculture has to be maintained at a very high standard and our research has an excellent reputation. The ACOT centres such as the one in Kildalton have a reputation that we hope to maintain.  AFT in Carlow recommend fertiliser programmes for cereal and beet production and for potatoes.  They also have herbicide and fungicide programmes which are vital if we are to keep up with modern trends.  Farmers demonstrated their commitment to ACOT last year when asked to pay for advice.  There is no better way to demonstrate commitment than by paying for the service.  Progressive farmers have never relied as much as they do now on these services.  We should encourage more research and reward our best researchers properly.  Unfortunately, because of the uncertainty a lot of our best people have chosen to leave.  This is disgraceful.  We should develop advice and training but it appears that the Government's approach is to decimate agriculture.</P>
    <P>Last May or June I attended a jamboree in Agriculture House where the Goodman organisation negotiated a deal worth over £100 million.  Is research, advice and training to be the sacrificial lamb to help to pay for this scandal? Where are all the jobs that were promised last May or June?  If our cattle numbers and the numbers of cattle being slaughtered are dropping I would like to know where the jobs are.  It would have been better to spend the money by offering to increase incentives to increase our national herd.</P>
    <P>I will not waste time discussing the proposed name of this new agency.  It has been adequately dealt with by other <Col N="1658" /> speakers.  I have no difficulty in pronouncing Teagasc but the name is not appropriate because it does not take into account research and development. There appears to be difficulty in the pronounciation of the name in this country, so how can we expect it to be recognised in Europe?</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that section 3 has no provision to allow farming organisations to nominate people to the board.  Boards of this nature are only a way of creating jobs for the deserving party faithful.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of this Bill seems to suggest that the role of the Minister for Finance in Agriculture may be becoming more significant than that of the Minister for Agriculture.  It is disappointing that the responsibility for animal disease eradication will not be included in the responsibility of the new agency.  This country has a sorry experience in tackling animal disease.  With regard to TB we have spent a vast amount of taxpayers' money without much success.  To deliberately exclude such a vital area from this agency is a backward step.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider his position.  Have we not learned anything from our experience with animal diseases in the past?</P>
    <P>The merits or demerits of committees of agriculture could be argued extensively but surely it is wise for any Minister to ensure that such committees have a strong local input into decision making. As a member of a committee of agriculture I would like to safeguard the role of the committees which do not cost a lot of money to run.</P>
    <P>The recent staffing audit carried out in the Department should be made public immediately.  It is crazy to have a staff of over 4,000 in the Department costing in the region of £60 million per annum and they are virtually untouched although the people providing services in research, advice and training are axed.  The Minister should be more responsible in his approach.  If the Minister gets away with this, agricuture will suffer and history will be very unkind to the present Administration.</P>
    <P>I was amused at the Minister, at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, taking credit for <Col N="1659" /> a boom in agriculture.  This demonstrated how far removed is the Minister from agriculture.  Perhaps he might explain why 10,000 people have chosen to leave the land on an annual basis, why farmers owe £2 billion and why related industries such as engineering and building are going broke.  We are living in an age of quotas and surpluses.  Our dairy herd is dropping and will continue to drop over the next couple of years.  Our suckler herd is half of what it was in 1978.  Our cattle numbers are dropping at an alarming rate.  The last Coalition Government did nothing to try to prevent this from happening and the present Fianna Fáil Administration are not taking the issue seriously.</P>
    <P>The dairy sector in agriculture is doing well in that the larger people are doing very well.  However a sector of them, the largest sector, the people with an under-25,000 gallon quota deserve some kind of attention.  There is not a livelihood for a person with a 25,000 gallon quota.  I raised this in the Dáil on 24 November 1987 when I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the action if any he proposed to take to counteract the imminent crisis of small milk producers many of whom had reached their quotas and were now facing extinction as a result of the imposition of severe penalties on production.  The Minister's reply, as recorded in the Official Report, column 1492, volume 375, was:</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties that the quotas system presents for some small scale milk producers.  I have already sought to assist these farmers within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community Regulations.  I have laid down that priority in both the distribution of fleximilk and in the new restructuring scheme which I negotiated as part of this year's price fixing package, will be given to those producers whose quotas do not exceed 25,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at other possibilities, within the regulations, of meeting the needs of small scale milk <Col N="1660" /> producers especially young farmers.  I expect to make an announcement in this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge nothing has been done about this and I would like to know when something can be done about it.  If we are to continue on the road we are going we will have a mass exodus of small farmers from Irish agriculture.  Dairying is the only real opportunity and means of livelihood for small farmers.</P>
    <P>Sheep are profitable at the moment.  I am delighted about that, but I am beginning to wonder how long it will last. Sheep numbers are increasing at an alarming rate.  The margins in beef production are very tight at the moment.  I have often wondered what the Minister's view on natural hormones is.  This is a very controversial area.  The profit margins are so tight that it is very difficult to see how the producers, the fatteners, are going to survive.  While I do not agree with everything Deputy Hegarty had to say on this, if there are to be restrictions on hormones there is a definite need for us to increase our continental breeds.</P>
    <P>The tillage sector are the forgotten people in agriculture.  If we had as many tillage farmers as we have dairy farmers more would be done for the tillage sector. The price of grain is dropping every year and people are being forced out of tillage. What is to become of people who have been growing corn?  What are they to do with their land?  It is no longer profitable for people to grow corn.  There are opportunities for bigger producers to grow malting barley and perhaps milling wheat, but growing milling wheat depends largely on the weather, as the Minister is aware.  When cattle numbers are dropping alarmingly what is the point of putting land under grass?  After the disastrous years 1985 and 1986 most tillage farmers could not afford to stock their land.  The dilemma there has not been addressed or taken seriously by the present Administration.</P>
    <P>A major marketing problem presents itself in the pig industry.  I have heard talk about the food industry for a long time and we are not getting to grips with <Col N="1661" /> it.  We could create a great deal of employment in this area but we are doing nothing about it.  The primary producer is not being rewarded for producing high quality meat in this case.  We need to develop this area quickly.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister in regard to vegetables and potatoes.  He is trying to promote the Irish potato, and that is a very positive step.</P>
    <P>This Bill demonstrates the lack of planning and understanding of our biggest and most productive industry.  Nothing in the Minister's speech convinces me that the action he proposes is correct.  I have heard a great deal of nonsense about us coming out of the recession.  I do not believe we are doing so; we have a long way to go.  I do not want to be negative about it, but how can we be positive when so many people are leaving the country, unemployment is on the increase and our national debt is increasing?  Let us not fool ourselves.  This Government hope to save money by curtailing our research, advice and training.  This is crazy and does not make sense.  Only a year ago I heard the Taoiseach say how we were going to create employment from agriculture, aquaculture, tourism and other areas, but all this has been forgotten.  In agriculture we will see the big farmers getting bigger and an increase in the number of part-time farmers.  People will be unable to survive in agriculture without some other part-time employment. In five or six years I will probably be proven right in this.</P>
    <P>Last July the Minister asked the two bodies for a 10 per cent reduction.  Last September he looked for a 25 per cent reduction.  Now we are looking for a 43 per cent reduction.  Where is it all going to end?  The present Administration have shattered the morale.  We are abolishing AFT and ACOT, two organisations who have no record of strikes, who worked well and effectively.  It is disgraceful &mdash; I cannot put it in terms strong enough.  I call on all parties to try to come to some arrangement for the benefit of the country and agriculture and do something about the present state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a contribution on this legislation.  I welcome the Bill.  It is timely from two points of view.  First, the new single organisation will be better able to cope with needs at present.  Second, because of the severe financial restrictions and the need to reduce public expenditure as much as possible in the interests of the overall financial position, it is well that the amalgamation be carried out to increase efficiency as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Various references were made in the course of the debate as to what was said and done in the past.  I see no advantage in going over old ground, as it were.  The possibility of merging AFT and ACOT was mooted many years ago.  Subsequently it was felt that that should not be done, but it has been decided at this time to bring the research and advisory bodies together under the umbrella of one organisation.  Perhaps at some time in the next decade experience will show that what we are now doing is no longer suitable.  When that happens I expect and hope that the Minister responsible at that time, having consulted the people best competent to give him advice, will make whatever changes are necessary having regard to all the prevailing circumstances of the time.  All we can ever do in politics and in public administration generally is to provide the best means for the needs of the day and to try at the same time to identify and develop the best possibilities for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is disagreement or dispute on any side of this House about the need for agricultural research, advice and education.  All of us, and people throughout the country, know well the very good work that has been carried out by An Foras Talúntais and by ACOT. An Foras Talúntais were established almost 30 years ago and have contributed enormously in that time to the development of the agricultural industry.  They had the advantage of starting from a green field situation.  This term is more than apt in the circumstances.  It was the result of the American aid for Europe <Col N="1663" /> after the 1939-45 war.  Their continuance in the intervening years has depended very much on the money from the Irish taxpayer but nonetheless my information is that the American authorities have, on more than one occasion, expressed satisfaction at the good results brought about by An Foras Talúntais.  I understand they have been very complimentary to them as a research body.</P>
    <P>With our entry into the Community at the beginning of the seventies, An Foras came very much into its own.  For the first time they had the opportunity of advising with regard to the best methods of agricultural production in a climate in which our producers were no longer depending, for practical purposes, on a single market for their output, a market which has all the disadvantages of a policy of lower prices.  Our entry into the Community at that time opened up new horizons and played a major role in the subsequent development that took place in the agricultural industry.  Within European agriculture, at the various contact levels and at Community level, between the research authorities of the member states, I know that An Foras Talúntais have had a very good name and a very good reputation.</P>
    <P>ACOT are a much younger body than An Foras Talúntais.  Nevertheless in the time since they were established they have been making progress in streamlining the 27 independent advisory services which they had to take over.  The merging of these more or less independent authorities was not an easy task but great credit is due to the governing body, the director and the other officers of ACOT for the work they have done over that period.  The time has now come for change and I can see great advantages in the merger of these two bodies.  Hard work will be needed to make the merger effective but there is no reason, given the application of common sense, that it should not be achieved without any difficulty and with subsequent great benefit to the most important of industries in this country.</P>
    <P>Research and advice are very much <Col N="1664" /> complementary activities.  On the question of whether they should be operated independently of one another I am sure we can learn from the experiences in other states in the Community.  The main objective is that good practical research should be done in a way that takes account of such considerations as the climatic conditions and the whole question of the location of the growing of crops in different parts of the country as well as everything else that affects agricultural production, especially having regard to modern developments in livestock and in crop production.  The changes now being brought about under the agricultural policy of the European Communities make it all the more necessary that research work should be to the fore and should take account of the economic conditions which are bringing about the changes within the Community.</P>
    <P>To take an example, the policy of set aside now being adopted is a completely new one for the Community and certainly for this country.  What its effects will be we will only have to wait and see.  How it will affect production either directly in this country or through the changing market situations we do not know but there is undoubted need for research institutions to take account of the new set of circumstances that the set-aside policy will bring.  The important thing is that there should be a research institution and that the benefits and findings of that institution on various aspects of agricultural production be brought as quickly as possible to the notice of those who are involved in primary production within the industry.  This does not mean that there is not already a well-grounded body of knowledge which does not change from year to year or over longer periods.  Production methods change.  They have changed dramatically in the past number of years and I am sure will continue to change in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is a need now more than even before to think in terms of what is required in the marketplace.  The philosophy of starting in the marketplace and identifying the needs and the discerning attitudes of the consumers, who <Col N="1665" /> at the end of the day determine what should and should not be produced and, more importantly, how it should be packaged and presented is very important and will play a very important role in the overall operation of the new body.  There is consensus that the attention to marketing and to detail in this area will be vitally important in the future.  We have a job to do, to change the marketing of our agricultural produce.  For various reasons our marketing techniques are not the best and we are setting out to change that.  The quicker we can achieve our objective the better it will be for the overall well-being of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The particular method which the Government have now chosen in regard to research and advice is this merger.  It is not the only method by which the service could be provided for the agricultural industry.  Perhaps if we never had US assistance in the first place, research in agriculture would have continued under the control, partly of the universities and partly of the Department of Agriculture, now the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There is no reason that a system of part university and part departmental control could not have been quite successful. Similarly, the Department could have the advisory services under their direct control.  At the time when the county committees of agriculture were active, each county being independent, the Department had a very important input into the work of the committees but these times are past and indeed the changeover to the single national advisory service, brought about through the establishment of ACOT, was very much overdue.  It is not entirely a matter of who controls research and who gives the advice that is important.  The important thing is that research is thoroughly done and that, in the carrying out of it, regard is given to the practical aspects of the marketplace in which the farmer must find an outlet for his goods.</P>
    <P>Given the conditions that existed last year on our coming into office, given the need for severe financial cutbacks <Col N="1666" /> in order to put the country on an even keel and to put away the very dangerous situation of financial upheaval into which we were running, there was no option but to do what is being done and to announce the bringing together of the two organisations.  Naturally enough, such mergers provoke fear in the minds of the individuals who are affected by the changes but the Government have dealt fairly with the situation as they have found it.  The main job now is to have the legislation passed as quickly as possible and to have the new organisation established without delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill also takes the very practical attitude of proposing that Teagasc can make charges for their services.  Such charges serve to impose a certain amount of discipline on the day to day workings of the new body.  They also provide a very necessary means of additional finance.  I do not think it would be good to continue indefinitely providing, entirely at State expense, for research and advice in agriculture. To cover the cost by the public purse on an on-going basis would result in a certain lack of appreciation of the importance of research and advice.</P>
    <P>An industry as important as agriculture must, over time, become more dependent on its own resources. While research activities continue to demand large scale subvention by the State, I am persuaded that the time will come when the people advising farmers with regard to particular aspects of production or the management of their farms, will be drawn from independent advisers who will not be looking to the State for employment but who, as with people in other professions, will be available at a charge for people who need and value their services.</P>
    <P>While settling the needs of today through legislation, developments are likely to be made over a period and we must prepare our minds for these changes while leaving over for an appropriate time the bringing in of legislation which will give them effect.  Very often these changes will themselves become common and well on the way to being established. This is perhaps looking too much to the <Col N="1667" /> future.  I will return to the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>A little of what I have said was foreshadowed in the arrangements made in legislation passed in 1987 in regard to charges by the advisory services for visits and consultations with farmers.  In the course of the debate up to now there was a lot of harking back to the old days. There was a time when there was a far greater number of farmers than there are at present but times are changing. Whether we like it or not, social and economic change, and particularly in this country the influence of membership of the EC, are bringing about great changes in the number of whole-time farmers.</P>
    <P>In 1987 ACOT advisers made a total of 150,000 visits to 60,000 farmers.  Deputies may wonder why the number of farmers was so small.  The low number suggests that a large percentage of farmers, perhaps because they are part-time farmers or maybe they are at the upper end of the scale and from experience they have very efficient operations, do not require the services.  Some farmers may already have the necessary training and advice which has enabled them to operate without calling on ACOT advisers as frequently as before.  Undoubtedly, the fall in the total number of farmers and the concentration of ACOT activity on farms with development potential has been a factor.  These are facts we have to face today.</P>
    <P>We should not try to judge what is needed this year or over the next decade on the way the advisory services were managed 30, 20 or even ten years ago. The advisory services are endeavouring to use the time of the specialist advisers more effectively and economically. Through the modest charging system farmers are being encouraged to come to the ACOT advisers' office when the problem does not need any examination on the farm itself.  Of course, there are times when farm visits are essential and these are still being carried out.</P>
    <P>The advisory services are also encouraging the giving of advice to groups of farmers.  This is a very good idea.  In the <Col N="1668" /> disadvantaged area if a farmer pays a modest initial sum of £20 a year he is free of other charges for that year.  I do not want to spend time going into detail about amounts of charges.  I am endeavouring to make the point that comparing the old with the new is not the best way of judging the position.  If we take the 60,000 farms visited in 1987 and add another 20,000 we would arrive at a figure of approximately 150 farmers for each ACOT adviser.  I do not think anyone could complain that this figure is ungenerous as regards availability of personnel and advice.</P>
    <P>I now come to my own area of responsibility, horticulture.  This legislation has very clear responsibilities for horticulture. Over the years very good work at research and advisory level has been done by the organisations which are being brought together under this Bill.  There have been some outstanding cases where the work of the organisations has been taken up with enthusiasm and enterprise with great results.  I particularly mention what has happened in the mushroom industry which has gone from strength to strength and can be held up as a very good example of the sort of development we would like to see taking place in other areas of agriculture.  It started virtually from a green field and has the added advantage of having a very strong export orientation in its make-up.  The fact that it is labour intensive, and is not as demanding on capital as other enterprises, clearly indicates that the concentration of attention in this area will be important.  We in the Office of Horticulture are endeavouring to give it that attention.  I am glad to say that such places as Monaghan Mushrooms and Carbury Mushrooms in Kildare are doing tremendous work and it is very gratifying to see that they are looking around for new growers all the time.  This augurs very well for the overall development of horticulture.  From time to time we in this House complain bitterly about the quality of produce but our mushroom production started from a very high base and there has been all-round satisfaction with the quality of the product.</P>
    <P>In horticulture generally, various <Col N="1669" /> areas have been clearly identified where there is an import substitution potential. We are actively tackling these areas.  We reckon we could import substitute to the tune of around £50 million per annum and generate new exports to the value of another £20 million.  Bearing in mind that this activity is labour intensive and that we have such a difficult problem with employment, it is important that we give the emphasis that is required in this area, and it is our intention to do that.  It will take time to come to terms with some of the problems facing us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons mentioned the difficulties facing potato producers.  Potato production has been the Achilles heel of the agricultural industry.  We have either a feast or a famine.  The 1987 crop has left us with an over supply which has resulted in very low prices.  The cost of growing an acre of potatoes can be in excess of £1,000.  One can clearly see the need to pay an adequate price to encourage people to make the capital investment needed in the areas of storage, grading and packing facilities.  I hope in the immediate years ahead those people who are fully committed to potato growing will see the need to make that capital investment and will immediately examine the grant schemes available.  We have identified that there is a need for an £8 million investment in this area.  I am convinced that if we are to come to terms with the erratic supply of potatoes and get the production base on certain footing it is very important that we make that investment in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to the fact that we had a potato promotion fortnight which commenced last Monday.  We are more than anxious to ensure that consumers are aware that there are top quality Irish potatoes available.  As part of that campaign we are endeavouring to change the unsatisfactory perception of Irish potatoes that has prevailed here for too long.  Indeed, on that point, there has been quite an amount of misinformation in circulation about Irish potatoes.  The feeling was that they were unsatisfactorily presented and their quality not dependable.  I say to those producing <Col N="1670" /> potatoes of sub-standard quality that they have no business in the marketplace.  We are endeavouring to change the image and perception of the Irish potato.  It will be by getting a quality product on to the market place, into supermarkets, that we will be able to turn around the volumes of imports here, bearing in mind particularly 1986 when they hit an historically high level.  It will be only by getting the image of the Irish potato right that we will be able to turn around those imports.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient committed people in the industry to do the right thing, that there are sufficient committed people prepared to make the investment needed in storage, handling and on general harvesting equipment to get the industry on a firm footing.  It will be essential that our discerning housewives have a quality product available to them from a home production base.  Also when it is considered that potato production, of its very nature, is labourintensive &mdash; with considerable job creation potential &mdash; then it will be realised that it is essential that it be developed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in horticulture where difficulties have been encountered. I am satisfied that An Bord Glas will be effective in this area.  Unfortunately An Bord Glas &mdash; primarily its membership &mdash; has been the victim of much unfair criticism both inside and outside this House.  The members of the board have willingly indicated their preparedness to put their expertise to work for and on behalf of the horticulture industry.  Therefore it is most unfortunate that people have seen fit to criticise them. There has been reference in the course of a number of contributions to the composition of that board.  There have been insinuations that people were chosen for their political leanings.  I would invite those who voice that criticism to examine the composition of the board, one by one, in order to satisfy themselves that the members are adequately and properly qualified.  I might add that the members of the board were chosen from the different areas of horticulture, people who it <Col N="1671" /> was felt could bring the necessary expertise to bear on their deliberations so as to ensure that correct decisions were taken. I might add that probably the political affiliations of the members of the board cover a fairly wide spectrum of political life here.  I make the point as an aside because there has been too much misinformed criticism.</P>
    <P>I should like to have more time in which to elaborate on the different aspects of horticulture development. When the appropriate legislation is introduced in the House I shall have an opportunity to expound my views to a greater extent.  There is general consensus in the House that what is being proposed in this Bill by the Minister for Agriculture and Food is right for the future of our agricultural industry.  There has been the feeling abroad that the duplication and, in many respects, the lack of co-ordination that has obtained in the area of research and advice must be curtailed; that is not to speak of the obvious necessity to effect savings at a time when the resources needed in many areas are not available to the extent we would like.  That is on account of the economic climate prevailing at present.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the new authority, once established and working on the ground, will expand its activities with the passage of years and will be sufficiently flexible to react to the needs of the time.  As Deputy Hegarty said in the course of his excellent contribution, alternative farm enterprises will be in need of development and the new authority will be able to cater for their needs. There has always been that flexibility in regard to research and advice in this country and we have no reason to believe that that flexibility will not continue once the new authority has been established. I am satisfied that we can get our agricultural industry on a firm footing and on the right road towards progress in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill seek to enact what was proposed in Deputy Mark Clinton's Bill &mdash; the <Col N="1672" /> National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977.  On leaving office in 1977 Deputy Mark Clinton made a public appeal to his successor, Deputy Jim Gibbons, to give the Bill a trial period of three years and, if he found weaknesses in it, to amend it.  If, at the end of three years, it was perceived to be a bad Bill then, he said, by all means it should be scrapped. Despite Deputy Mark Clinton's appeal the Act was repealed without having gone through any trial period.  Indeed it took Fianna Fáil 11 years to realise its merits.  In the meantime worthwhile development in agriculture has been delayed because of that short-sighted decision taken in 1977.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to amalgamate AFT and ACOT and the transfer of the existing functions of those two bodies to a new, single authority.  However, if it is taken to the point at which the services of both those bodies are emasculated completely, I would be totally opposed to any such proposal.  Like previous speakers, I am most concerned about the level of funding of the new authority, its composition and the method of appointment of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister stated that the authority will be responsible for establishing the knowledge base of the most important agricultural and food sector of any European country.  He said also that the changes sought under the provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure that the research and advisory services will serve the technological requirements of the rapidly changing agriculture and food industry up to and beyond the turn of this century. Those are laudable objectives.  However, surely the Minister cannot expect such progress to be made within the limited budget available to the new authority. The block grant of £20 million provided in the Estimates for agricultural research, advisory and education services is totally inadequate, representing a 43.5 per cent reduction on the 1987 provision.  Such a massive cut does not make sense.  If the Minister is serious in what he is proposing he should provide immediately an <Col N="1673" /> additional £20 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate for his Department or, at the latest, when the new board is established.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister indicated that he expected greater financial participation on the part of the farming sector.  Indeed his Minister of State made that point also.  Last year a charge for advisory services was introduced, the minimal charge being £20 per farm visit. Agricultural advisers experienced considerable difficulty in collecting what might appear to be this meagre sum, especially from smaller farmers, those most in need of the service.  If this charge is to be increased along with a reduction in the number of advisers, it will place the advisory services beyond the reach of many smallholders in the west, when the future for that section of the farming community will be very bleak indeed. The advisory service should be targeted towards those people who are the weakest because, as numerous speakers have said in the House, the larger farmer will survive, and has always survived, but it is the small farmer who is going out of business at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects savings to be made in the wages bill through the voluntary redundancy scheme.  It was expected that 1,000 employees of ACOT and AFT would opt for the early retirement scheme.  However, I understand that to date only 350 people have opted for that redundancy package and that a further 120 people are expected to opt for it before the end of the year.  To work within the estimate of £20 million would have required 1,000 redundancies but it now seems certain that even with the 144 to 180 redundancies within ACOT, there will be barely enough money to meet staff pay costs in 1988, that there will be no money for overheads such as heating, light, rent, telephones, transport or agricultural scholarships.  I understand that the financial controllers of AFT and ACOT have to seek multi-cash injections from the Government in order to meet their overheads and to survive.</P>
    <P>At this stage it seems likely that individual employees of AFT and ACOT <Col N="1674" /> may be forcibly redeployed in the Department of Agriculture and Food. This is a genuine concern held by many of the employees.  I should like the Minister to clarify that.  Even though the budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food was cut by 2 per cent it now seems certain that a large number of civil servants will opt for early retirement. The Government might be influenced to suggest filling these vacancies with the surplus staff from AFT and ACOT.  I suggest to the Minister that if savings are made within his Department through the voluntary redundancy scheme, these savings should be transferred to the new authority in order to increase their funding rather than taking people out of ACOT and AFT and putting them, against their will, into the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>As has been said previously, agriculture is still Ireland's biggest industry. It contributes 46 per cent of net exports when raw material imports are taken into account.  For every £100 worth of exports generated by manufacturing industry, £54 is paid for raw material imports and £17 goes out of the country as repatriation of profit.  This leaves £29 behind for the Irish economy.  For every £100 of agricultural exports, raw material imports account for 18 per cent or £18.  There is little or no repatriation of profit.  This leaves over £80 in our economy and it emphasises the importance of agriculture to our economy.  I am sure the Minister has noted the recent article by Tom Arnold, the senior economist in ACOT, on the future of agriculture.  He poses the question: &ldquo;Is agriculture being written off?&rdquo;  To remain competitive Irish farmers must continue to adapt to technological and financial change, to improve efficiency and to increase performance and product quality.  An effective agriculture advisory education and research service is vital.</P>
    <P>This decimation may save money on paper but will cost the economy dearly in the future.  According to ACOT, over 30,000 farmers will lose contact with the advisory service with a loss of £800 output per farm as a result of the recent changes <Col N="1675" /> and cutbacks.  During the past number of years, and this was during the period of the previous Government, the advisory service available to the farming community has been progressively reduced. The farm home advisory service which was set up to help farmers' wives to cope with low incomes has now been done away with.  The horticultural service has been decimated and the poultry and advisory service has been reduced to 16 for the Twenty-six Counties.  Originally, there were at least three to four for each county and at one stage there were over 90 people employed in this service.</P>
    <P>The agricultural advisory service has been reduced over the past few years due to the ban on recruitment.  As I already mentioned, over 144 ACOT staff, many of whom are agricultural advisers, have agreed to take redundancy.  The total ban on recruitment of young graduates means that we in Ireland have an aging service. ADAS, the British advisory service, now employ many of our young agricultural graduates so the British service is receiving free the benefit of our agricultural education system whereas we should be availing of this energy in order to promote the future of our industry.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, the 43 per cent cutback in the ACOT budget will mean that even after the redundancies there will only be sufficient money to meet wages.  There will be no money to pay for overheads such as heating, lighting, rent, transport etc.  A minimum charge of £20 per farm visit was introduced last year. This charge, together with the reduced number of advisers, will put the advisory service out of the reach of the majority of the smallholders in the west of Ireland, the people who are most in need of this service.  This represents a further attack on rural Ireland.  Present EC policy and Government policy discriminates totally against the small family unit in Ireland. Last Friday in this House the President of France advised us that we should protect the family farm unit.  I hope that the Minister heeded what he said but his policy in recent times shows that he does <Col N="1676" /> not have the same advisers as President Mitterrand.</P>
    <P>By the end of the century I believe that we will have witnessed the total eclipse of the small family farmer in rural Ireland.  This will result in major damage to the social fabric and culture of rural Ireland.  Already the smaller farmer is leaving the land in the west of Ireland but our present policies will accelerate this flight from the land.  This reminds me of the total extinction of the cottier class following the famine.  Now we are witnessing the total extinction of the small farming units following EC policy and the policies of the Government.  Indeed, the previous Government can share some of the blame as well as a result of pursuing a certain type of policy.</P>
    <P>The average farm size in Ireland is not large by EC standards.  With quotas imposed on traditional farm enterprises new systems of farming will have to be examined.  Deputy Kirk, the Minister of State, made this point clearly.  Surely the people who should do this are the farm advisers but it is difficult to see this happening when the socio-economic branch of ACOT is now practically non-existent due to Government cutbacks and policy. The loss of many of their best research workers from AFT will leave the advisory service much weaker as they depended on AFT for much of their back-up service. AFT played a very important role in the advisers' work.  At every class, lecture and demonstration I attended which was administered by ACOT, reference always was made to AFT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are satisfied that there is sufficient interest in the potential for establishing a third television channel which would be independent of RTE to warrant offering a franchise for the service and that at the end of the day this is the most effective way of testing demand for such a service. The Government's intentions in this regard are part of their policy for the broadcasting sector of providing opportunities for greater choice of service and plurality of views and opinions, of exploiting new opportunities created by new technologies, of providing greater competition in the broadcasting sector as in the other areas previously confined to the State, and of offsetting the imbalance which arises from the increasing number of external services becoming available here.</P>
      <P>While the proposed new service will undoubtedly have some impact on RTE advertising revenue, I am not so pessimistic as to believe that it will have unduly adverse consequences for RTE, or that it will necessitate the &ldquo;major increases&rdquo; in licence fees which the Deputy fears.</P>

      <P>I take it that no scientific survey or test of the market has been carried out to see whether it could bear another national commercial channel. The Minister is aware, I am sure, that even at present UTV, for instance, draw advertising from the Republic of Ireland and that any further competition for that type of advertising is bound to have an effect on the revenues of RTE. Does he foresee the effect of that being an increase in licence fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not see that arising.  I do not see the major increases referred to in the Deputy's question arising at all.  There has not been an increase in licence fees since 1986.  I believe that RTE will tackle the competition.  They are already responding in a positive way to the potential competition, both in <Col N="1679" /> radio and television.  I have full confidence in the ability of the management and staff of RTE to respond in a positive way.  When the Deputy mentions UTV, that is just one of many stations coming in.  The Government take the view that it is important we offset this imbalance arising from the increasing number of these external services becoming available here through satellite and the other channels.</P>

      <P>Yes, there will be legislation and I have estimates of the figures but they are really not relevant, merely estimates.  The demand for any new product in relation to advertising potential and so forth is more latent than explicit at this time.  While the estimates are there, I am assured by those in the industry that it is more than sufficient to carry a new station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the estimated cost of setting up the proposed new television station, whether it will have a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status with existing cable companies and the new MMDS; and whether the station will pay for this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new television station will be established by private enterprise.  Until applications are invited and proposals received for the franchise, I am not in a position to give any estimate of the costs that will be involved for the successful applicant.</P>
      <P>The station will have a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on cable and MMDS systems and at this stage I do not visualise that the station operator will be required to pay for the facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the fact that the station operator will not have to pay for these facilities conflict with commercial fairness to the bodies distributing the MMDS signal?  Further, can the Minister confirm whether the expansion of the MMDS system that he envisages will mean that fees will have to be paid to the BBC which were not heretofore paid? Will he, in effect, become a collector of money from consumers on behalf of the BBC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the non-payment of royalties to the BBC and ITV networks by the cable companies at the moment is concerned, my understanding <Col N="1681" /> is that negotiations have been proceeding for some time about payment of royalties in advance of any proposal for MMDS.  MMDS is merely a wireless type of cable system.  The introduction or otherwise of MMDS is not relevant as far as the royalties question is concerned. With regard to unfair advantage, RTE, for example, do not pay to be carried on the cable companies and this is the same type of system.  MMDS is the same, except that it is wireless as distinct from cable.  There is no unfair advantage whatsoever. As a matter of fact, a number of the satellite channels that are now being carried are carried free.  One or two of the other channels that were asking to be paid royalties were asking the cable companies to pay them to carry the system, rather than the other way around.  They have now been knocked off by the cable companies &mdash; CNN, for example.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point of non-payment of royalties, can the Minister confirm the truth of reports that the MMDS is a different system in that it involves rebroadcasting and will, therefore, bring to a head the question of payment of royalties in the way that head end systems that pick the programmes out of the air would not?  Would he not, therefore, agree that this will result in the likelihood of payment of royalties having to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want in any way to damage the negotiating position of the cable operators in relation to the dealings with the BBC and independent channels in the UK.  It is a fact that the negotiations are proceeding and, as I understand it, nearing completion in relation to the years that they have been operating without paying royalties.  I do not want to say anything in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention, that they would carry at least 40 per cent. RTE are doing an excellent job at the moment.  In recent years they have increased their percentage of home produced programmes from a very low level to about 45 per cent now.  They are continuing their concentration on this and recognise that in the competitive environment in which they will operate in the future they will need to concentrate more and more on the home production.  That is what the people want; it is where the advertising is and where the numbers are. It is intended that the independent station will commission programmes and that up to 40 per cent of their transmission time would be used for home produced programmes.</P>

Referring to the point which Deputy Richard Bruton made, would that not mean that there would be royalty implications and that payment would have to be made on the basis that it is being transmitted as a rebroadcast signal as distinct from being transmitted in the normal way through the system that exists at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for licences for MMDS will be invited by my Department in accordance with new Statutory Regulations to be made under the Wireless Telegraph Act, 1926.  These regulations are currently at an advanced stage of preparation and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</P>
      <P>The charges which will apply will be a matter for the licensee in the first place and will depend on a range of factors such as the investment involved in each particular system, market size, take-up of subscribers, etc.  The expectation is, however, that charges will be of the order of those currently applying in the more modern and recently built cable systems, about £100 rental per annum.  It is expected that a once-off installation charge of about the same amount will be payable.</P>
      <P>Applications for licences will be invited in accordance with a frequency plan designed to achieve national coverage. Any householder within the licensed service area of an established MMDS transmitter will be able to subscribe to the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In an area where there is not sufficient take-up to make it commercially justifiable for an MMDS licensee, does the Minister envisage that the service will, nonetheless, be provided? Will the charges which he mentioned be standardised across all MMDS providers or does he envisage regional differences in the cost, depending on take-up and difficulties in distributing the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of the State involving itself in the construction of these transmitters.  I am confident, having regard to the interest already shown by the cable companies <Col N="1684" /> and other commercial interests in the announcement I made at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in relation to MMDS, that there will be no difficulty in securing sufficient operators for the system on a countrywide basis.  I do not envisage that there will be geographical variations in relation to the costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that there will be a uniform charge across the country or will it be at the discretion of the licensee?  If there is not a sufficient take-up from subscribers, does the Minister envisage that the service will not be provided or, alternatively, much higher charges being levied on those regions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much more confident about the take-up than the Deputy appears to be.  I have no doubt that there will be national coverage, as that is the intention.  The indications are there already from inquiries to the Department about the commercial opportunities that this new system makes available in the improved business environment as a result of the Government's policies. People are looking for investment opportunities and I am sure this will be taken up on a national basis.  Of course there are variations in cable systems at present on a national basis between Cablelink, Dublin, Cork Communications, and Westward, Limerick.  The same applies to illegal broadcasters who are rebroadcasting. However, I aim to minimise these variations as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a national survey is being carried out on <Col N="1687" /> naturally-occurring radon levels in Irish homes.  Until it is completed it would be premature to speculate on the size and extent of the problem.  I believe that the results of the survey to date, however, show that most homes in Ireland do not have significant radon levels.  Responsibility for such remedial measures, if any, as may be necessary will lie with the Department of the Environment, in consultation with the Nuclear Energy Board, when the final results of the survey have been presented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister confirmed that 20,000 homes are estimated to have radiation levels over 20 times the level permitted from manmade sources, does he consider it appropriate for his Department to set &mdash; as other countries have &mdash; intervention limits where action needs to be taken to deal with this problem?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better to wait for the full report which should be completed by the end of the year.  The figures, so far, show that a small percentage &mdash; about 2 per cent &mdash; of Irish homes appear to have indoor radon levels in excess of the normal figures.  The solution to the problem of radon levels lies with the Minister for the Environment in consultation with the Nuclear Energy Board.  The Department of the Environment will handle identification of particular risk areas and take decisions on appropriate methods of reducing the risks.  The policing of any system introduced will be a matter for that Department who are monitoring the situation while awaiting the final report at the end of the year.  I should like to emphasise that the levels there are not a matter of concern.  I would not want any scare stories going around.</P>

      <P>A review carried out in October 1987 by the Industrial Development Authority of the prospects for establishment of a zinc smelter in Ireland concluded that a smelter would not be a viable undertaking because of low zinc metal prices, unfavourable dollar exchange rate movement and high operational costs.  Outokumpu Oy, the principal shareholder in Tara Mines Limited have recently indicated that they have no plans to establish a zinc smelter in Ireland because they also consider that it would not be a viable project at present. However, they will keep a watching brief on the situation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the whole thrust in relation to our natural resources should be to process them to final products before <Col N="1689" /> export?  Will the Minister agree that for that reason the question of whether a smelter is viable should be viewed from a wider perspective than whether &ldquo;X&rdquo; percentage points of profit can be made? Will the Minister agree that the effects on the Irish economy if we had a processing smelter should be considered and that, therefore, we should take a wider view of the viability of the project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the ideal solution is to have whatever processing possible done on Irish soil but there is a question of economics involved. In 1976-77 there was talk about the construction of a smelter and detailed investigation of the prospects for the establishment of a zinc smelter was carried out by the IDA.  They have looked at it since on a regular basis and as late as October last year indicated that it would not be a viable proposition.  Proposals that have come forward require that the State puts its hand deeply into its pocket and no proposal required State support of less than £80 million at a cost, on the basis of 500 employees in a smelter, of about £160,000 per job.  The matter is subject to constant review.  It would be ideal if we could process here but economically that is not viable at the moment.</P>

    <P>The most recent studies available to me on the coal resources in the Kish Bank Basin are a British Mining Consultants Limited report of 1981 and a Geological <Col N="1691" /> Survey of Ireland report of 1986.  These reports indicated that an extensive programme of exploration and other studies was necessary before conclusions could be reached on whether there are economically exploitable coal reserves in the area.  The data in the reports was made available to interested exploration companies who were invited to apply for prospecting facilities in the area.  One application was received.  The evaluation of this application by my Department is nearing completion.</P>

They have surpassed their original life expectancy, are known to be suffering from technical deterioration and have had a history of accidents.  The Government's view is that these plants no longer meet acceptable safety standards and should be closed down.  We cannot accept experimentation with them in order to keep them in operation even longer.  I have already made the Government's position on the matter clear to Mr. Parkinson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Geological Survey of my Department, which closely monitored operations at the Rossmore underground mine for some years prior to its closure in December 1986, carried out an assessment in early 1987 of prospects for resumption of operations there on a <Col N="1697" /> viable basis.  It was concluded that operating costs would significantly exceed mine revenues even if production was substantially increased with a view to obtaining benefits from economies of scale and that it was most unlikely therefore that further significant coal tonnages could be extracted on an economic basis. The cost/revenue relationship would have deteriorated further since then.</P>
      <P>A proposal has been put to me in broad outline by the ITGWU for substantial assistance to be provided by the State for the resumption of operations at the Rossmore underground mine, and I expect to meet the various parties interested in this matter in the near future.  I would point out, however, that even if it could be shown that additional coal could be extracted on an economic basis, any proposals for State financial support would be more appropriate for consideration by State agencies with a direct function in relation to the funding of industrial development rather than by my Department who have no such funds at their disposal.</P>

      <P>The electricity inter-connector, which was commissioned in 1970, has been out of action since 1975 due to malicious damage on the Northern side of the Border.  The situation is being kept under review, and any opportunity that may arise for restoration of the link will be availed of.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister understands that if this inter-connector existed it would be a very major contributor to a reduction in the price of electricity.  He did not indicate in his reply what attempts are being made to find safe ways of restoring the inter-connector so that it would not be interfered with by the Provos or by those who are doing the blowing up.  Have any new ideas come forward for an inter-connector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the record of attempts to restore the inter-connector is not great.  For example, they have been frustrated by attacks and threats to Northern Ireland electricity workers.  The last attempt made to repair the line was in March 1980 but it was abandoned when further threats were made against the lives of the workers. Therefore, I would not like to say that a further attempt is going to be made to connect it in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if the failure of Tara Mines Limited to pay any royalties to the State has been referred to an arbitrator; if so, if he has yet delivered his report; if, in view of the fact that Tara Mines has now been in operation for ten years and has paid neither tax nor royalties, he intends to seek a revision of the lease under which they operate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement has been reached on the selection of the arbitrator who is to adjudicate on the questions at issue in relation to computation of the company's profits for royalty purposes. The matter has not yet been referred to the arbitrator, however, because certain preparatory aspects require attention, including finalisation of consultations with legal advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of revision of the lease as raised by the Deputy, the <Col N="1701" /> position is that the lease is an agreement binding on both parties and its provisions must be complied with.  The lease provides that matters in dispute must be settled by artibration.</P>
    <P>Taxation matters are outside the scope of the lease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that it is outrageous that for ten years very little tax and no royalties have been paid by this company. Let me correct something which I said earlier in regard to the export of ores. The figure I gave was the value of ore exported but the figure I should have given for the export of zinc was 3.5 million tonnes which is an average of 350,000 tonnes per year and a total value in ten years of £626 million.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is outrageous that this State while not alone losing its ore is not getting any royalties from the company. The Minister has said in his reply that an arbitrator has now been agreed on.  Does this mean that the arbitrator will decide on a figure, rather than on the actual figure which should be given?  Is he saying that the arbitrator will decide what is to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is outside the terms of the agreement which was made with this company which stipulated that the company would have to pay so much in royalties.  If the arbitrator makes a decision that would surely be outside the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the State mining lease held by Tara Mines Limited royalties are payable to the State on the basis of 4.5 per cent of the profits of the company as calculated by the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with the law relating to corporation profits tax as it existed on 6 April 1974.  A number of complex issues arose in the computation of Tara's profits for royalty purposes, such as the question of the carrying forward of trading losses from year to year, allowability of deductions <Col N="1702" /> against profits realised, unrealised, exchange losses, treatment of capital allowances, treatment of interest on Tara's bank loans, and the question on the acceptability of Tara's accounts for some years in dollars rather than in punts. The position of the Revenue Commissioners on all of these matters has been disputed by Tara.  Because of the dispute we have now called for arbitration as stipulated under the particular case.  An arbitrator has at last been agreed and it is now a question of going through the legal procedures.  I agree with the Deputy that this situation is not acceptable and the sooner it is brought to an end the better.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that any possibilities for reducing electricity prices are availed of and in this context my Department keep ESB costs under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that while there was a drop in electricity prices that was made up for in the budget by the placing of 5 per cent VAT on electricity.  Does the Minister agree that the taking of £31 million from the ESB by requesting them to pay off the balance of debt immediately is further adding to the costs of the ESB and thereby preventing a further drop in the price of electricity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all.  In reply to the first point, there will be a net reduction of 5 per cent to most industrial and commercial customers as they can reclaim their VAT payments. As far as the second point is concerned, the £31 million would have to be repaid to the State anyway.</P>

      <P>With a view to clearing the road for resumption of operations, the State mining lease over Ballingarry coalfield, which was formerly held by the receiver of Flare Resources, was made forfeit by me on 6 September last, leaving me free to issue new mining facilities.  I have had a number of companies come forward after that.  One company has now withdrawn and another company are just concluding their arrangements for a start up on one portion of the Ballingarry mines area.  I hope that operations will commence before the summer.  The Deputy will be well aware from his vast knowledge of the area of the complications of land ownership and so on in that area.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether he has demanded of the European Commission under the Euratom Treaty that (a) there be full disclosure of all facts about discharges and incidents at nuclear power plants in the United Kingdom and (b) there be an independent European evaluation of the United Kingdom plans for undersea storage of radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Euratom Treaty do not provide for the notification to the Commission by member states of all incidents and discharges at nuclear power stations.  There is, however, a requirement on member states under the Euratom Directive that any accident involving exposure of the population must be notified as a matter of urgency when the circumstances so require to neighbouring member states and the Commission.  Recognising the importance of early notification of a nuclear accident following the Chernobyl disaster, both the EC and the International Atomic Energy Agency have adopted early notification systems for the rapid exchange of information.</P>
      <P>Apart from Italy, Greece and Luxembourg all other EC states are contracting parties to the Paris Convention for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources.  Under the Convention a format has been adopted whereby nuclear states report on an annual basis to the Secretariat of the Paris Convention information about discharges of radioactive substances to the marine environment.  On a proposal made by Ireland the Paris Commission has established a system for immediate reporting of unplanned discharges into the sea.  We also have an informal bilateral arrangement with the UK that incidents, including unplanned discharges at nuclear installations in the UK are reported to us as they arise.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> With regard to the proposed plans to store nuclear waste in caverns under the Irish Sea, at a meeting I had with Mr. Parkinson, the UK Secretary of State for Energy last September, I was assured by him that no definite proposals for final disposal of such waste in undersea caverns existed but various options were being examined by NIREX, the UK body entrusted with this task.  At the meeting I made it quite clear to Mr. Parkinson that the Government were totally opposed to any proposal to place nuclear waste in caverns under the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Any definite proposals for the disposal of radioactive waste would have to be submitted to the EC Commission for its opinion in compliance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the sos I was making the point that the loss of many of the best research workers from AFT will leave the advisory service much weaker as it depended on AFT for much of its back-up service.  AFT played a very important role in the advisers' work.  At every class, lecture or demonstration that I attended or that was held in the last 30 years, the research work of AFT was referred to.  AFT held courses for advisers regularly.  Both organisations worked hand in hand.  The great changes that have taken place in Irish farming in the last quarter of a century could not have taken place if it had not been for the research done by AFT in the first instance.  It is a very sad day for Ireland that in the interest of political expediency the Government have now decided to dump some of these men on the scrapheap of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reorganisation or amalgamation of these two services is all right with this side of the House provided it leads to greater efficiency and to some financial savings also.  If this is taken to the point where the services are emasculated, and this seems to be the Government's intention, I would have grave reservations about the Bill.  The effect of these unplanned and haphazard cutbacks and the uncertainty created has taken a great toll on the morale of both ACOT and AFT <Col N="1729" /> staff.  The shortage of funds will no doubt lead to the closure of agricultural colleges and research centres.  I would like the Minister to identity the colleges and research centres which are most vulnerable to closure.  Once these colleges or research centres have been closed they will never be re-opened or replaced.</P>

      <P>In the event of colleges of agriculture closing, will they be given equal treatment with other third level institutions?  Has the Minister considered how this will affect the cadre of Irish farmers in the future?  It was emphasised by the Minister of State that there is an urgent need for Ireland to get her rightful share of the EC and US markets in particular. Both are very stable in respect of volume but dynamic in respect of quality and market appeal.  We could easily lose our niche in these markets if we are unable to keep up standards and move with the times in agricultural science because of lack of resources.  This has been pointed out by more than one speaker and it is only right that it should be pointed out.  When we compare the amount we spend on advice and research with other European countries we rank among Third World countries.  We will not hold our place unless money is put into this area.  The Minister has already cut this sum by 43 per cent which is totally unacceptable.  This short term saving will prove to be false economy in the not too distant future and will destroy the agricultural industry, especially in the areas of research and advice.  Money spent on farmers to become self sufficient makes better sense than money spent on income support for farmers, which is the present EC policy.  It has been said that Ireland ranks among Third World countries in relation to expenditure in research and development.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the composition of the board of the new Authority.  I would like the Minister to reply to this, if I could have his attention.</P>

      <P>Very well.  In my view the present board is too small.  The case <Col N="1731" /> has been made that if it were larger it would be unwieldy and would not be as effective.  However, a membership of ten plus a chairman will not be representative of the wide spectrum of agricultural interests.  It will probably be hard on some occasions to even get a quorum because six members will have to be present.</P>
      <P>Compare this board to that in the Clinton Bill, which the Minister does not like to hear mentioned in this House because this Bill is modelled on the Clinton Bill but does not go as far.  The Clinton Bill mentioned 23 members from various agricultural interests and a chairman. The Minister has kept vast powers to himself in nominating the Members of the board.

      <P>The new board should include representatives of marketing, processing production and staff.  The staff of AFT and ACOT are very concerned that there is no mention that they will be represented on the board.  Perhaps the Minister would like to reply to that.  The IFA and the ICMSA have a right to have a representative from each organisation on the board.  Macra na Feirme have a justifiable argument in ensuring that they have membership on the board as they represent the young farmers who are the future of this country.  I was surprised to note that the Minister for Education does not have a nominee on the board. <Col N="1732" /> In the original Bill the Minister for Education had a nominee on the board. Regarding the Clinton board, as set out in the 1977 Bill, one member was to be nominated by the Minister for Education, one member by the Minister for Agriculture, one member from the General Council of the Committees of Agriculture &mdash; which have been disbanded and the remaining members by various agricultural and rural organisations, the staff of the universities and any other institutions providing courses in agriculture. I would be far more comfortable, and I am sure the farming bodies would too, if we had a board like that rather than a board of ten members nominated by the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to nominate these members on their ability rather than on promises made.</P>
      <P>This board should be appointed as soon as possible so that confidence in AFT and ACOT will not be totally undermined, and before any further staff retirements take place.  The first responsibility of the director on the board should be to prepare an objective statement stating the necessary functions to be discharged by the board, because as far as I can see, the functions of this board are not clearly defined in the Bill.  A statement on the staffing and facilities is also very necessary. Most important, we must be told the budget necessary to implement the programme for the Authority for a minimum of five years.  It will need to be a lot more than the £20 million the Minister has allocated if it is to be effective. Staffing and facilities must be determined by the job to be done in the immediate future and over the next five years, and not by the present fiscal rectitude which is being pursued by this Government. The new Authority should have discretion. I appeal to the Minister when reemploying any personnel of ACOT or AFT who may have availed of early retirement due to uncertainty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was disappointed that the farm development service has not been included in the remit of the new Authority.  I asked the Minister a question about the concept of the one-stop shop now so prevalent in industry.  There is a need to develop the one-stop shop concept ensuring more cost-effective utilisation of the scarce support services available to farmers. For example, in north Kerry, ACOT services are provided in Listowel whereas the farm development service is provided in Tralee.  This necessitates a 16 mile drive on the part of farmers perhaps to transmit a file from Listowel to Tralee whereas were they both under the same roof&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A method should be devised of incorporating the work of the farm apprenticeship board within the remit of the new Authority.  There has been mention also of the need to include veterinary research, research on animal diseases and hygiene.  For example, brucellosis was wiped out here on the strength of work done in Moorepark. There was also mention of the testing of fertiliser and foodstuffs, the need for their inclusion in the remit of the new Authority.  We can have fine objectives <Col N="1735" /> on paper but unless the necessary finance is provided for their implementation we will make no headway.  I appeal to the Minister to put sufficient funds at the disposal of this new authority to ensure its success, thereby inspiring confidence, which is non-existent at present, among the farming community.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the name of the new Authority proposed in the Bill &mdash; Teagasc &mdash; which has been generally accepted as being unsuitable.  Perhaps the Minister would consider some alternatives, such as Forbairt which means development or Comhar which means co-operation or another suggested &mdash; AFDA &mdash; the Agricultural Food Development Authority which would be eminently suitable.  It would be better to change the name now rather than at some future date thus causing confusion.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation of AFT and ACOT is acceptable to this side of the House, as it was back in 1977, provided the merger leads to greater efficiency and better use of resources, leading to financial savings, but if that is taken to the point that the services of the two bodies are emasculated then I would have serious reservations. I note that the provisions of section 3 (2) give the Minister absolute power to appoint a chairman and ten ordinary members of the board.  If those provisions remain as drafted then the Bill will be seen as an instrument of the Minister's party policy which would be a very sad ending to the life of two great bodies which took genuine pride in the fact that the advice they gave was independent of political interference or pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most Deputies, I welcome the amalgamation of AFT and ACOT into one single Authority responsible for all research, advisory and training services.  This is mooted at a time when agriculture is at the crossroads, when serious decisions have to be taken, when the future of the family farm is at stake on account of surpluses in traditional products and the curtailment of various areas of production.  There is an urgent need to diversify activities into <Col N="1736" /> other areas of development.  The most compelling need of the new Authority will be to identify unnecessary imports which can be produced at home.  The new Authority might also examine how to reap greatest benefit from the further processing of value-added products and ascertain new areas of production.</P>
      <P>It is a time not only to charter a course for the future but also to look back over events in recent years.  It has to be said that our record in that area since our accession to the EC has been anything but good.  In fact, if one examines it closely one finds it has been dismal.  In spite of the massive subsidies received by way of grants and other payments, and the huge payments made on foot of product intervention, we now have fewer cattle, sheep and pigs than we had when we joined the EC.  In the years leading up to our accession people had great expectations.  Our accession to the EC coincided with my full-time entry into politics.  There was the prediction at that time that our cattle herd would increase from approximately 6 million to 9 million by 1990 and level off at approximately 10 million in future years.  We are also faced with tillage problems.  One of the best ways of keeping our balance of payments deficit under control will be by way of a well organised agricultural products export programme.  Because the import content of agricultural products is so low agricultural exports make an even greater contribution in that direction.</P>
      <P>I hope the new authority will place great emphasis on job potential in the agricultural industry.  There are 62,000 fewer persons employed on the land at present than there were between 1969 and 1979 which was the most important period in our agricultural history.  We should look at the development of our agricultural resources and natural resources generally to provide jobs.  A recent report stated that 90 per cent of our farmland was under pasture but that 80 per cent of it was badly farmed.  This gives an idea of the neglect in the development of this resource.</P>
      <P>I have a crib regarding the ACOT corporate plan which was produced in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> This plan covers the period 1986-90.  It has now practically run half its course. The report deals with practically every aspect of farming &mdash; dairying, cattle, sheep, tillage, horticulture, pigs, education, socio-economics, small enterprise developments and poultry.  It outlines very clearly its objectives and plan of progress.  Now that it has run half its course, this would be an opportune time for the Minister to ascertain from ACOT how far they have gone in achieving their targets at national level.  One of the failures in this country during the past 15 years was that semi-State bodies and Government agencies could announce schemes and promise substantial jobs but at the end of the day those targets might not have been met.  There should be periodic progress reports on any body commissioned to put those plans into operation and if they do not meet their targets they should have to state the reasons.</P>
    <P>One portion of that plan deals with a horticultural development strategy.  It proposes to increase onion production by 400 acres, carrot production by 300 acres, winter cauliflower production by 300 acres, apple production by 2,000 acres and tomatoes and nursery stock production by 40 acres.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the ACOT corporate plan managed to do what no other group ever managed to do &mdash; they zoned the country into three areas, east, south and mid.  They completely disregarded the west and north-east where most small farmers are located.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, does not recognise those borders but I just wanted to give an idea of the thinking in ACOT at that time and why we can be critical of some of the work that was done by them. The Minister is looking at all regions for the implementation of his programme.</P>
    <P>The reason I am so annoyed about this zoning is that ACOT did this despite the spectacular success of the mushroom industry in my constituency.  The people in that region have a record in developing successfully both that industry and the poultry industry.  At the time this zoning was carried out, mushroom enterprises <Col N="1738" /> in other areas were collapsing but the enterprises in my constituency were going from strength to strength. Hundreds of plastic tunnel units are being provided at present so as to increase production. At the time the mushroom industry was being developed in that region, the Minister who is sitting here today was sitting with a different hat in a different ministry and he did great work in ensuring that the ideas those people had would come to fruition by giving aid and assistance to the areas that needed it.  There are other areas this new body should look at very closely.</P>
    <P>Pollution is a problem in my constituency. It is probably the greatest threat facing farmers at present because on the one hand there is an increase in emphasis on tourism and on keeping our waterways and lakes free but on the other hand farmers are faced with convictions for pollution.  There are continual lists of convictions on a weekly basis.  The fines for these convictions are fairly small &mdash; £10, £20 or £50 &mdash; but expenses can cost farmers up to £600 or £800.  This is a crippling blow to some small producers. We have got to remember that the buildings this effluent comes from and the buildings in which farmers keep their cattle were built on the recommendation of advisers and officials not so many years ago when planning laws were not as stringent and when most developments did not require any planning permission. Farmers are now being compelled to provide underground tanks but this will take a lot of advice, assistance and planning so as to ensure that a proper job is done and that we will not be faced in the future with the problem we are currently faced with.  This has come at a time when the surplus money to carry out those works is becoming increasingly scarce.  This is something which has to be tackled.  The recent publication, <i>Farm Buildings In The Countryside</i>, which is published in Northern Ireland is a very good booklet. There has to be a serious campaign carried out so as to ensure that the problem of pollution is solved and will not recur in the future as it has done during the past number of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> The new body will have to apply themselves very quickly to the provision of jobs through the further downstream processing of our products.  We are now faced with the situation where there will probably be no increase in meat production and we will have to make do with the quantity of meat for slaughtering which we have at present.  We can increase our poultry production.  The 1986 report referred to the fact that there was £19 million in poultry imports into this country, £3.8 million of which was processed poultry.  In my constituency there has been very good employment in this sector.  Great progress is being made in new types of foods, cooked and uncooked.  There appears to be an opportunity for further expansion there.  There has been progress in the poultry and pigs area with regard to breeding, food conversion and buildings.  However, in that constituency 12 months ago there were two pig slaughtering factories but one closed because of amalgamation and reorganisation with the western pig processors plant and the second closed because of trading difficulties.  This is one of the prime tradition areas for production of pigs and there now is no slaughtering facility.  Groups like ACOT, the IDA and the Department should get together to remedy the situation and ensure that such production is not be allowed to go to the wall.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the farmers of tomorrow will not be people who survive on sheer endurance and inherited social attitudes.  That is a very important statement.  We hope that the combined forces of the two bodies will use research and knowledge as their yardstick.  Times have changed and we must change with them, as has happened in other countries. Many speakers mentioned representation on the committee.  Whether it be ten, 11 or 20 is immaterial, provided that they are men of knowledge and of courage because it will take courage to work in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Mention also was made of committees of agriculture and I have regrets about them.  The local representatives on those <Col N="1740" /> committees made a substantial contribution. I hope that the new body will take cognisance of the work and assistance given by them.  I hope that such people will have a continued input.  It is very important that this be the case.  Over the past few years I was a member of a committee of agriculture and we were capable of discussing every problem that presented itself and of bringing suitable people along to discuss, for example, private afforestation, drainage programmes, TB eradication.  This was a very important medium for discussions and the local newspapers covered these meetings extensively.  When serious situations were developing, they could be pinpointed and brought to notice.  The committees did good work and I hope that this committee will continue to use the expertise and knowledge of these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned research and cited An Foras's achievement with regard to potatoes by the introduction of new and successful varieties.  Examination of export markets in recent times has shown that there is a market for seed potatoes. Our Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, by his efforts has made a very impressive impact on the thinking behind being self-sufficient in production.  These, efforts combined with improved weather conditions, have substantially reduced exports by 50 per cent.  I hope that the structures which are now being set up by the Minister will have the same result in 1988.  There is an opportunity here for the small farming counties to go into an alternative type of production, especially of seed potatoes.  There is a very lucrative market available and we have the Irish Potato Marketing Board who are only marking time at present when they could be becoming involved in securing markets in other regions.</P>
    <P>I hope that this new body will examine immediately every possible area of activity and ensure particularly that the small family farm, which is the life blood of this country, will have a place in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on what I consider to be a very important Bill, one of the most important to be placed before this House since I became a Member, and I am sure for many years previously.  There is nothing new in the idea.  In fact, it was first mooted when Fine Gael were in Government in 1976, by the then Minister for Agriculture, Mark Clinton. Unfortunately, like many good plans with changes of Government, it was shelved by the incoming Government for political and no other reasons.  That is sad to have to say.  For that reason, people, and farmers in particular, must be very sceptical about politicians who say one thing and do another.</P>
      <P>The difference between the present merger and the proposals made in 1976 is that there was ample funding in 1976. The present merger is being starved of finance.  I ask the Minister if he is serious about the development of agriculture over the next five, ten or 15 years.  We must plan for the next decade and further on.  To starve this body of cash is to make the job of research and instruction wellnigh impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal first with the question of instructors.  Many of these of my own county and constituency I know personally and I have a high regard for them. They are people who are committed, people with a good knowledge who are anxious to help farmers to develop their farms and make the best use of them. These people now have become tax collectors. There is a levy of £7,000 per head on each agricultural instructor that he must bring in.  How can you expect a man to do his job when he is looking over his shoulder to see if he has reached that goal and somebody higher up is waving the big stick?  Is his job then at stake?  Obviously, it is.  The Minister is aware of the number of people who have availed of the redundancy scheme.  Such people are the older members, generally those with most experience, who could pass it on to younger agricultural instructors.  The younger men who are left are totally frustrated. I know that from talking to them. When people are in that position they <Col N="1742" /> cannot give of their best or do the job expected of them.</P>
    <P>What has happened in my county of Cavan?  I hope the Minister has not yet sanctioned the closing of the ACOT county office in Cavan town.  It would do irreparable damage to the whole development of agriculture in that region.  If you have not a head office in your county town you cannot be seen to be serious about promoting agriculture in a rural county, one that is noted for its diversification and development in agriculture. The county offices were bought in 1968 by the old county committees of agriculture for a sum of £6,000 or £7,000 which was a considerable amount at that time.  The proposal now is that there will be no office in Cavan town and that will be moved out to Ballyhaise Agricultural College, four miles from Cavan town, and far removed from farmers in the vast part of the country.  The location in Cavan town was suitable because it was close to the mart which is doing very big business since it opened last year.  It was also close to a very prosperous bacon factory and farmers coming in there with their cattle and pigs could then go down to the agricultural office for firsthand advice.  Likewise, if they came into Cavan town with their families to do business, while the wife and family had other matters to attend to, the farmers could go down to the agricultural office.  Fianna Fáil said before the last election that there was a better way.  Is this the better way?  I can only judge by what is happening in my own area and, sad to relate, that is the story.</P>
    <P>The Government are also closing down the county committees of agriculture.  I have been a member of Cavan county committee of agriculture since 1974 and I know the role the members play.  They came regularly to meetings, made their contribution and were aware of the needs of farmers at grass root level.  The CAO took suggestions on board and, if necessary, resolutions went to the general council of the committees of agriculture. There was feedback from ground level right to the top but, at one stroke, these committees were abolished, which <Col N="1743" /> I regret.  Indeed, there were modifications in more recent times when rural organisations were asked to send in nominees which was a great improvement on the old committees of agriculture. These organisations were represented and had a voice.  The closing down of the county office in Cavan town and the abolition of the committee of agriculture is the death knell of agricultural advice in my county and constituency.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister the importance of agriculture to the economy.  Facts and figures have been given by previous speakers and the simple equation is that for every £100 generated by manufacturing industry, £30 remains in this country.  The other £70 is siphoned off either by imports or by the repatriation of investments from multinationals here.  They are welcome but they are not the key to the success of the economy in getting rid of debt or getting our young people back into meaningful work.  In agriculture, for every £100 generated, £80 remains in this country, two and a half times greater.  Those figures have been teased out and people can stand over them.  Other Deputies quoted them here and obviously they got them from the same source as the IDA.  They are, unquestionably, facts.  Agriculture is the key to our success in urban and rural areas.  Unless we are prepared to make the most of it, we will not succeed.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that people are getting carried away at present in Mayo about traces of gold.  In my own county, in west Cavan, gypsum has been discovered in test drills.  In other areas, a vast amount of money has been spent on drilling deep into the earth to see if there are mineral traces to be explored and exploited.  Yet, the green gold is there for everyone to see and we turn a blind eye to it.  We are the laughing stock of Europe.  We have signed the Single European Act and there is a vast population of over 300 million waiting to be fed with the finest food produce that any country can produce. Why are we not making the most of our <Col N="1744" /> produce?  Is the commitment not there and, if not, why?</P>
    <P>The area of research is very important and it is an ongoing process.  Things and times are changing.  Moorepark is doing sterling work and is internationally recognised. The scientists there are key people whose opinions are sought worldwide. However, some of these people are disillusioned and are pulling out.  They are offered jobs right across Europe and America because their ability is recognised. I visited Moorepark on a number of occasions and a farmer who does not make occasional visits there, either on his own or in a group, will not keep abreast of developments.</P>
    <P>There is another important station in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.  In this instance, a farm which had been totally neglected was taken over by a Mr. Mulqueen who showed what could be done in poor, wet, heavy soil with proper drainage, machinery and the right kind of stock.  He transformed the farm and it is now a showpiece for farmers in Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Monaghan and Cavan.  However, I believe there is a question mark over Ballinamore and I should like the Minister to state, clearly and categorically, that Ballinamore will not be closed.</P>
    <P>Cash on the farms was never as scarce and it amazed me listening to the reports from the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Food taking credit for the increased incomes of farmers over the last 12 months.  Nothing could be further from the truth and it tends to give farmers the opinion that politicians think they are easy prey, to be fobbed off with plausible statements.  The increase in incomes came about as a result of an outstandingly good year coming after two very bad years when farmers' incomes were at an all-time low. Farmers were fortunate that Fine Gael were in Government at that time, that Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture and managed to supply much needed finance for schemes in relation to fodder and meal vouchers to get them over that critical period.  I was not a Member of the House at that time but <Col N="1745" /> I was campaigning for funds for these schemes.</P>
    <P>It leads me to wonder why we are not pushing our case in the EC for the classification from disadvantaged to more severely handicapped areas, which include the remainder of Cavan and Monaghan and the other areas included in an application by the last Government and the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  I have waited 12 months and the Minister cannot accuse me of rushing him.  An announcement was made in August 1986 that the remainder of Cavan and Monaghan would be included in the severely handicapped area.  At that time Fianna Fáil people in my area jumped on my back and wanted to know if that move would take place the following day.  It amazes me that 18 months later with Fianna Fáil in Government, and Deputy O'Kennedy in charge of the Department of Agriculture and Food, there has not been any progress on that application.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign we were told that as soon as Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would have the application processed and would see to it that payments would commence.  We have not heard anything since they were returned to power about the application other than a statement by the Minister that the previous application was faulty. I have no way of verifying that but I doubt if it was, knowing the ability of Deputy Deasy and, in particular, of the former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald.  I understand that the original application has been withdrawn and a watered down version of it has been resubmitted, that dairy cows will not be included and that £375 is the maximum amount farmers can expect.</P>

I have tried in the past 12 <Col N="1746" /> months to get a solid answer to this question but have not succeeded.  The original application was accepted in Brussels and I accept that negotiations would have to take place following the lodging of the application.  Any person who ever went to a fair with a calf is aware that one asks for more than one expects to receive.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, a city man, will accept that that is normal practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair but I am sure he will agree that finance is important for farmers anxious to develop their holdings.  I am indicating how finance can be obtained for development and instruction.  I am indicating how it was possible to obtain maximum payments of up to £980 under the scheme lodged by the previous Government.  We accepted that the old rates would not apply in the new areas.  Is the Minister aware that sums of up to £2,000 have been denied to farmers in Cavan and Monaghan as a result of the delay in processing the new applications?  I hope the Minister will give me a response to that question in the course of his reply to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk quotas are a thorny problem for many farmers but not for those living in the north east.  However, a quota of 25,000 gallons is needed if a small farmer is to be able to rear his family.  Those who have exceeded that quota have to cut back on milk production.  Is it not reasonable to ask the Department to introduce a scheme to encourage those farmers to go into beef?  Should we not give such farmers subsidies to encourage them to do that?  In that way we would be increasing cattle numbers and that is vitally important if we are to get the economy moving again.  It is disappointing to learn <Col N="1747" /> that cattle numbers are reducing rapidly. I do not agree with the decision to pay £20 million to a beef baron to modernise his factories.  That money should have been given to farmers to encourage them to increase the size of their herds.  If we had the stock everything else would fall into place.  Paying that money represented a waste of public funds.  Up to £80 million and £100 million was also mentioned and I wonder if some of that was spent in my county recently on acquisitions? Recent press releases would indicate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <P>I am indicating to Deputy Boylan that he must relate his contribution to the provisions of the Bill.  He will have other opportunities, such as the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food, to deal at length with agriculture. For this debate he must confine himself to what is in the Bill or indicate what he thinks should be in it.  They are the terms of debate that control him and the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>A quota of 25,000 gallons is necesary for small farmers to make their holdings viable.  Under a Government scheme a farmer with a quota under 10,000 receives a concession.  If it is necessary for a farmer in the south to have a quota of 100,000 gallons, how can it be said that a farmer in the north east should be able to get by with a quota of <Col N="1748" /> 10,000 gallons.  That is not feasible.  The Minister should insist on a minimum of 25,000 gallons for farmers.  In the event of their exceeding that quota they should be encouraged to go into beef production.</P>
      <P>Agricultural instructors also deal with pollution.  It is a major problem in my area.  Dozens of farmers have been dragged before the courts to face charges of polluting lakes and so on but the judges have sympathy for their case and have imposed minimal fines of £25 on them. However, the costs incurred in defending such cases run from between £700 to more than £1,000.  It is unfortunate that that is happening.  Farmers are making a great effort to keep their farms tidy and prevent pollution.  Many of them borrow money to carry out improvements but there is a delay of up to 12 months before the grants are paid.  It must be remembered that farmers must pay for the materials, and the contractor, when the work is done.  Finance is the bogey as far as agricultural development is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister should substantially increase the grant for the provision of tanks in an effort to control the discharge of effluent.  Pollution is also affecting tourism in my area.  I ask the Minister to consider that many farmers in my area keep tourists in an effort to improve their income but it will not be possible for them to attract visitors if the lakes and rivers in the area are polluted.  Fishing is a big attraction in our region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also great difficulties in the area of TB eradication.  We must find out why TB is breaking out on farms which have been free of the disease for five or ten years.  Are we carrying out any research as to the cause of TB recurrence? We appear to have a stop-go policy.  When an outbreak occurs the veterinary experts move in and a campaign of testing is carried out until all diseased animals in the area are cleared out, yet we do not seem to be able to find the root cause.  Is the disease being spread by badgers?  Is bad fencing a factor?  I am aware of cases of cattle having been 30-day tested and subsequently contracting <Col N="1749" /> the disease.  The research station at Moorepark should be sufficiently funded to make a break through in relation to this major problem.  Due to the price of cattle and the small compensation available, it is almost impossible for a farmer who has lost his herd through TB to restock.</P>
    <P>Advice must also be available in the area of rabbit production.  A number of instructors have taken a keen interest in promoting this industry but they are not in a position to make their necessary calls on individual farmers to see how they are handling their stock.  A factory in County Monaghan for the processing of rabbit meat has been grant-aided and we believe there is a future for this industry if the necessary advice is made available to young farmers who show an interest in it.  Individual attention is necessary if success is to be achieved but it appears that farmers are being instructed in groups of 20.  A general class on general topics may be in order but each farmer has individual problems.</P>

      <P>The good agricultural instructor wants to keep in contact with the individual farmer and see what is happening on his farm.  This is impossible when dealing with a group.  Agriculture was built up over the years by the farm instructor calling to the farmer and chatting to him and his wife.  When the farmer responded to the advice he received, the instructor would take a keen interest in developments on that farm.  Group therapy is not the way to do it.  If the Minister will not take my word for it, he should talk to the agricultural instructors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from it.  These are young people who are starting up new projects on their fathers' farms.  Not all farm buildings are suitable for rabbit production. The rabbits must not be disturbed and certain temperature levels must be maintained.  It is necessary for the instructors to assess the conditions on each farm.  There are great possibilities in this area, just as there are for mushroom production.  Many people were sceptical when mushroom production began in Monaghan.  They felt that the venture would not succeed and that if a market existed the Dutch and the French would have been supplying it.  Yet there were agricultural instructors who saw a future for this industry, despite the fact that they may not have had the wholehearted support of the Department.  These are the sort of men we want.  They encouraged the farmers who could succeed in this line.  Not every farmer is suited to mushroom or rabbit production but some people have the necessary flair and skill. This can only be judged by visiting the farm and seeing the set up.  Mushroom production is now big business and people are making a very good livelihood from it.  I know men who have handed over their dairy enterprises to their sons and devoted themselves solely to mushroom production.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that we import so many potatoes and I compliment the Minister of State on his attempts to redress the situation.  I do not altogether deride Fianna Fáil.  I see some good points but not many.  I believe Deputy Kirk is doing a good job as Minister of State but I am disappointed with his colleagues, Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Walsh.  They came into office with a high profile as people expected to do a lot for agriculture but I am sorry to say they have failed.  I do not know the reason but they seem to be vying with each other as to who is responsible for what.  It is time we got away from that.  Time is not on our side and if we do not supply the market available to us others will do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> We must make the most of the opportunities by getting our agricultural instructors back on the road and giving them the necessary finance.  We are prepared to put millions into other industries. Why not put it into the one real industry we have?  I know agricultural instructors who are considering accepting the redundancy package and setting up as consultants or working on farm accounts. This is a very serious development.  There is to be a 43 per cent cut this year in the money available to this body and a 50 per cent cut in staff.  I would suggest that increases of 43 per cent and 50 per cent respectively would constitute money well spent and jobs well created.  Such jobs would lead to further jobs.  Agriculture can be a big employer if we give it the opportunity.  It will not come about if the industry is choked for finance.  I think the Minister will agree, although he might not wish to say so here.  He is a man who sees a future for agriculture and knows that the policies are wrong.  I would ask him to spell it out to the Cabinet that agriculture should be given the necessary finance.  The farmers will certainly respond.</P>
    <P>Dairying in Cavan is particularly difficult because of the terrain, the little hills of Breffni with their small farms and laneways.  Nevertheless we have made a success of dairying in Cavan and we can pay the highest prices in the country despite all the obstacles.  If that can be done in a very poor region, what is possible in the south and midlands?  I take Deputy Leonard's point that the country should be divided into regions &mdash; the south, the midlands, the north-east and north-west. The problems in my area are totally different from those in the south.  Instruction in counties Cavan and Monaghan should be geared to small dairy farms and store cattle, as well as the sidelines of rabbit and mushroom production.  The scene in the south is totally different and instruction there should be geared to large-scale dairy farming and tillage.</P>
    <P>These are my ideas but they certainly will not be put into effect in the light <Col N="1752" /> of present cutbacks.  Young people are wondering whether there is a future for them in agriculture.  I have no doubt that there is a good future for them and that many more jobs can be created.  I suppose that the small ten or 15 acre farm will have to be amalgamated with a neighbouring farm to form a viable holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest of respect, I think it may be a little wider than that and including Dublin city and county.  This is an issue which is current and which we as Dáil Deputies should be seen to raise as issues of this nature demand an airing in this House.  This occasion, gives us an opportunity to express points of view on an insidious community evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports in the newspapers have indicated that the Garda Síochána in their investigations into the slashing of tyres on two dozen cars in the Shankill area on Tuesday night last have discovered that it was not the work of organised criminals; certainly it was the work of criminals but they may not have been organised in the sense we have come to appreciate over the past couple of months.  Happily, the Garda Síochána now appear to have under observation the organised criminal gangs who are roving the city.  We will be <Col N="1753" /> all the better when these gangs are placed behind bars, I hope sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the report of the Garda Síochána in Shankill that this was not the work of the so-called organised criminal gangs but rather the work of a couple of local thugs this does not suggest for one moment that the campaign of tyre slashing in the recent past has not been the work of criminal gangs.  My own belief is that it is not mindless vandalism but rather a deliberate and calculated campaign to weaken public support for the custodians of law and security in our country.  It is in all our interests that the Garda Síochána be seen to win this war.  These criminals are cowards.  They must be exposed as being the cowards they are and they must be defeated.</P>
    <P>The litany of events is well known.  Last Friday night at Cowper Downs 90 tyres of cars were cut and in the Dartry, Terenure and Monkstown areas on the same night tyres of 107 cars were slashed.  Again, on the same night car tyres at St. Anne's Golf Club on Bull Island were slashed. On the Saturday night tyres were slashed and windows broken on cars outside the Garda Club on Harrington Street.  On Tuesday night, as I have mentioned, 24 cars were damaged in Shankill.  Effectively, all of this began ten days to two weeks ago when £20,000 worth of damage was done to vehicles at Stackstown Golf Club.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this issue is that I am concerned about where all of this is going to end and when it is going to be brought to an end.  The response I have received from the Shankill area of my constituency, from the constituency generally and from outside it has been extraordinary. As I have said, the community wants the Garda Síochána to win this particular war.  I believe the community will support them to a man and woman to ensure that they win this battle.  At the same time, people feel they are the victims of the continuing tension between the Garda Síochána and well-known criminal gangs and it is for that reason, among many others, that I have raised this issue in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> It is very important that the community be supported on the one hand and that the Garda Síochána be supported on the other.  At the same time the community should be seen to be supporting the Garda Síochána.  I know the Minister will respond that the Garda Síochána cannot and will not be intimidated.  I believe that to be so and that they are a very brave force of men and women serving the best interests of the nation.  The Garda Síochána will not be intimidated and we must ensure that the local comunity will not be intimidated also because of co-operating with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána must be, and will be, strong in their resolve to rout out these criminal elements in the community and in doing so they must be supported and must be seen to be supported by the Government.  In fairness to the Minister he has in his short period of office brought a new confidence to the Garda Síochána. That view is shared throughout the community. That is why I say the Garda Síochána must not lose this war because if they do the rule of law will break down. The rule of law must be protected at all costs, irrespective of the cost of putting more gardaí on the ground in local communities. There has never been a substitute for the garda on foot patrol.  With modern equipment and more cars there appears to be a perception in the public mind that the foot patrol is less evident. I know the Minister is dealing with that problem and I ask him to deal with it with some considerable urgency.</P>
    <P>The other matter which I would like to mention is vital to all of this.  In the recent past a neighbourhood watch scheme has been introduced and I believe it has a vital role to play in tackling the sordid campaign of attempted intimidation. People should immediately report anything suspicious to their local Garda authorities. Unfortunately and inevitably they do so after the crime has been committed by these cowardly elements in our community.  I realise that my colleague, Deputy Barrett, would like to make a contribution to this debate and therefore in a few minutes I will resume my seat so as to allow him to make a contribution.  I <Col N="1755" /> think the individual who spoke on RTE radio yesterday morning from the Shankill area expressed all of our thoughts when he said, and I quote from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Wednesday 2 March 1988:</P>
    <P>If this has been done by organised criminals then I feel we should make it clear that we back the Gardaí and that we will not be intimidated.</P>
    <P>That man did not want to give his name and I certainly can understand that having regard to the kind of intimidation he might be subjected to from these cowards, thugs and criminals.  At the same time I would re-echo his expression of support for the Garda.  While supporting the Garda we are supporting the local community.</P>
    <P>In Shankill there has been some local criticism by a number of councillors about the building of a new Garda station there. I fully suport the building of this new facility for the Garda Síochána.  It has been suggested that it might be too big but as far as I am concerned it cannot be big enough.  I hope that when it is built it will house more gardai than are at present in Shankill.  At the moment the gardai there are in severe difficulty because of the conditions in the station.  The same could be said for the Garda stations in Kill-O-the-Grange and other areas throughout the constituency.</P>
    <P>The Garda are coming to grips with crime but there is some way to go yet. We must ensure that we as Dáil Deputies are not afraid to be seen to be leading public opinion in our resolve to support the Garda.  This is where we have a leadership role.  Dáil Deputies cannot be seen to be funking issues of this nature and we must not be seen to be intimidated.  The Garda are approaching the crime problem properly.  If they have to sit on these criminal gangs for 24 hours a day so be it.  These criminals cannot remain silent for 24 hours a day for 12 months of the year and not make some slip up.</P>
    <P>Criminal gangs are depriving other people of their civil rights and when people whinge and cry about civil rights <Col N="1756" /> for the criminal gangs they should keep that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>To satisfy the formal requirement I know that I am anticipating agreement in the House when I say it agrees to Deputy Andrews dividing his time as indicated.  Deputy Sean Barrett will now have eight minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Andrews for sharing his time with me.  I tried to raise this matter yesterday when I asked the Government for time but that was not possible and my Private Notice Question was disallowed.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister for Justice should get an opportunity to outline the current position in relation to the happenings over the past number of days involving the slashing of tyres and the intimidation of the public.  Will the Minister indicate whether there was any connection between the incident in Shankill and those Deputy Andrews mentioned involving other areas in south County Dublin, because there is a danger that here we can have copycat type vandalism because of the publicity given to these events.  It is important to establish whether this was part of the organised crime being operated in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem is that statistics for the last couple of years have shown that crime is dropping.  However it is alarming to read in the papers about the numbers of armed crimes being committed.  These crimes have involved the use of firearms and knives.  I can imagine the difficulty of the Minister at the Cabinet table when seeking additional resources for the Department.  If the Department of Finance are satisfied that crime is dropping they will want to know why we need more money to support the Garda Síochána.  It would be a pity and it would be foolhardy if we set about solving our economic problems and allowed a situation to develop whereby through lack of resources to the Garda, serious crime were to escalate.  It is vitally important to support the Garda in getting the necessary resources to combat serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> The reason behind the recent happenings are quite obvious.  As a result of the open and constant surveillance by the Garda of well known criminals, there has been a systematic attempt to intimidate both the Garda and the public in the hope that, through public pressure, the Garda will be forced to reduce surveillance on criminals.  One could argue about the wisdom of open surveillance but now is not the time to do that.  I join with Deputy Andrews in saying that it is up to us as public representatives to clearly support the Garda Síochána in their attempts to defeat the criminals and to call on the public not to be intimidated despite their present losses.  For many people struggling to keep a car on the road to come out and find four tyres slashed which will cost up to £200 to replace, is gross intimidation. The criminals hope that through public pressure the Garda might be forced to ease off in the level of surveillance. It is important not to give in to that, to win this war and to ensure that these criminals are eventually put behind bars where they belong so that the ordinary citizen can go about his business without serious threat from criminals.  It is important that the Parliament calls on the public to support the Garda Síochána despite the present intimidation.</P>
    <P>One could ask where were the Garda Síochána when the tyres were slashed.  I am sure the Minister in his reply will give some of that information.  We hear from time to time that there are not sufficient gardaí on the beat and that the public do not see them.  It is vitally important that gardaí should be seen mixing among members of the public.  I note that the Minister has launched community-type policing in a number of areas in Dublin. The sooner we see gardaí on the beat mixing with the community the better. The Garda should support the community and the community should support the Garda.  That leads me to the neighbourhood watch scheme which has been successful.  It arose from co-operation between the public and the Garda and the citizen is seen to be part and parcel of law enforcement.  We all have a duty to inform the local gardaí if we <Col N="1758" /> suspect that a crime is being committed and we should assist them in their efforts.</P>
    <P>There has been quite an alarming increase in the number of reported incidents of armed crime.  On a number of occasions I have asked that the law in this area be changed.  It has been changed in Britain and we should do it here.  It is an offence in Britain to carry a firearm or a knife.  At the moment the Garda have to prove that a person is carrying a knife for a certain purpose.  It should be an automatic offence to carry a dangerous weapon and without very good reason for carrying such a weapon a person should be open to be brought before the courts. We must stamp out the increase in the number of armed crimes.</P>
    <P>The latest things to appear are stun guns which are being openly advertised. These are dangerous things which can cost lives and be used in committing crime.  The sooner we change our laws the better.  I am sure the public would support us in our call for a change in the law to make the carrying of dangerous weapons an offence.  So far as my party are concerned we will be only too pleased to support any legislative changes the Minister may have in this area.  Now is the time to do it and not allow a situation to continue where we all are asked when we attend meetings why we do not do something about the alarming increase in the number of crimes involving use of arms.</P>
    <P>Again I support Deputy Andrews in saying the sooner we have a Garda station in the Shankill area the better.  The conditions under which the Gardaí in that area operate at present are, to say the least, somewhat archaic.  I know money is short, but in this we have to support whoever is acting as Minister for Justice in his attempts to get the necessary resources to defeat crime.  If we have a certain cake to divide, if a certain amount of money is there to be spent on the public services, if we have to find the money somewhere else, so be it, but we cannot through lack of resources allow a position where the Garda Síochána and law enforcement agencies cannot carry out their duties properly.  We will have <Col N="1759" /> to find the money somewhere else and if there are cuts in other areas, so be it, but we cannot allow the criminals to be seen to win this war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Andrews and Deputy Barrett for their general welcome for what I as Minister for Justice and the Garda are doing successfully in combating crime.  For fear there might be any misunderstanding whatsoever from what Deputy Barrett has said, let me put him, the House and the public at large at ease in that there is not &mdash; I emphasise &mdash; an increase in armed raids as has been suggested during this debate by Deputy Barrett.  That is not so.  The reverse is the truth.  Let me say to the Deputy that in 1986 we had the highest ever number of armed raids standing at 685 reported.  In 1987 this was reduced to 574, a decrease of 16 per cent.  Provisional figures available to us for the first couple of months of this year show a 30 per cent decrease in armed raids over the corresponding period last year.  It is important that that be remembered.  It is not good enough to say there appears to be from newspaper reports a big increase in armed raids. That is not so and it is wrong to suggest that it is so.  There is no need for Deputy Barrett or anybody else to be concerned about my ability or lack of ability at the Cabinet table to get the funds necessary for the successful operations of my Vote and my Department.  Let there be no doubt whatever in Deputy Barrett's mind that I am more than capable of doing it, and if the Deputy would only have recourse to the Book of Estimates published a number of months ago he would see how successful I was in maintaining that position over and above every other Department.</P>
      <P>However, I thank him for his goodwill and words of encouragement and his suggestions that if more money is needed he would have no objection whatsoever to my raiding somebody else's till to get that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter refers to incidents of tyre slashing primarily in Shankill.  The Garda <Col N="1760" /> authorities have informed me that the incidents referred to occurred between 10.30 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Tuesday night last.  I understand that in the Sea View Park and Hazelwood areas 25 cars were interfered with and a total of 45 tyres were punctured by a sharp object.  The Garda have commenced an investigation into these crimes, and while matters are at an early stage, the Garda believe that the damage is very likely the work of local vandals and is not related to similar incidents over the last week.</P>
    <P>This incident is one of a number of car tyre slashing incidents in Dublin within the past week.  Deputy Andrews has referred to a number of specific incidents. I am, of course, conscious of the financial loss, inconvenience and distress that such incidents cause to the victims.  I want to assure Deputy Andrews and Deputy Barrett that I share the concern they have expressed here in this regard.</P>
    <P>Expressions of concern are, of course, not enough.  I want to make it crystal clear that crime is regarded by this Government as a major social evil and people quite rightly expect the Government to tackle it and to do absolutely everything possible to combat and reduce it.  If this means tackling head-on ruthless, well-organised criminals then let it be said: this is and will continue to be done for as long as is necessary.  We would be failing in our responsibilities to the law-abiding citizens of this country if we were to even contemplate shirking that responsibility.  It is evident from at least some of the recent events that the new strategies employed by the Garda in recent times are making a marked impact on the criminals' world of big business and big profits.  As far as this Government and the Garda are concerned, life for these ruthless parasites will be made increasingly difficult until such time as they are put where they belong &mdash; behind bars.  I might add that it is evident from the reaction of ordinary people to some recent incidents that they too share the Government's determination in this matter.  Their overwhelming support for the Garda &mdash; even where they have been the object of the bully-boy intimidatory <Col N="1761" /> tactics of these hooligans &mdash; is something for which they are to be highly commended. I want to assure these people that their strength and determination will be more than matched by that of the Government and the Garda in tackling the criminal.  Be certain that the full rigours of the law will apply to those who engage in wanton destruction of property, whatever their motive.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the Garda Síochána can be relied upon to do everything possible to prevent a continuation of this pattern of crime and to apprehend and bring to justice those who are responsible for it.  Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate that it would not be right or proper for me to go into details in relation to a Garda operation or investigation. Indeed, it is my considered opinion that to do so would not be in the best interests of the prevention and detection of serious crime.  I might also add that the fact that certain crimes have been given high profile attention by the media does not constitute a valid reason for my departing from the practice of successive Ministers for Justice of not giving detailed information in relation to Garda operational matters.  In addition, there is the most important consideration that no comment of mine should even appear to be prejudicial to any person in the event of criminal charges arising in connection with the matters being discussed here. Having said that, I want to say that the incidents are being fully investigated by the Garda; that a number of persons have been questioned in connection with them and that technical and other possible evidence is being examined.  In addition, Garda personnel and other resources are being redeployed to deal with the situation as the need arises, and crime prevention <Col N="1762" /> patrols are being stepped up.  I want to emphasise to the Deputies that if any criminal group think, for one moment, that destruction of the type we have seen will affect any Garda operation, they are very much mistaken.  The strategies and methods used by the Garda in the fight against crime are, of course, matters for determination by the Garda authorities but I can safely say that the Garda will not back down when confronted by such brazen activities as we have seen in the past few days.  They have, of course, the full backing of the Government, myself and, I am sure, of all Members of this House, in the fight against the criminal.</P>
    <P>Again I thank Deputy Andrews and Deputy Barrett for their welcome in particular for the foot patrols as they were described by Deputy Andrews, or community policemen, as described by Deputy Barrett.  The intention is that this scheme, which is extremely successful, will be fully operational in urban areas as quickly as possible.  There is a very strong, considered view that this is the best type police effort possible and the public generally welcome the policemen becoming part of the community.  In recent weeks I have had much commendation and support from the general public through my office and representatives in this House urging that many of those gardaí who are involved in other type activities such as desk activities would forsake the desks and become more involved in community police work. This is a matter on which I am sure I will get the full support of all the Members of the House when the matter comes up for further consideration in the near future.</P>

    <P>The ESB does not generate electricity from wind power.  However, my Department has maintained records of costs in relation to five wind turbines which were part of an EC/Department <Col N="1715" /> of Energy Demonstration Project during the period 1984 to 1987.  The average cost of producing a unit of electricity in these cases was 139 pence. It should be emphasised, however, that these were for experimental projects.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that over 100 patients were awaiting treatment at an out-patient clinic in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9 on Thursday, 18 February 1988; and if he will discuss with the chief executive of the hospital the possibility of providing more medical staff for out-patient clinics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the authorities at Beaumont Hospital that their out-patient clinics are arranged so as to minimise the number of patients awaiting examination/treatment at any one time while ensuring that there is always a sufficient number of patients available for examination/treatment by the medical staff.</P>
      <P>The only out-patient clinic which does not have a timetabled arrangement is the warfarin clinic which checks the clotting time of bloods of patients who are on warfarin (a long term medication) and operates on a &ldquo;walk in&rdquo; basis.  Because of the large throughput over a relatively short period it is not felt necessary to have patients timetabled for this clinic. The hospital is, however, monitoring this situation and the arrangement will be changed if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> I am satisfied that the level of medical staff available for outpatient clinics is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>An allocation of £4 million from the national lottery has been recently announced in respect of the operation, by my Department, of a scheme of capital grants in support of local initiative for the provision of community recreational facilities.  The question of grant allocations from this fund is currently receiving attention in my Department.  A small number of grants have been provisionally allocated to date and the Department is at present considering a great number of proposals for grant assistance, including those received from County Wexford.  The only project in County Wexford for which a grant has been sanctioned to date under this scheme is that of Rosslare Development Association, which has been provisionally allocated a grant of £40,000 for 1988 towards the cost of building a community centre at Rosslare.  It is expected that the selection of further projects to be grant-aided will be decided in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amount of £1.9 million for 1988 from the proceeds of the national lottery, has been allocated by the Government to <Col N="1727" /> my Department for the establishment of fourteen local sports centres in various locations throughout the country.  Wexford town is one of these locations and my Department will be discussing the matter with the relevant local authorities at an early date.</P>
    <P>County Wexford has also benefited from non-capital lottery funding through schemes which are administered by the Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee and County Wexford Vocational Education Committee. Details of the 1987 funding allocations in this regard are outlined in the attached statement.  It is expected that allocations for 1988 will be decided upon shortly. Additionally, County Wexford has benefited from funds allocated to sports organisations in respect of coaching, equipment, administration, international competition, etc.  These funds are allocated at national level and a breakdown for each country is not accordingly possible.</P>
