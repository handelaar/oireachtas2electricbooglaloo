    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has any proposals to improve the accuracy and interpretability of national income accounts and their usefulness in economic policy making, in view of consistent reports (details supplied) that these accounts present an inflated picture of the true value to the economy of Irish exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The article referred to by the Deputy examined the impact of high value exports by multinationals on Ireland's merchandise trade account.  In the national accounts the measures of national income and gross national product are compiled according to international standard definitions and take account, on a consistent basis, not only of net merchandise trade but also of the net flows of factor incomes, such as profits and dividends, to the rest of the world. These measures which take full account of both visible and invisible flows with the rest of the world are available for economic policy purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more general basis, the recent <Col N="598" /> report of the National Statistics Board, approved by the Government, recognised the central importance of the national accounts statistics.  A high priority is therefore accorded to the further development of the accounts.  This will include the provision of more detailed sectoral estimates which will further facilitate economic analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the article claimed that approximately 30 per cent of our exports were, to use the term given in the article, phantom in the sense that they represented transshipped goods?  That was without taking any account of the possibility of transfer pricing in view of the lower tax level applying here.  Have the Central Statistics Office any facility for or practice of going behind the figures supplied to them by companies where the magnitude is very large, with a view to re-evaluating them in order to ensure that the figures truly represent the economic added-value within the country, rather than simply the financial profit which the company wish to show within the country for tax purposes?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the possibility does exist in regard to the valuation of company transactions within the same group where goods are imported into this country from a subsidiary of a company in one country and exported from this country to a subsidiary of the same company in another country? The company can put any value they like on the price of the import and that of the export and they will do so in such a fashion as to reduce the value of the import and maximise the value of the export in order to have the maximum profit within this country if the tax level applying here on the company is below that which would apply either in the country from which the goods were imported or the country to which they are exported.  Companies have that facility and have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the functions, authority and powers of the CSO are limited.  However, I would point out to him that trade statistics are compiled and presented in accordance with international guidelines.  They correctly include the high value exports of multinational companies, irrespective of whether or not the related earnings are retained in the economy.  In fact, the scope, coverage and valuation of trade statistics are determined by EC Council Regulations Nos. 1736/75 and 1224/80.  Therefore, fairly comprehensive <Col N="600" /> international guidelines have been laid down in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the transfer pricing mechanism, particularly of multinational companies, has been ignored by the Revenue Commissioners during the past 15 years so as to accommodate those companies and as a result that the export figures have inevitably been distorted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="An Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that at all.  In the main these are highly respected multinational concerns of the highest integrity.  They conform to best international practices and procedures and there is no question in my mind that there is anything of the kind that Deputy Desmond is suggesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in the light of the frequent liquidation of companies to overcome industrial relations or tax problems and the subsequent formation of new companies in the same line of business by the same people, he intends to reform company law to deal with this problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of unscrupulous company operators in liquidating companies owing substantial debts to creditors, including the Revenue, and forming new companies in the same line of business, has been a matter of serious concern.</P>
      <P>The elimination of this problem, commonly known as the &ldquo;Phoenix Syndrome&rdquo;, is one of the more important themes in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  The Deputy will be aware that this Bill, which was presented to Seanad Éireann on 8 May of last year, is on Committee Stage in the Seanad at present.</P>
      <P>The general purpose of the Bill is to strengthen some of the existing provisions of company law and to introduce new measures, the essential objective of which is to eliminate, deter or penalise certain abuses and malpractices which can occur in the management and direction of companies.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this Bill, which will radically reform the existing body of Irish company law, will adequately deal with these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that we have been given assurances that these measures were in train.  Is he satisfied that under the provisions of the Companies (No. 2) Bill that, for instance, the manager director of a firm such as T &amp; C Carpets, who has asserted that he intends to start up again in business under a different name, would be prevented from doing so?  Apparently, <Col N="602" /> because £38,000 was owed to the Revenue Commissioners that company went into liquidation.  The managing director assured the creditors that he would start up in business again and see them okay.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy is covered by one of the objectives of the Company Law Bill, 1987, which is at present under discussion on Committee Stage in the Seanad and the Deputy will have an opportunity when the Bill comes into the Dáil to deal with that matter in detail.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the House has been talking about this problem for a number of years now, at least since the time Deputy Cluskey was Minister, and that this is one of the aspects of company law which needs to be reformed?  Can the Minister indicate whether he will attach urgency to this matter in the implementation of the new Bill which he has in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise.  The Deputy drafted the Bill, therefore he <Col N="603" /> should know.  In any event, that is a separate question.  I do not expect State companies to run away with Revenue moneys.  Does the Deputy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister stated that the provisions of the Companies (No. 2) Bill would also apply to those directors who wish to start up again in similar businesses.  Would the Minister agree that there is a need to go after these directors, particularly as it is smaller companies who are being hit?  Is the Minister taking cognisance of the fact under the new Companies Bill that there is a need to address this problem as much as the overall picture?  Has the Minister any plans in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which has been referred to by the Deputy is very complex.  This Bill runs to about 200 sections and deals with the serious problem of fly-by-night directors who open up new businesses.  There are those who say we have gone overboard in this Bill in stamping out this abuse and claim that we are in some way damaging and stifling enterprise.  A delicate balance needs to be struck but our objective is to stamp out that abuse.  It has given business a bad name, has put small firms out of business, has deprived the Exchequer of moneys due and has led to increased tax for everybody else.  This is an abuse which has to be stamped out and by doing so, from a business point of view, it will restore the good name of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Revenue Commissioners are already a priority creditor in the event of liquidation?  Will he agree that other <Col N="604" /> creditors are just as entitled to protection as the State in the event of liquidation and can he tell us if the provisions of the new Bill will protect other creditors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have introduced a new Part to the Bill, Part IX, deals with the matter the Deputy has referred to whereby a company which finds itself in financial difficulties would have the opportunity to apply to the court to have an examiner appointed and to be given a period of time to see if the particular company could be restructured.  The Revenue would attend the creditors meeting just like everybody else.  One could say that they hold a veto on liquidations but under the new Bill they would be one of a number of creditors and if everybody else is in favour of restructuring and the Revenue are not, the examiner would be able to go back into court and Revenue would not have the veto which they have had up to now. Nevertheless it is the court who would decide what is in the best long-term interest of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the <Col N="605" /> fact that Irish petrol retailers are reported to take a profit margin per gallon of around double the profit rate retained by retailers in Great Britain, he will take any measures to reduce this profit margin and lower the price of petrol to motorists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have no function in regard to the profit margins enjoyed by petrol retailers in Great Britain, I am not in a position to comment on them. However, I can say that margins here have to take account of market structures, retail distribution factors, low throughputs in some areas and exchange rates, etc.  I do not envisage taking any measures to control retailers' margins at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard it as reasonable that the margin of profit for petrol retailers here is double the margin of profit for petrol retailers in Britain?  In Irish pence terms, the margin here is 18p while the margin in Britain is 9p.  Can the Minister tell us whether he has any intention to restrict the margin so as to ensure the Irish motorists get a better deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the margins in Ireland are higher for this reason. In some stations which have a 400,000 gallon to 500,000 gallon throughput, one could legitimately say that the margin is a bit high.  On the other hand, when one looks at the distribution structure nationwide, one finds that many small petrol retailers have to engage in other activities in an endeavour to eke out a living for themselves.  That is the reality of the position as we find it.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not that easy a problem to identify although he will recall that I took 10p a gallon off the multinational oil companies in July last to reinstate some balance in the overall position. Most of the larger petrol stations are owned by the companies themselves.</P>

    <Col N="606" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the reasons the price of petrol at retail outlets here is so high is the feature of gifts given by the companies and the fact that they do not pay VAT on a product they give free, as a gift, this being a more attractive way in which to operate than by means of offering petrol at a lower price?  Would the Minister agree that it is time this whole area was examined with a view to the reduction of the retail price of petrol here?  Would he agree that one possible way of ensuring such a reduction would be by compelling companies to pay VAT on those gifts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Deputy has said and I brought that matter to the notice of the Minister for Finance previously.  It is not an area in respect of which I have any direct function or can take specific action.  In regard to the gifts themselves, I should say that some companies ceased this practice when there was a mandatory price reduction of 10p in July last while others continued to give out such gifts.  That proved the point that there was a margin there.  We are keeping a watchful eye on the position.  Since then, in some regions, individual retailers &mdash; although representing different companies &mdash; have come together to abolish the gift practice.  To a large extent the gifts being offered are not of Irish manufacture and, therefore, are not of great benefit to our economy.  Equally they can affect certain elements of Irish business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is a difficult area to monitor because there are such serious abuses taking place.  Would the Minister say whether he has in place any system of monitoring to ascertain precisely what is happening.  Is the Minister aware that in Dublin city there are two garages of the same name, two Esso garages, with a margin of 1.4p per litre difference in the price of their petrol and that none of the petrol stations has the price per gallon, or even per litre, displayed in a clearly visible manner?  I <Col N="607" /> understood at one stage that retailers must display the price of their petrol in a visual manner.  Is this being monitored by the Minister to ensure that people know the price per gallon or litre before putting £10 worth in their tanks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a requirement and it is being monitored by me.  Nobody keeps a more watchful eye on them than I.  I can assure the Deputy that any requisite action will be taken by me in an endeavour to gain more benefit for the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such proposals. In so far as I have responsibility in this area, I am satisfied that the consumer is afforded a considerable level of protection by the provisions of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which prohibit the giving of a false or misleading indication as to the price or charge for any goods or service.</P>

Will the <Col N="608" /> Minister accept that, in times of very low inflation and stable oil prices, there is not now the justification for an additional fuel surcharge as obtained perhaps a dozen years ago?  Furthermore, would he agree that any action on his part or that of any other member of the Government to reduce the price of package holidays even marginally would be in incentive and boost to our tourist trade?  May I ask the Minister to investigate the matter again?</P>

      <P>I will certainly do that. However, I should say that the insertion of a surcharge in a contract is a civil matter between the two parties to the contract.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to examine it and, if there is any action I can take by way of helping the consumer, I will gladly do so.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter simply because of reports in the press to the effect that there were discrepancies involved.  Would the Minister say whether this is a matter he could have examined once it has been brought to his attention?  The implication is that the statement of financial affairs of the company showed a substantial surplus over liabilities of the order of £4 million to £5 million whereas creditors were being <Col N="609" /> informed that they would get not even a penny out of the liquidation proceedings. Is this a matter the Minister can examine once it has been brought to his attention?</P>

I am not sure whether the Deputy is referring to the report in newspapers in relation to pension funds.  In regard to the protection of pension funds generally I should say that matter is being examined in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare who is also examining that whole area.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems which <Col N="613" /> arose for our export trade from the British seamen's strike will be brought to the attention of the European Commission with a view to ascertaining what, if any, action it might take or what assistance it might offer in a future similar situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that, in the emotive atmosphere which such strikes may evoke, it is not easy to see what useful action the Commission, or any individual Government for that matter, can take when workers decide to withdraw their labour.  The action which a particular Government can take is extremely limited when a strike occurs outside their jurisdiction.  While Governments or other entities may offer to mediate, there is the constant danger that insensitive interference by those not a party to a dispute may turn out to be counter-productive.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the best way to limit the damage to our export trade caused by strikes outside our jurisdiction is to seek to ensure, on all routes affecting us, a range of competing shipping services. This is particularly desirable between Ireland and the UK in view of the importance of our exchanges in trade, commerce and tourism with that country. That is the objective of the Government's plan for the B &amp; I company which aims to enhance its competitiveness and is supported by a guarantee, from the unions concerned, of industrial peace until the end of 1990.</P>

The Minister is probably aware that during the last strike when the CII tried to get a ship at short notice they had problems. There should be some effort made by the Minister's Department to ensure that we <Col N="614" /> have first hand information on the availability of ships.

If you try to charter a vehicle you can create a bigger problem than you have at that time.  These are very sensitive issues and it is not easy to generalise on them.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a recent magazine article which expressed concern at the claims provisioning of some insurance companies operating in this country.  I would like to point out, however, that the figures quoted in that article could be misinterpreted given that they reflect the gross position on claims, <Col N="617" /> that is, before allowance is made for reinsurance recoveries.  Therefore, the increases in the claims provisions referred to do not have a corresponding effect on the companies' net profitability as they are, to a large extent, met by the reinsurers involved.  This is particularly so in so far as the more costly third party injury awards and settlements are concerned.</P>
      <P>Difficulty in claims reserving in the past can be attributed to a number of factors, which in general either no longer apply or are now being taken into account by insurers.  These include high inflation over a number of years, a dramatic increase in claims consciousness and the level of claims awards by juries, and other unforeseen factors outside the control of insurers.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that my Department exercises supervisory control over insurance companies and pays particular attention to claims reserves. The strengthening of provisions in the companies' returns referred to in the article came about in a number of cases following action taken by my Department in their insurance supervisory capacity.  My Department have also been instrumental in the increasing use of independent expertise by insurers in recent years to assist them in estimating their claims liability and in advising on the appropriate premiums to be charged.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government are committed to improve the overall environment in which insurers operate and have already taken action to change our court and legal procedures, including the abolition of juries in personal injuries cases.  Other measures which are in train include the rationalisation of legal representation, the introduction of a pre-trial procedure system with a view to shortening the length of trials and reducing legal costs, and the establishment of a Book of Quantum of Damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that as well as helping to reduce insurance costs, these measures <Col N="618" /> will also provide a greater degree of certainty for insurers in estimating their future claims liability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of juries in personal injury High Court cases is not a panacea for, but is an important step in controlling, insurance claims costs.  The Deputy will appreciate the difficulties in predicting savings arising from a measure which has yet to be enacted and which will facilitate a moderation or a reduction of costs in other legal areas associated with personal injury claims.  However, the Irish Insurance Federation have given a commitment to me that and I quote:</P>
      <P>when the Courts Bill, 1986 is enacted by the Dáil, IIF members will agree to introduce a special no-claim bonus for drivers who have been named on one of their existing motor insurance policies, subject to the following conditions. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The driver must: <Col N="619" /></P>
    <P>&mdash;hold a full driving licence for at least one year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;have been named on the policy for at least two years;</P>
    <P>&mdash;not have had any claims or driving convictions.</P>
    <P>Subject to meeting the foregoing conditions, companies would grant the person involved a special discount equivalent to at least point 1 on their normal bonus scale which in practice would represent a discount of between 10 per cent-20 per cent of the premium which would otherwise be payable. This is a very real and immediate benefit which will be available to young drivers later this year. </P>
    <P>In addition to this specific commitment in relation to young drivers, insurers have stated publicly that whatever general savings accrue as a result of the abolition of juries will be passed on to policy-holders. Even if award levels only cease to spiral and premiums stabilise at current levels, a significant real saving for policyholders will have been achieved. Insurance industry sources have estimated that an overall reduction of at least 10 per cent in insurance premium levels could be the eventual outcome.  These savings will be passed on to policy-holders.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is apparent that already premium levels, particularly in motor insurance have been reducing in recent months as a result of increased competition and in anticipation of the abolition of juries and other Government measures to reduce insurance costs.</P>

      <P>What worries me about the Minister's reply is that it is all very general and vague with respect to what the insurance companies might have been saying for the last two or three years.  The view privately expressed now seems to be different.  Has the Minister or his Department looked at this area and have the Department made any suggestions in <Col N="620" /> relation to areas where they would like to see things happen if the Bill is passed and juries are abolished?  Are there ideas in the Department as to the direction in which insurance companies should go because of this measure being enacted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce are never short of ideas as to what they would like to see happen in the insurance industry.  We are naturally concerned about the level of employers' liability and public liability and we are seriously concerned about the number of young drivers without insurance cover.  All of that contributed to higher claims at the end of the day. We in the Department of Industry and Commerce have let it be known to the insurance companies in no uncertain terms that we are being vigilant with regard to the amounts of money being provided for claims and in relation to solvency.  We are pushing ahead and doing what the Government have committed themselves to in relation to insurance costs.  We want the insurance industry to respond.  It is not very general to say that young drivers' premiums will be coming down between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, or that overall premium levels will come down by at least 10 per cent.  That is being specific.</P>

      <P>Will the savings arising from the abolition of juries be separately identified in the accounts of the companies or in any other way in which a figure could be put on them?  If not, how will the Minister be able to ensure that the savings are passed on to the insured public?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the abolition of juries is only one aspect.  Because court costs were so high many cases were brought to the steps before being settled.  Anybody could calculate exactly what the High Court costs would be in any specific case.  This gave rise to a lot of frivolous claims.  When I <Col N="621" /> talk about the total cost I do not talk only about legal costs, but about engineers' costs, medical costs and doctors and other professional fees.  That whole area is being addressed and the industry will respond to the savings that will accrue from our approach.  Each case has a different set of costs depending on how long the case goes on, so the Deputy cannot ask for specific cost savings in relation to a specific case.</P>

One would imagine that a Government presenting this legislation would have a book full of facts and figures about the impact elsewhere and would generally be able to provide comparative tables enabling the House to judge whether what was being proposed was making any sense.  Is the Minister aware that his colleague, the Minister for Justice, when the Bill was before the House three weeks ago, admitted he had no comparative tables showing the likely impact on the size of awards in cases being decided by a judge alone instead of by a jury?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority, Shannon Development Company Ltd. and Córas Tráchtála that the total amount paid in grants to Irish-owned industry in Ireland in 1986 was approximately £60 million.  In the case of foreign-owned industry in Ireland, the total amount paid in grants was approximately £90 million.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the cost per job sustained in the seven-year period ending 1986 of new overseas industry was £22,550.  The corresponding figure for Irish-owned industry was £26,730.</P>
      <P>Figures in respect of 1987 have not yet been published by the State development agencies, but I understand informally that the indications are that the share of expenditure on indigenous industry <i>visá-vis</i> foreign-owned industry will show an increase over the 1986 figure, a situation in accord with Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the <i>per capita</i> grant to foreign-based industry in Ireland is almost twice the <i>per capita</i> grant to Irish industry, would the Minister agree that indigenous industries are suffering a handicap as a result of the way these grants are paid out?

For too long we have been paying grants and giving grant approvals and this area has been tightened up significantly. There have been reductions in IDA grants and in their day-to-day spending and this clearly shows that they will have to get more for less.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy and I have raised the matter with the insurance company concerned.  They have stated that they do not discriminate or operate a blacklist on the basis of district in providing third party motor cover which is compulsory under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Any additional cover, such as fire and theft, is not compulsory and the company have stated that they are selective as to the scope of cover which they provide in certain urban areas; but if adequate security is provided for a vehicle in any area then such cover would be favourably considered by them.  This selectivity is based on normal underwriting prudence and as the insurance supervisory authority, whose primary responsibility is to ensure that companies are maintaining their solvency margins and reserve requirements, I cannot fault the exercise of such prudence.</P>
      <P>If anyone in any area is refused basic third party insurance by five or more insurance companies, the matter should be referred to the insurance section of my Department for submission to the Declined Cases Committee.  Cover is always available in these cases except in very exceptional circumstances where it is considered that it would be contrary to the public interest to provide insurance. The committee cannot, however, compel insurers to provide anything other than the legally required third party cover.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's broad strategy in relation to industrial development is set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The objective of policy in the manufacturing and international services sector involves the creation of approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years.  This will be facilitated through an improved environment for investment in business arising from the Government's resolute action in tackling the imbalance in the national finances and the specific developmental policies set out in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the publication of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in October 1987, the Government asked the Industrial Development Authority to prepare detailed proposals in line with the programme's objectives and to <Col N="629" /> accommodate IDA's reduced budgetary allocations under the 1988 Estimates. These proposals were subsequently agreed by the Government and details have been set out in two comprehensive IDA brochures published in recent months.</P>
    <P>The key challenge facing IDA over the next three years is to achieve an increased impact in terms of job creation and income generation based on the overall targets set out in the programme while using fewer resources in terms of personnel and finance.  This objective will be pursued by focusing resources more intensively on those companies and sectors which can yield the highest return in terms of employment and income generation and changing the manner in which incentives are deployed to focus more sharply on payment for results and maximising the return on the State's investment.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer grant-in-aid for IDA's general administration and promotion expenses has fallen from approximately £18 million in 1986 to a provision of £13.7 million in 1988, a reduction of almost 23 per cent.  The Exchequer grant-in-aid for capital grants to industry has fallen from £142 million to a provision of £117.6 million over the same period, a reduction of over 17 per cent.  IDA's own building operations budget has fallen from £22 million to a provision of £8 million in 1988, a reduction of nearly two-thirds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the Minister's answer.  Perhaps the Minister would address the question I have asked which is what specifics have the Department of Industry and Commerce decided are to be carried out by the IDA as an industrial policy over the next year and beyond?  The Minister has not addressed that question at all but has dealt in generalities. The Minister has referred to budgets being reduced, but I want to know what are the objectives of the Department in reducing the budgets and how they saw the IDA utilising those <Col N="630" /> budgets and the proposals they got to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what the Deputy is saying because he talks about generalities.  The question was about cost savings or otherwise.  The IDA current budget has fallen from £18 million in 1986 to £13.7 million in 1988. There is nothing general about that.  That is a specific saving and I am sure the Deputy understands that.  The capital budget has come from £142 million in 1986 to £117.6 million over the same period.  There is nothing general about that.  That is specific and the Deputy can see the saving for himself.</P>
      <P>In relation to policy measures, they are stated in the programme and I will send the Deputy a copy if he is short.  They are designed to achieve the following: a reorganisation and simplification of the industrial promotional agencies; the market-oriented and technological development of the indigenous sector as a priority; an acceleration of the shift in State aid from fixed assets to marketing and product development, research and development and upgrading of management; linking of State aid more directly to employment creation which is, in effect, paying for jobs on the ground and not jobs approved; and sector by sector development strategy being carried out.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 22 together.  I understand that, on the basis of information provided by the State industrial promotion agencies, a total of approximately 16,000 jobs were created in manufacturing industry, including international services, in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> specifies as an objective of policy for the manufacturing and international services sectors the creation of 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years, the actual provision accelerating as the programme's policies take effect. In relation to job losses, the programme clearly says that the offsetting trend in job losses in these sectors cannot be foreseen accurately but the more competitive <Col N="632" /> economic climate and the greater attention given to the indigenous sector will make existing jobs more secure.</P>
    <P>In the joint Government-ICTU statement on job creation developments under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> released last Friday, comprehensive details were provided of the progress achieved to date.  As regards the State industrial promotion agencies operating under my aegis, surveys carried out by them estimate that of the order of 4,000 new jobs were created during the first quarter of 1988.  Some 240 project start-ups have been recorded across the overseas, indigenous and small industry sectors during the first quarter of the year and some examples are listed in the joint statement.</P>
    <P>There was a good build-up in the overseas company pipeline in the later part of 1987 and this momentum has been maintained since.  This reflects the new marketing strategy put in place in the Far East, a pick-up in the electronics sector and international services activity in North America and the impact of the new Financial Services Programme.  The IDA have targeted a 20 per cent increase in new job creation by overseas firms over the period of the programme and are confident based on current trends of their ability to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The industrial job creation position has been helped by improved investment confidence as a result of the economic and fiscal measures taken by the Government under the programme and the associated dramatic fall in interest rates and inflation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the overall job creation targets for the manufacturing and international services sectors specified in the programme can be realised.</P>

      <P>Could I prevail on the Minister for a degree of clarity, if not a degree of honesty, in relation to the responses he is giving on this topic?  While the Minister says that 16,000 jobs were created in 1987, surely he must also <Col N="633" /> recognise that 12,000 redundancies took place in the manufacturing sector?  Even if the Government are 100 per cent successful in 1988 in relation to their 20,000 job target, will the Minister accept the figures given recently by the ESRI that at least 13,000 jobs will go this year so that even if they are 100 per cent successful we are only talking about a net job creation of 7,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in regard to job losses was to get to the root of the cause of the jobs being lost.  One of the basic reasons was the uncompetitiveness of Irish industry, the high cost of money, inflation rates and various other factors. The objective of Government policy was to reduce interest rates which it has done by approximately 6.5 percentage points since we came to office.  If one takes into account that the borrowing of the whole business sector in Ireland is approximately £6 billion, for every 1 per cent reduction in interest rates there is a corresponding relief to the whole business sector and the whole investment sector of £60 million.  In effect, we are talking about £360 million and the other half, when it finds its way through, makes it £390 million in relief.  That, in turn, has to make industry more competitive and will provide opportunities for investment.</P>
      <P>In the manufacturing sector alone the borrowings were £1.5 million.  Therefore, any relief in interest rates is a definite improvement which will give people confidence to invest again.  The negative factors that were there and were causing job losses are being gradually taken out of the way.  Already the inflation rate in Ireland is below the average of the EC and that restores a competitive advantage to Irish exports in relation to the UK market, the traditional market for quite a number of Irish companies.  In that regard we can see a slow return back to competitiveness for Irish industry which is a firmer foundation on which to build our industry for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce his views on a recent IDA finding that indigenous Irish firms showed an average profit of only 2.4 per cent of sales, as against 24.9 per cent for overseas firms; if he has satisfied himself that the existing set of incentives <Col N="635" /> is appropriate to achieving an improvement in the profit performance of indigenous firms; and if the IDA have set themselves any qualified targets for improved performance by indigenous firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The profit performance of indigenous Irish firms as shown in the IDA's Irish economy expenditure surveys is disappointing, being equivalent to 2.1 per cent of sales for firms employing over 29 persons in the period 1984-86.  I believe that the reasons for this poor past performance are many and include the unfavourable cost environment over the period in question and the depressed state of the domestic market where these companies still sell 60 per cent of their output.  Weaknesses in management resulting in insufficient attention to product and market development were also contributory factors.</P>
      <P>The reorientation in the industrial incentive programme for the development of the indigenous sector announced earlier this year, involves greater emphasis on new product development and acquisition, a continuation in the move away from support for fixed assets, a switch in grants for operative training to management development and greater support for strategic market-led initiatives by Irish companies.  These changes together with the improved cost environment reflected in lower interest rates, low inflation and reduced public utility charges will further strengthen the competitive position of Irish firms and help to improve profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an increased focus by IDA on indigenous industry in 1988 in line with the priorities in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Deputy will be aware that a new IDA Directorate devoted to the development of internationally competitive Irish companies has been established since the beginning of this year.  The primary objective will be to stimulate an increased volume of <Col N="636" /> significant international development initiatives from existing Irish industry and emerging Irish growth companies.  In this connection, a key focus will be on working intensively with the high potential companies identified during 1987.</P>
    <P>The priority attaching to indigenous industry development will be reflected in an increasing share of the total IDA budget being earmarked for Irish companies and a shift in IDA's personnel and financial resources away from marginal and incremental investments towards substantial development initiatives aimed at achieving significant growth in sales and employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the National Software Centre is being closed down because of cuts in Government funding; if he was consulted in any way <Col N="637" /> before the board of the centre took the decision to recommend closure; and the implications of this for the Government strategy to develop an international services sector here creating 3,000 jobs as outlined in paragraph 28 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Industrial Development Authority to close the National Software Centre, was not due to the reasons suggested in the question.  I am informed that it was based on a number of criteria, including the view that the income of the centre would not be sufficient to sustain its operations.</P>
      <P>I was advised by the Authority of their decision.  There was no requirement that I be consulted in advance.</P>
      <P>In the light of that decision I have been keen to ensure that the provision of services and support by State agencies leaves no gap in the range of aids and assistance needed for the development of the software services sector.  In this connection services from the IDA and CTT will be available to firms in order to fill such gaps but I am concerned also that there should be a clearly identifiable focus for co-ordinating State services for the industry.  To this end I have asked my Department and the Industrial Development Authority to examine the form and organisation of institutional support that will be required for the sector for the future.</P>
      <P>The existing State services for the sector include the full range of incentives available to exporting service companies under the IDA's international services programme.  CTT's export marketing services are also available to the sector and indeed CTT have made organisational arrangements which are specific to the software area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the Government's Trading House initiative is particularly relevant to the export of software by relatively small Irish software firms.  One of the first trading houses to receive a licence from my Department will operate in the software <Col N="638" /> sector thus providing increased export opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that increasingly the investment in the electronics industry is in the software end of the business rather than in the hardware? In view of that, how can he accept that the only national centre of excellence in software, the National Software Centre, is being closed down while the State continues to invest substantial funds in the National Micro Electronics Research Centre which is engaged in the hardware end of the business?  Would he not agree that the State should be giving an equal emphasis in terms of the State support &mdash; if it is to give any support at all &mdash; to the software end as it is giving to the hardware end already each year?</P>

However, it was not in the best interest of anybody to continue the Irish Software Centre, which had its chance with no possibility of becoming viable over the next three years.  In view of the developments in the software centre I have been looking, through CTT, at all the ways and means to make sure that the software sector is fully supported because I see a greater potential for jobs there than in many other sectors.</P>

I would be fearful that in <Col N="717" /> relation to late sittings and trying to get Bills through the House with the degree of urgency being expressed by the Government we will have a recurrence of what happened in relation to the rod licences.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that we have longer sittings, extra days if necessary, to make sure that legislation is properly discussed in the House.</P>

      <P>To conclude, it appears that the Taoiseach does not wish to have a debate in the House on the report made by the Ombudsman which not only deals with the action the Ombudsman is able to take in defence of the ordinary citizen but sets out very clearly the effects of very petty reductions in staff in the overall in that office.  It sets out clearly how the Government have emasculated this one <Col N="718" /> office that provides direct redress for the citizen.  It is very interesting that we have on the record a statement from the Taoiseach saying that he does not want that report discussed.</P>

      <P>When this matter was last before the House about three weeks ago I reported progress, having tried to make the point that even if it could be shown that the change proposed by the Minister and the Government would produce a lower level of awards in personal accident cases, that did not address the question of whether it was a proper change to make in the law.  We are dealing with a system which is embedded in our administration of justice.  It is not an administration of insurance or of personal injuries but an administration of justice. The Minister, the Government and the House will have to be satisfied that whatever takes the place of the existing system will do justice to litigants.  As an individual I am not satisfied but evidently I am in the minority in my party on this question.  The mere fact that the crude level of awards may be lower does not prove anything.  As an insurance premium payer I would rejoice over anything that reduced the level of premiums but if <Col N="727" /> I suddenly found myself in the posture of a plaintiff having been knocked down and injured, say by Deputy McCartan in his hurry to provide competition in the trade of which he is an ornament, and bringing an action for compensation for personal injury, I would be very far from pleased to find that the Dáil had only yesterday enacted a law, the purpose of which was to make sure that the level of my award would be only about 50 per cent of what it would have been last week.</P>
      <P>These are serious questions and we must have sober examination of statistical evidence from other countries, so far as that is available.  I do not mean evidence just from the UK.  We are not at liberty to legislate on a matter like this merely because insurance companies have a sort of hunch that the level of awards would be lower.  We must be convinced that what we are doing will also make for justice.  I am not at all satisfied about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It used to be said the reason awards in Britain were lower than here at a time when the British had made the change &mdash; which now, after the usual decorous interval of a generation and a half we are trotting after them to make with the peak of our caps turned to the back, the usual posture we adopt when imitating British legislation &mdash; was that British judges were usually appointed in their fifties or sixties and were men whose ideas about the value of money had been formed long before the Second World War when a £1 note was a large sum of money, a week's wages for many classes of people in the lower grades of employment.  These judges had not personally kept up with reality.  I must admit there is something in that argument.  Everybody's ideas of the value of money are formed when they are very young.  Personally I cannot rid myself of the notion that a £1 note is a substantial sum of money, even though it will no longer buy a pint of stout.  I cannot get that idea out of my mind and I am not used to the sense of money I hear my children talking about.  Everybody suffers from this.  Is that a reason to go for this system, merely because the insurance <Col N="728" /> companies have a hunch that the crude level of awards will be lower?  Why is it necessarily more just that a man whose ideas about money were formed at a time when mine were should bring those ideas to bear in the assessment of personal injuries awards, rather than ideas formed at the time when, say, Deputy Anne Colley formed her ideas about the value of money?  Where is the justice in preferring the evaluation of £1,000 or £1 million of one generation to the evaluation of another.</P>
    <P>This House has been left very short of material on which to make up its mind about matters like this.  One of my colleagues asked the Minister whether he had any statistical information which could give the House some idea of the probable impact of this change upon the level of awards and the consequential impact on insurance premia.  The Minister did not appear to have the information. If he now has that information to hand, we would be interested to hear it.  An hour ago when the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was answering questions, I asked him, in a supplementary to a question asked by Deputy Mary Harney, whether he or his Department had looked to see whether the level of insurance premiums had fallen in Britain subsequent to the enactment of the law which transferred personal injury actions from juries to single judges.  It should not be much of a job to look as far as Britain because most of our Government operations for the last 65 years have done little else.  It should be second nature.  Surely we might have some idea about whether there was a steep drop, as we are being promised, in the level of insurance premiums when that change was made in the law of our nearest neighbours who have a comparable legal system.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, had no information to offer.  I asked him if he realised that a similar answer had been given by the Minister in front of me a couple of weeks ago under this Bill and he replied rather testily, but I have to admit with some justice, that he could not be expected to know what statistics <Col N="729" /> were or were not relevant to the Department of Justice.  Both these Ministers &mdash; they cannot perpetually throw the hot potato between one another &mdash; are jointly in charge of this area: Deputy Reynolds under his insurance hat and the Minister present, Deputy Collins, under his justice hat.  Neither of them appears to have any concrete information which would enable this House to form any idea about probabilities of the impact of this measure.</P>
    <P>We are now seeing the last stages of a very persistent, well kept up lobbying operation laid on by the insurance companies which has been going on for at least 20 years.  I remember attending meetings under an academic hat on this point in the sixties.  The insurance companies have now had their way.  I suppose there must be something in it for them.  It may be that they are sincere in expecting lower awards but that does not dispose of the question of whether that is just and it does not dispose of the question of whether premiums will, in consequence, be lower.</P>
    <P>By a happy coincidence, a most felicitous chance, Deputy Harney's question to the Minister's colleague, Deputy Reynolds, was answered about an hour ago.  She asked him if he has had any assessments carried out of the impact on insurance costs of the abolition of juries in personal injuries cases.  He said that he had not carried out such assessments. What he did &mdash; I am very interested in this &mdash; was to quote verbatim, indented with inverted commas, a passage from perhaps a letter of comfort from the standing committee of the insurance companies in which a paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>When the Courts Bill, 1986 is enacted by the Dáil, IIF members will agree to introduce a special no-claim bonus for drivers who have been named on one of their existing motor insurance policies, subject to the following conditions.  The driver must:</P>
    <P>&mdash; hold a full driving licence for at least one year;</P>
    <P>&mdash; have been named on the policy for at least two years;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" />&mdash; not have had any claims or driving convictions. </P>
    <P>I would like time to think out my attitude but, at first blush, I am not very happy at this bargaining with the Parliament.  I do not like to see the insurance companies say to the Government or to the Dáil through the Government: &ldquo;If you will do this, we will do that&rdquo;.  I would not mind if it took the form: &ldquo;If you do this, the consequence will be that because there is a causal and evident nexus between the action demanded of the Dáil and the result which will follow outside&rdquo;.  There is no such nexus here because the concession which the insurance companies are here offering has no obvious connection whatsoever with the abolition of juries.  They are going to offer a special no-claim bonus to people on three conditions but all these conditions are ones which point to the reduction of risk.  They are all conditions which, if I fulfil, will demonstrate that I am in a lower than average risk category for my age, my class of power or whatever.  They are offering a special no-claim bonus, which I presume will be an attraction in the eyes of customers, but that no-claim bonus is conditional on things which have nothing to do with the change we are making here today.  Therefore, the representation made to the Minister is not simply a statement of the consequence which will follow from what the Dáil is being urged to do.  It is a promise to offer something by way of a make-weight or a consideration. That is what I am inclined to object to.  It is not proper to bargain with the Dáil, the Government or a Minister in that way.  Either it is right or it is wrong for us to make this change.  We ought not to be hurried into it by reason of the fact that we are being promised something which will enable the Minister to say to young drivers, for example: &ldquo;We have made it easier for you to get insurance&rdquo; when that change has had no connection whatsoever with the change in the system which we are being asked to make today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds also said, in the course of the same answer, that premium levels have been reducing in recent <Col N="731" /> months as a result of increased competition &mdash; I want to emphasise the following words &mdash; in anticipation of the abolition of juries.  That cannot be true.  Naturally, I am not saying that the Minister is telling an untruth but I do not believe that is the reason why insurance premiums have been reducing, if they have been reducing, over recent months. The reason why I believe it cannot be true is that this legislation has been moving through the House at a snail's pace. Almost a complete year has passed since Second Stage of this Bill passed this House in June of last year.  What has happened to the Bill since then?  How could any insurance company be sure what time the Bill will become law?  Even in this House there has been no impressive sign of urgency about it.  It is three weeks since it was discussed in the House and we are only in the middle of Committee Stage.  I know there is pressure of business but I cannot believe that any businessman, let alone an insurance company, would do anything so drastic as an across-the-board reduction in insurance premiums in anticipation of a change which depends on legislation that is moving through these Houses at a snail's pace.  I do not believe that representation, if it was made to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope, when the Minister replies to the contributions on this section, we will firstly hear the statistical and concrete factors on which he is basing an expectation that the level of jury awards will be significantly different from what it is, if he entertains that expectation; secondly, the reasons he feels that the level of insurance premiums will be beneficially affected and, thirdly, if the first is not going to be affected I would like to know how he can be so sure that the second will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to much of the debate on this Bill and I share a great deal of the cynicism of my colleague, who has just spoken, about this Bill and the objectives that the abolition of juries are designed to achieve.  I <Col N="732" /> share some degree of cynicism with other aspects of the proposals put forward by the Minister.  Firstly, I want to deal with the broad issue that arises under the Minister's amendment that we are discussing. It is suggested that if juries are abolished there will be some immediate saving in the area of insurance premiums.  That is the proposition that is being made to this House.  Everyone in this House, in all parties, would agree that the level of insurance premiums, in particular with regard to the main issue that appears to be directing attention, that of premiums for motor cars, is exorbitantly high in a number of areas.</P>
      <P>The level of insurance premiums and the amount payable has no direct connection with juries.  I will make a prediction, as someone who would like to see our courts system radically changed for a variety of reasons, that if and when this Bill is enacted, as appears to be inevitable, it will have absolutely no impact of any nature whatsoever on insurance premiums.  Some members of my party seem to think that it will have a radical impact on insurance premiums.  I would be pleased to be proved wrong but it is my view that it would have absolutely no impact and it is a false issue with regard to the problems of personal injury claims and the issue of insurance.</P>
      <P>The more honest approach to this issue we have had in print from any group associated with the insurance industry is in a statement issued by the Corporation of Insurance Brokers of Ireland.  These are the brokers as opposed to the insurance companies, and the group who are most in a position to carry out an independent assessment of what insurance companies do in their day-to-day dealings with them with regard, not merely to claims for damages but to obtaining insurance quotations for premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lawyers are very familiar with damages claims headings into the courts but they are not too familiar with the quotes when a young, middle-aged or elderly person seeks car insurance.  In a statement issued by the Corporation of Insurance Brokers of Ireland, relating <Col N="733" /> directly to the Courts Bill, 1986, and the abolition of the jury system, they say:</P>
    <P>It is realistic to expect that whereas there may be no immediate reduction in premiums in the short term although stability and consistency in claims settlements should emerge quickly, however, the medium to long term should&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>And I emphasise the word &ldquo;should&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;produce reductions in legal costs as the result of more out of court settlements and perhaps shorter duration of court hearings.</P>
    <P>That sentence needs to be analysed because it comes clear on one thing, that there will be no immediate reduction in premiums as a result of the passing of this legislation.  There is then a wonderful <i>non sequitur.</i> They say that in the medium to long term, there may be more out of court settlements which would reduce legal costs.</P>
    <P>Anyone who practises in the area of civil litigation will know that in many instances properly brought claims on behalf of individuals who have suffered serious personal injuries, not people one might describe as &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; who are making spurious claims, but people who have suffered serious personal injury and who have very valid claims to process, very often they would be anxious to settle their claims.  Most people are intimidated by the idea of having to go to the courts to obtain damages.  Most people would wish to resolve their personal injuries claims without ever having to see a bewigged gentleman or lady in the Four Courts building or without ever having to set foot in the courts.</P>
    <P>The reality is that insurance companies which provide insurance cover to ensure adequate compensation can be paid to people who suffer serious personal injuries, try to limit for their own financial reasons the sums they will pay in respect of injuries.  Many insurance companies will not admit a realistic claim nor will they agree to pay a realistic sum in respect of personal injuries until they are outside the door of the court.  The problem of <Col N="734" /> cases not being settled and people not getting the damages to which they are entitled as a result of suffering serious personal injury is as much a problem created by the insurance companies, because the insurance companies have the facility to settle, but they have something else as well.  They have the financial back-up of major corporations who can afford to litigate as much as they wish. They can use the weight and the financial security of their position to impose on the individual who have very little income and little financial backing a settlement that that persons may not only believe is detrimental to their interests but do not wish to accept, but which they may be forced to accept because they are faced with the danger of incurring legal expenses.</P>
    <P>All this is a problem, but it is not a problem that relates to the existence or abolition of juries.  This problem will be with us whether we abolish juries or not. That is another reality.  For many years the insurance companies have had it in their hands to facilitate the settlement of claims that are justifiably brought for realistic sums before people are outside the door of the court.  The insurance companies should put their house in order in this area.  It is very interesting that the Corporation of the Insurance Brokers of Ireland are telling us that when this Bill is passed there will be no immediate change in premiums.  Very succinctly and very honestly they have set out the position.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing in this Bill epitomises something we do uniquely in this House, something different parties of different political persuasions in Government do uniquely in this House, that is, we look at the problem and realise something needs to be done but instead of engaging in what I would describe as a root and branch reform we tinker with the existing system.  We tread warily but we do not provide the radical solutions that are necessary.  We play around with the system instead of providing the overhaul that is necessary.</P>
    <P>This amendment primarily deals with the abolition of juries in personal injuries <Col N="735" /> claims.  Why do court cases take so long? Why are they so expensive?  Why will they remain so expensive whether or not we have juries?  The reason is that we retain a system we inherited from the British, a system we have not sought to reform and which we have never even examined in a comprehensive way with a view to seeing how it can be radically changed.</P>
    <P>Much of the time of the High Court and the Circuit Court in dealing with injuries claims is spent not so much on how much someone should get for a personal injury they have suffered but on disputes as to liability.  Most of their time is taken up determining whether somebody should be held to have been negligible or not.  If I am seriously injured in a road traffic accident and seek compensation against the driver I ran into, or who ran into me, and he denies liability, there is a court case to determine who was and who was not negligent.</P>
    <P>Equally, there might be a case of alleged medical negligence when someone suffers a serious personal damage as a result of a medical operation in a hospital, and there is no doubt that that person suffered long-term psychological or physiological damage.  The court spends time dealing with whether there is a negligence claim long before it deals with the assessment of damages.</P>
    <P>Instead of tinkering with an antiquated outmoded system that no Irish Government have yet confronted, instead of playing around with juries in this Bill and pretending it will be some sort of a panacea that will resolve our problems that arise due to the expense of litigation when people seek to obtain compensation for personal injuries, the time has come for us to introduce a no-fault system for compensation of damages with no-fault insurance schemes backing it up, similar to that provided in New Zealand and a number of other countries.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am dealing with Amendment No. 1 which deals with damages and personal injuries.  I do not intend to go on at great length about this but it has been generally accepted on all sides of the House that in a sense we have something of a Second Stage debate because we have not dealt with this issue previously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is to try to reduce the costs incurred by those making claims for suffering serious personal injuries.  If you genuinely want to do that, you should introduce the no-fault system of compensation claims.  I believe that will have a far more dramatic effect on reducing costs and ensuring that people receive adequate compensation for personal injuries suffered.  One of the problems of the current system, when insurance companies talk about large payments being ordered by way of damages, is that people who suffer very serious personal injuries are often provided with very large sums of money, around the £200,000 to £400,000 mark, the damages so ordered in these circumstances being designed to ensure that certain minimal comforts are provided for such people and that they are adequately compensated for loss of <Col N="737" /> income and other losses as a result of the injuries incurred.</P>
      <P>What happens on occasions to those who have suffered the terrible tragedy of serious personal injury and make such claims is that very often due to the tragic accident in which they have been involved, either they do not live long enough, to benefit in any way from the court award or the award made goes on occasions away beyond what is necessary adequately to provide for these people and compensate them in so far as they can be compensated for what they have suffered.</P>
      <P>If we are talking seriously about reducing insurance premiums &mdash; and it is astonishing that the insurance industry here has honed in simply on juries rather than on this aspect &mdash; a totally different system of compensation based on annuity payments and damages for distress which would result in annual income being paid out to the person who suffered the serious personal injury would be a far more radical and realistic reform, providing a modern code of law in this area.  This would, in the context of the insurance industry, to an extent delimit the immediate damage that any insurance claim can make on their resources whilst also ensuring that those who deserve to be properly compensated for suffering serious personal injuries have that compensation made available to them.</P>
      <P>In this context, if we are serious about reforming our laws with regard to personal injuries, providing for a more coherent, a less expensive, a more efficient system of civil justice and at the same time have an anxiety to ensure that adequate compensation is paid to those who suffer serious personal injuries, it is my case that tinkering with the system in this way will not help.  A more radical solution is required.  It is regrettable that neither the Minister for industry and Commerce, nor the Minister for Justice, nor their individual Departments, have given any detailed consideration of any nature to introducing this more radical approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision before us with regard to the abolition of juries and to the rules <Col N="738" /> relating to counsel are based on a perception that our court system is inefficient in the way in which it operates and is unduly expensive.  Generally speaking, I agree that our courts system is inefficient in the way in which it operates.  That is due to the fact that there are too few judges to cope with the amount of litigation coming before the courts.  That means that justice is delayed for those who seek redress from our courts.  I could never logically see any reason that an individual who requires justice from our courts and must go to the High Court to process a personal injuries claim should find it necessary to employ three or four lawyers, all to give him similar advice and act for him in our courts system.</P>
    <P>There is no rational reason for having a solicitor, junior counsel and two senior counsel in any case, unless it is one of the most exceptional gravity and complexity. It is rare, indeed, that there is a case of such exceptional gravity and complexity as to require that amount of legal assistance. What we are doing about this in the context of the Minister's amendment is tinkering with the system.  We are not radically overhauling it in the way that we should.  The radical overhaul required is not one in which the Minister can, by regulation, determine that one can have one or two barristers in one type of case, perhaps three in another and one in yet another.  That is not the way to tackle the matter.  This needs a root and branch reform of the legal profession, not just as regards the number of barristers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That motion deals with the issue of juries and also with the Minister's amendment with regard to the number of barristers who can appear in a case.

      <P>As I was saying, I do not believe the Minister's amendment, which would seek simply to delimit the number of counsel who should appear in a case, deals with this issue in the way in which it should be dealt with.  The need for a root and branch reform of the legal profession stretches across the solicitors' profession and the Bar.  If we want to ensure that people who litigate before our courts can have extended to them, with the minimal amount of expense necessary, a degree of expertise in individual areas of law which ensures that they do not require representation from two, three, four or five lawyers for one court case, the time has come when the Minister and his Department should look seriously at unifying the legal professions. They should allow solicitors and barristers to practice simply as lawyers, to specialise in individual areas, to advertise their individual speciality and allow members of the general public to have direct access to lawyers with regard to their areas of speciality.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why members of the Bar should be hidden away in the Bar Library to which no member of the public can have access unless accompanied by a solicitor.  I will say no more about that issue other than to say to the Minister that, instead of tinkering with the system, a more rational approach would be a root and branch reform of the legal profession to bring that profession out of the 17th century and into the 21st century.  It is remarkable that no such reform has been provided for since the foundation of this State and apparently no such reform is currently envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis that no such approach will be adopted by the Minister a good case could be made for limiting the number of lawyers who represent an individual in any one case and that should make a small contribution towards reducing the expense of court proceedings.  I do not believe the abolition of juries will.  I have absolutely no doubt that that will have no effect at all.  Deputy Kelly was correct in asking who is to say that the individual citizen who goes to our courts looking <Col N="741" /> for justice and who has suffered serious personal injuries would necessarily do any better in front of a judge alone and get a better form of justice in front of a judge alone who makes a damages assessment than would be obtained from a jury?</P>
    <P>In so far as the insurance industry are concerned in respect of the lowering of compensation orders which are made by our courts with regard to damages, it is noteworthy that some of the largest compensation orders have been made by judges without the assistance of juries.  I ask the Minister to indicate whether his Department have examined that issue. Can he indicate to us in reply what amounts have been awarded in each of the past three years when High Court judges have assessed damages and what the particular cases related to?  Can he also indicate how many of those cases were appealed to the Supreme Court and what the Supreme Court's ultimate decision was?  I suspect that the Minister may discover &mdash; and I suspect that the insurance companies are already aware of this &mdash; that some of the highest damages awards have been made by judges sitting alone.  If that is the case, one wonders why the insurance companies want to get rid of juries.  Is it simply that they feel they might be able to read the individual judges better themselves?  An insurance company who knows that a case is going to come before a financially conservative judge could try by way of settlement to escape from paying an adequate sum by way of compensation to someone who has suffered serious personal injuries?</P>
    <P>We hear much about the quirks of our jury system but we hear little about the individual quirks of our individual judges each of whom would have to make assessments under this Bill as to what amount of damages it is appropriate to order.  In theory they would do this on the basis of the specific criteria laid down by law.  The reality is that they would have a broad degree of flexibility in making that decision and their own subjective views of the value of money would greatly impinge on the decisions made. <Col N="742" /> It is equally my prediction that the suggestion that the absence of juries would introduce a greater degree of certainty into damages awards will be proved to be incorrect in practice and that there will be as much a variety of judicial approaches in the area of damages awards as there is in the context of juries.</P>
    <P>The evidence of this can be seen in an entirely different area of our law where Circuit Court judges and High Court judges have to make maintenance orders or awards for the support of dependent wives in family law actions.  We all know in practice that there are some judges who make very generous awards and who take a view that large financial sums are required by a wife to support her and her children and we all know that in practice there are other judges who make extremely conservative awards and that, somewhere in the middle, there are judges who make realistic awards.  That variety of judicial approach, which results in a great deal of uncertainty in that area of our law and which gets no public notice because all of these matters are dealt with in private, will become clear if juries are abolished under this Bill and power is conferred on the Judiciary to make orders with regard to damages.</P>
    <P>The major cost impact in the area of civil litigation &mdash; although I am critical of the number of counsel people have to use and although I would like to see reform in this area &mdash; derives from the fact that a 25 per cent rate of VAT is applicable on all legal fees which are charged to any individual who has to process a court case through our courts.  It is quite ironic that our law in this area currently puts the individual litigant at a considerable disadvantage as against the major corporation or company.  The individual litigant who has to pay a 25 per cent rate of VAT does so out of his or her hard-earned income and has no means of reclaiming that money.  The large corporation which goes to court and litigates can set off the VAT which it pays on legal fees against VAT it may have coming in the context of income and, as a result, the imposition of VAT has no real impact on any court costs it might incur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Perhaps the Minister could say something to us about the role of value-added tax for the personal litigant who has to process a personal injuries claim.  If one wanted to wipe 25 per cent off the cost of litigation overnight, one could do it by abolishing VAT on legal fees.  Therefore, there is a great peculiarity about this debate.  It is equally strange that the insurance companies have not at any stage expressed any worry about the 25 per cent rate of VAT on legal fees which perhaps has resulted in an increase of 25 per cent on the amount they had to pay in costs and legal fees when compensation awards were made against them or when they settled claims.  Is it because they can set that off and it is regarded as a different financial outlay from the rest of the outlay they make?</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is well meant.  I have no doubt the Minister genuinely believes he is doing something which will improve the position of people who have to litigate through our courts.  I have no doubt the Minister genuinely believes it would save them substantial expense and I have no doubt the Minister genuinely believes that in some way the abolition of juries will provide a better litigation system.  I have absolutely no doubt that the Minister means well and I have no doubt that other people in this House who think this Bill will solve all of these problems mean well, but I believe they are wrong and it is clear that the back-up work which should have been done by Government Departments has not been done.</P>
    <P>I think the claims made by the insurance industry are spurious and that the brokers from the corporation of insurance brokers have come clean and said there is going to be no immediate change in premiums.  I believe the claim that judges would provide a better form of justice for people who seek damages for personal injuries than juries do at present is equally spurious.  I suspect that the Minister and his Department cannot respond to the queries Deputy Kelly raised as to what the impact on premiums in Britain was when a similar reform was <Col N="744" /> introduced so many years ago.  I simply say to the Minister that a more radical approach could achieve some of the things which I believe everyone in this House would like to achieve.  The problem in this country is that traditionally we turn our backs against radical approaches.  We tinker and play around with existing systems we inherited on the foundation of this State and that have remained unchanged for centuries.</P>
    <P>There is one final issue &mdash; which arises under amendment No. 1 &mdash; to which I want to draw the Minister's attention, that is an aspect of this Bill I believe to be unconstitutional.  I know it has been suggested that there may be other aspects of the Bill that are unconstitutional, but there is one particular aspect about which I would have grave constitutional doubts. As this House has an obligation to enact legislation which is in conformity with the Constitution it is only correct that I draw this issue to the attention of the Minister. Indeed I would be interested in hearing the view of other Members of the House on this issue.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 1, which proposes the insertion of a new section, in subsection (6), if one takes the linkage between subsections (1) and (6), as I understand the framework the Minister has laid down &mdash; and he can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; taking this amendment with a later one there is first an assumption that the provisions of the Bill will come into force by 1 August 1988.  Let us assume that will happen.  Let us assume this Bill passes through this House, the Seanad, is signed by the President and becomes law.  As I understand the framework of the Bill, there may be a variety of court cases in being; people may have issued High Court plenary summonses seeking claims for damages.  To illustrate my point I will quote subsection (6) of amendment No. 1 which reads:</P>
    <P>Where, as respects an action in relation to which subsection (1) of this section applies, or a question of fact or an issue arising in such an action&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  a notice of trial containing a <Col N="745" /> requirement to have the action, question or issue tried with a jury, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a notice signifying a desire to have the action, question or issued tried with a jury, </P>
    <P>was served or given before the commencement of this Act, the requirement referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection or, as the case may be, the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be disregarded. </P>
    <P>Taking that subsection, the linkage with the rest of section 1 and a later provision of the Bill, it is my understanding that if proceedings have been issued in the High Court claiming personal injuries, if before 1 August next a notice of trial to have the action dealt with by a jury has been served, or if a notice signifying a desire to have the action or question tried by a jury has been served, that person's right to have a jury trial will be preserved as and from 1 August next.  That would mean it would be possible, say, next autumn or early next spring that a number of jury trials will continue to take place although the provisions of this Bill will have come into force.</P>
    <P>It is equally my understanding that the intention is that if a plenary summons, for example, was issued this morning by someone claiming personal injuries, that if no such notice as referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (6) is served before 1 August next, that person will not be entitled to a jury trial and that, as a result, their claim for personal injuries will have to be determined by a judge alone whether they wish that to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister, his Department and indeed other Members may be more familiar with what was known as the Sinn Féin funds case and a number of other cases of a constitutional nature which derive therefrom, which laid down that the Oireachtas cannot interfere, by way of legislation, with existing litigation. That is paraphrasing what that case determined. It seems to me that if I issue proceedings today, making a claim for <Col N="746" /> personal injuries, I do it today under existing law having an entitlement to a jury trial &mdash; and I may only elect out of a jury at some later stage &mdash; the type of administration of justice to which I am entitled includes today an entitlement to have any claim for damages determined by a jury, or I might opt for a judge alone. It would seem to me that legislation enacted that interferes with that right, circumscribes it, which curtails or delimits my entitlement to have a jury trial, or which requires me to opt for a jury trial at an earlier stage in the processing of my proceedings in the High Court than is in my interests is an unwarranted interference by the Oireachtas in existing litigation.</P>
    <P>Whereas it may be constitutionally correct for this House to pass a Bill which abolishes juries, in the context of future court cases commenced after the date of enforcement of the provisions of the Bill, I believe it is constitutionally unsound to pass legislation which, in a sense, provides a cut-off date for opting to have one's case determined by juries in the context of court proceedings that are in being at the time when this legislation is going through this House.  For example, what would be the position if the provisions of this Bill said that after a certain date proceedings commenced in the High Court can be dealt with only by the District Court, and that that applies to all existing, current proceedings that have been issued?  It would seem to me that that would be an unwarranted interference with the jurisdiction of the High Court and existing litigation.</P>
    <P>To take a more extreme example, what would happen if this House passed legislation which said that all High Court cases in being as and from 1 August 1988, which had not been determined, will fall to be determined by a named High Court judge?  It would no longer be a question of the President of the High Court determining who the judge should be but rather it would be a named High Court judge.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister it is my belief that if a constitutional challenge were to be instituted against the provisions of this <Col N="747" /> section, this provision under the new section the Minister is proposing may be held to be constitutionally infirm.  Indeed, it may be the case that if and when this Bill is passed the President may be advised by the Council of State that it should be referred, under Article 26 of the Constitution, to the Supreme Court for a decision as to its constitutionality.  I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say in addressing that aspect of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I deal first with the last point raised by Deputy Shatter. I do not agree with him in relation to the constitutional implications of having a particular date as a cut-off one.  I do not believe there is any constitutional argument which prevents this House from reforming the procedures in the law courts in a general sense.  It is my belief that this proposal is the fairest one because it would be equally arbitrary to start denying one form of trial to people on the basis that their solicitor had or had not served a document on another person or that a writ had or had not issued before a particular date.  If we are going to abolish juries we must do so, carefully, fairly and cleanly.  It must be done by reference to a particular date after which jury trials will no longer apply to a particular class of action.  I do not believe there is any analogy &mdash; other than perhaps a distant one &mdash; binding or having a firm connection between the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the Sinn Féin funds case and a decision by this House to reform the general procedures appertaining to civil litigation of a general class such as a Bill of this type, if enacted, will do.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is that I feel sorry for Deputy Barrett sitting here, as it were, surrounded in the lion's den.  However, I note he now has one ally in Deputy O'Brien, to keep him company while being surrounded by lawyers.  It might raise a cynical eyebrow or two that there are so many lawyers in the House today showing an interest in this matter but, on the other hand, it is a good and healthy sign that they are at least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a view on this matter which is not held by most lawyers.  The present system in regard to injury actions, employer's liability actions, and road traffic accidents, or the great majority of them, whereby juries are the determining tribunal of fact and quantum is not necessarily a good system.  I know that many of my colleagues at the Bar and in the solicitors profession believe there are a number of arguments for keeping juries that have not been adequately stated, but in many senses the arguments against having juries have not been adequately stated.</P>
      <P>The fact, as is undoubtedly the case, that this is done at the instance of the insurance industry has tended to cloud lawyers' judgments of the merits or demerits of the issue which lies at the bottom of it.  I would say in agreement with Deputy Kelly that the bauble, a tinselly little bauble, pathetic in ways, of giving young drivers a temporary relief from exorbitant insurance premiums is somehow a <i>quid pro quo</i> for this legislation is an insult and demeaning to this House.  It is so stupid that we should change the law generally in order to provide a slightly better deal at the instance of some insurance companies for a particular class of young drivers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One is a bribe to this House to do the other.  The people to whom this bribe will be of value will not be the young drivers because in the long run economic forces will determine how they will be treated by insurance companies, and post 1992 it will not matter what the Irish Insurance Federation thought about who should or should not get &ldquo;no claims bonuses&rdquo; or special deals.  It will all fall to be decided by the risk that they as a group represent, and that is the basics of insurance.  A special deal.  &ldquo;Green Shield Stamps&rdquo; of a legislative kind are a bit demeaning for us to fall for.</P>

      <P>We should not listen to the insurance companies going to the Minister and circulating Deputies in this House with demeaning and squalid correspondence to the effect that if we will change the law against plaintiffs, they will undertake not to bring in certain numbers of counsel in cases.  What is their undertaking worth?  Is it part of the law of the land?  Are the Irish Insurance Federation entitled to come to us and say, if you nail down the plaintiff's representation we will guarantee that we will keep down our own representation.  That is not law and it has nothing to do with the legislative process.  It is wheeling and dealing with the Legislature.  It is demeaning.  As I have said it is something which is attractive only to the more superficial political minds, and I exempt the Minister who is defending the wicket on this occasion from that category.  I think it applies to another of his colleagues, a junior colleague, who on occasions has approached this whole matter in a superficial and lighthearted way, with a view to getting cheap headlines.  Although the Bar is not probably one of the most popular institutions, I believe it was shabbily treated by the junior Minister.  They dealt with him honourably and he in his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  Juries were employed much more generally as part of the legal process than they are nowadays. If you look at 19th century and early 20th century law reports you will see that it was commonplace that juries decided what damages the plaintiff should receive in relatively straightforward cases such as goods being substandard. This was got rid of without huge objection, even though it was, to use the classical argument for retaining juries &ldquo;an instance of the ordinary man being involved in justice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In Britain they decided to remove juries from the vast majority of cases but there is still an exceptional power to allow jury trial in personal injury cases. However, in the vast majority of cases they dispensed with the trial of personal injury actions by juries.  I believe that was a sensible decision.  We can chose to what extent we involve juries.  In America, juries award billions of dollars in damages against large oil corporations for abuse of competitive or dominant positions and for fraud and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our jurisdiction we are entitled to take the view that the ordinary run of the mill industrial accident or car crash does not require that 12 people be sworn in and spend day after day listening to very <Col N="751" /> straightforward evidence whether somebody did or did not have a whiplash injury and what they should or should not award for it.  Juries were commonplace in the Circuit Court, and I do not think it dramatically affected the quality of justice coming out of the Circuit Court when juries were abolished in the kind of actions the Circuit Court dealt with.  In all fairness I think to try any litigation arising out of the ordinary personal injuries accident before a jury is an unnecessary formality.</P>
    <P>I appreciate all the arguments that people go away satisfied from a jury verdict, in the sense that they sometimes feel dissatisfied with a judicial verdict.  I appreciate the other argument that quantification of damages is not a legal decision since it involves an ordinary man's view.  I take fully on board what Deputy Kelly has said about the failings and the frailities of judicial quantification of damages, especially as judges become more and more remote from the hurly burly of life and as age catches up on them.  I take all that on board but for the ordinary kind of case that I have seen dealt with in the High Court: fellows injuring their back and putting a disc out, claiming the accident took place at work while they were levering a manhole with the wrong end of a pickaxe and claiming they were not given sufficient keys to lift a manhole cover &mdash; such cases are not necessarily capable only of being dealt with fairly by a jury.  I do not believe they require a jury.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong to erect huge gothic cathedrals of principle on what are really fairly straightforward situations which can and often are determined by a judge alone.  In the case of a car crash where somebody suffers a relatively minor injury such as breaking an arm, we say at present that this is something which can be dealt with by a judge sitting in the Circuit Court but because it is a broken back, the same decision suddenly becomes one which demands a jury because the quantity of damages involved is brought to bear on it.  In a sense it becomes more important.  However it is <Col N="752" /> still a car crash and it is nothing but a car crash.  The quantification of damages in my view does not change qualitatively when it hits some figure like £15,000 or £2,500 as it was some years ago, or even £25,000 were the Labour Party amendment to be taken.  I believe absolutely that relatively straightforward car crashes and industrial accidents do not require the formality, the expense and all the delay that a jury trial necessarily means.</P>
    <P>When you bring in 12 laymen you must go through the matter slowly.  You must go through it in a manner which does not presume any qualities of alertness of mind or capacity to follow technical evidence.  If they are to be 12 ordinary people it must be done on the basis of the lowest common denominator in terms of understanding.  Therefore it must be done slowly and carefully.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is correct in seeking to withdraw the ordinary crash and the ordinary industrial accident from the remit of juries.  The section as proposed by the Minister is undesirable in a number of ways.  First, I do not believe that it should be a blanket rule, because there will be occasions when a jury, as in Britain, available in theory and very rarely availed of in practice, would be an appropriate tribunal to determine some questions of fact and questions of quantification. There are cases, and I have no doubt they are important cases, where a single judge's determination of fact is unacceptable in many respects.  A doctor who is accused of medical negligence by a plaintiff puts his whole career on the line the day he goes into court.  I know the case is in many ways about the plaintiff's cause of action but, in many respects, somebody like a doctor who goes to court brings his career, his professional reputation, his good name, his lifestyle and his livelihood with him into court.</P>
    <P>If a doctor is disbelieved on his oath by a judge on a question of fact and effectively has no redress in relation to getting any appeal on the facts from any other tribunal, it is unacceptable that, as a defendant, he should be effectively put on the sidelines of society by a determination of this kind.  People might say <Col N="753" /> that this is a snobbish attitude and ask why I would not allow an industrial worker who has just had a very serious injury to have his case decided by a jury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When a plaintiff goes to court looking for damages, the onus is on him to prove his case.  A plaintiff goes to court seeking compensation but the defendant in many respects loses more than his money in that he can lose his reputation along with it.  That is the distinction between a plaintiff and a defendant. It may be a subtle distinction but it is a real distinction.</P>
      <P>I would have preferred if the Minister had allowed a jury to be retained in exceptional circumstances, since he is talking about allowing different numbers of counsel in exceptional circumstances. There may be some occasion when it would be more in the interest of justice that a jury should determine a negligence case rather than a judge alone, for instance, a case involving gardaí as potential defendants.  The average plaintiff coming to court for a case where gardaí may or may not have caused a traffic accident would wonder if a judge weigh a garda's evidence against his fairly squarely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In circumstances where the State apparatus is involved as part of litigation, it is desirable that there should be an exceptional right to a trial by jury.  That is an instance where the ordinary man has something extra to bring to a court case, that is, objectivity where it is essentially needed.  There should be an exceptional ground for trial by jury in cases where it should be seen that a judge alone <Col N="754" /> is not making the decision and that the decision is being made independently on the apparatus of the State.  People will ask if we do not expect judges to be objective and to be independent.  Of course we do, but in the ordinary man's mind there is often a tendency to identify a judge as part of the State apparatus, rather than as somebody holding the balance equally between the State and the individual.  A judge who sentences people to prison has in one sense a role as part of the State apparatus and it is hard for ordinary people to see that as a separate function.</P>
    <P>As the amendment is presently phrased, in joint actions which involve both a claim in negligence and a claim for trespass to the person, or assault or something like that, wherever there is any element of negligence claimed in the plaintiff's proceedings, it is taken away from a jury and given to a judge alone.  If there is any element which strays outside intentional assault on an individual, or false imprisonment, under the law it has to be taken away from the jury.  That is wrong.  In certain circumstances, for instance, I could claim against the bouncers of a club that they beat me up, or against the gardaí that they beat me up and their defence could be that they negligently dropped me down the stairway in the station, or whatever, or that they negligently failed to treat me for the injuries which I had sustained otherwise. There may be cases where assault and trespass to the person or wrongful imprisonment will be married to a possible alternative remedy in negligence.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the case for assault and wrongful imprisonment must be taken away from the jury if this wording is followed, because the alternative remedy is negligence or breach of duty, or whatever is being claimed as well, by the plaintiff.  A plaintiff will be only restricted to black and white cases of assault and will not be able to have available the alternative remedy in negligence, going into one of these actions when it is about to be heard by a jury, because the Minister has drafted his amendment so restrictively.  I know what <Col N="755" /> the Minister and his officials were driving at.  They were trying to prevent people from bringing in negligence actions before juries by throwing in a little dash of assault or whatever, to get before a jury.  The Minister's aim was clearly to prevent people from using wrongful imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person as a vehicle to get around the prohibition on juries trying ordinary accident cases.</P>
    <P>I see what the Minister was trying to avoid, but surely the wording of the amendment could have been changed to say that, where the principal claim in the action is for assault or for wrongful imprisonment, it should be triable by a jury.  It should not be necessary to completely exclude an action brought for wrongful imprisonment or assault from trial by jury solely on the basis that the plaintiff is holding open the possibility that there was negligence as well.  That is unfair to the plaintiff.  It is taking away from a plaintiff the right to have his assault action fairly tried with an alternative remedy available to him.  The right way to do this would be along the lines suggested by The Workers' Party.  They want to say &ldquo;comprise in whole or in part a claim for&rdquo;.  That would allow too much latitude which the departmental officials advising the Minister are afraid of, but there is probably a middle road and that is to say that the principal claim in a proceeding should be for false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person, and that that should make available to one a jury trial.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's amendment, I am probably the only lawyer in this House who will say to the Minister that he agrees with him in general terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It <Col N="756" /> is a mistake to attempt to keep them there.  The Bar of Ireland and the solicitors' profession will not be undone, destroyed or relegated to a minor position by the abolition of juries in this manner.</P>
      <P>Many of the things barristers have been forced to do, such as haggling over money for damages, are not the particular arts for which they were educated in the King's Inns where they underwent their legal education.  The legal profession should not be afraid of change of this kind and they should be willing to view this change in principle as one which is sensible and the same as in the change in the early 20th century when jury involvement in contract cases was scrapped.  The legal profession should not get hysterical over this.  If I get back into the debate later I will talk about the number of counsel, in relation to which there is a very profound injustice being planned by the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the Minister, first, allowed an exceptional right of trial by a jury where a judge &mdash; and judges are not likely to bestow the right lightly &mdash; feels that the public interest would be served by trial by jury, he should accede to that.  Secondly, he should accede to an exceptional right of trial by jury in cases of negligence where they are ancillary remedies to a main action being brought for assault or wrongful imprisonment.  If he would permit of those exceptions to the general principle of what he is trying to bring about, I would be wholly with him. However, I think too much rhetoric has gone into this and too many people have tried to justify what I think is unjustifiable on the basis of high principle when the reality is a good deal more mundane than is made out.</P>
      <P>If the Government had sat down with the lawyers and the trade unions and asked them in a rational way to reform the right of jury trial, instead of posturing in public and dealing in these little baubles of young drivers insurance concessions this debate would have been a lot more rational and would have led to a much fairer conclusion.</P>

      <P>However, it is a matter of historical fact at this stage.  The main reason given for the abolition of juries was that it would lead to a reduction in the cost of insurance premiums.  That was the argument put forward by the insurance companies and their lobby in their demand for the abolition of juries. A decision was taken by the previous Government, and reiterated by the present Government, to abolish juries but I am afraid this commitment later developed into something far less positive and the reduction in the price of insurance premiums is now becoming more vague as the abolition of juries becomes more imminent.  I urge the Government to ensure if and when juries are abolished that the insurance company lobby, who were so vociferous, will be obliged to meet their stated commitment to try to reduce premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is one qualification I want to put on that.  I hope when the injuries suffered by an individual are being assessed that the injured party will be uppermost in the minds of all concerned. Today we are discussing the insurance lobby, the situation in regard to the courts, juries, barristers, solicitors, doctors, engineers and so on but the one person who has to be uppermost in the <Col N="758" /> minds of all concerned is the injured party, the ordinary Seán Citizen.  We have to ensure that the compensation he receives is adequate, fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The jury system has been a safeguard to the person of limited modest means who was able to have his case heard in court.  We have to ensure that the injured party will not be in any way victimised.  I have already stated that there is no civil legal aid in these cases similar to what is available in Britain and because of our financial resources I doubt if it will be possible to introduce even a limited form of legal aid in civil actions.  People will say they have been able to have their cases heard in Ireland and in the past solicitors and barristers brought many cases to court and they did not charge any fees when cases were lost.  We are living in a changing environment and if people have problems in bringing cases before courts &mdash; and this is likely to occur because of the cost of court proceedings &mdash; some basic fundamentals should apply to them.  What I am saying is that a case should be initially investigated, a junior counsel's opinion obtained and, if necessary, a senior counsel's opinion obtained, for people of modest means.  We have to bear this in mind.  I appreciate that it is not possible at present because of our financial problems but because the abolition of juries will make major changes I want to warn the Minister that this could occur in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>An injured person has to prove negligence on the part of the defendant.  That is all very well but it is a difficult thing to do and the insurance industry have excellent advice and personnel available to them.  We have to ensure that people have access to our courts.  It would be a sad day if they did not have access to them.  People must be allowed to obtain the compensation they are entitled to.  I am sorry the State has relieved itself of all responsibility for malicious damage to property in almost all instances.  That is wrong and people whose property is maliciously damaged should be entitled to some compensation.  Similarly, an elderly person who is injured will no longer receive compensation for his injuries. <Col N="759" /> This is a serious matter.  We should try to ensure that people are compensated when they suffer serious injuries.</P>
    <P>Matters of law are decided by the judge; matters of fact are decided by the jury.  The judge has a specialised training in matters of law but 12 citizens, chosen by lot, bringing together their common sense, their common humanity and their wide experience, are much more likely to provide a fair and balanced view of reasonable people.  It is important that that be retained.  I am afraid it will not be retained now with the abolition of juries.</P>
    <P>There has never been a major cry for the abolition of juries other than from the insurance companies and their lobby. I admit that there has been no major demand for them to be retained either. The issue has not generated any great amount of interest, so really it is not a major issue.  With the passing of time it will be recognised that the day we abolished juries was a bad day for the country. It is wrong to do away with juries because judges have little practical experience of working in the marketplace, in factories and in various industries.  Many of them come from middle class well-off families. Some come through from ordinary working people, qualify as barristers and go on to become judges, but that is the exception rather than the rule.  So many judges have not had the real experience, the hard graft of living down the country or in the inner cities, and so on, where life is so different from the rarefied atmosphere that many of these judges come from.</P>
    <P>That is why it is good that judges will be assessing matters of law but, in regard to matters of fact, issues such as the injuries a person living in a high rise flat might have suffered, some judges may not be able as accurately to assess the damages and compensation that should be paid as 12 fellow citizens who bring together their collective wisdom in making those decisions.  I mentioned that free legal aid is something that is away in the future, but it will have to be provided at some stage to ensure that there is access to our <Col N="760" /> courts.  Deputy Shatter mentioned the removal of VAT.  VAT was imposed at 25 per cent across the board and its removal helped to increase access to all sorts of professionals, lawyers, engineers, architects and so on.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the decision to abolish juries is being taken too quickly. What is really being said is that juries are not competent to assess damages.  I disagree with that.  I believe that they are competent.  If we are to follow this point through and accept that a jury is not competent to assess damages a person is entitled to be paid for injuries following the negligence of somebody else, will we, at a later stage, state that a jury is no longer competent to assess whether or not a person is guilty of a crime?</P>
    <P>The fact that we have juries has helped to bring the ordinary man in the street into contact with our courts and our judicial system and it is all part of the democratic process.  The citizen has been well served by juries and will be the sufferer by their abolition in civil matters.  I know it is not in the Minister's mind now to abolish juries in criminal matters but one must ask: if they are not competent to assess damages in civil cases, are they competent to decide on guilt or innocence in criminal cases?  In our criminal system juries have been the hallmark of a fair judicial system.  The ordinary person could decide, on the evidence, whether a person was guilty or innocent.  It is wrong that juries should be abolished in this instance because there is a real danger that the system as we know it will be changed.  This system has served the public well.  We should take great care to provide some safeguards if juries are abolished.  In particular judges should get continuous training in these matters.</P>
    <P>People have been speaking about a reduction in the cost of insurance premiums. It is incumbent upon the Minister, as Minister for Justice, to pursue an active and vigilant campaign to prevent people from driving without insurance. This would help to spread the load of insurance premiums across the board. Juries in civil cases are in their last days and this is a sad day and not a wise day. <Col N="761" /> I have the greatest possible reservations about this.</P>

      <P>I am, by and large, in agreement with what Deputy Enright had to say.  Someone said that there were quite a substantial number of lawyers in the Chamber today.

      <P>Excluding Deputy Barrett, the Minister and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Deputy Enright said there is no lobbying in relation to this.  The reason is that the group who may be affected by this, the people who in future may be injured, are not definable at this time. That is why no such lobby is coming to Deputies asking them not to go ahead with this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have an open mind as to whether juries should be retained.  There are a number of arguments in favour of doing away with juries.  Anyone who has been involved in the legal system can see that juries tend to lead to quite substantial delays in the court.  When the panel is taken in the juries are selected and four juries may be selected at any one time. Some have to be sent home because there is not a case for them or their case will be taken later in the week or the day. This, in itself, leads to the people empanelled on juries having a very bad impression of the whole legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people who have been involved in jury service are asked what they think about it most of them say it was an honour to be chosen but it was a bit of a nuisance they could not go to work, or if unemployed they had perhaps had to go through the mill at the local social welfare office because they were not there to claim the dole.  Generally people say it was an imposition on their private lives. Recently on either the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; or Marian Finucane's &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; a gentleman rang up and said that in England juries are entitled to meals, <Col N="762" /> expenses and whatever, whereas in Ireland they are not.  This has been a bone of contention with our jurors for as long as I have been involved in the system.  They are obliged to turn up for service when called.  Maybe the legal profession and the Department of Justice did not look at that in time.</P>
    <P>In recent times because of the large lists in Dublin, jury trials were panned out to various major centres.  My home town of Dundalk has been the recipient of the jury trial system for a number of years.  That helped the system in both Dublin and Dundalk, but I got the impression that many of the jurors were well known to either the legal representatives or the litigants themselves.  I know jurors are under an obligation to declare whether they have any connection with the people involved, but there is no doubt &mdash; I have been involved in such cases &mdash; the people may not have been known personally but were known by sight or whatever and that in a way makes the jury system slightly unreal.</P>
    <P>If I was involved in a car accident or an accident at work and had the choice of trial by judge or trial by jury I would rather have my case adjudicated upon by a jury of 12 ordinary citizens who, as Deputy Enright said, are not subject to the rarefied atmosphere and do not live in the ivory towers some of our judges live in.  I would rather that my case would be decided upon by the 12 good men and true.  Many of the judges, particularly in the higher courts, have become divorced from reality.  Deputy Shatter made the other side of the argument here when he said abolishing juries may not in itself lead to reductions in awards.  A number of awards made recently by judges alone were quite substantial, probably much more than a jury would award, given the type of economic atmosphere we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>The whole push by the insurance companies in particular, and to a certain extent by the media, to abolish juries is having a delayed reaction, maybe because of a problem with our political system in that we have had a change of Government.  When the previous <Col N="763" /> Government brought in this legislation there was an argument for abolition of juries because some horrific awards were being granted by juries, massive awards which the general public began to realise some day they would have to pay for. There was a turning around, as it were, in the perception that juries could be done away with because juries were making nonsensical awards.  Generally speaking, any massive award made got headline publicity, but that clouded the issue that the average award made by a jury was reasonable.</P>
    <P>Most of these massive awards we heard about on radio or TV or read about in the newspapers were appealed to the Supreme Court and the judges sitting there would have reduced the award, or the parties to the case would have agreed to settle the case before it went to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court itself set a ceiling in relation to quite a number of cases.  I am thinking particularly of the Quinnsworth case which was heard in the intervening period from the first call for the abolition of juries.  The legal system in itself started to regulate the types of awards being made.  As I said, the need to abolish juries may not nowadays be as great as it was three, four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>The public attitude also has changed. People now realise that ultimately they will be the paymasters for any of the major awards that have been made.  I am not saying awards should not be made. As most Deputies here said, people are entitled to proper compensation for the injuries they sustain because they will have to put up with the effects for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>A fault in relation to the legal system, and anyone practising in it will know this, is that insurance companies themselves adopted an attitude that their insurer was never wrong.  One of the major insurance companies in the Republic until recently adopted the attitude that their Johnnie was not at fault.  Even though a Garda report may have shown without doubt that their Johnnie was at fault, the insurance company insisted on the case <Col N="764" /> going to court, on barristers being briefed and on they themselves briefing two senior counsel, even though there may have been no need for that.  I know that because I have acted for insurance companies and I hope they will not take the business from me.  The insurance companies are not without sin.  They had in their own hands the settling of cases much earlier than before they came to court. Part of the reason insurance premiums are so expensive is that fact and we are now paying for it.</P>
    <P>Recently &mdash; again, this is a reason why there is not a great need to abolish juries &mdash; the insurance companies have adopted a far more reasonable attitude in relation to claims.  The insurance inspector will come in and sit down with solicitors or whoever and say that this is an obvious case for settlement and they will try to agree on a figure.  At that stage, if there is no agreement, the matter would go to court.  However, when the Garda report is issued and the injuries are determined, insurance companies adopt a much more reasonable attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly and Deputy McDowell referred to the fact that insurance companies seem to be bent on having a Green Shield Stamp system if we pass this Bill.  They say they intend to bring in low cost insurance, particularly for young people.  I am not in agreement with that system and, if the Bill is passed, the Minister should make it clear that they must conform to various conditions.  This was the case when the much-maligned Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce told the Bar that they must comply with certain conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should adopt that attitude in relation to the insurance companies because anyone who knows anything about the legal system knows that the abolition of juries by itself will not reduce premiums.  The Government, quite rightly, made the point that they are bringing in a package <Col N="765" /> which they hope will reduce costs. However, we are merely dealing with the jury system and its abolition will not reduce costs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce should adopt a more stringent attitude in regard to insurance companies and he should get a definite commitment from them instead of a mere undertaking to do this.  Deputy Shatter referred to subsection (6) and the Sinn Féin funds case.  I agree with Deputy McDowell that this section could not be regarded as unconstitutional.  The point made was that it deals generally with the system instead of a particular case as happened in relation to the Sinn Féin funds hearing.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell also made the valid point that a judge sits alone in the Circuit Court to deliberate on cases in relation to occupational injuries or road traffic accidents.  Why should it be any different in the High Court?  Perhaps there should be a jury hearing a case in the Circuit Court but that is another day's work. Deputy Shatter suggested that we are only tinkering with the system.  Perhaps the time has come to merge the Circuit Court with the High Court or, alternatively, there should be a substantial increase in the limit which the District Court may award, which is currently £2,500.  The whole system should be more open to my own profession, solicitors, who, by and large, do not participate in cases where the awards are likely to be over £2,500.  They would be as able as anyone else to participate in these cases.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Enright that the tide is running against juries although that may seem slightly unfair.  People most affected will not realise what has happened until they are in court, not in front of a jury of 12 men and women, but before a judge who may not have a sympathetic attitude to their injuries or indeed to the case itself.  There are two sides to the argument but the die is cast and the day of juries in civil cases is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up a point to which Deputy Shatter devoted some time, the question of making a radical change.  I do not think Deputy Shatter <Col N="766" /> would consider the merging of courts to be radical or, indeed, increasing their jurisdiction.  He wanted to introduce the &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; system and seemed to think that had never been considered.  Of course it was looked at and, <i>prima facie,</i> you have to run a mile from it because the cost of a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; system would be immense.  It would mean, in effect, a system of State insurance against all personal injuries.  There is no doubt that it would be radical but it is just not practical. We must keep the system we have, which is based on fault, and look at it carefully.  That involves being extremely careful and slow in regard to making changes.</P>
      <P>I was involved in the genesis of this Bill in 1986 and I had some reservations then about it but I was overwhelmed by the collective wisdom of my colleagues.  That constraint no longer applies and my reservations have become much more firm, thinking about the matter since.  Having heard them articulated here today by able advocates, I have no doubt that my reservations were correct.  The first reservation I have is that we should not change our legal system, particularly in a major way, unless we are certain that the change will bring a better regime for the citizen affected by it.  We must be certain that that will be a consequence.  We may not be totally certain because human nature does not permit of total certainty, but we should be as near it as we reasonably can that the change will be for the better.  All the arguments I have heard today for and against the retention of juries does not convince me &mdash; and it could not convince any objective listener &mdash; that this change is reasonably certain to improve the lot of the citizen coming into the legal system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright mentioned the plight of the citizen.  He was the only one who mentioned the injured citizen, the person who suffers from the careless driving of a fellow citizen, or who has a lazy or mean employer who does not provide a proper system of work for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  The prime consideration is the person who is injured. He is entitled to have his bodily integrity in its pristine state for the duration of his life and, if that is interfered with and the quality of his life is disimproved by reason of having to endure pain, physical or mental, and if his earning capacity is diminished, he must be adequately compensated. I do not think any victim of negligence who has been awarded damages by a court would say that he got too much.  Who are we, on the outside, to say that he got too much?  The Supreme Court in a couple of instances said that some victims got too much but because in one or two cases a jury has given what another tribunal regarded as excessive is not a good argument in itself for ending the whole system of juries.  It would be as logical to say that because one Deputy makes an intemperate speech we should curtail the rights of all Deputies to make speeches.  It would have the same logic and I do not think that should be applied.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in 1970 investigated the question of the abolition of juries in civil actions and came to a conclusion, by a majority view, that juries should not be abolished in civil actions in the High Court.  They felt that, unless it could be shown clearly that the cause of justice would be best served by abolishing juries or curtailing their present right, it should not be interfered with.  In their opinion, having researched the matter at length, no such case had been established.  They were satisfied that the advantages of a civil jury trial far outweighted the disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the criticisms of jury trials relate to excessive awards.  The number of awards that objectively could be <Col N="768" /> described as execessive &mdash; never by the recipient &mdash; are very few.  They are capable of being corrected in the higher court and because an occasional excessive award has been made is not a good ground for condemning the whole system.  It is alleged that jury trials are a significant factor in the high cost of litigation.  I do not see how they can be except in one possible way in that they protract the trials.  It is agreed that they protract trials by about one-third.  They account for about one-third of the time but I do not think that a saving of one-third of the time of the trial will have a significant impact on the costs attributable to that litigation.  In any event, even in the present system, the vast majority of cases are settled before they come to trial at all.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that for some years past a comprehensive and carefully structured campaign has been mounted by the insurance industry to get rid of juries in civil cases.  It is common case that that campaign was being advised by, and possibly organised by, what one would call a professional communicator not unknown to the gentlemen and ladies on the other side of the House.  They employed a professional PR man to orchestrate this campaign. They managed to build up a climate of opinion where it was wellnigh irresistable.  It became common case among all sections of society that there was something wrong with juries.  It was a notion that became insinuated into the public consciousness without people really analysing why that should be so.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ahern pointed out, there is no organised lobby in favour of juries and by definition there cannot be.  Deputy Enright made the point that there was no major outcry to retain juries and that is so because there cannot be an organised lobby to retain them.  The case for the retention of juries falls on those who are involved in the legal system and on Members of the House when the case is being made before us to abolish juries. The case I have heard made in the House has convinced me that there is no good reason for abolishing juries.  I have not been shown in any contribution in the <Col N="769" /> House how the lot of the injured citizen is going to be improved by going before a judge without a jury.  In fact, the arguments tend to suggest the contrary.  Those arguments for a case being heard by a single judge were carefully considered by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in 1970.</P>
    <P>We have a reasonably small Judiciary. Judges are human with the quirks of their own personalities.  As Deputy Kelly said, some of them may value £1 as being a lot of money and some of them may have a different regard for the value of money. Their individual perceptions will colour the amount of the award they will give. Their history in practice may also cause them to acquire prejudices or leanings in certain directions.  A man may be appointed to the bench after a practice acting for insurance companies.  He may have developed a certain cynicism about litigants and about their injuries and he is hardly going to get rid of that cynicism by being elevated to the bench.  Yet, what is proposed is that that person will be sitting as a single arbitrator on an injured party coming before him, a party he spent his professional life fighting against.  Likewise, some judges may have different values of compensation.  It becomes a bit of a lottery as to who is drawn when a case is set down.  If a litigant is unlucky he may end up before a judge who is regarded as being biased against plaintiffs or before a judge who is regarded as being ungenerous in his consideration of damages.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made the point, when arguing in favour of the change, that a lot of time has to be spent in opening technical details to a jury, that so much time might not have to be spent with a judge.  With respect, some judges might require even more time having matters opened to them than would a jury.  I do not think that is a good argument.</P>

      <P>We get back to a fundamental legal question which is the test as to whether there has been negligence or not, whether the standard that one would expect of a reasonable man was present or was failing.  I do not think a judge is a better person to make that test than 12 fellow citizens.  I would prefer the reasonableness of the reasonable man to be engaged by 12 ordinary citizens than by a reasonable judge.  It does not follow that a reasonable judge will apply the standards of a reasonable man but what is being proposed leaves us without any choice and we will have to accept whatever a judge finds, conditioned as he is by his background and legal training.</P>
      <P>One school of American jurisprudence, in analysing the sources of law, particularly the law made by judges, said that one of the greatest influences in deciding our law was what they call the judge's inarticulate major premise. When that was examined it was found it could be anything, leading that particular school of jurisprudence to be known as the digestive school of jurisprudence because it was found in one case that the unhappy state of a judge's digestion influenced his finding in a particular case.</P>
      <P>That may sound like a rather extreme case being made in favour of juries as against judges but it is not so when one considers it.  We are all victims of our own inarticulate major premise in some way or another, our own bias or prejudice. We are the victims of our personal history and we are now proposing to send an injured citizen before a single person, subject as he is to all those constraints and handicaps.  The arguments in favour of the injured citizen going before 12 of his peers are unanswerable.</P>

      <Col N="771" /> Deputy McDowell mentioned the wide right to a jury in the 19th century in a whole host of actions relating to contract and so on.  He said that because it was abolished without too much brouhaha it could be abolished now.  To compare the conditions of 19th century Great Britain or Ireland with the complexities of modern western society is a false analogy. The class of people involved then was a comparatively affluent, narrow, mercantile class who were quite happy to have their contractual problems adjudicated by one of their own.  One hundred years have elapsed and society has become much more complex and more egalitarian.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned the jury system in the United States as a reason for curtailing the jury system here.  It is a case of different societies, different mores.  We should not condemn our system, which has not been producing the same excesses that the US system has produced.  We have a system for correcting it on the odd occasion when it could be argued that excesses did take place, although the recipients of what others thought to be excessive awards might not have agreed.</P>
    <P>The point has also been made that the jury was abolished without any difficulty in the Circuit Court.  The important point to remember is that an appeal from the Circuit Court is by way of full rehearing in the High Court, so that a second mind is coming to adjudicate on the facts.  If we abolish juries in the High Court the appeal will not be by way of re-hearing. It will be on a transcript to the Supreme Court.  That is a very significant point in demolishing the argument that because juries were abolished in the Circuit Court they should be abolished in the High Court as well.  That point cannot be overemphasised.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made a colourful point when he raised the case of a man injured lifting a manhole because he was not given proper tools and had to wrestle at it with a badly-made crowbar.  He asked why we should waste the time of the jury in hearing such a case and <Col N="772" /> whether it could not be decided equally well by a judge.  This is precisely the point I am making.  A judge might very well say that the tools with which he was provided were good enough to do the job.  The judge's background and training, and possibly his professional career as an insurance company lawyer, might lead him to draw that conclusion, quite objectively in his own mind.  He might never have used a pick in his life.  On a jury there would be a cross section of 12 people who might have a better perception of the realities of a workman's lot and would be able to come to a better conclusion on whether that system of working was safe or unsafe.</P>
    <P>None of the arguments I have heard here for abolishing juries stands any comparison with the arguments for their retention.  There is such an area of doubt and uncertainty raised by the two contending sides that the question should be resolved in favour of the <i>status quo.</i> We should not change the <i>status quo</i> of something so fundamental in our legal system unless we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is for the better.  If this debating forum teases out issues in a certain direction which is contrary to that proposed, it should not be ignored.  We have been victims of that thinking for too long.  There should be more flexibility in the House in hearing a matter debated and analysed and if the conclusions mean a rethink of policy it should be done.</P>
    <P>The case had been to some extent won in the public consciousness by the intensive and very proficient lobbying by the insurance companies over the years.  One of the great fallacies of that lobby was the tacit implication that premiums would be reduced.  In the past couple of months the line is that premiums will at least be maintained or that the rate of increase will decrease.  The suggestion of a reduction has disappeared.</P>
    <P>If premiums are to be reduced, two important things must be done, neither of which has any connection with juries or courts.  In the first place, uninsured drivers must be made to take out insurance and, secondly, the standard of driving on our roads, the standard of <Col N="773" /> vehicles and the standard of the roads themselves must be improved so that the incidence of traffic accidents is reduced. These are the two essentials if there is to be a reduction in insurance claims.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies made the case &mdash; and it was made at one stage by the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; that the companies should be entitled to underwriting profits in any class of business.  That is the view of the National Prices Commission.  Two Government accounting committees examined that view, in the McLean report and the O'Donoghue report.  In each case the conclusion was that investment income must be taken into account in determining profitability and that companies have no right to make underwriting profits.  In 1984 the example was given of Irish companies in the motor market who made a profit on the motor side before tax of over £7 million.  There was an underwriting loss of £24 million but an investment income of £21 million and expenses not charged to other accounts of £10 million.  There was a profit before tax after an underwriting loss.  It is now being proposed that there should be an underwriting break-even point or indeed an underwriting profit. The total profit could become immense and totally out of proportion.</P>
    <P>The case being made by insurance companies that the abolition of juries will bring a great new dawn for drivers or for employers is fallacious.  It has not been proved.  There is no guarantee that the incidence of claims will drop, or that the level of awards will be reduced.  We will have to wait and see what will happen. There will be a kind of lottery as to how the individual judges will perform, whether they will show a bias in favour of the plaintiff or the defendant or whether they will show themselves to be generous or otherwise as regards damages.  The unfortunate litigant, the person whose bodily integrity has been injured by the negligence of his employer or fellow citizen, will have to take part in that lottery and if he is unlucky he will not be adequately or properly compensated for the injury he sustained.  He is entitled to <Col N="774" /> be adequately and properly compensated. The best guarantee we can give that that will happen is to allow his compensation to be decided by 12 fellow citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the arguments put forward by those in favour of retaining juries.  As I said the last day, having read the statement by the then Opposition spokesman on Justice, Deputy Michael Woods, I wonder why Fianna Fáil brought this Bill back to the Dáil.  However, I am sticking by my original stance, that juries have to be abolished from a practical point of view.</P>
      <P>I would like people to recall 1984 to 1986 when this Bill was first mooted and brought into this House by the then Government.  You can talk all you like about the rights of an individual who goes to court.  The reality at that time was that a handful of insurance companies were underwriting motor insurance.  Two or three companies were underwriting motor insurance for young people and a handful of insurance companies were underwriting public liability and employers' liability cover.  The net result was that the number of people driving on our roads without insurance was increasing dramatically, particularly among the younger age groups.  More and more firms were going out of business because, first, they could not afford the premiums they were being charged for public and employers' liability and, secondly, they could not even get the cover.  This House had to face up to a situation where an insurance company, which at the time held up to 60 per cent of motor insurance cover, went bust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can talk at length about the rights of an individual who goes to court but we have to get back to reality.  The reality is that we are a small country that can afford a certain amount and no more.  Let us compare our situation with that of some of our counterparts in the EC.  For example, in Greece if you are unfortunate enough to be a passenger in a motor vehicle that is involved in an accident, you might not get any compensation because they do not have <Col N="775" /> Compulsory cover for passengers.  I have yet to see anybody in Great Britain start a campaign for the re-establishment of juries in that country.  All these unfortunate people are supposed to be without adequate compensation as a result of injuries but I have not read one line where there has been a demand for the re-establishment of juries.  I have not read one line about people who brought their cases to court for perhaps breach of contract, who feel they are not getting a fair deal and want juries re-established. They do not seem to think that these judges we have heard about for the past couple of hours who will not be humane enough to deal with an individual plaintiff who has suffered very severe injuries will not grant a just reward.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day we have to deal with reality.  The reason there are now more insurance companies in the marketplace is that when the Courts Bill, 1986, was published more companies came back into the market for public liability, employers' liability and motor insurance.  That, in itself, had the effect of stabilising premium rates and in some cases reduced, through competition, premium rates in employers' and public liability. In particular it made cover available to those the law of the land obliges to carry insurance.  Motor insurance is not something that you take upon yourself to pay if you so wish.  The law obliges you to do so.</P>
    <P>I have listened to various arguments in the past 18 months about cuts in public expenditure.  I do not like cuts in public expenditure, in education or in health.  I would love to see people getting a far better health service, a far better education service and a far better service in most areas but the reality is that we have only a certain sum of money to spend.  At the end of the day it is difficult to justify any cut, just as it is difficult to justify not giving somebody £500,000 who is unfortunate enough to lose an arm.  Who am I to say that Deputy McDowell or Deputy Cooney should not get £500,000 if they are unfortunate enough to lose an arm. Will £500,000 compensate you for the <Col N="776" /> loss of an arm?  If we want to have insurance companies underwriting risks we will have to have some sort of system whereby if people suffer a certain type of injury it will be reasonably predictable as to the compensation that will be awarded in that case.  Otherwise people will not underwrite the risks that we want them to underwrite.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to those who argue in favour of the rights of the individual who finds himself or herself in court, there are thousands of people who have to pay the premiums every year.  I want to be able to say to young people that the premium they will be charged for the cover the law obliges them to have is reasonable enough, that they should pay it and that the law of the land will punish them severely if they do not carry that cover.  Whether we like it or not there is a direct link between this Bill and insurance.  That is a fact that we cannot deny.  This Bill would not have been introduced if there was not a difficulty in the insurance industry.  I want to say to people that they have premiums that are reasonable and if they do not pay them we will throw the book at them.  I am not going to tolerate a situation where a higher percentage of people every year are driving vehicles without proper insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Bureau are funded by insurance companies and indirectly by myself and others who are paying our premiums.  People who have no insurance cover and are involved in accidents cause personal injuries to people and others have to pick up the tab for them.  I do not think that is just in the same way as people may think it is not just that one person should judge how much should be given out in a particular case as against 12 people making the decision.  It is not just that I should have to pick up the tab for people who drive around without insurance cover and are involved in an accident causing personal injuries.  Many things have to be taken into account when deciding whether the abolition of juries is right or wrong.  I am on the side of practicality.  It is practical, first, that we have a system that gives <Col N="777" /> the cover we want people to have and, secondly, that we have people to underwrite it.</P>
    <P>There is another section in this Bill which causes me concern and that is the section which deals with the restriction on representation when people go into court.  That is a far wider principle, but I will deal with it later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I know we do not have very much time to discuss this.  This legislation was brought in by the previous Government in 1986 because of the situation the country was in in relation to the motor insurance industry.  I do not believe anything extraordinary has happened in the meantime to suggest that more and more insurance companies will be anxious to underwrite motor insurance.  I made it clear the last day that I would not be accused of representing any lobby group, but the reality is that a number of insurance companies came back into the market because that Bill was published. They felt this was a justifiable reason for them to get involved again in underwriting certain classes of business.  They felt they were going to get a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with some of the points made by Deputy Cooney when he spoke about the application for increases in rates and that we must take into account the return on investment that insurance companies are getting as well as underwriting the profit and loss account.  That is a valid point but other things could be done in relation to underwriting motor insurance in particular.  I have always held the view that we should have a system where each individual carries their own insurance instead of insuring the vehicle.  In that way everybody would contribute to the pool.  In my book to have one policy covering ten people is nonsensical.  If everybody carried their own insurance more people would be contributing and the premiums would be lower.  That should be looked at when we are talking about the cost of motor insurance.  I have <Col N="778" /> yet to hear a valid argument suggesting that what I am proposing is not correct. However, that is for discussion another day.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue we are discussing this evening, the reality is that some years ago the major motor insurance underwriter went bang and the State had to rescue the company which covered 60 per cent of insured motorists. I would not like to see more people without insurance cover, fewer people contributing to the pool and the few picking up the tab for those who refuse to pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>If the House finds that the public are not getting a fair deal because of the abolition of juries and that judges are not treating plaintiffs in a humane way, there is nothing to stop us re-establishing juries in civil actions.  If we can abolish them we can re-establish them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being very realistic.  The reality is we have the power to re-establish juries if we wish.  If we find people are not getting a fair deal, we can change the law as easily as we are doing now.  The reality is we have to look at the insurance industry and the obligations on people to carry motor insurance in particular.</P>
      <P>It is a pity employers are not forced to carry employers' liability cover because many people suffer when an employer does not have adequate insurance cover. When the employee brings an action against the employer they find it is a waste of time because there is no money to pay them.  In 1985-86 one jury would give Y award for X amount in a particular case and a month later in similar circumstances another jury would give Y amount &mdash; the amounts granted could be poles apart.  Insurance companies found it difficult to get realistic settlements and many cases were settled on the steps of the court.  At the end of the day the insurance companies are using my money because my premiums go into that pool which is used to pay awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> I do not want to see anybody who has been unfortunate enough to have received serious personal injuries not getting a proper award.  That would be a retrograde step.  I want to see justice being done as far as possible, but I do not believe we can ignore reality.  The reality is there are a small number of people contributing to the pot out of which claims have to be paid.  I could argue for those thousands of people who are paying high insurance premiums and never get a penny back.</P>
    <P>I respect the views expressed by those who fear the abolition of juries but, on balance, I believe what we are doing is in the interests of the majority.  As I said, if we find it has not worked there is nothing to stop us coming back to the House and not alone re-establishing juries in the High Court but introducing them in the Circuit Court; we do not have juries in the Circuit Court at present &mdash; I listened to Deputy Cooney's argument about that &mdash; nor do we have juries in the Supreme Court.  The insurance companies know that if the Supreme Court lays down guidelines for general damages and the jury in the High Court action go beyond that figure, the case will be appealed to the Supreme Court.  This has happened in the past.</P>

      <P>The Government have collective responsibility under the Constitution and the Coalition Government decided on something given the circumstances of the day.  I believe they acted correctly and their actions stabilised the insurance industry.  They brought more companies back into the market place and the public at large are benefiting from that action. I stand over that decision, and hope we will pass on to the next section.  Even though people may disagree with the abolition of juries, the case has been made for and against.</P>

      <P>In reference to the remarks made by Deputy Barrett about an insurance company which had about 60 per cent of the motor business in the country some years ago, and then got into trouble, my recollection is that that company came into existence after a campaign that insurance cover could be retained <Col N="781" /> and insurance premiums abolished or some such campaign.  Of course, that company got into trouble and had to be bailed out.</P>
      <P>Another Irish company took up business across the water and reinsured every crazy risk on which they could get their hands.  They got into trouble and had to be bailed out, also.  I think I can say I have no vested interest in the remarks that I make on this Bill.  I have not been associated with a solicitor's practice since 1973, but for over 30 years prior to that I acted in the courts of this country, for plaintiffs and defendants, in the Circuit Court and the High Court for plaintiffs and &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; insurance companies.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this Bill is a dangerous one. It is embarking on an interference with the administration of justice, although that is not the intention behind it.  This Bill is about insurance premiums, their level and their reduction.  That theme has been running through this debate since it started.  We have heard very little about <Col N="782" /> the injured person, about the man whose career has been destroyed and who will be unable to earn anything for the rest of his life.  Fair enough, Deputy McDowell did mention that aspect when he introduced the case of an action for negligence against a doctor.  Deputy McDowell is one of our leading barristers.  Many people would regard him as an ornament at the Bar.  If he were promoted to the Bench, I have no doubt we would have leading articles saying this is the sort of man that we want there.</P>

      <P>He made the strongest possible case for the retention of the jury system.  He stated, if I understood him correctly, that that system should be retained in some cases.  He gave an example of an action for negligence against a medical man, saying that the jury system should be retained there because if the case went against the doctor his career was gone, his reputation was gone and he would be accused of perjury.  Perhaps I am not interpreting Deputy McDowell correctly but he gave me the impression that one should be very slow to decide against a doctor.  If that is so and if Deputy McDowell is a typical example, because of his qualifications and his judicial approach to things of someone whom we might find on the Bench, then I certainly think that that is an unanswerable case for retaining the jury system.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that in any personal way.  The effect of this Bill, if enacted, will be to make it more difficult for the average person to have access to the courts on equal terms with his opposite number.  This Bill deals with a class of case, 99 per cent of which will have a wealthy insurance company on one side and a man of little or no property on the other.  It may be said <Col N="783" /> that this has always been the way in this country, that we had wealthy litigants on one side and a poorish person on the other.  We had no free legal aid system here.</P>
      <P>One of the points made &mdash; and made with some considerable force here &mdash; is that we are the only country left with a jury system.  However, the people who say that do not go on to say that we are the only people left, in this part of the world, at any rate, without a free legal aid system.  We have, I know, a free legal aid system on the criminal side.  We also have some sort of Mickey Mouse free legal aid system confined largely to family law, and let me say that it is doing an excellent job with the amount of money that it has at its disposal.</P>
      <P>We have here an Irish solution to an Irish problem in so far as the man of no property is concerned who wants to have recourse to litigation.  We have the jury system coupled with the two senior counsel system.  Those two institutions are ridiculed, but they have stood behind the litigant with little or no means.  All litigants, or 90 per cent of them, who go to the High Court are poor people.  Nobody can afford to become involved in a High Court action which will go on for three or four weeks, or even for a week, if he has to pay out of his own resources.  An eminent senior counsel, now deceased, told me that no matter what he was sued for in the High Court he would settle because he could not afford to fight the case.  If we do away with the jury system and the two senior counsel system, it will not be possible for people to have their cases brought to the High Court and litigated there.  I think that the insurance companies are inclined to exaggerate things.</P>

That is absolutely startling especially when one considers the present billing arrangements of Telecom Éireann.

      <P>Slightly more than this, 22 per cent, said that they had obtained some form of satisfaction and, of those who queried their bills, only 28 per cent said they were satisfied with the way in which their queries were handled.</P>
      <P>The main criticisms were that Telecom Éireann issued standard replies and were reluctant to consider the possibility that they had made an error.  Only 35 per cent of those surveyed expressed satisfaction with the way in which their telephone bills were presented.  The main criticism in this respect was that STD calls were not itemised.  Forty-two per cent of those surveyed listed this as a complaint which is an extraordinarily large percentage.  An extraordinarily low percentage of consumers reported any form of satisfaction with the billing arrangements and I hope this matter will be addressed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that the profits accruing to An Post and Bord Telecom will <Col N="785" /> increase as the years go by.  I caution both of these companies against yielding to the pressure which will be put on them to pay dividends to the Government of the day with the consequent risk of not increasing the number of services being provided to the consumer.  I am concerned that the companies will forget about the consumer in favour of the profit motive and it is only when the consumer is satisfied with the services being provided by those companies that extra business will be generated for them.  There is a great need to examine what the future role of these companies should be and I would like to see extra services being provided to the consumer rather than the companies seeking higher profits which would yield dividends to the State.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to the need for this legislation.  The Postal and Telecommunications Users Council was abolished on 3 July 1987 and this was a retrograde step.  The Minister stated at that time that the ambit of the office of the Ombudsman was being extended to cover this area.  In recent weeks we have had a number of opportunities to consider the latest report of the Ombudsman. I ask the Minister for Communications to accept that this decision to abolish the Postal and Telecommunications Users Council was a bad decision in the light of the findings in the Ombudsman report and given the fact that the decision appeared to be taken on the basis that there was a duplication of roles as between the office of the Ombudsman and the Postal and Telecommunications Users Council.  I understand that the savings which accrued to the State amounted to £85,000 but the abolition of this council left the consumer with no way of seeking redress.  When we look across the water we find that there is more than one complaints council to which the consumers of British Telecom and the British postal service can complain. I feel there is a great need for such a body here and that the bill at present before the House goes a long way towards solving the problems which exist at present.</P>
    <P>Turning to deal with the Bill itself, it <Col N="786" /> is very important in the light of what I said earlier that some code of practice is introduced to enable consumers to seek redress.  I do not think we are going too far by advocating the payment of compensation to those who have grounds for complaint against the two bodies concerned. I am not advocating that we should go back to the time of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as I feel the change which was made in the early eighties was a move in the right direction. We removed these two companies from direct political control at that time but we have now turned the wheel 360 degrees and I question the accountability of both of these bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that we have now reached a position where deputations are not being received in Telecom Éireann, that it is impossible for the consumer to seek any form of redress and the office of the Ombudsman is being starved of cash.  The users council has also been abolished.  The answers to the problems lie in this Bill and I urge the Minister and the Government to allow this Bill to proceed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say that we seem to be forgetting in this debate that both An Post and Telecom Éireann are at a very early stage in their development.  The Minister in his contribution last week warned against the danger of taking any action which would weaken the commercial mandate of the two companies.  It should be emphasised that we do not want to take any action which would work to the economic disadvantage of the two companies.  Both An Post and Telecom Éireann have been very successful to date.  In the case of An Post, they have achieved profitability over a short period of three years.  They made a profit of £2.776 million in 1987, an increase of £2 million over the previous year.  That profit, the achievements in the volume of mail traffic &mdash; which is 16 per cent higher than when An Post took over <Col N="787" />&mdash; and the quality of service, with 90 per cent of letters being delivered on the next working day after posting, are indications that An Post are doing a good job and providing a very high quality reliable service.</P>
      <P>An Post has given the postal service a vibrant, forward-looking image.  They have been active and inventive in introducing and extending measures to develop the postal service.  I am glad to note that the company are investing some £8 million a year on the improvement of post office premises, on the provision of security measures, replacement of their vehicular fleet and on the provision of general equipment.</P>
      <P>There was one issue raised by Deputy Flanagan and indeed also by the Minister in the course of his remarks in which I am interested.  That is the introduction of letter-boxes.  The Minister has stolen some of my thunder because he has said already, and I was delighted to hear him say, that he is worried about the security aspect of letter-boxes and that they will be redesigned.  I presume the idea of letter-boxes originated in the USA, which are a feature of the postal service there and in many European countries.  I am not opposed in principle to the idea of letter-boxes.  I realise that their introduction would secure savings for An Post and speed up the delivery of mail in rural areas where some people have very late deliveries.  I am reassured that the Minister has said that these letter-boxes will be redesigned to ensure greater security. I might suggest to An Post that these letter-boxes be provided on the roadside outside people's property.  I should not like to see the proposal implemented that was considered in some parts of County Galway that five of six letter-boxes be located at the top of a country road where perhaps five families might carry the name of Flanagan, Connolly or Burke, causing the postman enormous confusion in the course of his deliveries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that criticism <i>vis-a-vis</i> proposals, since vesting day An Post have shown great imagination and energy. They have been very successful in the <Col N="788" /> introduction of their special St. Patrick's Day and Valentine's Day cards and other first issue stamps.  I wish them every success in the work they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Bruton spoke here last week &mdash; in relation to section 3 of the Bill before us &mdash; of the need to move toward a level of service and charges as good as the best standards prevailing in the EC. The implication was that we had much to learn from our European colleagues in terms of how they organise and charge for postal services in a manner that meets customers' needs, particularly those of their business customers.  There were some problems Deputy Bruton overlooked, in particular the fact that, with the exception of Luxembourg, we have the smallest, most thinly spread population of any country in Europe.  This means we cannot achieve the economies of scale, commensurate with falling marginal costs for our services, as is the case in larger economies.  Diseconomies of scale account for the relatively high cost we face for virtually all internally-generated national services, including energy, telecommunications and consumer goods.  As long as we, as a country, wish to retain control over such services at a national level then we must live with the problem of higher costs while striving continuously for their reduction.</P>
    <P>Certainly there are major differences between countries in terms of management practices, legislative controls and cultural factors that render many of the comparisons that Deputy Bruton required very difficult of achievement. For example, in the United Kingdom and Holland postal financial services are run by private companies while in France and Germany those services are controlled strictly by the Government; I suppose we are somewhere in between.  When Deputy Bruton refers to the level of services I presume he is concerned mainly with their price and quality.</P>
    <P>Again, in order to put these matters in perspective, I should say we have one of the most extensive post office networks, relative to our population, in Europe. Therefore, when Deputy Bruton speaks of the current or best practices in Europe <Col N="789" /> we should remember that those other European countries at present seem to drastically curtail their post office networks, closing numerous uneconomic offices in order to generate saving that can be passed on to their customers by way of reduced prices.  I wonder are Deputy Bruton and the Fine Gael party allowing us to move towards Europe and European standards, or are we to have one hand tied behind our backs, representing pressure on us to cut our services without having any discretion as to the implementation of savings.  We must face up to all of those issues.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say that in future there will be an itemised telephone billing system.  That is a welcome announcement because we hear regularly of telephone accounts having been improperly computed with complaints being lodged with the Ombudsman. We are aware also of the waiting lists for the installation of telephones, particularly in rural areas.  That waiting list has been reduced dramatically from 60,000 in January 1984 to a current 17,000.  However that reduction has not received much publicity.  The billings system and people's complaints are much more publicised.</P>
    <P>In their annual report Bord Telecom stated that customer relations are the first priority of the company.  I contend they still have some way to go before reaching a fully satisfactory position in this regard. People are always seeking a satisfactory response.  At times the company must form judgments on a balance of prob-abilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also referred to the question of the publication of a code of practice.  If we base our judgment on the experience of British Telecom, I wonder whether the publication of a code of practice on complaints procedures would do anything to improve customer relations on the ground.  In fact, in some respects such codes can be a cause of contention. The existence of an elegant code of practice does not appear to have afforded much comfort to British Telecom customers, or to the people who comment on it in the media.  Having said that, <Col N="790" /> however, I agree with Telecom Éireann's view that customer relations are a continuing priority for the company.  It is true to say that they have made considerable progress already.  We are told that in their current staff training programme they have ensured they have more staff to deal with customer problems and indeed their training courses are oriented towards improving customer handling.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann have now a centralised repair service in Dublin and Cork which puts customers directly in contact with the field staff responsible for the maintenance of services.  This has been a major step forward in making for better understanding and in establishing confidence among customers that their complaints are receiving personal attention. It has been announced that calls will be itemised with the advent of detail call logging procedures and the fully computerised telecommunications information system over the next few years. This technology will greatly improve customer confidence and the availability of information to customers.  This should make the response to customer queries quicker.</P>
    <P>Customer relations are very important to Telecom Éireann.  They have informed us that they intend to develop progressively a system whereby personnel will deal with the major customers' accounts and service matters, with a particular emphasis on the data network. This should improve relations and services to major businesses and industrial users.  In general, I hope &mdash; and I am sure everybody in this House hopes &mdash; that the quality of service and the attention to installations will continue to improve, that the level of complaints from customers will continue to drop and that a greater proportion of staff time will be devoted to cultivating better customer relations.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Bruton spoke on the Bill last week he said that his approach to the economic performance of the companies covered by the Bill is that recommended in the proposals of the National Planning Board published in 1984.  Deputy Bruton said that investment projects should be <Col N="791" /> appraised by the company and, by implication, if the appraisal did not show a sufficiently attractive yield, the investment should not be undertaken.  This may seem to make sense in economic terms but when we look at the duties imposed by statute on Telecom Éireann a different picture emerges.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann have an obligation to provide a national telecommunications service and to meet the industrial, commercial and household needs of the State for a comprehensive and efficient telecommunications service and so far as they consider it reasonably practical they have to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services throughout the State.  Therefore, investment cannot always be considered on purely economic criteria.  For example, if a telephone exchange in County Galway does not meet the economic criteria set down, the area can hardly be left without a telephone service. Scaling down the size of the exchange would in general make little difference to the overall cost.  If one were to follow this line of thinking many areas of the country would be left without service if service at standard rates for all were to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the proposal to bring prices into line with those elsewhere in the European community, which is reasonable as an aspiration or a target, should not be legislated for.  In labour intensive industries, and the telecommunications area is one, much depends on public use of the service compared with that in other countries.  The level of wages is another factor which affects prices.  To force the company by law to surpass the best price standard prevailing in the European Communities could only be brought about by disimproving the existing level of services.  The underlying pressure to reduce charges is reasonable and Telecom Éireann have made it clear that this is an objective.</P>
    <P>The question I raised on cross-subsidisation refers to An Post as well as Telecom Éireann.  We are well aware that courier services are serving the larger towns and cities.  We have to think of <Col N="792" /> rural areas and, as a Deputy from a rural area, I am very concerned and worried that the services provided by An Post and Telecom Éireann would be undermined in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill if enacted would, as I understand it, lay a statutory obligation on Telecom Éireann to publish before the start of the financial year an appraisal of any major investment proposed to be undertaken during the year.  This would be sensible if each investment proposed by the company were a stand alone project which could be appraised without reference to its impact on the rest of the network.  However, the integrated nature of the telecommunications network makes a conventional type of capital appraisal difficult and inappropriate in many cases, as the costs and benefits of specific items of expenditure cannot readily be identified in isolation from the network as a whole.  For example, for the Eircell project and, indeed, every case where costs and benefits can be allocated with reasonable accuracy, full appraisal of the capital expenditure involved forms part of the company's analysis.  The telecommunications network is a single structure and while certain costs may be directly attributed to individual exchanges or to sub-networks within the network, the bulk of the company's capital expenditure relates to the provision of the main countrywide telecommunications system and the costs incurred for the various elements are for the common benefit of all users of the network.</P>
    <P>The standard of service which the network has to achieve was set out in the report of the review group, 1978-79. These standards have been accepted as the target to which Telecom Éireann must work.  Telecom Éireann are at present working towards these standards and unless one goes back again to rewrite these standards, expenditure of the network must continue until these standards are achieved.  To speak of appraisal of any major expenditure proposed is not realistic in the context of the telecommunications network.  However, it is true to say that there are service targets <Col N="793" /> set for An Post and Telecom Éireann. Having listened to Deputy Bruton last week one would be forgiven if one were to come to the conclusion that there were no targets set.  Since Telecom Éireann drew up their first corporate plan, they have set objectives and targets in the critical key results area of their activities. These are published in their annual report.</P>
    <P>The current corporate plan which covers the period 1988 to 1993 aims to provide telephones within six weeks of application, to repair 85 per cent of telephone faults within two working days, to connect telex lines within three weeks of application, to repair 90 per cent of telex faults within two working days and that 70 per cent of all households will have a telephone by the end of the period.  The company also hope to grow at the rate of 7 per cent per annum on average and to double output per head in real terms, to have a profit of at least 5 per cent on turnover in 1988-89.  They also hope to be fully self-financing by 1988-89.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the targets which the company have publicly set down.  From what I have said it is very clear that those targets have been set down by the company themselves.  It is another thing altogether to have targets imposed on companies.  This sort of target could demand an unrealistic performance, although the target might look good on paper.  Such an approach would be totally demoralising for the management and staff of the organisation so that instead of trying to achieve the targets the company would throw in the towel.  In any business organisation targets are set by management and approved by the shareholders, not the other way around.</P>
    <P>In relation to cross-subsidisation, in general terms under our present structure relating to telecommunications, large users subsidise low users, business customers subsidise residential customers, high density areas subsidise low density areas and so on.  This cross-subsidisation exists as a result of a combination of uniform pricing and the historical development of charging structures and <Col N="794" /> technological changes.  The structure of telephone charges was inherited from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and it has remained largely unchanged.  Some degree of rebalancing has been implemented for example in international charges and more significant rebalancing is proposed for the future. For those reasons it is impossible to compare in an equitable way nominal charges in this country with charges in another.</P>
    <P>On the face of it telephone charges in Ireland appear to be higher than in other EC countries.  One must look behind the figures in investigating this.  The exchange line connection fee in Ireland is £120 which is considerably lower than connection fees in Greece, Norway, Sweden, UK or Denmark where the fee is £172. The rental charge in Ireland is the same irrespective of location of subscribers.  In Belgium, Denmark, Italy and Luxembourg the rental charges very according to the number of customers available at the local call rate, or the geographical location of the customer.  In Ireland local calls are charged at 11.17p.  The statistics show that for a three minute peak rate call the Irish charge is 11.17p and that charge is only exceeded by Italy at 15.13p and the UK at 17.84p.  Local calls in Ireland are untimed and that is certainly very different from other European countries where there is a considerable second charge for long calls particularly at peak times.</P>
    <P>We have low population density and we had a low level of telephone development until Telecom Éireann were established. The cost of distributing telecommunications services is very high.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann in their corporate plan are engaged in a programme rebalancing the charge structure which they inherited in 1984, with a view to reducing international charges and so improving their competitiveness on key routes. Telecom Éireann and An Post are doing a reasonable job.  There are problems, but I am certainly encouraged by what the Minister said last week.  The way the companies are progressing is very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in introducing his Bill <Col N="795" /> made comparisons with other EC countries. He did not do that on a fair basis so I would ask him to reconsider and withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton in introducing this Bill outlined two objectives which motivated him.  One was a desire to seek protection for the customer. Nobody would dispute that the customer deserves protection.  The Deputy also said that he had the desire to see the best possible economic performance by both companies.  I intend to oppose this Bill as the Bill just concentrates on An Post and Telecom Éireann in isolation from other semi-State organisations.  I do not see the justification for this Bill.  There are other State institutions which enjoy a far greater monopoly and which are not subject to the same pressure that these two relatively young companies are subjected to, yet there is no cry for further legislation which would hamper them in any way.  Since these companies were set up just four years ago, it is a bit premature to introduce this type of legislation particularly when progress has been made in both companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious aspect of the Bill is the proposal for additional reporting procedures.  This would just create another bureaucracy.  It would be far more beneficial if the companies were taken from the semi-State sector and put into the State sector, making them part of the Civil Service make-up.  At this stage nobody would envisage this happening. Deputies Bruton, Barnes and Flanagan did not mention or mourn the loss of the users council.  It should be borne in mind that the Deputies in Fine Gael who supported the Government cuts contributed in no small way to the demise of the Ombudsman's office.  We are not happy that the role of the Ombudsman has been reduced or that the users council has been abolished, saving £80,000.  Fine Gael are shedding crocodile tears on the whole affair.  As for the Ombudsman, the suggestion that there should be a contribution from both <Col N="796" /> companies is unrealistic.  To ask for a contribution from the companies would be to ask them to cut a stick to strike themselves.  I doubt if any company could be charged with responsibility for funding an office which would in effect monitor their performance.  It would in some ways restrict the role of the Ombudsman and take away from him the independence which he now enjoys.</P>
    <P>Comparisons have been made with other EC countries which I do not think are very realistic.  We should take into consideration the fact that the population of the greater Manchester area is equivalent to the whole population of this country and that it is far easier to provide a cheaper service in an area of high population. Both Telecom Éireann and An Post have a social role to fulfil.  An Post provide daily deliveries to the most isolated parts of the country.  Telecom Éireann also provide services to isolated parts of the country without any extra charge.  If further pressure is applied on them at this stage it could very well upset the excellent work which they have done. As I have said already, if the proposals outlined in the Bill are adopted this would be a step backwards and would in effect create more bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the various sections in the Bill.  With regard to the quality of service, the success rate of STD calls improved from 74 per cent on vesting day to 97 per cent at the end of 1987.  The review group set a target of 96 per cent and already Telecom Éireann have exceeded that.  That is a fair performance. Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill call for the surpassing of the best standards prevailing in Europe.  It is fair to ask that we try to equal the standards which prevail in Europe but it is unrealistic to ask them to surpass them when the company are only four years old.  We have a scattered rural population and we are asking them to compete with, for example, the Scandinavian countries where the bulk of the population live in urban areas.  It is very easy to provide a service in these communities.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to the annual report <Col N="797" /> and key management performance indicators. This places the companies in a disadvantaged position because section 4 states:</P>
    <P>Each company shall, before the start of the financial year, publish the borrowing limits that have been agreed with the Minister, and an appraisal of any major investment proposed to be undertaken during the year.</P>
    <P>We hope that these two companies will be able to compete commercially in the market but yet they are expected to expose their plans in advance so that their competitors will know what they are doing.  I do not accept, as Deputy Bruton suggested, that there is a monopoly situation here, and this is reflected by their losses in the parcel area.  An Post have to compete with the courier service.  I think they will have a loss of £6 million in that area this year and if they were to show their hand, as suggested in section 4 of the Bill, I believe they would have further losses.  This is not a very realistic proposal. Deputy Bruton has greater experience in the business field than I have but nonetheless that is not a very realistic aspiration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the opposition in the telecommunications area, Telecom Éireann provide a service up to the door but the profitable services, such as the installations of the PBX and internal telephone systems, are done by private companies. The competition in this area is quite keen and if we were to agree to section 4 of the Bill this would put both companies in a disadvantaged position. The quality of the service being provided has improved considerably.  I am not satisfied that everything is completely satisfactory and I think I would be doing a disservice to the customers if I was to say otherwise, but nonetheless much has been achieved in the past four years.  I doubt if any company in the State sector could say with any degree of satisfaction that they have performed as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and I were part of the Government who introduced the original Bill.  Like many other people I expressed reservations about the under-financing <Col N="798" /> and capitalisation of the two companies but despite that they have overcome many problems.  An Post occupied probably the most derelict buildings in the State sector and most of the old post office buildings were in urgent need of repair.  The van fleet was long past its best and I can say with some degree of certainty that some vans were actually dangerous.  In 1979 there was a lengthy strike by the workers in the Post Office and industrial relations were not good. There was a bureaucratic set-up in the Post Office which was not conducive to commercial activity.</P>
    <P>I have to confess that the Government did not give the Post Office an opportunity to get involved in the really profitable area of activity, the banking area.  I made a plea at the time about the security of workers and the Minister responded very positively to the plea.  The Post Office were anxious to expand their banking activities and complete with the commercial banks but they did not get the power to do so.  I sincerely hope that the Minister, while he is in office, will give serious consideration to this because there are precedents right across the world which prove that the postal service can run a very effective banking system. It has offices in every village in the country and it has a service that would be well supported if it had State backing.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's leaselines, telex and data charges are now among the lowest in the EC and reductions in charges for international telephone calls will be introduced this autumn.  That represents progress despite all the problems which were spelt out by Deputy Bruton when he introduced the Bill.  Telephone charges may be high if measured against those in other countries.  That is what it may seem at first glance but I think Deputy Kitt mentioned that there is no limit on local calls in this country.  A local call in the Dublin area can stretch from Newtownmountkennedy up to Gormanstown and if those calls were charged at a commercial rate and the duration of the call was curtailed I have no doubt this would lead to further profits for Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Likewise, An Post are trying to compete with couriers in the parcel service area.  Couriers will bring parcels to main towns only and then post them on to the remoter parts of those districts.  It is very easy to be profitable if one brings parcels to the main towns as the couriers tend to do, and so siphon off business from An Post.  When it comes to going up every boreen there is no house inaccessible to the postal service.  This makes it extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 seeks to compare management performance against management in similar organisations in the EC taking into account productivity, manning and efficiency in the use of equipment.  This is not measuring like with like.  For example, most of the organisations do not provide operator assisted service unless it is paid for; in a number of EC states the operator assisted service is shut down at 5 p.m.  We provide a 24 hour STD service, something that our friends in Europe do not enjoy.  Curtailing this service would lead to further profitability.</P>
    <P>If the business side were subsidising private customers there would be further pressure for legislation to deregulate so as to avoid cross-subsidisation.  There are precedents.  For instance, this happened in the United States and as a result the cost of private telephones was increased.</P>
    <P>We now come back to the new subsection (4) to which I have already referred in regard to information being made available.  I do not think this would be advisable.  Other commercial organisations have not been compelled to do this, so why penalise the postal service by asking them to do it?</P>
    <P>The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to consult with the Minister for Communications to apply this Act to telecommunications. Therefore the proposal in the new subsection (5) is unnecessary.  I wonder did Deputy Bruton take this into account.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 9 he called for a code of practice and written contracts for customers confined now to the terms which <Col N="800" /> we suggest would be unfair.  I would like to know what is meant by a customer.  Is it somebody who posts a letter?  What type of contract would be involved?  This will create a further layer of bureaucracy. That they should be answerable I agree, but to suggest that there would be an independent contract for each customer is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Ombudsman report has been one of the more controversial issues.  It should be borne in mind that in 1986 three million bills were issued and this is quite a substantial number.  The Ombudsman's office dealt with 2,400 cases of which 230 were still outstanding. The Ombudsman recommended that rebates be paid in 317 cases out of the 2,400.  I am not satisfied with the response I get to representations I make, particularly to Telecom Éireann regarding the billing system.  There seems to be an attitude that the company is infallible and that the machine cannot go wrong.  That is why I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be capital expenditure to the extent of £20 million to overcome this problem.  I do not know why at this stage, despite this assurance, we should be asking for an amendment to the existing legislation.  What the Minister is doing is a very positive step in trying to overcome what is by far the most controversial side of the whole operation.  Added to that there will be a computerised fault handling system.  This was introduced in my own city in 1985-86 and it is now being introduced in Dublin.  This will considerably improve the procedures for handling telephone fault and will also provide better information for customers. The company has also installed free telephone facilities in each district for personal queries and this is quite innovative and welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to monopoly and to commercial freedom and said that the extensive privilege which is granted to the company under the 1983 Act is justified because of the vast amount of taxpayers' money invested in the network and the non-commercial commitments and responsibilities placed on the company. The taxpayer has made a massive <Col N="801" /> investment and that must be taken into account.  The number of telephone exchange lines has been increased from 600,000 in 1984 to 800,000 in 1987.  The staff numbers have been reduced from 18,300 to 14,500.  We now have a fully automatic telephone system.  This is progress on the part of Telecom Éireann.  In An Post, despite the fact that there was a 17 per cent increase in business, we have a reduction in staff of 500 and discussions on making further economies and I have no doubt that with the agreement signed between PTWU and An Post we will see further economies in this area. Discussions are ongoing and a productivity deal is now being implemented.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to support this Bill as I feel it is superfluous legislation dealing unfairly with companies who are making an honest effort.  I have my own complaints to make, and make them regularly, regarding the major fault, which is billing.  The other aspects of the service are reasonably satisfactory.  With the Minister's commitment to a further investment of £20 million to ensure that the customer gets a fair deal I feel they are making an honest effort and therefore I will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this Bill that worries me more than any other. The seriousness of my reservations on this aspect is such that I wish to open my remarks by drawing attention to it and appealing to the House to reject the provisions of this Bill because the fundamental wellspring of its conception is extremely narrow.  If the House were to accept this Bill as an authentic and desirable measure it would, at the same time, be passing a vote of censure on two semi-State companies, their boards and, more especially, their employees, right from the ones who perform the least paid tasks to those who lead and direct the highest professional managerial projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not merely a legislative measure; it is a statement to the effect that these two companies, An Post and Telecom Éireann, are negligent of the needs of their customers and unwilling to <Col N="802" /> give a level of service that is the customers' right.  It is a statement to the effect that these two companies and all the personnel that comprise them are incapable of giving due service to the public unless stung by the whiplash of a substantial legislative measure that imposes this fundamental duty upon them as a matter of law.  This Bill is not merely a no confidence motion in the directorate and the workforce of the companies but is a dangerous Bill that could be the forerunner and instigator of a plethora of contractual breach cases of such minimal content that the law courts would be log jammed with the resultant trivia to the detriment of pressing and substative processes of far greater importance to litigants than the sort of cases that this legislation would handsomely encourage.</P>
    <P>Let me take the House back again to the fundamental no confidence in the workforce aspect of the Bill.  If this Bill were to go through this House and become a precedent for further legislation in the area of public service or indeed any service provided by a company in either the public or private sector, I would foresee a level of trade union agitation which would be counter-productive to the very notion of improved service.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement must view this Bill with great misgiving and, in casting their mind's eye down the road to its consequences for workers in the service sector, see all the pitfalls, all the dangers and all the potential it has for worker discomfiture.  That is how I see the fundamental drift of this Bill.  I contend that these measures alone should make us all so wary of it that the House should register a no to its every provision.  This House has a duty to reassure the public at large that both Telecom Éireann and An Post are two companies of the highest calibre comparable with the best in Europe, or in the world, and in the most major aspects are better than any.</P>
    <P>It would be a bad day for the public service companies if this House were to fail to recognise the service they give. <Col N="803" /> In the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1988, there are elements which very much concern me.  There is a great dichotomy between the notion of public accountability and the erroneous notion of unbounded commercial disclosure.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Burke, has already drawn the attention of the House to the inherent fallacy of disclosing information for the laudable purpose of public accountability and the subsequent use of this or that information by competitors to undermine the competitiveness and economic viability of public companies. If this Government, or any Government, politician or political party were to introduce a similar Bill imposing such a public disclosure clause on the private sector, they would tell them where to go.  It is unthinkable and an unheard concept in the world of business.  Let us not forget for one moment that Telecom Éireann and An Post are as much part of the commercial milieu as any private company. To shackle them legislatively in the manner in which this Bill proposes would be to condemn them to operate at such a level of disadvantage that before long we would have a succession of Bills before this House calling for special moneys to save these important public services from extinction at the hands of world communications giants who would then hold them all to ransom.  I believe this section of the Bill is only a facilitation of industrial espionage.</P>
    <P>If we were to act in this unthinking way and overlook and overturn the basic principle of business practice and competitiveness, we would be the laughing stock of parliamentarians everywhere. We would be written into the textbooks of leading world schools of economics as a prime example of how to destroy rather than to support and foster enterprise. This is how this legislation would have its dire effect.  We cannot and must not go down this particular road.</P>
    <P>These two companies are but a few short years in existence.  They have developed and improved their services at an admirable rate and to a most laudable <Col N="804" /> degree.  If the matters purported to be in need of rectification are so pertinent as to warrant this Bill now, I cannot see for the life of me why the Coalition Government were so remiss during their term of office that they failed to introduce the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Deputies across the floor that they recognise the worth and the progressive development that was in train.  This current Bill is a superfluous piece of window dressing. The notion of public good is not to be denied.  The concept of public good can, however, lead one quickly and irrevocably into error.  I have already referred to the pitfalls &mdash; or should I say the bottomless pits &mdash; that abound in this Bill in relation to disclosure of information that is gold dust to the competitors, for example, giving advance notice by way of appraisal of major investment projects for the year ahead.  Look for a moment at the potential I have already referred to in the clause that would require companies to have written contracts with their customers.  This would open the floodgates and create an unsolvable dilemma for the courts.  It would be a supreme example of how the concept of public good could be exploited to become a mammoth public nuisance.  We have written contracts for many services, we have them where necessary and useful, where the Act is a brake on bad service. Wisdom tells us that too much of a good thing is counter-productive.  It might be popular, on the face of it, to make proposals such as this but a fleeting wave of public acclaim would, with hindsight, turn quickly to a clamour of public redress and redemption from the consequences of this quickly soured measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is unique in my opinion in one respect.  It consists of two double sheets but is crammed with amendments that are a legislative timebomb, a commercial entrepreneur's joy on beholding the crevice created for An Bord Telecom and An Post to fall into and sink without trace and the incalculable cost to the nation. <Col N="805" /> As I have said, this Bill in one major respect constitutes a massive vote of no confidence in and dire ingratitude to the workers in Telecom Éireann, the engineers, technicians and manual clerical workers and to all grades in An Post, both outdoor and indoor.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it a matter of public record that I appreciate the contribution of these companies to the life and good of this country.  I wish to dissociate myself from the implied criticism of them at the very core of this Bill.  If there is any fault to be found in the public service companies it is not at the level of staff but rather in the procedural wrangle that typifies bureaucracy.  The short name and the popular name for this procedural wrangle is red tape.  This Bill is a massive spool of red tape, of indeterminate length.  Its red tape potential is stretching on and on to infinity.  It is an extraordinary contradiction to put forth proposals to improve service to the public and to so enshrine the methodology of the improvement in tangles of red tape. This concept of red tape bureaucracy is so abhorrent to the general public that, if they were truely aware of the provisions of this Bill, they would raise a clamour for its fortright rejection on the grounds of its being against the public good.</P>
    <P>The final section of the Bill, in relation to the role of the Ombudsman, seems to be a duplication of the roles of the competent authorities in the area of auditing and I wonder if it is not a minimisation of the role of the Public Accounts Committee of this House.  The Bill contains two substantial sections relating to the codes of practice.  The same Bill empowers the Office of the Ombudsman to modify the codes of practice as he sees fit.  I am dumbfounded by this confusion of parliamentary practice and public modification which the Bill seeks to have us accept.  It does not make sense.  It creates a dangerous precedent. It appears to give a public servant powers in excess of those possessed by a Cabinet Minister.  Section 2 (4) seeks to require that the companies pay one half of the audit costs of the Office of the Ombudsman, costs which would have to be passed <Col N="806" /> on.  Would the next step be a charge for each member of the public, a public fee for the service of Office of the Ombudsman. In my view this is a vexatious Bill. It is not thought out.  It is an outstanding example of bad drafting, shallow thinking and of misunderstood and misapplied principles.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one or two comments made by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Flanagan last week.  When Deputy Bruton refers to levels of services for An Post, he is probably concerned mainly with price and quality.  Again, it is necessary to put these details into perspective.  For example, we have one of the most extensive post office networks, relative to our population, in Europe. When we talk about best practices and so forth in Europe, Europe is drastically curtailing its post office networks, closing numerous uneconomic offices in order to generate savings that can be passed on to the consumers at reduced prices.  How willing is Deputy Bruton to let us move towards European standards or are we to have one hand tied behind our backs?</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan in his contribution referred to the decision of An Post to set up consumer panels.  He expressed concern that the panels would be little more than talking shops.  The main point to be made here is that An Post are totally committed to the highest level of consumer service and that as evidence of this the company has decided to set up consumer panels.  The panels consist of groups of An Post customers and are representative of both personnel and business users.  They are also regionally representative.  The panels take the form of group discussions and are designed to identify areas where the required level of service is not being provided and where new services could be provided by An Post to meet the change in consumer demand.</P>
    <P>Another matter which Deputy Bruton raised was the liability question.  He was also worried about the immunity from liability enjoyed by An Post under the existing legislation in regard to delay in operating the postal service.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two points here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> First, the immunity enjoyed by An Post is no less and no greater than that enjoyed by the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Indeed the immunity is not unique to Ireland.  I understand that in the majority if not all EC countries, there is a similar immunity from the liability for the postal service.  If Deputy Bruton is seeking to have the immunity removed from An Post and to have the company operate in an environment different from that of other EC countries this would make An Post open to claims that could add significantly to the cost of operating our postal service.  If so, there would be an inevitable increase in our postal charges. How could An Post seek to reach EC levels of charges if that was the case?</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to refer to the speech made by our Minister for Communications, Deputy Ray Burke, in which he went to some lengths to set out the problems that would arise if it were decided to remove the existing exemption in relation to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  He added, however, that the question of removal of the exemption was currently being considered. Obviously, this area requires detailed assessment.</P>
    <P>On the economic performance of semi-State bodies, Deputy Bruton highlighted the point that investment projects should be appraised by the company on the implication that if appraisal did not show sufficiently attractive yield the investment should not be undertaken.  As Deputy Michael Kitt said, this approach seems to make sense economically but when one looks at the duty imposed by statute on BTE a different picture emerges. In everyone's constituency, including mine of Dublin North, telephone booths or boxes in certain parts are provided for social reasons only.  We would like to see both our State companies maintaining that position which they were set up for.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to what Deputy Bruton had to say.  We have a common interest in continuing the development of the companies, ensuring that the charges are kept at a minimum rate consistent with the requirements of the legislation and seeing that the companies provide comprehensive and efficient service to their customers.  There is need and scope for more improvements in both companies, but by their plans for investment in improving the services to their customers, both companies within the present mandate are capable of overcoming any problems.  However, I am not satisfied that Deputy Bruton's approach to the problems he has outlined is appropriate. Therefore, I join with the Minister in asking the proposer to reconsider his proposal for a Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton for bringing the measure before the House.  It is more than justified.  The Deputy in his opening address presenting the Bill has given proof positive of the need for and <i>raison d'être</i> of the measure. Members on both sides of the House if they are genuine and honest could quote chapter and verse in relation to the need to provide consumer protection from semi-State organisations such as An Post and BTE.  One presupposes that when we have semi-State or State organisations everything is right, there is fair play and everyone gets cothrom na féinne.  Unfortunately, this is not so.</P>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan who makes the point that we are in this Bill putting extra pressure on those semi-State organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> Far from putting additional pressure, all we are asking for is efficiency, competence and economy of scale.  He goes on to make great play of the fact that if these companies expose their finances that will have an adverse effect on their viability and competitiveness.  Here we are talking about two semi-State organisations of monolithic proportions who have an absolute monopoly of the postal and telecommunications services.  To suggest that An Post might be under any threat whatever from the fairly recent inception of courier services is facile in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wright went even further and accused the Bill of having industrial espionage intent.  He said that these organisations, only a few years in existence, are weak and vulnerable and would undoubtedly wilt under the competitiveness of making public exposure of their accounts.  I could not accept that for a moment.  They both inherited very healthy long-established State organisations under the aegis of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He then admitted that we have one of the most expensive postal networks in Europe. One of the reasons for the measure is to try to bring about proportion and a sense of economy and competitiveness in the postal and telecommunication charges.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a measure of consumer protection and we must do everything to protect the consumer. Deputy Wright towards the conclusion of his speech mentioned the need to retain non-viable telephone booths in areas because of their social dimension.  I would like to take that a stage further and give my experience from rural Ireland in relation to the post boxes and postal services. I am going to focus on that aspect alone, not from a social dimension &mdash; there is a social dimension in it &mdash; but from the point of view of where exactly An Post stand on this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of bringing a more efficient structure into the postal service and with the erection of post boxes where these are erected by consent, and I agree that many people if <Col N="810" /> properly approached would agree voluntarily to accept them.  Indeed, An Post are obliged by the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, section 65, to do this.  The section provides that the company shall not be required to deliver a postal packet to the addressee's residence or office provided the company makes acceptable alternative arrangements to make it available to the addressee.  I might justifiably ask, acceptable to whom?</P>
    <P>As public representatives, in midsummer 1987 we were approached by various consumers, and my experience was very much the same as that of other rural Deputies.  In isolated rural areas post boxes were erected against the will of the consumer.  In some cases people were led to believe they had absolutely no option or choice in the matter.  Others were told that if they accepted them this year they could have them free gratis and for nothing but next year they must pay.  Another instance was subtle intimidation when people were told, &ldquo;You are the only one in the village who will not accept&rdquo; and in other cases, such as a pub in Tourmakeady the consumer learned from the postman, &ldquo;We are erecting a postbox at the head of the boreen next Tuesday morning&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I decided on foot of those complaints to contact An Post and find out what the position was.  I was told by Mr. McCabe of the letters and postal division of An Post that roadside delivery boxes were being provided on a voluntary basis throughout the country and it was not intended to compel anyone to accept them at that stage.  On 29 January 1988 Mr. McCabe reiterated: &ldquo;While provision of roadside boxes is on a voluntary basis at present, we obviously could not operate on a basis of removing boxes when people changed their minds, having initially accepted them&rdquo;.  There was supposed to be no element of compulsion. Let me quote from a letter dated 26 January 1988 sent to a consumer in Skibbereen, in a village near Leap, County Cork, and signed by B. O'Connor, head postmaster: &ldquo;I have to inform you that unless you agree to the use of a roadside <Col N="811" /> letter-box your letters will be left at Leap Post Office from Monday next, February 1, at an annual cost of £27.50 payable in advance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a full file of letters.  I will quote from another: &ldquo;Concerning the postbox, when the man called at my house he said they were putting the postbox up at the end of the road and he gave us absolutely no choice in the matter.&rdquo;  In another case: &ldquo;We are objecting especially to the fact that we were not given a clear option to refuse or accept these post boxes in the first place by An Post.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another case, a woman complained that she had two children under three years of age and that, hail, rain or snow, she had to leave her children asleep or march them a half a mile to see if there was any post at the end of the lane.  A letter was sent to me from An Post stating that there is no question of compelling elderly people, the disabled or the handicapped to accept postboxes.  The acting head postmaster in Claremorris post office, in a letter dated 13 November, said it was not their intention to ask old age pensioners or invalids living alone to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I also have a letter from a person which states:</P>
    <P>I don't know who the man was who called here but I told him I was not able to walk up that hill.  I have to get a car to take me to Mass on Sunday and to town as I have chronic arthritis and my husband is aged 77 years and has a heart condition.  I wish to point out that An Post allegation in relation to a son living with us is not true. We have no son living with us, we are absolutely on our own.</P>
    <P>We chronicled all these letters and sent them to An Post.  They are valid complaints. They come from people who were not initially aware of their rights and who, in some cases, seem to have been compelled to accept the post box. They did not have a clear choice in the matter and, in some cases, subtle intimidation was used.  Time and time again I requested An Post to notify people in <Col N="812" /> advance of their entitlements, to stream-line and structure the scheme and to administer it properly.  This has not happened. Those letters were published in the newspaper and the people who felt they had been deluded subsequently took the postboxes down because they had not been presented with a choice in the matter.  What happened?  These people &mdash; each and every one of them &mdash; now have to walk, in some cases up to a mile and a half, to a local post office on a daily basis to check if there is mail for them.</P>
    <P>I always had a tremendous amount of respect for An Post and for their predecessor, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  However, An Post are a massive semi-State organisation which, last year, had a turnover of £192 million and made an alleged profit of £2 million. They have now changed a traditional system without putting a notice in the newspaper or running an advertisement on radio or television.  They did not send out letters in advance even through they had free post, like public representatives.</P>
    <P>This organisation are handling tax-payers' money and administering the national lottery.  My honest assessment of the situation is that this is a public relations disaster.  An Post have blundered badly in relation to this matter. They have made a hamfisted job of what should have been a professionally handled innovation.  They managed to mix a certain amount of slyness with thuggery and subtle intimidation.  I urge the Minister to use his powers of persuasion with An Post to take that matter back to base, to start from scratch and to introduce basic administrative procedures, to notify people in advance, get them to sign a consent form and to get the goodwill of people right across the board.</P>
    <P>In one of the letters I mentioned, a person went to a commissioner of oaths to sign an affidavit to prove what was said.  An Post maintained that a number of the households accepted the postboxes. In one instance they said that children accepted it.  I will quote from an affidavit, from a person of 18 years from Carramore, Killasser, Swinford, County Mayo:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> On the 29th of November, 1987, I was working on my parents' farm.  My mother and father were in Dublin at the time and my aunt was at the health centre in Swinford.  During the day a person arrived at my parents' house and said he was from An Post.  He said he was putting postboxes at the end of the road.  He did not ask for permission to erect the postboxes.  He further asked me were my parents at home and I informed him that my parents were in Dublin.  I did not at any time, either on my own behalf or on behalf of my parents, agree to An Post erecting postboxes at the end of the road.  I make this affidavit within the knowledge save or otherwise appearing and I believe same to be true.</P>
    <P>The parents of the person who wrote that letter now have to walk to Killasser post office daily to check if there is mail.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to intervene and to bring sanity to bear on this matter before it gets out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>There is merit in having roadside boxes where there is acceptance across the board and where someone is in a position to collect the post.  However, there must be ethical standards in this regard.  I know that An Post are an independent organisation but the manner in which they have handled this public relations exercise augurs very badly for their future.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Higgins and Deputy Richard Bruton for allowing me some time to speak on this Bill.  I am particularly grateful in view of the fact that I oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point is that public accountability in regard to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann has been laid down in the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1982.  The existing procedures in regard to public accountability are laid down as follows: they ensure that the following role of the Government in relation to both bodies provides for these safeguards &mdash; Government appointment of the boards, Government approval of corporate plans, Government approval of capital expenditure, Government <Col N="814" /> approval of prices, adherence to Government policy on pay and Government control of licensing.  If one takes these key areas as an example of the degree of public accountability for a company like Bord Telecom Éireann, it is clearly the case that a bond exists between democratic control, accountability and commercial performance, which was the whole purpose of setting up An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  They were to operate on commercial lines.  One of the results is the erection of the post boxes to which Deputy Higgins referred.</P>
    <P>The Bill consists of a whole list of complaints about An Post without any regard to the proper procedure for setting out a Bill.  However, the complaint made by Deputy Higgins has not been dealt with because An Post must operate on commercial criteria.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that it is totally wrong that these post boxes should be erected without people's consent.  However, this was the purpose of their public accountability aspect, not to tie them up in regard to commercial operations.  The Bill struck that balance but it adds nothing to the case for public accountability.  There is bureaucracy down along the line and we are providing further platforms for public representatives to attack State enterprise and to downgrade it.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that a Deputy whose party support the policy of liberalisation and deregulation &mdash; one of the big aspects of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats' policy &mdash; should want to increase regulation for public enterprise which is the reverse of what is proposed for the private sector, to take the State off our backs, etc.  The idea is that we could do fantastic things if the State was not in our way.  We are told that if there was less accountability of all kinds the public sector could do wonders.  However, some people want public enterprise endeavours in the commercial field tied up with all types of red tape.  The establishment of a State company for telecommunications services was by way of a desire for a more responsive and commercial orientated performance.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I said that I was rather alarmed at the terms of the Bill.  In my view the effect of them will be that it will be more difficult for everybody, with the exception of the wealthy litigant who can guarantee payment to his legal team, to have a case brought before a court.  I will defer my arguments in regard to the senior counsel until we reach the relevant amendment.  The ceasing of that practice together with the abolition of the jury system will make it more difficult for litigants of moderate means to have their case tried before the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, is loaded in favour of the wealthy corporation and against the person of moderate means or a poor person.  The jury system lends itself to settlement.  Insurance companies are more likely to settle a case listed to be tried by a jury than if it is to go before a judge sitting alone.  It may be that a litigant <Col N="818" /> will be awarded less than if his case was tried by jury.  The Constitution guarantees trial by a jury in serious criminal cases and I have never heard it suggested that that right should be taken away from an accused person.  In the course of his contribution Deputy McDowell recommended that trial by jury be retained in what he regarded as very serious claims in the High Court for damages for personal injuries.  In my view all claims for damages for personal injuries listed for hearing by the High Court are serious matters for plaintiffs involved.  The plaintiff should have the right to have his or her case heard by a judge sitting with a jury.</P>
    <P>From time to time when the question of trial by jury is raised the argument is put forward that we are the only country in the western world that has retained trial by jury and that we should have got rid of that system long ago.  Those who express that view do not say in the same breath that we are the only country in the western world that does not have a full blown free legal aid system.  They have had such a system in the UK for almost 50 years.  I do not know when trial by jury was abolished there but under their free legal aid system a person with an arguable case can have his or her case dealt with by the courts.  It is preposterous that we should consider making radical changes such as the abolition of juries or reducing the number of senior counsel without at the same time introducing a system of free legal aid.  However, we have been told that we could not do that because the system would cost the earth.  We have also been told that we cannot continue with the present system of trial by jury because insurance premiums are too high.</P>
    <P>Who is to pay the cost or bear the loss? In my view the cost will be borne by the unfortunate individual who may be maimed for life, the person who may be deprived of his or her ability to earn a living.  Will those people be given compensation which will be less than adequate?  I had expected to hear some Members suggesting that we should have <Col N="819" /> a personal injuries policy under which the relatives of a person killed in an accident would be paid £1,000 or the person who would lose an eye or a limb would get some type of mickey mouse contribution. I hope we are not on the road to such a system, although what I heard earlier gave me the impression that we were travelling along that road.</P>
    <P>This evening we were told that the cost of insurance premiums is reducing.  I am glad to hear that but I find it difficult to accept that hard-headed insurance companies reduced premiums in 1986 when the Bill under discussion was published. At the time the Bill was introduced it was strenuously opposed by the largest party then in the Dáil who were later elected to Government.  At that time it did not seem likely that the Bill would get on the Statute Book but strange things have happened.  In my view insurance companies reduced premiums because they were too high.  Down the years insurance companies have been inclined to exaggerate. I was practising at the time when the old workman's compensation code was abolished and I can recall insurance companies telling us that they had been losing money in the years that code was in operation.  Those with claims under that code almost had to get down on their hands and knees to get anything from the insurance companies but when a Bill was introduced to abolish it they lobbied right, left and centre to have it retained.</P>
    <P>I believe the insurance companies will reduce premiums in the case of those categories for which there is justification. It is not reasonable or fair to tell young people that this Bill, if it becomes law, will have the effect of reducing their premiums. Statistics prove that people in their teens or early twenties are worse risks than mature people in middle age or in their thirties.  Insurance is a business and if companies were to carry on their business in the same manner as a couple of companies I mentioned earlier, they would go the same way.</P>
    <P>The practice of having a jury system and two senior counsel is very important and should not be interferred with on any <Col N="820" /> account until we replace it by a proper free legal aid Bill.  This Bill was introduced as a political measure.  I do not use that phrase in any offensive way, but it was introduced as a carrot to young people to make them believe it would reduce their premiums.  It has been carried on by the Government on that basis. It is bad to tamper or tinker with our courts system solely to attain a purpose which has no direct bearing on the courts system.</P>
    <P>A tribunal hearing a personal injury case does not mind whether the defendant is insured or not.  If one of the advocates in the case were to disclose to a jury the fact that the person was not insured or was insured, the jury would be immediately discharged and a new jury sworn in to hear the case.  That is not a matter which should influence the jury. They are supposed to bring in a verdict on the facts before them and on the basis of what would be fair compensation.  Yet we are devoting all our time and attention in this debate not to convincing ourselves whether this Bill will be good or bad for the people who most need to be thought about, the injured people who have lost limbs or been incapacitated for life.  We are devoting our time to thinking how this Bill will affect people who want to drive negligently, to put it at its best, and cause severe damage to people with whom they come in contact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to respond to some of the points raised by a number of speakers.  Our first amendment applies to subsection (3) of the Minister's amendment.  The Government propose that sections relating to the abolition of juries will not apply to an action where damages claimed consist only of damages for false imprisonment or for intentional trespass to the person.  Our amendment proposes to take out the words &ldquo;consist only of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;comprises in whole or in part of a claim for&rdquo;.  Each of these amendments is consequential upon the failure of our initial ground of fundamental opposition to the abolition of juries or the restriction of the availability of juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> An action is rarely launched on the narrow and single ground of damages for false imprisonment only or intentional trespass only, or only in relation to a fact arising from those two claims.  In every area of civil litigation there are attendant or ancillary statutory obligations and duties existing by reason of a ministerial order, statutory instrument or by law. For that reason it is rare to find pleadings drawn in the exact singular under the headings indicated here.  We are suggesting in our first amendment that the section should be drafted to allow a definition of the action to suggest that its principal or major cause is false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person.</P>
    <P>That is the gravamen or the central leg of the cause of action and that type of action should have the right to a hearing before a jury at the option of the parties. For that reason I would ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment in the name of The Worker's Party, dealing with that matter.  It is fairly obvious that it will lead to pressure on litigants to be excessively narrow in the basis upon which they draft their cause of action even though the substantial ground will be one of false imprisonment or intentional trespass.  Nonetheless, if they want to opt for the availability of a jury they will be unduly constrained and obliged to restrict the drafting of their pleadings to that narrow base and that could have important implications for the progress and development of the action after inception.  What is being suggested here is, if the gravamen or the major cause of the action is one relating to assault, intentional trespass of the person or false imprisonment and there are other added ancillary, alternative or additional grounds of complaint, that type of action should be allowed to be brought before a jury.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to make the point that the Government accept that there are cases where it is desirable to allow to remain available to a litigant the option of trial by jury.  That is one of the more important points which I want to come back to on the overall question of the <Col N="822" /> abolition of juries.  It should be made clear to all Deputies in this House who want to address seriously the question of litigation that we are not talking about the total abolition of juries.  The reality is that juries will continue in place in a large number of litigation cases after this legislation is passed.  There will be practical duties and obligations on registrars to assemble jury panels at the sittings of the High Court throughout the country after the passing of this legislation.  It is recognised by the Government and by the Opposition, although the Opposition support the Government on this proposal, that juries are a desirable element in litigation in certain circumstances.  Our argument is the extent to which those circumstances exist or are to be availed of.</P>
    <P>The second amendment in the name of The Workers' Party deals with what actions the legislation should affect when it becomes law.  The Government proposal is that from the day the legislation is passed into law &mdash; there are suggested dates as to when that will be and there have been comments as to whether or not we will achieve them &mdash; the cases to be heard, irrespective of when they were commenced, will not be entitled to avail of a jury.  The Workers' Party are proposing the amendment that the legislation curtailing the availability of juries should not apply to actions or causes of actions &ldquo;if a writ commencing the action was issued before the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.  I mentioned this briefly the last day and I want to make the point again. At the end of the day, given the practical point that registrars and the High Court will be assembling juries for other actions and will have to go through all the necessary ground work for that, all those people who initiated their pleadings and proceedings in the High Court in the hope or expectation of a jury, not realising that this sinister legislation was being contemplated, should be allowed see their proceedings through to the end under the same conditions as when they made their decision to initiate.</P>
    <P>It will present no practical difficulties because panels of juries will be assembled <Col N="823" /> anyway.  It will not add significantly to delays because there are no delays in the High Court now.  If anything, civil actions in the High Court are being heard much too quickly from the practitioners' point of view.  They much prefer a longer preparation of cases where intricate medical matters have to be watched, assessed and observed.  They want to know the full sequela before they make an ultimate quantitative decision on the damages. They want to see will there be full recovery from occupational injury or accident before making a decision.  The situation now applies, certainly in Dublin, the single greatest centre for these kinds of actions, that if you set your action down you can expect to have it finalised, as far as the High Court is concerned, within a year.  I want to refer to the arguments of people that insurance premiums will be reduced as a result of this legislation. That is utterly fallacious and without foundation.  I do not think it is unreasonable for this House to allow people who initiate proceedings the right to see those proceedings through under the conditions in which they were initially embarked upon.</P>
    <P>The final amendment in the name of The Workers' Party relates as a consequence of amendment No. 2 in our name being accepted.  Amendment No. 3 is perhaps a preface to some degree because, if amendment No. 2 is accepted, subsection (6) of the proposals of the Government should not arise.  Those are the peripheral amendments of The Workers' Party.  As I have said, they are consequent on the other issue being lost.  One has to recognise that a counter-proposal to a Government suggestion will be defeated. Nonetheless, a number of points must be made in answer to some of the arguments that have been advanced in defence of what has been suggested by Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, in his opening remarks, said that nothing has changed since the Government of the day introduced the Bill in 1986 and for that reason he and his party feel committed to supporting the proposal.  One has to bow to the consistency of the position.  I wish I <Col N="824" /> could borrow his remarks and say to the Government: &ldquo;Why not reflect the same degree of consistency and stand by the position you so admirably stood by in the course of the debate on this issue not so long ago when the point was made that we should not proceed with this proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two major reasons why this legislation is being promoted.  First, it will assist in the administration of the courts business and in making the proceedings of the High Court more efficient, speedy and effective.  Secondly, it will lead to a reduction in insurance costs which, in turn will lead to reduced premiums.  Both those premises need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The administrative necessity of assembling juries will not have been disposed of as a result of this legislation, in its present form, being passed.  The registrar of the High Court will still have to assemble jury panels, ensure they attend, and make facilities for their accommodation once they attend a sitting of the High Court.  There is no way one would be able to assemble sittings of the High Court in their various orders into jury and non-jury sittings given the nature of the actions that will be involved.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the efficiency with which civil actions are being disposed of &mdash; and have been for the past two years &mdash; with the so-called imposition of the jury is such that we cannot effectively improve on what is already there in terms of speed and getting the cases dealt with. That point must be supported by the minuteness of the percentage of civil actions that ultimately seek a hearing before a jury.  Two per cent of all actions set down for hearing eventually avail of a hearing by a jury.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but could I dissuade him from engaging in a wide-ranging speech which, I think he will agree, is inappropriate on Committee Stage, especially when there is a time factor involved in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your point but <Col N="825" /> unfortunately we have all been labouring under the difficulty that because of the extent of the Government's amendment this is almost a new Bill and we are having difficulty addressing this point on Committee Stage.  I admit my remarks may have been wide ranging but, in fairness, most of the contributions today have also been wide ranging.  However, I will not be much longer.</P>
      <P>The argument is being advanced that by abolishing the jury in civil action we will have a reduction in insurance premiums. For all the reasons that have been advanced by more senior, skilled and experienced Deputies in the area of civil litigation, I have to make the point that the added cost factor for the insurance companies on the administrative side of a jury hearing, given that so few cases go to hearing, is negligible.  On the other side, it is said that juries are so unpredictable that the level of settlement is unrealistically high.  That point is made by people who are far more experienced and seasoned than I in this area, but I believe that a reflection on settlement figures will show that most judges, in the High Court in particular, are capable of assessing damages as well as anyone could expect.  If one read newspaper reports one will see that the single greatest settlements of damages for personal injury have been made by judges sitting alone.  I do not believe the argument that juries are more outrageous in their assessment of damages stands up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney made the point that at least from the Circuit to the High Court, one has the opportunity of a rehearing by way of appeal.  From the High Court to the Supreme Court it is on transcript, but more often than not it is on judge's note because stenographers, as an exception, are employed to report accurately the proceedings in the High Court.  What happens is one gets a judge's ruling or decision going to the Supreme Court from the High Court on review, not on transcript but on a note resume prepared by the judge.  For that reason I believe the prospect of reviewing downwards an assessment by a judge from the High <Col N="826" /> Court to the Supreme Court is very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>All that is put in here on the basis of restricting access to juries.  Deputies on this side say it is not a good decision because, at the end of the day, the jury is a safeguard mechanism.  It is rarely resorted to in this type of litigation, but it is a useful institution of redress by the man in the street who may have a distrust of lawyers alone, or a misgiving about a judge alone, or a person alone, making the ultimate decision on the issues of fact or quantum in his case.  He may want his peers to listen to his case and decide, yes or no, on his claim and the extent of that claim.  That principle is accepted and acknowledged, in part at least, in the actions that have been exempted by Government in this legislation from restriction of availability of jury.</P>
    <P>If it is right and proper in cases of intentional personal trespass, or false imprisonment, or defamation of character, to retain the availability of choice of jury, what are the considerations that are different in the other areas of personal injury we are seeking to restrict at this stage when so little cost element is involved and when no saving will be made to the consumer by reason of this change alone?</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Barrett that I do not have the slightest doubt that this legislation will achieve absolutely no saving or reduction in the premium to the consumer.  There are many other proposals that have been discussed in this House by way of Private Members' Business and at Question Time which would have a meaningful impact on the levels of premiums, but this proposal &mdash; I may be wrong about this prediction but I do not believe I am &mdash; will achieve not one iota of a saving.  If one wants to talk about reality, that is the ultimate reality that has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government in the only way I can from this very isolated position in the House to consider afresh their proposal in this regard.  If they are intent upon it, I ask the Minister to consider at least accepting some of the amendments in the name of The Workers' Party as a <Col N="827" /> means of alleviating the impact on and ameliorating the condition of the litigant who will, sadly, be at a major loss and disadvantage if this proposal proceeds tonight.</P>

      <P>I am opposing the three amendments tabled by Deputy McCartan.</P>
      <P>The first of these amendments would restore a loophole that could exist in the text of the original Bill, and would enable a plaintiff in a personal injury case to evade the intention of the Bill by including a claim for assault in his action &mdash; say where he alleged that there had been a separate assault on him following a car accident.</P>
      <P>The purpose of subsection (3) of my amendment No. 1 is to close off that loophole.  Deputy McCartan, in moving his amendment, acknowledged that lawyers will attempt to evade the provisions of the Bill by clever drafting of pleadings, so it is most important from my point of view to eliminate any possible loopholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his second amendment, Deputy McCartan wants to allow jury trials for all personal and fatal injury cases where the proceedings have been initiated before the commencement of the Act. The Bill as introduced in 1986, contained a saving provision for all cases that had been set down for trial before the Bill is enacted.  In my amendment No. 10 I am proposing to substitute a new commencement provision in the Bill to replace the existing saver, so that all jury trials would end after 31 July 1988, that is, the end of the current legal year.  It is <Col N="829" /> over three years since the change from jury trial was announced by the previous Administration, and over two years since the Bill was introduced.  I think that generous notice has been given of the change.  Also, I am anxious to ensure that the economic benefits expected from the passage of the Bill can be realised quickly and passed on to the public.  That cannot happen while jury trials continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan, in moving his amendment, spoke about the small percentage of personal injury cases that go to trial.  This obscures the fact that thousands of civil jury actions for personal and fatal injuries are disposed of each year in the High Court and that many hundreds of these cases go all the way to trial.  These are not minuscule numbers, as the Deputy would have us believe.  The Deputy's third amendment is consequential on this second amendment which I am opposing.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, in 1984-85 the number of jury actions set down was 5,385, the number disposed of was 5,033 and the number to trial 700 to 800. In 1985-86, the numbers set down were 5,394, the number disposed of 5,372 and approximately the same number to trial.</P>

      <P>That is not a small percentage, 15 per cent.  In 1984 in England, the number of personal injury cases set down was 31,000, number of cases tried 1,300 to 1,800 &mdash; 4 to 5 per cent.  I shall not delay the debate because the main debate must be responded to, also.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of amendment No. 1 is to replace section 1 of the Bill, with a more comprehensive provision.  Section 1 contains the substantive provision in the Bill to abolish the use of juries in personal and fatal injury cases in the High Court.  Amendment No. 1 repeats that provision &mdash; in subsection (1) of the proposed new section 1, but adds further provisions of a technical nature to eliminate possible loopholes that could arise under section 1 of the Bill as drafted. There is no change in substance proposed in the amendment.  The main reason that the additional provisions are needed is that many personal injury actions also include claims for other heads of damage &mdash; for example, damage to property &mdash; and defendants in these actions can include counter-claims against the plaintiffs and join other parties as co-defendants. It was necessary to provide that none of these aspects could be used in any way to get around the basic provision that personal injury cases should be tried without a jury.  It was also necessary to include a transitional provision to enable any jury trial that may be in progress on the cut-off date proposed in the Bill to continue until the trial is completed. Some Deputies acknowledged the need for these additional provisions in their contributions to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I would like to make a few comments in response to the individual contributions by Deputies in the debate on amendment No. 1.  Deputy Barrett, while supporting the substantive provision in the Bill, thought that the benefits in terms of insurance costs were being exaggerated, while the rights of plaintiffs to be properly represented in court were being ignored.  The insurance industry have for long maintained that the use of juries to decide personal injury cases was the main cause of the high cost of liability insurance.  There will be a heavy onus on <Col N="831" /> insurance companies to reduce premiums when this Bill comes into effect.</P>
    <P>The question of the level of legal representation that plaintiffs need is a separate but related matter.  The Bar Council have already agreed that some reduction is possible in the number of counsel who need to be briefed at present.  I can assure the House that the interests of plaintiffs will be carefully protected in any regulations that I may make under the new powers proposed in amendment No. 8. There will be no question of leaving plaintiffs, who have to appear in court, without proper representation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested that I should consider increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  Deputy Taylor has tabled an amendment on the same lines.  This is an issue which goes beyond the scope of the present Bill, and it would require careful, separate study.  There could be staffing and resource implications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and Deputy Kelly said that we were copying the British system and Deputy Taylor said that the British system had been described as a lottery by a leading barrister there.  The plain fact is that no other European country uses juries to decide personal injury cases.  As far as I know, the only country in the world that uses juries for that purpose is the USA and it has been said that an insurance crisis exists there.  Last year, the civil jury system was abolished in Northern Ireland for personal and fatal injury cases, following an independent review of the position there involving widespread consultations with interested parties.  There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> drawn up between the Government and the social partners to make a similar change here as part of a comprehensive package to tackle the problems of the cost of liability insurance.  I wonder was the eminent QC Deputy Taylor referred to advocating the return of jury trials?</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham inquired if any results were known about the changes <Col N="832" /> made in Northern Ireland.  The change there did not come into operation until September last and I am not aware of any analysis of the results.  The interesting fact is that the main reason for the change was to bring more consistency and predictability into awards and to reduce legal costs.  Benefits were expected to arise in relation to the cost of liability insurance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham was concerned that the public would not perceive judges as being as impartial as juries in deciding cases.  I do not think this will be a problem considering the range of civil actions judges already decide in the High Court, and in the Circuit Court, without a jury.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor is opposed to the Bill and said that the insurance companies were responsible for the three counsel practice by voluntarily briefing three counsel in each case.  The Irish Insurance Federation have written to me to say that when the Courts Bill, 1986, is passed they intend to brief only one counsel in most cases and a maximum of two counsel in exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is also opposed to the abolition of civil juries in these cases. He said that juries are an essential part of the democratic process and that judges would be as unpredictable and unreliable as juries.  The point that juries are part of the democratic process would be more important if juries were involved in all civil trials but that is not the case, even in the High Court where judges alone decide a whole range of cases, including contract, debt and matrimonial actions. Even in the particular area of personal injuries actions, jury trials were abolished for such cases in the Circuit Court in 1972 with no apparent ill-effects.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 8 in the name of the Minister involves the insertion of a new section.  Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 8 is an alternative to amendment No. 1.  I suggest that we take amendments Nos. 9 and 9a, with amendment No. 8.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are consequential on amendments Nos. 8 and 9a respectively.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 4.  &mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding any provision made by or under statute, or any rule of law or practice, the Minister <Col N="836" /> may specify by regulations the maximum number of counsel in respect of whom costs may be allowed, on taxation by a Taxing Master, for payment by another party or other parties to an action in relation to which section 1 (1) of this Act applies, or a question of fact or an issue arising in such an action, or an appeal from a decision in such an action or on such a question or issue.</P>
    <P>(2) Regulations under this section may&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) specify different numbers of counsel (whether junior counsel or senior counsel or both) in relation to different classes (designated in such manner and by reference to such matters as the Minister considers appropriate) of such actions, questions, issues or appeals as aforesaid,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  provide for the allowance, on taxation by a Taxing Master, for payment by another party or other parties to such actions, questions, issues or appeals as aforesaid, of the costs in respect of different counsel or different numbers of counsel engaged in relation to different stages of such actions, questions, issues or appeals. </P>
    <P>(3) Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if either such House, within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, passes a resolution annulling the regulation, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder. </P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section in the Bill to provide for the regulation of the number of counsel appearing in actions covered by the Bill whose costs may be recovered by a successful litigant. The provisions extend to appeals from such actions heard by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is an enabling provision <Col N="837" /> empowering the Minister for Justice to make regulations specifying the maximum number of counsel whose costs may be recovered by a party on a taxation of costs in an action covered by the Bill. The regulations would not affect the right of parties to instruct whatever number of counsel they wish.  They would merely limit the costs that the successful party could recover from an unsuccessful party in an action in respect of his counsel's fees.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a) will empower the Minister to specify different numbers of counsel, whether junior counsel or senior counsel, for different classes of cases covered by the Bill.  The provision is a flexible one which will enable personal injury and dependency actions to be classified in whatever manner I would consider appropriate for the purpose of specifying the maximum number of counsel whose costs can be recovered.  While the monetary value of a case and its complexity would be important factors in such classification, it will be necessary to consider this matter in detail before the regulations are finalised.  The regulations could include a provision to enable the costs of additional counsel to be allowed in appropriate circumstances, at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>This degree of flexibility is necessary because a standard provision that would allow costs for a certain predetermined number of counsel in every High Court action, irrespective of the nature and demands of the case, is not appropriate. It could be argued that one counsel would be able to handle many personal injury cases in the High Court, when one counsel can deal with all cases of up to £15,000 in value in the Circuit Court.  Also it might be regarded as justifiable to have up to three counsel in some very exceptional cases such as high value cases that might also involve specialist areas of the law.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) will enable the regulations to make provision for cases where different individual counsel share appearances in a case, without exceeding the maximum number of counsel whose costs <Col N="838" /> may be recovered as specified in the regulations. It happens from time to time that an individual counsel will substitute for another in a case for good reason, for example, illness, or because a case may take considerably longer to hear than expected, causing a clash of commitments for the original counsel.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) will also enable a distinction to be made between different stages of an action when specifying the maximum number of counsel whose costs can be allowed.  For example, it would be possible to provide that in some cases the costs of one counsel would be allowed for all stages preliminary to the hearing, or for all interlocutory work, while allowing a court to certify that two counsel should be allowed for the hearing of the action. Subsection (3) is a standard provision that regulations must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and provides that regulations may be annulled by a negative resolution passed by either House within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the debate that has occurred already in the House on the proposal to empower me to make such regulations, I would now agree that a provision for a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas would be preferable. Accordingly, I am prepared to accept the terms of the amendment put down by Deputy Barrett.  This will have the effect of substituting a provision for a positive resolution by both Houses for the provision in subsection (3) of my amendment No. 8.</P>
    <P>Generally, my attitude to the proposed new power to make regulations is that I should wait until experience has been gained of the operation of non-jury trials before considering the question of regulations. Both the Bar Council and the Irish Insurance Federation have given commitments to the number of counsel who will be briefed when civil juries cease in these cases.  Also, trials are expected to be shorter and simpler under the new arrangements.  This should tie up barristers for shorter periods in court.  If, as expected, most cases are settled at an earlier stage, this should improve the position about listing cases for trial which <Col N="839" /> has been frequently cited by the Bar Council as the main cause of multiple representation by counsel.</P>
    <P>Finally the report of the Fair Trades Commission into the legal profession, including the question of the number of counsel required in a particular case, is due out fairly soon and I would like to consider that report before deciding what action is necessary.  I intend to await these developments before considering what regulations I should make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move my amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made unless a resolution approving of the draft is passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I said the last day, this side of the House are totally opposed to the method being used by the Government to introduce this fundamental change.  If the Government wanted to introduce procedures on the regulation of the number of counsel appearing in certain actions, they should have done so either by way of withdrawing the existing Bill and bringing forward a totally new Bill so that the fundamental principle could be debated on Second Stage, or waiting to see what agreement could be reached with the Bar Council.  If agreement had not been reached, the Government could have brought forward enabling powers for the Minister to make regulations in a future Courts Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental principle involved in amending a Bill of this nature to such an extent on Committee Stage without affording this House an opportunity to debate the principle on Second Stage.  I can say that without anybody accusing me of representing a vested interest group because I am not a member of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> However, I am thinking in terms of the extent of the interference and the heavy-handed approach by the Government in regulating the rules applying to a profession, whether it be the legal profession or my own profession, the insurance profession, without adequate debate and discussion with the representative body, who must be regarded as a responsible group of people.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe it is a grave mistake to introduce an amendment such as amendment No. 8.  In his remarks the Minister mentioned the listing system which has been a major justification of the two senior and junior counsel procedure. He said that the abolition of juries may change that, but I am not aware of whether or not that would be the case.  I am quite certain that negotiations should take place between the Minister and his Department and the Bar Council to work out an acceptable level of representation for a plaintiff in particular cases.</P>
    <P>My understanding from what I have read and from statements from the junior Minister in the Department, is that negotiations have already taken place between the junior Minister and the Bar Council and the Minister for Justice and the Bar Council and that progress has been made.  I also understand that the junior Minister issued a statement after one of those meetings saying that if the Bar Council would not agree on a voluntary basis to reducing the number of seniors in particular actions, the Government would be forced to introduce legislation to make it compulsory.  I understand that the Bar Council have already agreed to reduce the number of seniors from two to one in accordance with a request made by the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is no reason for this amendment, certainly at this stage, when there is no obvious breach of good faith on the part of the Bar Council.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that the Minister is at least accepting the principle that no regulation should be implemented without first being brought back to this House and to the Seanad for a full debate.  Will <Col N="841" /> the Minister put on record that no regulations will be made if agreement is reached between the Minister and the Bar Council?  It is important that we as legislators build up our relationships with responsible bodies such as the Bar Council and that we show that we trust each other.  If that trust is breached then the law can fill the gap.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister is prepared to accept a letter from the insurance industry giving a guarantee that they will do something.  Accepting a letter is quite different from imposing statutory controls.  If the Minister can do it for one side, surely he can do it for the other.  I would like to be satisfied that people will not find that they will only be allowed to have a senior and junior counsel in exceptional circumstances and the defendant, the insurance companies, can have as many representatives as they wish.  In some cases it will be necessary to get specialist advice.  Any regulations discussed between the Minister and the Bar Council should take exceptional circumstances into account and provisions should be made for proper representation when needed.  I would prefer now to hear the views of other members present in the Chamber.</P>
    <P>We are opposed in principle to the way in which this amendment is being introduced.  I have tabled amendments on behalf of my party to safeguard people.  We know that this annulling power is there to be used within 21 days, but in practice this power is never used because successive Governments by and large have refused adequate time to debate such regulations, so the power is not worth the paper it is written on.  Our amendment will oblige the Minister to bring before both Houses of the Oireachtas any regulations he wishes to make in this regard.  That is the minimum safeguard.  I would prefer if this provision was not there at all and to hear from the Minister that he had reached a satisfactory agreement with the Bar Council and with the insurance industry that would not need the heavy hand of the law to implement.  Will the Minister assure us that regulations will not be made if <Col N="842" /> agreement is reached between the Minister and the Bar Council and that he will enter into discussions with the insurance companies to see that people will not be left with the minimum of representation in court, when the major institutions, the insurance companies in this case, will have no such restrictions on them as to the numbers.  I would like now to hear these assurances from the Minister before contributing any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There was talk on the earlier section about the degree o consistency that the Government have displayed, and the manner in which they have set about their business.  Those charges apply with particular force in relation to this section.  What is involved here i a very fundamental departure from what we have known to date in the legal system or from the Bill as originally intended. The way in which this amendment is introduced late in the life of the Bill is a most unhappy one.  There has been talk about the extent to which the Government have steered a straight course and some questions arise.  My understanding of the Government's track record in this debate, is that having opposed this Bill during the life of the last Dáil, within a matter of days of the change of administration, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce wandered off to an insurance dinner and, in the congenial company in which he found himself, gave commitments that there would be a <i>volte face</i> on the part of his party and that they would after all favour the abolition of juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in the aftermath of that commitment the Minister of State entered into negotiations with the legal profession and made clear to them, rightly, that the Government of the day had a proper concern with the level of legal costs and with the consequent cost to the insurance industry and the cost to the insured persons.  My understanding is that those negotiations proceeded very specifically on the basis that it was for the Bar Council to introduce change, and that if change was not forthcoming, such was the Government's strength of feeling <Col N="843" /> on the subject that they would bring in legislation.  I understood that that was a fall back position and that only if no movement was forthcoming from the legal profession would the Government find it necessary to legislate.  We know that there has been movement.  We know that a general meeting of the Bar attended by several hundred barristers was called and they made a solemn decision to change their procedures so as to provide that it would not be possible to seek to recover costs for more than one senior counsel and one junior counsel in a typical personal injuries case.  We know that they have followed that up by specifically stating that that resolution would take effect on the day that this Bill comes into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not before then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Because before then there is the jury system and the current listing system.  I understand that this Bill will now come into effect on 31 July and the Bar Council resolution will come into effect simultaneously.  There has been movement on the part of the Bar Council. Given that the Minister has been somewhat forthcoming in his attitude to Deputy Barrett's amendment, I do not want to make a charge of breach of faith, but it seems to me that those who entered into negotiations with the Government and with the Minister of State in good faith are entitled to feel more than a little aggrieved at the way in which matters have proceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that to some extent the question of regulations will go, if not on the long finger, at least on the middle finger and that there will not be regulations unless they are first approved by the House.  He has also indicated that he does not have any intention of immediately introducing regulations but that he will wait and see what develops.  I welcome that proposal.  The drafting of regulations would be an extraordinarily complex task and one which I suspect would defeat the Department.  I say that <Col N="844" /> because the Minister has indicated that the one area that could be considered is the size of the case, the seriousness of the injuries and the likely damages to be recovered.  There is a world of difference between a personal injuries case in a High Court, a case involving two motor cars where the question was which of them was on the right side of the white line and whether the injuries were serious or not and, for example, an accident that might have arisen following the disaster at Whiddy.  In fact, I understand that the plaintiff in that case has opted for a non-jury trial.  Clearly the degree of expertise that has to be brought to bear and the degree of preliminary work and research to be undertaken will be vastly different.</P>
    <P>If the previous Government had not established a tribunal to deal with the victims of the Stardust disaster one can imagine how prolonged and complicated that litigation would have been and how uncertain its prospects would have been because of the multiple defendants involved &mdash; the various companies who had an interest in the property, the people who had manufactured the furniture and equipment, the officers of those companies in a personal capacity, the local authority on whether they had carried out their function adequately and the State because of the adequacy of the planning laws and the inspectorate.  The range of possibilities would be almost endless if somebody was injured or believed they had suffered injury, sickness or illness following a leak at Sellafield. If one decided to bring an action one can imagine the degree of preparation that would be required if witnesses from all over the world with a high technical expertise had to be assembled together.  It is not possible to cover this wide range of possibilities on the basis of certification and by providing at the end of the case that one could stand up and say to the judge: &ldquo;Would you mind certifying the fact that there are two or three of us here?&rdquo; Of course, the case is over at that stage and it means that someone has had to work their way through the case &mdash; and the cases we are talking about <Col N="845" /> would be of unusual length and complexity &mdash; without any knowledge as to whether a person's application for certification would be successful or whether they would be paid.  I do not think it is possible to address this simply on the basis of a <i>post hoc</i> certification.  If one is to regulate it has to be done on the basis of identifying categories of cases because the multiplicity of categories that would arise would be extraordinary.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which should not be lost sight of.  At present, almost all personal injury cases are taken on behalf of people who, if unsuccessful, cannot afford to pay their lawyers.  The present level of legal costs &mdash; and the level of legal costs whether or not this Bill goes through &mdash; is such that a person who is mowed down by a motor car at a pedestrian crossing, or a person whose finger is sliced off while operating machinery in a factory, would not have the resources to fund a legal action.  Most actions are taken on the basis that the lawyers are content to take them in the expectation that, if the plaintiff is successful, they will be paid but in the knowledge that they have no guarantee of being paid if an action is not successful. I do not want to overstate this case.  That is not done by lawyers because they are philanthropists or exclusively out of the goodness of their hearts, although I do think there is some element of public service involved.  It is done, of course, because in the majority of cases the plaintiff can expect to recover and if one has multiple counsel it does not require the degree of exclusive commitment that makes it impossible to take the case on the basis that payment will follow only if there is a satisfactory result.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to introduce regulations, as was suggested by the Minister for Social Welfare when he stood in for the Minister on the last occasion, which would provide that there could be only one counsel in a case &mdash; and I think it may have been a slip of the tongue by the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; the system of operating without a guarantee of payment would come to a standstill.  It could not continue because people would be <Col N="846" /> obliged to take on a case to the exclusion of all other cases and, because of the nature of things, they would not know exactly when a case would begin and could not make an exact estimate of how long it would last.  Not only would they have to give exclusive attention to that case but they would also have to block off time at either end.  Nobody is going to do that unless they have a reasonable expectation of being paid either on the basis that there is a guarantee of payment or because it appears that the strength of the case is such that a victory is very likely and counsel can expect to recover.</P>
    <P>That means that an injured plaintiff who has suffered very serious injuries but whose success is hanging in the balance will find it difficult to secure legal representation. That would be the inevitable consequence of proceeding along the lines suggested by the Minister for Social Welfare.  The only follow-on from that would be that a plaintiff who was cut off from effective access to the court would immediately launch a constitutional action seeking to establish a right to legal aid.  It seems to be a matter of overwhelming probability that that application would be successful and the effect of that would be that a Pandora's box would be opened, that the State would have let itself in for an absolutely unquantifiable bill and this legislation which was designed to reduce legal costs would, in fact, turn out to be a great bonanza for the legal profession.  I caution the Minister against being over-ambitious in this area in seeking to regulate.  It is infinitely superior to look to the people who have the greatest knowledge to organise their own affairs and to do it on the basis that, if they do not respond satisfactorily, the Minister will, in the public good, have a reserved right to legislate.  That would seem to be the responsible way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I concede that the Minister has come a distance and I welcome the fact that there will have to be further vetting of anything that might emerge from the Oireachtas because these are questions not just of detail but of fundamental principle. I also welcome the fact that the <Col N="847" /> Minister has disavowed any immediate intention to introduce regulations.  He has indicated that he will wait, listen and observe and this is commendable. However, I think he should go further and indicate that, if the various interests involved, the legal professions and the insurance industry, are prepared to organise their affairs in a responsible way he will not meddle unnecessarily and his concern is that the public interest should be protected.  If the legal professions and the insurance industry can arrange that themselves, the Minister would be well advised to stay clear of this.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 8 reads:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and such regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 9a deals with the regulations of counsel which is in answer to both the Minister's amendment and Deputy Barret's amendment.  We believe that there are a number of problems attaching to the amendment tabled by the Minister and the first of these is that the Minister is given the power to specify by regulation the maximum number of counsel in respect of whom the cost can be taxed.  It does not specify on what grounds he may make regulations and it <Col N="848" /> does not demand of the Minister that he inform himself as to the reasons such regulations would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Our amendment provides that the Minister must be of the opinion that there is a practice leading to an excessive number of counsel being used.  In fact, it says here that where the Minister is of opinion that by reason of any practice whereby an excessive number of counsel are retained in cases arising under section 1 (1) of this Act, the amount of costs recoverable on taxation are unreasonable having regard to the nature of the proceedings etc, it allows for the making of regulations at that stage.  It is important to echo what Deputy Barrett was saying about the fact that the idea of the Minister making regulations directly to control the numbers of counsel appearing in cases is overstating the necessity.  I feel that it is probably unnecessary because the Bar Council does seem to have shown itself willing to make fairly major adjustments in the recent past when it was put to them, quite strenuously I would agree.  I feel they would be willing to make even further changes were it spelled out to them that this was absolutely necessary.  However, I feel that regulations should be used as a last resort and that is what our amendment allows for.</P>
    <P>The second point about our amendment &mdash; and it is really the major aspect of it &mdash; is that it provides for fairness as between the two sides.  This is an issue which has come up a number of times in relation to the regulation of counsel and it is felt that there will be many defendants who will have the services of their insurance company who will be heavily backed and have access to a heavier legal team to represent them.  Certainly, as the Minister's amendment is drafted, that is possible.  What we have done is to draft amendment No. 9a which would then be section 4 (3) which essentially provides that there shall be similar representation for each party.  In other words, if the party who ends up paying the costs ups the ante and decides to put in a heavier team they will do so in the knowledge that they will have to pay the costs of a similar sized team on the other side in <Col N="849" /> most cases.  In the vast majority of cases it is the defendant, and probably an insurance company, that ends up paying the costs, and the plaintiff, under the Minister's suggestion, would be restricted in the number of counsel he could have costs taxed for.  Our amendment would go a very long way towards evening up the odds as between the two sides.  It is a reasonable amendment which I would urge the Minister to take on board to show he wishes to deal with this matter in a fair and even-handed way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

      <P>One of the problems with regulating the number of counsel at all is that the Title of this Bill, as inserted by the Minister, allows for the regulation of the number of counsel in certain actions. There is no way that can be done because it would be a denial of one's civil rights to engage any number of counsel; if one wanted to have ten counsel on one's side one could have them so long as one was willing to pay for them or they were willing to give their services free of charge. Our amendment No. 14 provides that the number of counsel may be regulated in respect of whom costs may be recovered and is also allowing people their civil right, if they wish, to take the benefit of the service of further counsel, but certainly it is open to the Minister to regulate the numbers in respect of whom he may wish to allow taxation of costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to that, I see that Deputy <Col N="850" /> Barrett's amendment allows the Minister, by order, to prescribe rules of practice to be observed by the Bar Council in stipulating the number of counsel appearing in actions to which this section applies.  I am surprised and very puzzled because Deputy Barrett, in his contribution, indicated that he felt the Minister was going too far, taking too wide powers, and he did not wish the Minister to step in and regulate the number of counsel.  In fact, his own amendment goes much further than the Minister's amendment in trying to stipulate the number of counsel who may appear in a case, not just have their costs taxed.  I believe it would be a very grave mistake to follow down that line of argument.</P>
    <P>I would like to say further that I believe the Minister and the junior Minister with responsibility for Trade and Marketing have shown a lack of faith in their dealings with the Bar Council to date.  I hope that the Minister in his introduction was indicating &mdash; I believe he was &mdash; somewhat of a pull-back from that position that appeared to have been reached recently.  The Bar Council, after consultations with the junior Minister adopted, as Deputy Birmingham said, a new regime that after the passing of this Bill no more than one senior and one junior counsel would appear in these cases.  It was on the basis of undertakings that there would be no regulations brought in and no legislation which would curtail the numbers appearing in cases. Having done that they then find that the Minister wishes to take to himself in this Bill the powers to regulate the number of counsel for whom costs may be taxed. In doing this the Minister has invited the Bar Council to end this agreement or to put in jeopardy this type of agreement or future agreements that might be reached between the two parties.  That is regrettable because if the goodwill of the Bar Council had been maintained and the dealings had been proceeded with as planned, further changes could have been achieved with no difficulties or less difficulties than we might have now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> I want to refer to the Insurance Federation's letter.  The Insurance Federation sent me a copy of the letter they sent to the Minister for Justice and to the Minister who is sitting here, Deputy Reynolds.  They say that they have given a categoric assurance in regard to the briefing of no more than two counsel.  In fact, the words they use are &ldquo;insurers can envisage no case in which any party would need to brief a third barrister&rdquo;.  That, I would submit, leaves it open to them to revise their opinions in the future and to say that circumstances arise now that they did not envisage before.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make regulations and we are pressing that the numbers of counsel in cases be reduced.  We are absolutely positive about that.  There are a number of ways that can be achieved. The Minister and his colleagues have shot themselves in the foot between last year and now.  The very least that can be done is that this procedure should be made fair to both sides but particularly to the side, as pointed out by many Deputies, on a less well off footing as regards being able to instruct numbers of counsel.  I strongly urge that amendment No. 14 should be adopted because the Minister's amendment, No. 13, is not factually true.  You cannot regulate the number of counsel appearing.  We should strive for accuracy at the very least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief in response to Deputy Cooney's request for brevity.  The Minister knows my views in relation to the retention of the jury system.  I have already placed my views in that regard on the record of the House. Despite the fact that my voting position, to say the least, is anomalous I still believe the jury system should have been retained.  The Bill remains a Bill until it is signed by the President and will, presumably become law before the end of July.  I express my sorrow that that is about to become a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the regulations before the House, I must express my surprise that we are debating them at all because I understand from discussions between the Minister of State and the Bar Council that on the basis of undertakings given by the Bar Council that they themselves would regulate their own affairs in the context of the number of counsel they would have in running down actions, common law and employers' liability actions and so on.  It comes as a surprise to me that we should even be discussing regulations on the basis of the Bar Council's undertaking.  I support the manner in which the Bar Council met the reality of the abolition of juries and I also support the statement by the Bar Council which, I believe, will remain a statement of their intent and their practice, that the <Col N="853" /> number of seniors, as undertaken to be regulated by them, will be so regulated. I do not want to be seen as a Tadgh an dá thaobh in this area because the Minister and the House knows that I am a practising barrister and in the nature of things I could be representing a self-interest and so on.  That may be so and it may not be so.  I would like to feel that I am meeting this problem in an unbiased fashion as a public representative, but it is difficult to beat the barrister out of the public representative.</P>
    <P>Having said that and on the basis that the regulations have been suspended pending the operation of the new, non-jury regime, the Minister has very reasonably approached the situation on the basis that the regulations will not be introduced if it is found that the council's system, the limitation on counsel, will be operating properly.  I think that is right. My wish is that the Minister will not have to operate these regulations, which I hope will remain in a permanent state of suspension, because I believe that the Minister, who is a reasonable and honourable man, is dealing with a group of reasonable and honourable people. When the new, non-jury system is seen to operate over a period of two, three, four or five years the undertaking originally given will be seen to be a fact.  I believe the Bar Council will regulate the system to ensure that the number of counsel in each case will be limited according to the exigencies of the situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that the regulations would be permanently suspended.  I believe they will be and that honour will be met on both sides.  I want to place on record again my view that it came as somewhat of a surprise to me that we are debating regulations to curtail the number of counsel in cases.  Where small claims in the High Court were dealt with by three counsel, two senior and one junior, and a solicitor on the one hand, and two senior counsel, one junior and a solicitor on the other, that is for plaintiff and defendant, I believed that was socially wrong and incorrect, and I think the general view of the Bar, as a totality, was <Col N="854" /> that it was wrong also.  That is why I believe they undertook, in the situation that the non-jury system would be in operation, to have a look at the number of counsel in cases which required that there be fewer counsel than there were originally.  I believe the Minister will give effect to his undertaking, that his position will be honoured and that the Bar Council will give effect to their undertaking and that they will regulate the number of counsel in cases and that their position will be honoured.  My wish is that these regulations never see the light of day.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I am thankful to you for calling me in this matter.  From Second Stage debate I anticipate that I will be very much in the minority of one on this issue.  On Second Stage I welcomed the intention of the Government to introduce regulations.  I hope the section will be in place and will remain there, and through or by whatever means regulations are eventually drafted, I look forward to the amendment now accepted whereby it will be a matter for this House to debate, discuss and agree them before they are put in place.  As someone who has practised, not for as long as Deputy Fitzpatrick, in the legal profession but in an area of work where the Government and the Department of Justice had no difficulty in regulating the number of counsel and deciding down the line in all kinds of complexities and in cases of all kinds of seriousness affecting far greater issues concerning the liberty, livelihood and future wellbeing of the subject, I do not see that they will have any difficulty in this area either.  We are talking about the wit and will of this combined House, with all official support and input, and the arguments that it is complex and impossible to deal with do not wash with me.  I have worked for 15 years with it and it can be done without any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> I am disappointed that these regulations are not being progressed.  For example.  I do not hold the view that there is all that good, great and well disposed attitude of public spirit in the Bar or in any area of the legal profession as a whole.  It is not a well-motivated profession when it comes to dealing with negotiations on its own position, rights and area.  I could go into theories but I do not want to spend too much time on this.  I want to give other Deputies, some of who have a view counter to mine on this, an opportunity to speak.  The motivation comes primarily from changes in the rules with regard to the number of counsel and from the change in the structure of membership in the Bar over the past number of years.  There has been a huge influx of young members who are standing around idly watching the fat cows on the top of the pile making an absolute fortune as they waddle into the round hall every morning with numerous briefs tucked under their oxters, standing about and controlling what is known locally as the &ldquo;round hall Mafia&rdquo;.  It is the demand for democracy within the Bar that is forcing change on the Bar, not any public spirited notion about the need to change in face of arguments about the interests of the insurance industry or people who have to pay the premiums over the counter in the insurance offices. There is a revolt within the Bar to try to distribute work more fairly among the many hundreds of young, educated, qualified lawyers who find they are not getting a fair deal down there.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is worry about the Fair Trade Commission and their recommendations and findings.  The Government on this occasion are being prompted by a preview, perhaps, of a suggestion of what might be coming in that commission's report and they are anticipating something that will be suggested and incorporating it into a section of regulations here.  I do not want in any way to be singular in the profession, but my experience is that the law profession generally is very slow and reluctant to change and change for the sake of progress.  The <Col N="856" /> whole area of legal education has concerned me over the years and it is remarkable that at this stage there is no third level input from the Department of Education. A student coming out of our democratic educational process cannot avail of third level departmental grants. There are arbitrary controls on entry to the profession.  There are huge fees to be paid and you cannot get one iota of concession from either side of the profession on that issue.</P>
    <P>The one big thing that has not been addressed in these regulations at any stage is the scale of fee that can be levelled by barristers on their brief for attending.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  I know of an instance in the last week where a case demanded and the client demanded a single senior simply to get singular attention in the hearing.  The senior was found without difficulty, but what happened?  The brief fee was doubled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>And can be doubled here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>And can be doubled here as well.  I make no point about it. The solicitor's fee will be doubled to keep abreast of what the senior is getting and the juniors come up with it as well.  As the rule stands within the trade unionism of the Bar, it is two thirds for the juniors. That is what will happen in these regulations. The numbers will be cut down but the fees will be doubled.  What is the argument?  It is that under the thick oxter under which they carry three or four briefs, they can manage to make three or four brief fees a day.  If you interfere with that, they have to compensate over by doubling or trebling up, if they can get away with it, on their brief fees.  They will hand them out and work them around, but they will work their fees up. Many of us cannot understand &mdash; and as a practising lawyer for many years I could never understand &mdash; the basis upon which the fees are marked by lawyers on the whole when they get a run and a brief and a marking pen.  They just pick figures from the sky.  I have seen figures in lawyer's firms around this city and around <Col N="857" /> the country that baffle me beyond comprehension.</P>
      <P>A woman wrote to me last week from Kerry and her bottom line was that this lawyer was charging her £4,500 to get her £7,500 compensation.  It was all there documented, no problem to say how it was arrived at.</P>

      <P>One aspect of these regulations is the question of the scale the fees can be fixed on.  Perhaps the commission we talked about will have something to say about that.  It is a fact to be concerned about.  I am not at all taken by the concessions very late in the day that are welcomed as if they are what the Government and everyone else in this House want.  We need enabling legislation in place if we are to do that tonight but the Minister should not wait too long in terms of drafting up his regulations. They will need to be looked at and the matter will have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Birmingham's suggestion that the problem up to this has been that the jury system in some way or other makes the listing of cases difficult and makes it hard for the poor counsel to operate down there, that is not so. The current listing in the High Court in Dublin is 25 to 30 actions per day put in for hearing.  On average, three to four High Court judges are available per day to take them and 99 per cent of civil actions today operate on a non-jury basis. We have made the point that it is the very exceptional case that goes to a jury hearing.  The lawyers go over knowing it is a settling court they are going to, but they go with three or four briefs under their arm and there is no difficulty for them.  If the will was there, their own self-governing regulations would be long in place.  We would be getting on with it and they would have shown by practical illustration that they had a serious interest in this area.  You need a stick, not <Col N="858" /> a carrot, to deal with the legal profession when it comes to change, particularly against their interests.  Let us keep on with the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say will be brief because other Members want to contribute on this section of the Bill. While the attitude of the Fine Gael Party on this issue is a little strange and inconsistent, Deputy Barrett made the point, rightly, that this issue of the control of the number of counsel in a case was completely separate and distinct from the main thrust of the Bill dealing with the abolition of juries in civil cases.  So it is. He made the point, again rightly, that the normal procedure for a Second Stage debate on this issue has been denied to Members of this House.  It is bad parliamentary practice for one thing.  When a separate issue of this nature was introduced there should have been a Second Stage debate on it in the normal way.  He is right about all those things but, if that is the view he takes, it puzzles me as to why he arranged with his Whip to have this Committee Stage today guillotined to conclude at 11 p.m.  It was quite clear that this debate was the only opportunity there would be to have anything even approaching a Second Stage debate on this important issue.  Yet the Fine Gael Whip agreed to guillotine the measure.  I find those two positions somewhat inconsistent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial factor on this issue has been touched on during the course of the debate but I want to emphasise one particular aspect which goes to the root of the matter.  In this jurisdiction there is no legal aid system worth mentioning in civil cases and that is the nub of the problem we are seeking to address here, by controlling the number of counsel. In the United Kingdom the number of counsel is controlled and in a normal running down action or in a case for personal injuries, the one counsel rule applies.  Indeed, in most cases, a junior counsel conducts the case exclusively.</P>
      <P>In regard to the criminal end, Deputy McCartan said that the Minister had no difficulty in bringing in regulations controlling the number of counsel and organising the whole system.  That is true but there is a basic difference in the United Kingdom position in civil cases and our system dealing with criminal cases.  In both those areas, there is a free legal aid system and that makes the position we are faced with here totally different.  If the Minister or the Government wanted to do anything realistic to tackle the problem, they ought to bring in a civil legal aid system and then the question of the number of counsel would, rightly, be brought in as an integral part of that arrangement.  Doing it on its own leaves out the most crucial requirement and precondition of the whole issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the difficulty and, as a practising solicitor acting for clients who cannot afford to pay counsel from their own resources, I must consider their position when the non-jury rule comes into force. I certainly hold no brief for the barons of the round court &mdash; the system has been ripped off to a large extent &mdash; but I must consider the position of people in poor circumstances who face a very important lawsuit in which they will require the <Col N="862" /> services of an experienced counsel on an issue which will determine the whole future course of their lives and that of their families for many years to come. Will they be adversely affected by this situation?  There is a very serious risk, in the absence of a civil legal aid system, that their position will be seriously prejudiced and that they may have great difficulty in obtaining adequate representation for their case.</P>
    <P>On an earlier stage of the Bill, Deputy Barrett asked if the new system would be humane towards a person who had been involved in an accident and who had sustained possible serious injuries.  I do not know what he meant.  Nobody is looking for charity or a humane approach to this issue.  People will merely be seeking their legal rights to compensate them for what they have been made to suffer and for the wrong that has been done to them by a car driver or a factory owner whose dangerous system in the workplace caused the accident.  I fear that may not be forthcoming because very few cases can be guaranteed 100 per cent and if the case is difficult counsel who are experienced and in demand will be exclusively committed to these cases and may not be available &mdash; as they are now in many cases &mdash; to assist a person whose whole future may be at issue.</P>
    <P>These are my concerns and worries and that is what I meant when I said that we are pushing aside the real issue here. Never mind the insurance companies.  I am concerned about the individual person whose life may have been destroyed in an accident.  The insurance companies have investment incomes and profits.  I am not too concerned about them.  Their buildings and offices get bigger and flashier every year notwithstanding the whingeing they do.  The danger here is that, as always, it is the man at the wrong end of the stick who suffers.  The Minister should do something to assist that person although I do not believe that any of the three parties of the right here have any interest in that regard.  They represent other interests.  If they want to get together let them do so on some worth-while issue; let them <Col N="863" /> provide a free legal aid system for those people.</P>
    <P>We can deal with the question of the number of counsel later.  I agree that the present position in regard to counsel is not satisfactory and something will have to be done about it.  I would have preferred if we could have had more time to deal with that issue.  We could have had if Deputy O'Brien had been as vociferous at the meeting of the Whips as he has been this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked my colleagues to be brief and so I will have to set an example.  I should like to outline to the House the position that faces an ordinary country attorney regularly.  His client, probably a man of no substance in terms of material things, comes in to him having been injured in the course of his work, <Col N="864" /> may be in a chemical factory or a complex machinery yard.  A difficult technical legal question arises as to whether there was a safe system of work for that man or not.  That man may have a young family and he may have sustained a serious injury.  His humble country solicitor instructs his junior counsel, probably from the circuit, and instructs a senior counsel probably from the circuit also, a person he is used to dealing with. Because of the complexity of the case he will almost inevitably want to have a second senior counsel and in the past has had a second senior as a matter of course. He has had available to him the best senior counsel practising at the Bar at no cost greater than the cost of the other senior.</P>
      <P>The country solicitor can put together the maximum legal team suited to his particular needs and the needs of that client in the knowledge that if the case fails everybody is on nothing and if the case wins everybody gets paid.  That is the position at the moment.  The second senior counsel may be brought in for a particular purpose in that case.  He may be brought in to address the jury winding up the case; he may be brought in for a specialist cross-examination or he may be brought in for his own personal muscle at settlement on the steps of the court. The system allows the humblest country solicitor, acting for the poorest man in his district, to build that sort of a legal team.  We are now proposing to end that at the behest of the insurance lobby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also propose to introduce regulations but for the life of me I cannot see how regulations are going to be intelligible and workable if they are going to allow exceptions from the norm.  They obviously have to set a norm and the norm will be a senior and a junior counsel, as has been indicated.  However, it has also been indicated to us that they will allow exceptions.  That raises the question: who is to rule on the exception and at what stage?  Is it to be the trial court?  Is it to be the Minister or officials of the Minister's Department?  How are those people going to be convinced that <Col N="865" /> my particular case is one that comes within the exception?</P>
    <P>The drafting of regulations to provide a norm, and provide exceptions having regard to a myriad of complex different cases that can arise, is a matter of impossibility.  I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider this change which, again, is another example of the insurance lobby getting their way.  It is ironic that the insurance lobby are getting their way when they have played the two senior counsel rule down the years and when they know that coming into the new system they will not have to seek exception from the norm.  If they want to engage powerful silks they can do so in the knowledge that they will be able to pay.  If I want to have a second senior on my team and I do not get permission under these new regulations he has to be paid.  Having regard to the law of supply and demand if I want a leader at the Bar his fee is now going to be a market fee and it will not be the same fee as the senior I have already engaged.</P>
    <P>They are the realities behind the changes proposed.  I will deal with these matters on Report Stage, particularly in regard to Deputy Colley's amendment providing for the same legal representation on each side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have time to respond to all the points raised.  Deputy Barrett raised a question about the number of counsel to be allowed in personal injury cases and one about jury trials.  It is a fundamental purpose of the Courts Bill, 1986 to bring greater consistency and predictability into awards in personal and fatal injury cases in the High Court.  This will enable insurance companies to settle cases at earlier stages and reduce the legal costs associated with the large volume of cases that go to trial or are settled at the last moment.  Fewer cases going to court will create greater certainty in the listing system and reduce the need for double-booking of barristers, which is frequently cited as the main reason for multiple representation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, for cases that do go to trial, the <Col N="866" /> proceedings, in general, should be simpler and shorter before a judge alone. The input needed for barristers should be correspondingly reduced.  I also hope that savings can be achieved in the cost of expert evidence &mdash; that fewer expensive experts will be needed to give oral evidence in court and that those that appear can be dealt with more quickly.</P>
    <P>This connection between the abolition of jury trial and the level of legal representation by counsel justifies dealing with both matters in this Bill.  Also, as Deputies will be aware, the question of over-representation in personal injury cases has been the subject of much critical debate, and there is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to deal with the problem.  The Bar Council have linked their voluntary agreement to reduce the number of barristers who are to be briefed in personal injury cases, to the abolition of civil juries.  I recognise that the Bar Council have moved, by a large majority, to regulate the number of counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear what Deputy Cooney said.  It is clear that the Minister for Justice, or any Minister, will not bring in regulations that are unnecessary. I should like to make it clear that the Director of Fair Trade did not get a preview of them.  It is quite sensible for the Minister for Justice to wait until he sees what he should put into the regulations before he decides to introduce them.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Barrett is common sense in that it gives both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; not one House as represented in another amendment &mdash; an opportunity to discuss the regulations.  Members will be able to voice any reservations they may have about the regulations then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that no regulations will be introduced if agreement is reached with the Bar Council. Is that accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="867" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill says &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It is clear that the Minister for Justice will not be making any regulations in advance of assessing the matter.  If they are unnecessary why would any Minister introduce them?  We recognise the move of the Bar Council but it would be sensible to have regulations if they are required in the future.  I am certain that if the agreements reached are put into practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The whole object of the Bill is to get down the cost of insurance claims.  A whole package of measures, of which this is one, have been put together.  It is in the interests of everybody to get down the cost of insurance in relation to personal injuries and public liability.  The high cost of insurance is costing jobs in the economy and we should not be in any doubt about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister finish one sentence that he started?  He began to say that if the agreements reached are, and I should like to ask him to finish that sentence and say that if the agreement of the Bar Council is implemented and they honour their commitment, as announced after their general meeting, he accepts that the regulations will be unnecessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out that the legislation states that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I asked if any Minister would bring regulations into the House if they were unnecessary.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In this, the Millennium year of this city and the 75th anniversary of the great and historic lock-out of 1913, it is sad for me to have to stand in this House of a free and independent Republic and report to you, Sir, and indeed to the Minister for Labour that the spirit, if not the ghost, of William Martin Murphy is stalking the streets of this city but, unlike his predecessor who at least had the courage of his own convictions and did not put his hands into the pockets of the State coffers to justify his exploitation of working people, the reincarnation of William Martin Murphy not only has the temerity to deny workers the basic right of trade union affiliation and negotiation, but has the temerity and the audacity to obtain from the same PAYE workers subsidies to the tune of £575,000 to enable him to carry out this continuous exploitation and flaunting of <Col N="871" /> basic rights for which the Republic of Ireland was established in the first instance.</P>
      <P>What is at issue here, after 14 weeks of an official trade union dispute, which was endorsed by a finding of the Labour Court, is the fundamental and basic right of groups of workers to pool together and to join freely a union so as to maximise their own labour and the sale of that labour in the marketplace.  For most working people the only thing they have to sell is their skill, their ability to work, and the best way that they can sell that in the marketplace is to ensure that they get the best price for it.  Historically and traditionally it has been the unique task of the trade union movement to bind together the individual spirit and contributions of workers in the form of a trade union to ensure that they got a fair and decent price for the sale of their labour.</P>
      <P>Tonight I have to report that that basic right, which so many of us had taken for granted that it was no longer a matter of question or dispute, has been systematically denied over the past 18 months by an employer, Mr. Michael Clear, managing director of Irish Printed Circuits Limited.  The tragedy that compounds insult to injury is that this individual was formerly an employee of the IDA and the factory he established&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy did not personalise the debate by referring to a particular person or persons. This is a privileged Assembly and we must be concerned about the rights of people outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am concerned about the rights of people inside and outside this House and I will respect your admonition.  Some of the directors of this privately owned company were previously employed by the IDA and benefited from their experience within that organisation to the extent that they were able to obtain the assistance of the IDA in the establishment of this <Col N="872" /> enterprise and received taxpayers' assistance to the tune of £575,000.  What is the policy of the IDA, the body in which some of the directors of this company were employed?  In response to a letter from Deputy De Rossa the secretary of the IDA said:</P>
      <P>The Management of the Undertaking should also recognise the constitutional rights of Irish workers regarding Trade Union membership and the right of a Union having a negotiation licence under the Irish Trade Union Acts, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages and other conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>If that advice is good enough for Japanese, German, United States and United Kingdom industrialists and enterpreneurs establishing companies in the Irish Republic, why is it not good enough for former employees of the IDA?</P>
      <P>On foot of the recommendation of the Labour Court, and having regard to the time constraints, I am asking the Minister for Labour to undertake to do the following three things.  First, I want him to say unequivocally in his reply that, as Minister for Labour he will formally write to the management of this company and request them to recognise the recommendation of the Labour Court.  In asking him to do that I put him on notice that the managing director of that company, in response to a question put to him, said:</P>
      <P>I am not bound by a recommendation of the Labour Court and, in my view the court has always favoured union recognition even if only one employee wanted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that 32 people out of 35 want a trade union, their third time trying to have one established in this enterprise, and their efforts are being frustrated.  It is extraordinary and contradictory, but perhaps in the nature of capital exploitation, that management are prepared to recognise the State in the form of the IDA when they are giving them money but not prepared to recognise the State in the form of the Labour Court when <Col N="873" /> they are making a recommendation.  I repeat: the first thing I want the Minister to do is to tell the House he will request management to recognise the rights of workers to organise a union in this workplace.</P>
    <P>Second, I want to ask his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to direct the IDA not to pay any further moneys to this enterprise until such time as they recognise the spirit of the management policy of the IDA in relation to the recognition of trade unions outlined by Séamus Walsh, secretary of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Third, I ask the Minister to request his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to conduct an investigation into the origins of the establishment of this enterprise.  How was this enterprise established in the first place?  How did it happen that a person working in the IDA could get a slice of what is reputed to be £100 million of the domestic market for printed circuits and in so doing to flaunt not once, not twice, but consistently, the fundamental right of Irish working men and women to form a trade union, to ensure that they can sell their labour at the best possible price and live and work in a Republic which is capable of providing them with the sort of liberty and freedom for which this Republic was established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made his case well and clearly and I will deal with the three questions he asked in a moment.  I want to put on record the background to this dispute in Irish Printed Circuits Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An official strike has been in progress in this company since 21 March 1988 over union recognition and the dismissal of a temporary worker.  Union representation in the company is put at approximately 20 per cent of the workforce of 55.  The union in question is Manufacturing Science Finance.  The two unions were referred unilaterally by manufacturing Science Finance to the Labour Court under section 20 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  A reference under this section binds the union to accept the <Col N="874" /> court's findings.  No such obligation is placed on the employer.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court recommended on the issue of the dismissal of the temporary worker as follows:</P>
    <P>The Court recommends that the Company agree to discuss the dismissal of this worker with the Union and if necessary to have the issue referred to a Rights Commissioner or other third party as the parties may agree.</P>
    <P>On the question of the union recognition, the court recommended that:</P>
    <P>... the Company agree to recognise the Union as the negotiating and representative body on behalf of those employees who are members of a union.  The parties should negotiate a procedural agreement to govern their relationship for the future and to avoid any recurrence of the difficulties which have arisen between the parties.</P>
    <P>The employer rejected the Labour Court findings and the strike continues.</P>
    <P>Despite the continued presence of pickets, production is being maintained. The two sides in this dispute are maintaining their present positions and so a stalemate exists.  As the Deputy will understand, the question of the implementation in this case of the Labour Court recommendation by the employer is a matter for the employer concerned.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the questions raised by the Deputy.  As the Deputy will know, the issues he raised with regard to the IDA do not come under the Department of Labour, but I will consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on them.  As regards other action to be taken by the Department of Labour at this stage, the fact that the Deputy has raised this matter will ensure that we will keep in touch with the issue but I am not sure exactly what else we can do.  I am giving a commitment that we will keep in contact with the Deputy and any other Deputies who are interested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister write formally to the management of the company asking them to accept the recommendations of the Labour Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the matter.  The rules are laid down in the Labour Court and, if the employer does <Col N="876" /> not wish to accept the recommendation of the Labour Court, that is his right.  If there is anything useful I could do in the interests of orderly and good industrial relations I would be happy to do it, but that position does not exist as of now. There is a stalemate but, as often happens in disputes, that position can change. However, we will keep in touch with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurers take many underwriting factors into account in calculating a motor insurance premium. These factors include: the nature and scope of the cover required e.g. third party, third party fire and theft, or comprehensive cover; the age of the proposer for insurance; the insured value and horsepower or cubic capacity of the vehicle; full or provisional licence status; the address at which the vehicle is ordinarily kept; no claims bonus entitlement; previous claims history; endorsements or convictions under the Road Traffic Acts; whether cover is required for social and domestic or commercial purposes.  Contrary to the implication in the Deputy's question, marital status is not an underwriting factor for premium rating purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed to circulate a table with my reply in an attempt to provide meaningful <Col N="650" /> information of the kind sought by the Deputy covering the years 1980, 1985, 1987 and 1988.  As the House is aware, the cost of motor insurance in this country is largely attributable to the number and level of claims and the associated legal and other expenses.</P>
    <P>Significant measures to tackle these problems are already in train.  The reduction of high insurance costs is an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Government is moving quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs, by proceeding with legislation to abolish juries with effect from 31 July 1988 and to limit the level of legal representation in personal injury cases, and by promoting greater awareness of the need for road safety. The scope for promoting the publication of a book of Quantum of Damages and for introducing a pre-trial procedure system to help reduce legal costs is also being examined.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with motor insurers and they have undertaken when the Courts Bill is enacted, to give a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no claims bonus to young drivers taking out their first policies if they have been named drivers on their parents' policies for two full years, have a full licence and have been accident free.  I will be pressing for further improvements.  Indeed, it is apparent that motor premium levels have been reducing in recent months as a result of increased competition in the market and in anticipation of the improved framework which we are introducing.  This is reflected in the fact that the premiums as at 1 January 1988 in the table to be circulated with this reply are up to 8 per cent lower than those applying a year earlier.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible at this stage to forecast exact motor premium levels for 1989. However, I am hopeful that the current favourable trends will continue to benefit consumers.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that it is only when the overall burden of accidents <Col N="651" /> and claims costs is reduced that significant reductions in insurance premiums will be achieved.  For this to be brought about it will be necessary, in addition to the measures being taken by the Government, for the motoring public generally, and young drivers in particular, to improve standards of driving and road safety.</P>

    <P>2. The simple average of the rating schedules employed on 1 January in each year by motor insurers representing over half of the total Irish market was used for premium comparisons purposes. The rates were calculated on two bases:</P>

    <P>(ii)  without allowance for no claims bonus with the following indicative results:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overseas investment programme has been a key aspect of Irish industrial policy since 1958.  Overseas companies in Ireland employ 80,000 people and last year spent over £2.8 billion in the Irish economy on wages, materials and services.  This is a fivefold increase in real terms on their 1973 expenditure.  Over the past five years they have invested approximately £200 million per annum in the country and are creating annually, an average of 5,000 new jobs. The IDA has targeted a 20 per cent increase in this job creation level up to the end of 1990.</P>
      <P>The continuing development of our overseas industry base in Ireland represents a key element of the opportunities available to Ireland through the completion of the Internal Market by 1992.</P>
      <P>The Government, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> fully recognise that the country's economic prospects are heavily dependent on the development of our industrial base and in particular our indigenous industry base.  Specific policy measures were set out in the programme to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I announced changes <Col N="657" /> in our industrial support measures which now focus more clearly on developing home based Irish industry, targeting incentives on actual job creation and shifting support from fixed assets to areas of greatest weakness in Irish industry such as management development, marketing and research and development. The State industrial development agencies have made extensive organisational changes to meet these objectives.</P>
    <P>The central thrust of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is the creation of new employment.  A significant proportion of these jobs are targeted in Irish owned industries.  This will result in proportionately more funds being invested in mainstream Irish industry, from young private sector growth companies to established public sector companies, to secure more jobs and value added in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>A report submitted to me on 21 March 1988 by the Car Rental Council of Ireland set out the difficulties being experienced by self-drive car hire companies in relation to, among other things, the high cost of motor insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> I replied in detail to the council on 15 April 1988.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the adverse impact which the high cost of insurance can have on all sections of the community, including the car rental industry and I intend to do everything practicable to solve these problems wherever possible.  The high cost is largely attributable to the number of accidents, the levels of claims arising and the associated legal and other expenses involved.  In 1986, the latest year for which full figures are available, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £18 million on their motor accounts. Therefore, the challenge is to reduce the number of accidents and the number and cost of claims so as to minimise insurance premia.</P>
    <P>Significant measures to tackle these problems are already in train.  The reduction of high insurance costs is an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Government are moving quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs, by proceeding with legislation to abolish juries with effect from 31 July next, to limit the level of legal representation in personal injury cases and by promoting greater awareness of the need for road safety.  The scope for promoting the publication of a Book of Quantum of Damages, and for introducing a pre-trial procedure system to help reduce legal costs is also being examined.  Insurance industry representatives have given assurances that reductions in insurance premia will follow the introduction of an improved framework.</P>
    <P>Insurers experience the car hire business as a high risk activity, particularly where renters are tourists who are not accustomed to Irish roads, driving conditions, e.g., right hand drive, and other environmental factors.  The premia quoted by insurance companies to car hire firms reflect the inherent risks involved.  Until there is an improvement in insurance companies' underwriting experience in this sector, problems of cost and availability will persist.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the car hire sector is an important component of the tourist <Col N="681" /> industry generally.  If any company has a particular problem in relation to insurance cover for its fleet it should contact the insurance section of my Department with the details.  I can assure the Deputy that every possible assistance will be given in such cases.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No.33 of 27 January 1988 which outlined recent efforts made to recover outstanding debts of US$3.7 million in nigeria.</P>
      <P>Since then we have received a promissory Note for US$1,197,314 in respect of principal of US$864,124 and capitalised interest of US$333, 190 under the terms of an internationally agreed Nigerian debt rescheduling programme over an extended period.  The Promissory Note received covers two out of five claims lodged by us with the Central Bank of Nigeria.</P>
      <P>The first payment of approximately US$15,000 under the Promissory Note was received in May 1988.  Under the rescheduling programme further payments are due on a quarterly basis over a 22 year period to January, 2010.  Total payments of principal and interest due over the 22 year period amount to approximately US$2.035 million.</P>
      <P>My Department, with the help of the Irish Embassy in Lagos, are continuing to exert pressure both on the buyer and the appropriate authorities in Nigeria until a recovery has been made in respect of the three outstanding claims.</P>

      <P>My Department are currently engaged in carrying out such a review which is being co-ordinated by a principal officer in the Industries `A' Division.

I will be making a composite report covering progress in all Departments to the Government later this year.</P>
      <P>The new compliance cost assessment procedures which have now been introduced cover the assessment of all costs, including administrative costs, to industry of compliance with any proposed new regulations or amendments to existing regulations which impact on industry. This compares with an earlier requirement in operation since March 1985 which covered only new proposals being submitted to Government and which called for an estimate of the direct industrial costs involved in the proposals.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy no doubt is aware, psychiatric services in County Carlow and in a major part of County Kildare have traditionally been provided from St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.  In accordance with the policy outlined in the report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; it is the intention of both the South Eastern and the Eastern <Col N="702" /> Health Boards to develop community based psychiatric services in Counties Carlow and Kildare respectively.  As for County Kildare, this will necessitate the provision of a range of facilities including an in-patient unit, day care units and hostels.  I have approved the tenders for a new admission unit and day hospital at Naas General Hospital and construction work is expected to commence in the near future.  Pending the completion of this unit, the Eastern Health Board will be in a position to provide interim admission facilities for patients from County Kildare.  In addition, my Department has made capital resources available to the Eastern Health Board to enable them to provide day care and hostel facilities so that they can begin to take over the care of County Kildare patients now in St. Dympna's and to provide an alternative service to people in County Kildare who require psychiatric care.  Discussions between the two Boards are continuing with a view to commencing these services.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to children who were adopted abroad by Irish couples and brought back to live here.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952 requires An t-Ard Chlaraitheoir to maintain an adoption children register containing an entry in respect of each child adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976.</P>

      <Col N="704" /> An extract from the register is not a birth certificate since it shows clearly that the child has been adopted but it has the status of a birth certificate for most purposes.

    <P>However, these figures do not imply that these were the actual numbers imported. During the period of validity of a licence, the licence holder may in fact import far fewer contraceptives than the maximum specified under the terms of the particular licence.  The vast majority of condoms imported in to this country are sourced from EC countries.  Well known brands of market leader products imported from <Col N="706" /> the UK for example would generally conform with the relevant British standard for condoms.  However, on the question of standards, I have recently decided to make it a condition of licences issued under the family planning legislation, that any condoms imported must have been tested to and must conform with an official national standard of a member state of the European Community.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the matter mentioned by the Deputy. However, I understand from County Donegal Vocational Education Committee that four of the students have already received payment of scholarships. The fifth student was deemed ineligible for the award of a scholarship as the reckonable income of the student's parents exceeded the income limits of the relevant scholarship scheme.</P>
