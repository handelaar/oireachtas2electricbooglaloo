      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, a Cheann Comhairle, I am very happy to see No. 1 on the Order but I wonder if the Tánaiste could give us any indication when Report Stage of that Bill will be debated in the House?</P>

      <P>The Chair is anxious to dispose of the Tánaiste's proposals, I must ask if it is agreed that No. 1 be taken without debate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It would help the House to deal with the Tánaiste's proposals with more alacrity if we knew when the debate is going to be taken.  I must say I am very disappointed that no agreement was reached with the Government Chief Whip after the very open position adopted by the Tánaiste on the matter yesterday.  Could the Tánaiste give me any indication if we will be debating this <Col N="322" /> Bill in the House in Government time in the near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Whips got together yesterday evening when the Government Whip was much more reticent than the Tánaiste was yesterday.  I want to make it clear to the Tánaiste and the Government that I want this Bill debated in the House in Government time the week after next.</P>

It was promised again yesterday in the Dáil by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in exactly the same words used when it was promised previously.  The legislation has not arrived.

      <P>The Special Committee has considered the Bill and has made amendments thereto.  The Bill, as amended, is reported to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That, perhaps, is in the absence of an indication from the Government but it is certainly not my intention that that Bill will go into Private Members' Time, as I made clear earlier this morning.  I want that Bill debated in the House in Government time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that if this Bill goes into Private Members' Time it will take up Private Members' Time across the board thus preventing any other Private Members' business being debated in the House?  I am sure that the Tánaiste, if he considers that, will be reasonable and generous enough, as he normally is, to provide Government time to debate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of where the future of the Bill might now lie, it is clear that the Government must have considered whether Government time will be allocated for the Report Stage of the Bill.  The matter to be decided by the Whips, traditionally, is the question of what day or what week a Bill should be taken but the question in principle of whether Government time will be given for the debate is a matter for the Tánaiste, representing the Taoiseach, and the Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it not correct to say that when a Bill is passing to Report Stage a day must be nominated for that debate?  Therefore, from a procedural point of view is it not important that we should be told whether the Bill will be taken next Tuesday, subject to agreement between the Whips? Surely we must be told when Report Stage will be taken, as is normal?  If it is decided by the House that the Bill should be debated in Private Members' Time we will be debarred in the future from seeking Government time.  It is vitally important, therefore, that we follow normal procedures and that we be told when it is proposed to take Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a <Col N="329" /> similar point to the Tánaiste.  In the context of the Bill I should like to draw the Government's attention to two points.  It is a matter for agreement between the Whips as to the date on which Report Stage debate may take place; it is a matter for a decision by the Government as to whether the Report Stage debate takes place in Government time or, for example, on Fridays when the Government's legislative programme would not be disrupted.  Through the Chair I should like to ask the Government to state by early next week on the Order of Business whether Government time will, or will not, be granted or whether the Bill will inevitably have to take up Private Members' Time for a number of weeks. That would be an unsatisfactory and fragmented way to deal with important legislation. Will the Tánaiste indicate if he will tell us on the Order of Business next Tuesday the Government's decision on this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will elaborate on this for the House's benefit but I have fully explained our position in regard to item No. 1.  The position is almost as Deputy Shatter has adumbrated, that automatically this Bill goes into Private Members' Time as a result of the motion being moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Government to take it out of Private Member' Time and take the other route. As I said in reply to Deputy Dukes, there are two routes open.  We either take it in Private Members' Time or the Government give their time to it.  We have not decided which of those routes to take, as I explained this morning.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the idea of Government time and Private Members' Time is laid down in Standing Orders and it is open to a majority of Members at any time to introduce a motion to vary those Standing Orders and provide that Government time be made available for this purpose.  It is an unsatisfactory breach of convention perhaps, but this Party will support a motion to make Government time available and whether the Government like it or not, their time will be used for this purpose if a majority want it to be.  We will not allow our Private Members' time to be abused in this manner.  I would make it clear that we will support anybody in this House who moves that time be taken from the Government by way of motion to vary Standing Orders to make that possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the following be adopted as an additional Standing Order of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business&mdash;</P>
      <P>46A.  A private member's motion which is not moved within twelve months from the date on which it was first placed on the Order Paper shall be deemed to have lapsed, but without prejudice to the right of members to put down such motion again.</P>
      <P>The proposal which is before the House today continues a process, which began in the last Dáil, of improving and updating the Dáil Order Paper in order to make it more relevant to the business which is before the House.</P>
      <P>This process began when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in March, 1986, approved new arrangements for the printing of Private Members' motions so as to reduce the number of such motions appearing daily on the Order Paper.  At that time, although only one Private Members' motion was debated by the Dáil each week, as many as 50 motions appeared on every issue of the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements which the CPP approved in 1986 were a combination of two previous systems which had been in <Col N="333" /> operation.  Prior to 1962, a Private Members' motion appeared on the Order Paper only once before it was placed on a special list, which was updated at specified intervals and circulated to Members.</P>
    <P>Motions were taken in order of their receipt and when the time came for a motion to be debated in Private Members' time it appeared again on the Order Paper, accompanied by a reference to the list from which it was taken.</P>
    <P>In 1962, this system was changed because of the possibility that when motions were debated in order of receipt, a Member could put down any number of them and thereby monopolise Private Members' Business for some considerable time.  The new arrangement, under which priority was given to groups &mdash; as defined by Standing Orders &mdash; was seen as an improvement in the situation which had applied up to then.  It resulted however in a large number of Private Members' motions &mdash; none of which were likely to be taken in the foreseeable future &mdash; appearing daily on the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
    <P>In March 1986, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered this subject again and approved new arrangements, which combined the best aspects of both the pre-1962 and post-1962 formats.  Under these new arrangements, at the beginning of every two months &mdash; excluding periods when the Dáil is in recess &mdash; a list containing all Private Members' motions, other than those given precedence, is published.</P>
    <P>It was felt at the time that some provision should be made for the automatic lapse of motions on the list which are no longer of relevance.  In this regard, of the 55 items which are on the current list, only 14 were put down within the last six months.</P>
    <P>The proposal before the House today provides a mechanism to remove such motions.</P>
    <P>This motion has the approval of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I trust that Deputies will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was proposed by my party at the CPP so we have <Col N="334" /> no problem in supporting it.  However, it was part of a package of suggested improvements in Dáil procedure.  One of the proposals related to provisions for Private Members' Bills to enable individual Members to bring forward Bills. There were also proposals to make proper provision for discussing a huge number of statutory reports that the Dáil receives virtually every day, where these contain important matter.  My party suggested that an hour or two each week should be set aside for discussing reports about which individual Members felt strongly.  The passing of legislation here frequently involves reference to reports being presented to the Dáil as if that meant something when in fact it means little more than adding bulk to the Order Paper on the day on which the report is presented to the Dáil, because there is no mechanism whereby the Dáil can actually discuss these issues.  There should be a mechanism available for discussing reports.  While the Minister of State saw his way to accepting the motion under discussion he did not accept the proposal I have just referred to or the one in relation to Private Members' Bills.</P>
      <P>It is also worth drawing attention to the fact that in the context of the decision of the Dáil to make provision for the televising of the Dáil, it was agreed by the Dáil that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be mandated to draw, within six months, a programme of Dáil reforms to accompany the introduction of the television cameras.  That six months expires some time in December. I will not be precise about the day but the six months is nearly over.  It is important that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are seen to do their business in this matter with expedition and to bring forward a range of procedures to ensure that the Dáil presents itself to the public and is seen to do its business by the public in the best possible and most efficient light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for improvement with regard to the length of speeches and with regard to estimates on expenditure so that they can be discussed in the Dáil in <Col N="335" /> the way that other bodies including local authorities would discuss Estimates.  In other words, we should be able to have some dialogue where people can ask questions or raise points about an item of expenditure and have a reply and then, that having been discussed, we could move on to some other aspect of the same Estimate.  The procedure at the moment does not allow for repeat interventions or for discussion.  It simply allows for a succession of monologues followed by a reply from the Minister which frequently ignores many of the points that have been raised.  There is also a case with regard to the discussion of Estimates for opportunities to exist to have individual subheads reduced so that the Dáil could resolve to provide more money for something else where the Dáil feels that the Government's priorities within the Estimate are incorrect and that they are giving too little to one service and too much to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy since I appreciate his very keen interest in the area of Dáil reform, but he will appreciate that the motion before us relates to Private Members' motions on the Dáil Order Paper.  I have given the Deputy some latitude but I would ask him not to stray too far from the subject matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appreciative as ever of the latitude shown by the Ceann Comhairle and I will not trespass unduly on his forebearance.  Reforms of the kind I have been speaking about are very necessary if this Dáil is to be seen as a modern assembly doing its business in a modern way and allowing Members to contribute.  I do not see this as threatening the Government in any way.  Frequently Governments tend to see Dáil reform as something which might show them in a bad light.  The contrary is the case.  The sort of reform which would be contemplated would enable the entire House to present itself in a better way and enable the citizens to have a higher <Col N="336" /> respect for politicians.  It is fair to say that the public do not have as high a view of us as we would wish.  That is partly due to our failure to reform our assembly.  I hope this minor proposal will be the first of many emanating from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as a result of the review which the committee must complete within the next month or so.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party have put down an amendment which would require seven days' notice to be given to the Members who had put down a motion that it was to be deleted.  I suppose there is some case for that, but I presume that if Members have gone to the trouble of putting down a motion they will know when the 12-month period will expire.  If they did not know this, it would be argued that they were not very serious in the first place and were simply putting down a motion to make work for the printing presses.  It is not too great a job to have a &ldquo;bring forward&rdquo; system in an office which will show all the motions which have been put down and when they are due to expire.  It should not require the services of the House to duplicate what a good secretary to any Member would do by way of keeping a record of how much time has expired since a particular motion was put down and when it would need to be renewed, if that was the Member's wish.  I am not sure that it would be desirable to incorporate this in a motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it might be useful if the Minister could indicate informally that in so far as possible the services of the House would be used as Deputy De Rossa indicates, without any formal legal requirement to do so.  This might become a matter of practice, but to put it into Standing Orders in such a fashion that the decision would be invalid if an official did not telephone somebody to say a motion was about to lapse would be unduly cumbersome and could lead to all sorts of problems.  There is no real record of a telephone call.  A message could be given to a secretary and the Member could say he did not receive it.  There could then be a dispute in the House about whether a motion was correctly <Col N="337" /> struck off.  We could get into difficulty by incorporating such an arrangement into Standing Orders.  I take the view that practical politeness would require matters to be dealt with as Deputy De Rossa wishes but that there is no need to incorporate it into the motion.</P>
    <P>I am glad this matter has moved forward but I hope the Minister of State will come before us before Christmas with proposals on parliamentary reform which will be a lot more ambitious than on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty with this measure and will support it.  It supports the view that we are largely irrelevant when we see motions on the Order Paper which have long been overtaken by events.  This is a small step towards updating procedures in this House, which are antiquated in so many ways.</P>
      <P>The reason many motions remain on the Order Paper for longer than 12 months is the limited access to Private Members' time afforded to the Opposition parties.  All the Opposition parties would wish to debate issues every week but obviously parties such as the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats are afforded that opportunity only once or twice in a session and are denied the opportunity to make a contribution on many urgent and important issues because of lack of time.</P>
      <P>I hope this minor progress today will be the start of a far greater process which will involve all Deputies and all parties in a real and active way.  Many new Deputies have the impression that they are coming into a place of power but they find that this Chamber has very limited power.  Backbench Deputies, even in the Government party, are denied a direct input into legislation and because of party Whips they do not express their true feelings on the floor of the House.  A reform of Private Members' time affording to the individual Deputy the opportunity to bring forward legislation or a motion would give every Deputy the feeling of having an important and vital role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy Bruton's view about the discussion of reports.  The <Col N="338" /> Seanad, perhaps because of the way they order their business, seem to deal with reports much more frequently than this House.  It is a pity that reports into which organisations and sub-committees have put so much effort are so seldom debated in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will support this small element of progress but I hope to see a far more sweeping change which will make this House and its Deputies more relevant to the legislative process.</P>
    <P>I see great merit in The Workers' Party amendment.  I do not think it would have the bureaucratic ramifications which Deputy Bruton suggested.  Surely it would be a simple procedure for the bureaucracy of the House to indicate to a party or a Deputy that a particular motion was about to lapse and that it should be resubmitted if they wish it to remain on the Order Paper.  That would not be a tedious burden.  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate that it will be done informally and the formal moving of the amendment might not then be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To add to the motion, the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When a motion becomes due to be lapsed, the member or members in whose name the motion stands shall be notified, not later than 7 days prior to the proposed lapsing, that it is proposed to lapse the motion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Other speakers have agreed that the motion before us relates to a relatively minor amendment to Standing Orders which will enable the lapsing of motions which have been on the Order Paper for 12 months, not having been moved.  We have no problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has not been said, but most of us would agree that once you put down a motion there is always a reluctance to have it taken off the Order Paper for fear that it might be seen as a change of mind on the issue and the automatic lapsing of motions can be of assistance to Deputies in this way.  Nevertheless, despite what Deputy Bruton has said with regard to <Col N="339" /> the amendment, it is important that Deputies be notified that a motion is to be lapsed.  Deputy Bruton says that a good secretary would keep tabs on that situation and that might be true but, as the Deputy knows, Members have dozens of items to keep tabs on and it is not unreasonable to ask, in view of the fact that the staff will have to monitor motions anyway, that a note be put in the box for a Deputy that his or her motion is about to lapse.  This would not put an undue strain on the resources of the House.  I am asking the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Also, it should be recognised that to some extent the fact that so many motions remain on the Order Paper for so long masks the fact that many Deputies do not have the opportunity to move their motions.  There are 55 motions on the Order Paper at present and, of those, 17 are in the names of Deputies of The Workers' Party.  Since we came into this House seven or eight years ago, we have not had the opportunity of moving a single Private Member's motion in Private Members' Time.  That derives specifically from the Standing Order which says that a party must have at least seven members in order to move a motion in Private Members' time, or to have access to that time.  We have tried on numerous occasions to have that Standing Order changed, unsuccessfully to date.  It is unreasonable that a Deputy elected to this House can be here for many years but, because he or she does not belong to a group of seven or more, will never have the opportunity of having his or her views or policies debated in Private Members' time.  I urge strongly on the other parties to review their attitude to the use of Private Members' Time and to review, also, the extent of time available for motions of this kind because, as Deputy Howlin has said, it is very limited.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to which I wish to refer in relation to motions and which is hidden by this amendment to Standing Orders is the fact that of the 55 motions on the current Order Paper, three seek to annul <Col N="340" /> orders made by a Minister in pursuit of aims, either the abolition of an agency or the making of a regulation.  These motions to annul orders of Government have never been debated in this House. They are known as negative orders.  They come into effect, unless annulled by the House, within 21 sitting days of the order being annulled.</P>
    <P>Again, Standing Orders are not very clear on the matter but the reality, as far as I can find out from the records is that only once in the past 20 years has a motion to annul an order been debated in this House.  The Government have steadfastly refused to allocate time to have such motions debated and in the normal course of events parties who have control of Private Members' time are reluctant to allow their time to be used to debate issues which others might want to have debated.</P>

I ask the Minister of State to accept this fairly simple and straight-forward amendment which I propose.</P>

      <P>I welcome this reform proposed by the Minister of State today. It is a great pity it is so minimal, given that the Dáil in the past year has been seen to be incapable of dealing with certain issues which can be discussed on the radio and in the newspapers on the day. There is no point in my wasting time in calling for the reforms that we would like <Col N="341" /> to see happening, but I only hope that this will be the first of many proposed and agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. As Deputy Bruton has already said, this motion is at the behest of the Fine Gael Party in the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  It is a meritorious motion in that there is surely a need for a regular springclean of motions on the Order Paper.  It is not that these motions have become obsolete or are in any way being adjudicated upon as being of a vexatious nature, but it is very much in order from time to time to restructure, to reorganise and put in order of priority the various items on the Order Paper itself.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I fully support the views echoed on all sides of the House on the need for long overdue Dáil reform. This morning we have had a prime example of a Bill coming out of committee which has a widespread body of public and parliamentary support not being provided with adequate time within the existing framework without trespassing upon the Private Members' Time of other parties on the Opposition benches.  Surely, where there is a totally inadequate time allocation and totally disproportionate allocation of time in respect of the merits of particular motions, it is long overdue that we should examine realistically the question of restructuring our business, reorganising procedures within the House and making things more democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It never ceases to amaze me that, although we have such a consensus of opinions as to where we should be going and what we should be doing, we still fail to come up with the necessary guidelines, changes or amendments to structures to enable this to happen.  That would be in everybody's interest.  There tends, naturally enough, to be a selfish monopoly tendency on the part of the Government to dominate things, but if one looks back at the pattern of governmental changes and changes of office right back to 1977, it has been on an every second turn basis and there is no reason whatsoever why <Col N="342" /> what is here today will be gone tomorrow if the immediate history of the past is repeated.</P>
    <P>There would seem to be a certain amount of merit in The Workers' Party amendment, but I take Deputy Bruton's point that by way of a courtesy it should be possible to have something accommodated in this regard.  I also take his point that there are not so many motions on the Order Paper that a vigilant and alert secretary cannot watch out for the possible demise of a motion on the expiry of the 12-month period.  Would the Minister of State advise the House if it would be of help if, when a motion is put before the House, the date on which that motion is submitted would be put down in order to strengthen one's ability to perceive its possible demise?  That might be a way out of the logjam and might be seen as a forewarning or early warning system as to the possible death of a motion.  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all Deputies for their comments and very constructive proposals.  It is true that this motion is a very small and simple one and I hope it will be a forerunner to other changes that may be brought to the House from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy De Rossa's amendment, I would be inclined to agree with Deputy Bruton's view that there is no need to incorporate this amendment into the motion.  I cannot see any difficulty in some administrative arrangement being made to contact any Deputy where the motion is about to lapse.  I want to emphasise that there is provision for Deputies to retable lapsed motions almost immediately should they wish to do so.

      <Col N="343" /> I want to mention very briefly the question of televising Dáil proceedings.  I know this does not really come under this motion but Deputy Bruton raised it.  The original motion in the names of Deputy Bruton and Deputy O'Brien asked that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should report back to the House within a three month period.  I felt three months was totally inadequate and we compromised and agreed on a period of six months.  At that time I said I thought six months was far too short, and that has turned out to be so because the six month period lapses next month and it is my intention to come back to the House, with the agreement of the Whips, with a further motion asking for an extension of a further six months to enable the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to report fully to the House.  Televising the proceedings of the House is not something we can do overnight.</P>

The proceedings of the British House of Commons have not yet been televised and they set up a committee to look into this area 18 months ago.  The members of that committee were drawn from many interests, even <Col N="344" /> outside Parliament, and they are expected to bring their report to the House very shortly.  When we televise the proceedings in this House, we want to do it properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid which was opened for signature by the Member States of the Council of Europe on 27 January, 1977, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 25 March, 1988.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> The object of the European agreement on Transmission of applications for Legal Aid is to provide procedural machinery to enable residents of Contracting States of the Council of Europe who wish to apply for legal aid in civil, commercial or administrative matters in another Contracting State to do so via a transmitting authority in the State in which they are resident.  The agreement does not affect in any way a person's entitlement to legal aid in any State.  It is concerned with procedural and administrative matters only.</P>
    <P>The provisions of our civil legal aid scheme, which is administered by the Legal Aid Board, are not confined to nationals of the State.  It is open to any person, whether resident here or not, who requires legal aid in connection with a matter which is before our courts to apply to the board under the scheme. Accordingly, signature of the European agreement on Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid by Ireland would not create rights to legal aid that do not already exist under our existing scheme of civil legal aid.  No amendment of the terms of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the European Agreement.</P>
    <P>The European Agreement was opened for signature on 27 January 1977 and it entered into force on 28 February 1977. So far it has been ratified by 13 of the Council of Europe member states &mdash; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom.  Switzerland has signed the agreement subject to ratification. Non-member states of the Council of Europe may also accede to the agreement, and Finland has done so.</P>
    <P>The main benefit arising from signature, is that the European Agreement on Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid will facilitate people in Ireland who wish to pursue their entitlements to legal aid in other countries that are parties to the agreement.  In practical terms this will represent a considerable improvement for people in Ireland who <Col N="346" /> want to apply for legal aid in those countries. At present such people are at a considerable disadvantage.  They are faced with problems of getting accurate information on legal aid facilities in foreign countries, with establishing lines of communication, and this is often compounded by language difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline briefly the main provisions of the agreement.  Article 2 is the principal provision.  It creates administrative machinery for transmitting applications for legal aid between the contracting States.  This involves the designation of &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; and &ldquo;transmitting&rdquo; authorities in each State.  In our case the Legal Aid Board, which administer the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, will be the relevant authority to forward applications for legal aid to the receiving agencies in other countries, and to receive and take action on, applications for legal aid coming from the other contracting states.</P>
    <P>Under Article 3 the transmitting authority is required to assist the applicant for legal aid in ensuring that the application is accompanied by all the relevant documentation required by the receiving authority in the other country.  This assistance includes providing any necessary translation of documents.  Documents forwarded under the agreement are exempt from legalisation or equivalent formalities under the provisions of article 4. Under Article 5 no charges may be levied by the contracting States in respect of services rendered under the agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 6 contains provisions in relation to the language in which documents are to be drawn up for transmission.  In effect, English or French are the main languages involved.  Article 7 provides for an exchange of information as between the contracting states on their rules concerning legal aid.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board have indicated that they favour signature of the agreement by Ireland.  Signature will assist the board in handling applications under the civil legal aid scheme received from people resident in other contracting states.  As I have indicated, the main benefit for people living in Ireland is that <Col N="347" /> machinery will be in place to enable them to process their applications for legal aid to other European countries which have ratified or acceded to the agreement, and that they will receive all the assistance they require to make their applications.</P>
    <P>I would now like to give a few examples of the practical benefits of the European Agreement in particular cases for Irish people.  Suppose an Irish wife who has been deserted by her husband is served with papers relating to her husband's petition for a divorce in England.  The Legal Aid Board will be able to assist the wife in such a case by sending the relevant documents to the legal aid authority in England, so that the question of her entitlement to legal aid in England in connection with the proceedings can be considered.</P>
    <P>Again, if a wife here who is legally aided, wishes to enforce an Irish maintenance order in her favour abroad, the Legal Aid Board will be able to use the provisions of the agreement to help her to secure her entitlement to legal aid in connection with the special enforcement procedures provided for by the &ldquo;Judgements Convention&rdquo; of the European Communities.  Effect was given in this country to that convention by the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1988.  Under that convention a maintenance creditor wishing to enforce a maintenance order in another EC country is entitled to legal aid to bring the application for enforcement before the foreign court, if she or he was in receipt of legal aid at home.</P>
    <P>As regards the impact of this on the work of the Legal Aid Board, I realise that the board's resources are under some strain at present, but it estimates that the number of applications it will have to process under the European Agreement will not be significant, and will be confined mainly to requests involving the United Kingdom and Ireland.  From what we know of the operation of the agreement in other European countries, the volume of cases involved has been small.</P>
    <P>From an administrative point of view, ratification of the European Agreement <Col N="348" /> on Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid will be a positive assistance to the board, because the board already receive requests from people resident here about legal aid entitlements in other European countries.  The framework provided under the European Agreement will enable the board to deal with such requests more effectively.</P>
    <P>Some expenses may be incurred by the board.  Although these would be negligible, and should be confined mainly to incidental translation costs I have been advised that the agreement is not one that is saved from the requirement of Dáil approval by the provisions of Article 29.5.3º of the Constitution, which exempts agreements of a technical and administrative character from Dáil approval.  Since the terms of Article 5 of the agreement require that the State bear the cost of any services rendered under the agreement &mdash; for example the cost of translation of documents &mdash; the Government has authorised me to seek Dáil approval of the terms of the agreement, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29.2.5º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>After such approval, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will arrange for signature of the agreement, on behalf of Ireland and for lodgment of the necessary Declaration designating the Legal Aid Board as the transmitting and receiving authority for Ireland.  In accordance with Article 10 of the Agreement, its provisions will enter into force one month after the date of signature.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As this agreement is concerned with procedural and administrative matters only we, on this side of the House, will not be opposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt but that this agreement will prove to be of positive assistance to many of our people wishing to avail of legal aid in other countries.  I refer in particular to people who find themselves in the unfortunate position &mdash; where there is divorce, Irish style &mdash; when husbands pack their bags and disappear, leaving wives and families stranded.  I sincerely hope that the terms of this <Col N="349" /> agreement will help those unfortunate wives and families, enabling them to pursue their rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that our Legal Aid Board will be charged with dealing with the technicalities involved under the terms of this agreement, contending that there will be very little such work involved.  The problem is that we continue to burden existing boards with extra tasks, with the idea in mind that there is very little work involved.  What happens is that such boards find themselves with more and more work and less resources available to them.  That is the problem with civil legal aid here.  We have totally ignored the fact that a large section of our community is deprived of their rights to defend themselves in court and obtain a fair hearing because they do not have the money to engage a solicitor or barrister to pursue those rights.  The position of such people is deteriorating constantly. All of us in public life come across such people frequently.  More and more people come to us seeking advice.  All we can say to such people is that this is really a matter for the courts.  Inevitably they reply that they do not have the money to take such action.</P>
    <P>We live in a democracy.  However it must be recognised that, at times, that system is an expensive one to live under. Nonetheless, if we call ourselves democrats, there are certain rights we must protect.  Slowly but surely we are arriving at a position here when, unless one has money, one is unable to pursue one's rights, particularly in regard to civil matters, in our courts.  That is a danger for democracy.  We must recognise that the sooner we implement a proper system of free civil legal aid the better, thereby protecting the democracy we all cherish. At times it is heartbreaking to encounter individuals, particularly in the family law area, who have been awaiting help for months on end and many others who will not receive such help at all.  Indeed the civil legal aid scheme we have has not even been established on a statutory basis.  If my recollection is correct it was established when the present Minister was the incumbent of that office in 1979. <Col N="350" /> Yet for the past nine years &mdash; and I do not blame merely the present Minister &mdash; there has been nothing done to pursue the recommendations of the very comprehensive Pringle report.  Indeed there are more and more problems being encountered which prevent the present inadequate system being operated properly.</P>
    <P>I recognise that every Minister for Justice sitting at the Cabinet table seeking money for his Department is faced with a dilemma to obtain an adequate allocation for the commitments of his Department, such as pay for the Garda Síochána, prison officers and so on.  I appreciate his dilemma in that respect.  When one looks at this year's Estimates one finds the same pattern emerging.  For example, one notes that the probation and welfare service has been subjected to a decrease in their allocation from last year.  Yet we continue to pay more and more prison officers and gardaí, probably the very people who could keep people out of prison or, when they are released, prevent them from re-entry but we are depriving these officers of the necessary resources.  In other words, we are straying away from preventive action.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is no money available for such matters as civil legal aid.  However, money will be found some day when a large number of our people decide to march in the streets demanding their rights to have somebody defend them in courts and have those rights upheld.  As legislators we must point out to the Minister and his colleagues in Government that, no matter what the consequences, there are certain services for which we must pay.  If the money has to be found elsewhere, so be it.</P>
    <P>Again examining this year's Estimates, I note that there is a large increase under the subhead for office equipment and so on in the Department of Justice.  While I am sure there is a valid reason therefore I shall be questioning the Minister in that respect.  When it comes to the probation and welfare service, or civil legal aid, one finds there is no money allocated.  We had better get our priorities in order.  We had better decide whether we will look <Col N="351" /> after the rights of individuals or merely deploy more machines to write to people informing them that we regret we do not have the necessary funds available to do so, or that we do not have the necessary funds to provide them with the services for which they pay their taxes.  It is somewhat like the position prevailing in the local government area, when an individual may receive up to 50 letters informing him or her why a pothole cannot be filled.  There are plenty of people to type such letters but nobody to fill the potholes.  That is the way this system is developing.  We are getting more and more used to the provision of facilities informing people why they cannot have that to which they are entitled while, at the other end of the scale, we do nothing to ensure that a large section of our community are given an opportunity of using our courts and getting proper legal representation.</P>
    <P>While I welcome our entering into this agreement the reality is that adherence to its terms will involve us in additional expenditure.  We cannot ask those people already inundated with requests for help, to take on an extra task without providing them with the necessary resources.  We do not want a situation where we will be dealing with applications from abroad from people looking for free civil legal aid in this country when the people here cannot get it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should put the present scheme on a statutory basis.  We should bring forward a comprehensive civil legal aid and advice scheme as outlined in the Pringle report.  We must be realistic but we should at least introduce an overall plan even though we may only have a certain amount of money to implement it.  We should give a commitment to implement it 100 per cent next year.  That would show that we are committed to the scheme and we could commence the development of centres around the country. At present, vast numbers of people in rural areas do not have any access to civil legal aid and we must do something about this.  Those involved in the present <Col N="352" /> scheme are becoming more and more frustrated.</P>
    <P>The last report produced by the Legal Aid Board was in 1986.  They do not have the resources to produce a report for 1987.  The 1986 report outlines the problems they have encountered and it is worth giving a brief summary of their conclusions.  They point out that there is a serious failure to meet the demand for legal services.  I have already made that point and I do not want to labour it although I could say a lot more about it.  The decision of the Government to reverse an existing commitment to open law centres in Dundalk, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Letterkenny is a major setback.  They are reversing decisions and not implementing a scheme to provide further centres in other parts of the country. The report warns that the moneys provided under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, will terminate at the end of 1988, which gives rise to great concern.  We must now decide where the money will come from to service the present scheme. The shortage of staff is of grave concern to the board and to people seeking their help.  Indeed, because they are running short of money, they have to temporarily close some of the present centres.  We must be realistic and take heed of what we are told by the people who serve on legal aid boards.  I am sure that many of them have better things to do with their time rather than being continually frustrated by the fact that the present scheme does not operate on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I hope the judicial separation Bill will shortly become law.  Other Bills dealing with family law will be introduced which will cause further demands for civil legal aid.  However, we have no plans to provide resources, centres or staff to help people to get their rights under all these Bills.  There is not much point in introducing legislation of this nature if people cannot avail of the provisions.  The board have also been asked to deal with adoption cases but they do not have the resources to do so.  We must face up to the fact that while it is grand to be signing European agreements and being part of the development within Europe, grand <Col N="353" /> to say that there are structures in place at present and that this will only mean a little additional work for the staff involved, we are ignoring the fact that they are already inundated with work. We are ignoring the fact that we do not have a scheme on a statutory basis and there is no evidence to show that that will change in the immediate future.  There is no evidence that there is a commitment to produce a more comprehensive scheme, even on a phased basis, despite the fact that a committee reported back in 1977.</P>
    <P>We are not developing any new centres, vast areas in the country are devoid of any civil legal aid and there is no evidence that we intend to provide additional funding, even for the miserable scheme at present in operation. While I welcome the fact that we are becoming part of the European agreement, we should avail of this opportunity to call on the Minister and his colleagues in Government to address the problems we are highlighting on behalf of people who are frustrated daily trying to work in these centres.  I am sure other Members will make similar points.  The centres try to provide a service and they regularly meet people who are being deprived of their right to avail of our judicial system because they do not have the money.  We do not want a democracy where only those with money can avail of the courts. That is no way to run a democracy and we must face the fact that certain things must be paid for.  This is one of them and the sooner we realise we have these obligations, the better for all.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we support the motion.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome this agreement as we would welcome any evidence of co-operation within the European context.  Any move which seeks to alleviate the problems facing people with legal battles in a different country should be welcomed. On a technical note, before I continue I would like to ask the Minister when he is replying to indicate &mdash; which he has not done in his speech, therefore I assume it is not the case &mdash; whether Ireland will be <Col N="354" /> ratifying the agreement without reservation. The agreement provides for reservation when they are being ratified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  The question that has to be posed, even though this is a motion which does not relate directly to the provisions of civil legal aid in Ireland is, if there is any real civil legal aid in Ireland?  In reality there is practically none.  Most centres have to close on a regular basis.  Much of the country is not covered by civil legal aid. What I think if it is true is an appalling indictment of the service is that recently lottery funds have been used apparently to shore up the funds of the legal aid service.</P>
      <P>Many people are moving backwards and forwards to Europe.  Many of our young people when they cannot find employment here are moving to Europe for employment.  They are being encouraged to do so.  They are being prepared in school to a certain extent to do so, and doubtless some of them will find themselves in legal wrangles.  They may have returned here by the time the matter turns up, but the fact that more and more people are travelling on these routes means we are going to have more and more cases brought requiring civil legal aid either here or on the European mainland among those countries which are party to this agreement.</P>
      <P>Recent trends in employment, or rather unemployment, mean that employment legislation is an up and coming area of law, one which is developing daily not just in Ireland but in Europe. It provides the courts, not necessarily the main judicial system but perhaps employment tribunals in many cases, with much more than they would have been used to in the past.  Certainly in Ireland people are being involved in these cases and the more they travel to Europe and take up employment there, they are going to find themselves involved there too.  That is probably a growth area where many people are going to need civil legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment itself means that far <Col N="355" /> more people qualify for legal aid.  They now consist of a much greater percentage of the population than they used to, yet even as I speak they are not being served. How can we extend that?  While in principle it is a good idea, how can we hope to extend it to others?  How can we hope to extend even the administrative machinery which is inherent in the Legal Aid Board and their services to those people who are not in this country or Irish people who have business in places abroad?</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not believe what the Minister says about the impact of this agreement on the work of the Legal Aid Board.  We can expect this area to mushroom. Let it be said once more, we are facing the impact of 1992, the single European market and all its attendant ramifications which will include the increase in the amount of litigation as between parties, say, in Ireland and abroad.  Doubtless some of them will be unable to afford legal representation. The impact of this agreement on the Legal Aid Board is hugely under-estimated by the Minister in his speech.</P>
    <P>I see the Legal Aid Board are to be designated both as the transmitting authority and the central receiving authority. That also begs the question as to whether the Legal Aid Board should be put on a statutory basis in conjunction with their designation of these authorities.  It seems somewhat remiss that we should be designating a non-statutory board who may disappear overnight at the whim of the Government, a board whose future is not secure, to liaise with other countries on this very important matter.  Also, when we sign this agreement we are taking on responsibilities towards the machinery which the agreement includes.  We are saying we will continue the operation of this machinery, that we are committed to it, yet we are not committed enough to put on a statutory basis the board who are supposed to carry out these duties.</P>
    <P>On reading through it, the agreement seems to be not specific on how information regarding the differing laws on legal aid will be transmitted.  How will <Col N="356" /> that information be communicated as between states?  Is it simply between the receiving and transmitting authorities? That seems to involve a great deal of extra work if applications are simply to be put in every time somebody wishes to obtain legal aid, with no evidence as to whether he or she might qualify for such legal aid.  It seems there is a case to be made for having some central bank of information regarding the legal aid provisions in all the countries which are party to this agreement.  That would save time and administrative problems in those countries.  It seems excessive to have to put in applications, translate the applications, send them to the receiving authority in the other country and then find that there was no question of qualifying for legal aid at the outset.  There is a good case to be made for having at least some guidelines as to the rules in each country before you start out.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister says that the translation facilities will be provided by the Legal Aid Board.  I am just puzzled by that because I am certain they do not have translation facilities as matters stand and the embargo also still stands.  I presume the Minister will see that this is done on a contracting out basis.  Because of some small experience I have in talking to people who do this kind of legal translation, I know it is quite an onerous and strenuous occupation.  It is precise and it is going to be quite costly.  Therefore, the more applications there are, the more translation will be involved.  Some provision should be made for that so we will not have that as a barrier to our complying with the agreement.  The agreement provides for designating the status of one or other official language. Perhaps the Minister would like to let us know when replying the status, if any, of the Irish language under the agreement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it has to be said that there is a certain element of sleight-of-hand in this motion being proposed to the House.  I am absolutely in favour in principle of co-operation on a European front in a European context with extending legal aid across borders.  However, <Col N="357" /> it is totally unrealistic with the kind of service we have at present to pretend we will be able to offer it to those who are in other countries or that we will be able effectively to transmit the applications of Irish people here to other countries when the personnel involved in the legal aid centres are snowed under with work and are regularly closing their doors for months on end because they cannot cope with the work they have at present.  We see there was a plan to open four new centres in early 1987 but that was put back.  That is an indication of the state of the legal aid system.</P>
    <P>I think it is timely that the Minister takes on board the real difficulties in the system, puts the board on a statutory basis, and commits this Government and this country to a proper system of civil legal aid which reflects the rights of the citizens of this democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just a cynical exercise to introduce this motion into this House. An international convention such as this convention of the Council of Europe ought to be based on reciprocity of availability of services between subscribing member countries.  Quite clearly that does not exist.  It should be noted that this convention was introduced in 1977 and now ten years later the Minister introduces this motion in the House.  I wonder what the reason for the delay was in introducing it by successive Governments? I put it down to some reticence on the part of successive Governments in introducing what would appear on the surface to be a reciprocal arrangement, giving even approximate equality of rights in the legal aid field to residents in the different countries who would be subscribing.  That patently does not exist and not to put a tooth in it the civil legal aid scheme in this country is appalling and, as has been said, is virtually non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to facilitate our own citizens, and it is very helpful to say that they will be able to avail of their legal aid rights in other countries by using the good offices of the Legal Aid Board, but we also have to think of the response from <Col N="358" /> the other side.  This is not a one-way but a two-way transaction.  There will be applications coming into this country for civil legal aid.  I am afraid that any British, Spanish, Belgian or other residents who go into the legal aid board in their own country and needs to avail of the civil legal aid service in Ireland will get quite a drop when they get their response.  They are going to be pretty annoyed to say the least when they find out what the situation is here in this country.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly I think it is a bit much to put forward this motion before the House, until such time as we are in a position and prepared to offer something like an equivalent service to residents of the other European countries looking for their rights in this country.  In my opinion it is nothing short of a scandal that we have gone on year after year, decade after decade, denying the openness of justice to ordinary people who cannot afford to avail of the luxury.  I have said it before in this House and I will say it again, the old adage still applies &ldquo;justice is open to everybody just like the Ritz Hotel&rdquo;.  If you can afford the expensive costs and fees you can have your justice &mdash; all the courts and all the fashionable lawyers in the land are open to you.  If you cannot afford it and have to rely on free civil legal aid services in this country I am afraid it is going to be a very difficult situation.  Justice, in truth in this country is not open to everybody.  It is open to those who have the money to pay for it to call up that expertise that is available if you have a substantial cheque book account behind you.  That is the situation. What we need is not this motion but an improvement in the legal aid service.  In his speech the Minister points out and gives some examples of the practical benefits of this agreement and he says:</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board will be able to assist the wife in such a case by sending the relevant documents to the Legal Aid authority in England, so that the question of her entitlement to legal aid in England in connection with the proceedings, can be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Of course, that is fine, we can use the Legal Aid Board here as a letterbox and send the correspondence across.  From what I know of the civil legal aid service in England, which is excellent, and has been in the position for decades to offer such services, people will find ready advice available virtually on a free basis. There will be no problem at all with regard to the divorce proceedings going on in England but there will be something very much lacking in the service in Ireland.  The wife's documents will be sent across to the legal aid authority in England but let us remember that as a resident of this State she will want to know the implications of the law in this country of a divorce that might be granted in England.  What will be the implications of maintenance or alimony that would be granted there?  The wife will want to know what her position will be here in this country, and that is the one thing she will not be able to find under any civil legal aid scheme.  Of course the English will give her all the advice she needs in connection with English law but Irish law is quite different and access to that kind of information is denied unless she is in a position to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I think it is a bit unfair to put at our easier disposal social services and in particular, this service of free legal aid that is available on a generous basis in virtually all other European countries without at the same time and by the same token giving a reciprocal service to the citizens of those States who need to avail of it here.  I do not agree with the Minister's statement that most of these cases will simply involve England.  Certainly many of them will, but I think the Minister is not taking into account the effects of the incredible level of emigration from this country.  There has been a massive emigration of spouses and other family members to Germany in particular, the Benelux countries, to Italy and so on.  The fact that there is a large Irish emigrant population in those countries, increasing all the time, is bound to increase the need for the delivery of legal aid services in <Col N="360" /> those countries.  It is just a surprising coincidence that within the last few months I have had occasion to deal with three or four women who were in the process of divorce proceedings arising from the Benelux countries.  Divorce documents were coming from the Belgian and the Dutch courts in their language and it was extremely difficult to get the documents translated and find out what the implications were.  I think the translation service will be availed of quite substantially and I agree with Deputy Colley in that regard.</P>
    <P>I think we must accept that it will not be a matter of filling a form in the Legal Aid Board office and sending it off and that would be the end of that.  Things do not operate quite that simply.  The transactions tend to be ongoing and there will be replies coming back from the other office raising further queries and looking for more information and the position about witnesses.  These things could go on for quite some considerable time, as legal affairs do in all countries, and it could be an ongoing situation.  Clearly, additional staff would be needed in the Legal Aid Board office to handle this on an ongoing basis and to have ongoing files on each and every case.  As the case develops further information is required and the person here will be totally reliant.</P>
    <P>Also an increase in the volume of legal work abroad arises from the high volume of people who go on holidays to Spain, Italy, Greece and so on and get involved in accidents.  That is by no means an unusual occurrence.  Road accidents, bus accidents or accidents in hotels give rise to legal claims and give an increasing line of activity where people would need to avail of the service.</P>
    <P>I am glad the measure has been brought in in so far as it goes, but I feel we should look at ourselves and think of what the attitude of the legal aid boards in European countries and the attitude of the Ministers for Justice, the Minister's opposite numbers will be when the harsh reality hits them about what is on offer in this country.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to try to ensure that we get some kind of civil legal aid system up <Col N="361" /> and running so that we are not brought into a state of total disgrace when comparisons are made between our service and that in the other European countries, and so that at least we are able to give as good as we take.  Self-respect demands that.  It would be damaging to our self-respect if we were shown up in European eyes in the Council of Europe.  These matters are debated and commented on in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. These conventions are reviewed from time to time and questions are raised about them.  I, as a member of the Council of Europe working on and producing these conventions, would feel pretty embarrassed, as would any Irish member, if debates were made in Strasbourg in public highlighting the discrepancies and showing us up for a nation that is just taking what is on offer in the way of social service abroad while not being prepared to give at least the equivalent to those who need to avail of our legal services here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party, I wish to signal at the outset that we support the motion and welcome the fact that it is being discussed in the House today with, it would appear, the agreement of all parties.  It is a useful and worthwhile development that we are bringing our legal aid systems into contact with the legal aid systems existing elsewhere in Europe, particularly with regard to the countries that are signatories to the European Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister at the outset to account for the delay in bringing this motion before the House.  I presume it is to the credit, in part, of this Government that they have, within a short time of assuming office, brought this very useful and important convention to the attention of the House to have it passed and accepted by the House.  A lesson was no doubt learned from the proceedings of the last number of years in extradition cases where it had been overlooked by previous Governments to bring before the House international conventions and agreements that would be a charge on <Col N="362" /> the Exchequer and, by reason of the Constitution, must be brought to the attention of the House in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We should be advised as to why, since February 1977 when this agreement was available to be ratified and taken up by this Government, it has not seen light of day until now.  That point in part helps to underscore in some respects the rather crocodile tears that Deputy Barrett, on behalf of the Fine Gael party, has sought to shed this morning in his very commendable but rather late in the day realisation of the sad state of affairs of legal services for the poor and indigent in this country.  Fine Gael have had the opportunity on many occasions since the institution of this scheme in 1979 to put matters right and have singularly failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The second point that has to be made in welcoming this agreement is to realise that the legal aid services will come to the attention of and under the scrutiny of our international partners in Europe.  The history of legal aid, be it on the criminal or civil side, as it has been protrayed internationally, has been one of deceit and misrepresentation by successive Governments abroad.  It is worthwhile to recall that in the sixties the Fianna Fáil Government of the day and the Taoiseach as Minister for Justice in the Cabinet on occasion indicated abroad that Ireland had a legal aid system, a misrepresentation of the realities here at home.  It was often repeated at international conferences that we had met our modern obligations to civil liberties and indeed to democracy, as has been said by other speakers this morning, by the introduction of the Criminal Legal Aid Act, 1962.  That Act was not acted on until three years later, in 1965, and the whole operation of criminal legal aid was never fully implemented until people were obliged to go to the Supreme Court and force, through legal action, their right to be legally represented on all occasions where the threat of imprisonment could arise from criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the context of civil legal aid it is also worth remembering that no action was <Col N="363" /> taken by any Government until Josie Airey&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the legal profession, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;went to the European courts and compelled the Government to act.  It was not by any magnanimous gesture by the Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil parties in Government towards the poor and the unrepresented that they acted but because they were forced to do so by legal action, first, in the Supreme Court with regard to criminal legal aid and, secondly, in the European Court in the context of civil legal aid.  What did they do in regard to civil legal aid?  They set up the Pringle committee. Many people balked at the idea that a man who had presided so effectively in the non-jury courts over the years might not have done the job with regard to civil legal aid.  It has to be conceded that the report produced one of the most comprehensive, well thought out and structured proposals with regard to the presentation of legal aid.</P>
      <P>It was a very sad occasion in the past year when Mr. Justice Pringle came to Buswells Hotel to mark the tenth anniversary of the publication of the report and had to speak so sadly of how much of what had been proposed then had been utterly and totally ignored by successive Governments.  It must be remembered that Mr. Justice Pringle talked not just about the opening of law centres which would deliver a service but about the introduction ultimately of the comprehensive scheme of legal aid centres that would deliver an education and a system that would make people alert to their rights and would help them in the bringing of actions to improve their positions &mdash; it was not simply the delivery of a legal service to process actions or remedies before the courts, important as that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Mr. Justice Pringle has reported and since the scheme was established in December 1979 the history has been disgraceful. I do not believe there has been <Col N="364" /> a greater scandal in all of the issues, functions and responsibilities that the Minister has to deal with than the way in which civil legal aid is run today.  The question has to be begged as to how it is ever hoped to meet any of the obligations posed for this country under the terms of the convention we are discussing today. The Minister has identified that for the purposes of Articles 2 and 3, the Legal Aid Board will be the receiving and transmitting authority.  To suggest that it will not have a great impact on their work and their responsibilities in view of their scarce resources is again peddling the long history of misrepresentations and deceit that has surrounded ministerial involvement in the delivery of legal aid.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the most recent report of the Legal Aid Board, the report of 1986, one will see that it makes what can only be described as very sad reading.  It is a report which from cover to cover highlights insurmountable difficulties and which pleads on every page for help.  The board operates with great commitment and a desire to see legal aid properly developed and properly worked.  Law centres are staffed by some of the most committed lawyers this country could ever hope to encounter.  People who have given up the option of a very lucrative private practice have gone into the legal aid service in the hope and belief, initially at least, that they would be doing something useful and meaningful for the many poor people who otherwise would not have access to or relief from our courts. One talks with such people on a weekly or daily basis and their spirit is totally destroyed because they are working under conditions that no other Government Department would expect their employees to tolerate.  The day is rapidly coming when the Government will not have available to them any young or newly qualified people prepared to put up with the unbelievable conditions in our law centres.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fennelly, in his report of 1986, pointed out that it was a matter of regret to the board that it was obliged once again in an annual report to headline the fact that although thousands of people <Col N="365" /> had been provided with legal aid and advice since his last report was published that it could still go nowhere near meeting public demand for these services; that the principal piece of hard evidence of the inadequacy of the service was the fact that several law centres, particularly over the past 12 months, had had to close their doors to new work for months on end. Mr. Fennelly also said that the primary reason the legal aid service was unable to meet the demands made on it was that the financial resources necessary to respond to the demands had not been made available.  In the section dealing with the proposals to open new law centres he highlighted the fact that a Government gave authorisation for the location of new centres in major urban areas over 50 miles from any existing centres, in Dundalk, Letterkenny, Portlaoise and Castlebar, and then welched on that undertaking and refused to come up with the funds.  Mr. Fennelly went on to highlight the fact that the moneys made available in 1984 under the Funds of Suitors Act would now run out at the end of 1988 and these were the only funds made available to the board since its inception to allow for any expansion which would have included the opening of the centres in Tralee, the second centre in Cork, and one in Tallaght.  Those moneys will go.</P>
    <P>The staffing difficulties are covered at length.  No other Minister would ask staff to work with the incredible workload and under such conditions as the staff and lawyers are expected to work under in these law centres.  To ask for help or aid from them is an impossibility at this stage. One would be dealing with people who are at their wits end and do not know where to go from here.</P>
    <P>The Minister was made aware of all this when we talked about the European Convention for the Enforcement of Judgments, when it was raised by me on the Adjournment debate here in February; the problems are known to him. In the midst of this, when we thought that the Minister might listen and take cognisance of the position of civil legal aid here, we see that in the Estimates <Col N="366" /> published in the last few days, grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board is to be reduced by 1 per cent of what was allocated in the current year.  There is no prospect of improvement, of development, of anything being done to meet the demands made by the chairman of the Legal Aid Board over the years in the terms contained in his reports.  The amount of money is to be reduced.  In real terms what that means is a reduction of up to 10 per cent in the workability of the moneys made available to the law centres over the next year.  It means there will be no new centres and that there will be the closure of centres for months on end simply to catch up with the back-breaking workload.  It means the embargo on staff that has decimated the numbers working in the office will be left in place.  There will be no new staff employed to fill the many needs.  Many of the centres in towns around the country will not be serviced or will be serviced in the unsatisfactory way in which the scheme has worked to date.</P>
    <P>None of that is reflected in a glib pass-age in the Minister's statement where he suggested that he realises that the board's resources are under some strain.  What a ridiculous understatement of the situation. It is not just under some strain. The system is in tatters, almost at a standstill and likely to collapse entirely in the coming year because the Minister has not just failed to increase the allocation but has reduced it substantially in real terms.</P>
    <P>In the midst of all of this the Minister's motion this morning suggests that this is the type of scheme that we should bring forward to our partners in Europe, telling them that we have a service available to assist in the transmission and reception of legal aid from the other contracting parties.  We do not.  That must be said loud and clear here this morning.  The idea that we have such a service must not be peddled by the Minister when he goes back to Europe saying that we are taking up this agreement.  I hope that by the time the budget comes in January the Minister, having listened to what has been said here this morning, will have <Col N="367" /> taken serious steps to redress the appalling conditions that surround the delivery of civil legal aid here and will have something positive to tell us, the board and all the people working in the service, so that we can then, in a truthful way, and with some pride, approach our international obligations under the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion this morning for two reasons.  First, it raises the whole question of the lack of free civil legal aid here and rips aside the curtain of respectability that we have built around it, revealing the reality behind it.  Women here have to rely almost entirely on European directives, on European conventions and on European legislation to bring us into a mainstream Europe that really and truly not alone protects the rights of European citizens but also, through pressure and resources, insists that those protections can in fact be satisfied even when people cannot afford it themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan went through the history of the lack of free civil legal aid here and the long struggle to bring it in.  This is not the first time that I have castigated the lack of political will on all sides to give the right kind of resources and priority to free civil legal aid here.  I want to particularly highlight this morning, to the embarrassment and shame of this House, that it was the one lonely, solitary case of a woman in Cork, Mrs. Josie Airey who, by herself, under incredible strain and with no resource here to protect or support her, wrote to Europe in desperation, and her plea was heard.  In fact Europe was appalled at the need for civil legal aid here particularly as it affected women, and the lack of political will or will on the part of the legal profession itself to take any steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing I always admire about the legal profession is how wary and how right they are to protect their judicial responsibilities without any interference from the State.  One thing which causes me to be a little cynical at times is that if the same amount of energy and pressure was applied by the legal profession into <Col N="368" /> pushing for the resources they need to implement a proper legal system for everybody regardless of income I believe that legislators would be put under pressure and would have to listen.  That would not leave the legislators off the hook but all I am saying is that all professions with their commitment to what they are trying to achieve should raise hell when this does not prove possible.  One of the most outstanding examples in this regard is the denial of free civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>Another cynical thought which struck me this morning, and indeed Deputy Taylor referred to this fact, is that there will be a far greater need, in the all European sense, for access to free civil legal aid in other countries and for us to supply it because of the mobility of our work-force and those who travel to Europe for their holidays.  We should ensure that a structure exists to meet those needs.  The thought which struck me this morning is that we have had to look to Europe for jobs and I would not like to think that some of our less well off people in desperate circumstances might be forced to emigrate in order to get free civil legal aid because it is not being supplied in this country.  As of now it is not being supplied to any degree which would be considered satisfactory.  The Minister needs to go much farther than he indicated in his speech, that he realises that the board's resources are under some strain at present.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that the board are under strain and that there is a lack of facilities and a shortage of personnel in our free civil legal aid centres.  It is more than a scandal, it amounts to a denial of justice. If we were to talk about democracy, one of the foundation stones of democracy should be that we guarantee justice for all our citizens.  This we are patently not doing.  I would like to quote one figure from a recent ESRI report on poverty in this country.  It stated that the percentage of the population living in poverty in Ireland is steadily rising and that Ireland now has more than 1,200,000 people living in households where the weekly income is below £48.70 per adult equivalent. This means that a married couple <Col N="369" /> without children have less than £82.80 per week.  The report further shows again and again that households with children make up two-thirds of that number.  It also goes on to show that households where the lone parent is a woman are next on the list.</P>
    <P>Who needs to seek free civil legal aid in this country?  Josie Airey is a sterling example &mdash; a woman deserted, abused, battered and left with the responsibility for caring for her children without an adequate income to support them in any basic sense.  There are thousands of such households in this country.  It is bad enough that we cannot at any stage provide enough resources for our free civil legal aid centres having been forced by Europe to set them up but the fact that we can reach the end of the eighties, heading towards 1992 with full European integration, and not feel constrained to raise our standards to European standards and not marginalise people out of the legal system through the denial of free civil legal aid, is an embarrassment and a shame that I do not think any of us can live with.</P>
    <P>That is not the worst part, it is not our finer feelings that I am thinking about but rather of the day-to-day struggle of women in particular who are caught up in bad marriages and who have a need for free civil legal aid and of our failure to fulfil our promise or pledge to set up free civil legal aid centres in the remoter parts of Ireland.  The few that we have are under such severe strain and so over-loaded with work that they have to say to people no matter how desperate their cases are that through no fault of theirs they cannot take their cases and that they will have to wait.  Many of those people are in bad circumstances and are therefore in desperate need of legal support and aid.</P>
    <P>I have met women, as have I am sure other Members of this House, who find it impossible to pay the bus fare from Dublin's remoter housing estates into one of its central legal aid centres.  What about those women living in rural areas?  I do not think we can sit there as legislators and live with the fact that we have been <Col N="370" /> forced by Europe to supply the small skeleton structure we have in existence and with the reality that not alone is free civil legal aid being denied to women, in particular living in households such as the ones I have described and who have the greatest need to have recourse to free civil legal aid, but that we feel we do not have to justify why we are denying it to them.</P>
    <P>Another dimension, and this also has a European aspect, is the whole question of foreign divorces.  I know of cases where the first indication the woman received, particularly from husbands working abroad, is when divorce papers were served on her.  It is enough of a shock when they are served in one's own language and one can at least understand what the impact of the papers is, but can you imagine the impact on a woman being served papers in a language she cannot understand and having to operate through a court she knows nothing about?  As I said, there is no point in us talking about being part of mainstream Europe in regard to the provision of free civil legal aid unless we are prepared to invest, firstly, on behalf of our own citizens and, secondly, in regard to the European Agreement we are now entering and should fulfil.  We need the back-up resources, translation facilities in particular, as most of us do not have two or three languages.  Again, I am coming back to those who will be most affected, a great number of whom have not had the privilege of learning languages.  In their day-to-day struggle for survival the last thing they would do is try to learn a language, the language which they would have to understand when dealing with the divorce papers served against them.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by making two points. The first is that we could provide a free civil legal aid service to those who are at present denied it by integrating such a service into the community information centres which are already set up and which are working well all over the country. That will not make the Exchequer destitute.</P>
    <P>On every possible occasion between <Col N="371" /> now and budget day I will highlight the need for more resources for the free civil legal aid service here.  We were dragged before the European Court on such issues as equal pay, equal opportunity and human rights and I have no doubt that we will be embarrassed by being dragged before the European Court on the issue of free civil legal aid proving once more that our citizens cannot trust their Legislature. It is possible that some citizens will bring the Government before the European Court for their failure to provide a proper free legal aid service as is available in other European countries. That service is being denied, unjustifiably, to our citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the Government being brought before the European Court due to their neglect in regard to this issue.  There is a political will to deal with this and I appeal to the Minister to insist at Cabinet level on adequate funds being made available for free civil legal aid.  At a time when there is a debate in regard to the distribution of national lottery funds we should consider allocating resources to the free civil legal aid scheme.  We were told that resources would be made available from those funds to the arts, culture and sport but I should like to appeal on behalf of the 1,200,000 people who are in need, that some of the lottery funds be devoted to guaranteeing the rights of such people. They should be given a basic sense of citizenship which the rest of us can afford. Such funds should be allocated to assist those people rather than being given for GAA pitches, tennis courts or golf clubs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the agreement is to facilitate residents of one contracting State in making application to another contracting State for free civil legal aid.  In other words, we are saying to the other contracting States that we will assist their citizens in making application for free legal aid that is available here.  Governments of the other contracting states are saying that they will facilitate citizens of their countries in <Col N="372" /> making application to Ireland for assistance under the free legal aid scheme in operation here.  That sounds very good and it is an improvement so far as it goes but if we are seriously offering under this agreement citizens of contracting states free legal aid in return for reciprocal assistance for our citizens we have a bit of a cheek.  We are engaging in a bit of conmanship.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the Legal Aid Board are doing the best they can.  Those who are assigned a barrister or solicitor by the board to do work get an excellent service.  They are treated courteously by the board and their case is looked after.  However, the board do not receive adequate funding, do not have sufficient staff or proper accommodation to make any impression on the demand by citizens for free civil legal aid.  When I practised as a solicitor I represented people who were anxious to avail of the free legal aid scheme in the UK.  That was about 25 years ago but at that time there was an efficient free legal aid scheme operating in the UK.  That scheme covered what are commonly known as running down actions and all types of civil litigation.  The free legal aid available here is confined to family law but it is not adequate to cover the demands made on it.  It does not pretend to deal with the volume of family law it is asked to deal with and does not deal with running down actions or commercial law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of Ireland signing this agreement and I hope that as a result of that action we will be shamed into providing a proper system of free legal aid for our citizens.  If citizens of other states apply through their Governments for free legal aid here they will find that it is not available and as a result we will be brought before the European Court. In that event we will be forced into adopting a suitable free legal aid scheme.  If the agreement means anything it is that the existing board will have more work thrust upon it.  If it does not mean that there is no sense in doing what we are doing; this is just a sham, a pretence.  If this puts <Col N="373" /> more work onto an already grossly over-worked and understaffed free legal aid board it means that the ordinary resident who relies on free legal aid, especially in family law, will fare worse than at present instead of better.  We would also be held up to ridicule by countries like the UK and other European countries who have a genuine system of free legal aid.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Courts Bill which abolished juries and introduced regulations curtailing representation in certain legal actions for personal injuries and so on, I stated and now repeat that if the effect of that Bill which was not concerned in any way with the administration of justice but was concerned solely with reducing insurance premiums, will be to reduce the level of administration of justice it was a bad day's work. The effect of the Courts Bill will be to make it more difficult for litigants with an arguable case to get legal representation. There is an obligation on the Government to provide a proper free legal aid system.</P>
    <P>In the event of someone knocked down by a car it is now harder to get a medical report as it is more expensive.  Now, more doctors want an undertaking from the solicitor that whether a plaintiff wins, loses or draws, they will be paid.  It is now more difficult to get a professional witness such as a medical man, an engineer or an architect to come from rural Ireland and spend a day or two away from his practice giving evidence in court. These professional witnesses are now demanding undertakings from solicitors that they will be paid for their time in court irrespective of the outcome of the case.  It will take a little time for the problems relating to absence of free legal aid to surface but within the next two or three years the complaints will have moved from the insurance area and they will relate to people with an arguable case being unable to get representation.  Open and shut cases will still present few problems and wealthy people will not be faced with many problems but the man of no means or of moderate means will find it much more difficult to get a solicitor to take his case, running the risk of having <Col N="374" /> to pay fees to doctors for reports and for attendance at court and to a barrister. Few barristers will take a brief and live with a case unless they are satisfied they will get paid.  They are the sorts of problems Deputies will hear about at their clinics.</P>
    <P>If the signing of this agreement and the entry into this convention brings to the surface the absence of a proper free legal aid scheme it will have done a good day's work.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter carefully and heed the advice he must have received from the free legal aid board.  I am sure they are telling the Minister that they are very much in arrears with their work, that they have not enough staff to discharge their obligations and that their office accommodation is miserable.  Will the Minister look into that and provide a reasonable scheme of free legal aid because the consequences of the other measures we have passed in this House will bring to a head the sort of complaints I have mentioned? This proposal will also add more work to the existing staff of the free legal aid board and the position of people who need help will deteriorate instead of improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and congratulate the Minister.  I disagree with some of the speakers who feel that the system is jammed up and that this proposal will not see the light of day.  I see the whole process as being a very effective one in which an aggrieved party, for instance, a wife with a husband in England, can make an application to the Legal Aid Board and they can merely transmit the application to their counterparts in Britain.  There will be no translating expenses in a case like that.  Indeed a party to a marriage where a person speaking another language was involved would probably not need a translating service and the necessity of translating in that case would probably not be insisted upon by the applicant.</P>

    <P>In a case where a husband has absconded to England there will be great benefits.  Having looked into the logistics of tracing an errant husband or wife in <Col N="375" /> Britain I have been impressed with the facility there in relation to making an application to court.  If a husband is in the British army it is possible to have his number traced and also his location.  If the husband is registered for social welfare purposes it is possible to get the equivalent of his PRSI number in Britain and make an application to have the papers served on him at the address to which his payments are made.  It has been the case that people like me have been endeavouring to inveigle English solicitors to take on cases on an instalment basis and asking people in Ireland to make most complex arrangements with solicitors to have the case carried out for them in England.  The road will now be open for these people.  Many women in my constituency have been waiting for this type of scheme for many years and will be greatly assisted by it.  There will be immediate relief, as long as the Minister, the Department and the Legal Aid Board maintain this as a form filling exercise and transmit the cases to the British Legal Aid Board.  It should be done in the simplest possible way, although if people want to make work out of it I am sure it can be done.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that the Legal Aid Board are quite short of funds and may not have all the facilities they would want and we would wish to give them, the move is a very desirable one.  I represent a rural constituency where there may not be quite as many of these problems as elsewhere.  The number is still quite significant and I look forward to working under this legislation and producing results for constituents.  That is what matters at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We should consider why legal aid is necessary.  It is necessary because people cannot get justice without hiring lawyers.  The law is so complicated that the citizen cannot understand it and cannot represent himself before a judge. If the law is so complicated that the citizen cannot represent himself and has to hire a lawyer for the purpose, that is <Col N="376" /> because the law has been made complicated by this House.  It is important to go back to the fundamentals.  The cost of legal aid derives from the Floor of this House because it is we who make the law so complicated that people are unable to represent themselves.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling that in Britain legal aid costs in the region of £400 million.  In a period in which the consumer price index increased by 59 per cent, the cost of legal aid in Britain increased by 300 per cent.  Money is being poured through legal aid into a system of justice which is inherently inefficient and expensive.  This is something which was drawn very much to the attention of the Irish public by Commissioner Peter Sutherland at a recent meeting at the Irish Centre for European Law.  He asked how the Irish legal system compares in the provision of rapid, efficient and authoritative judgments with other legal systems.  How do Irish legal costs compare?  He asked what is to prevent the Irish legal system from becoming a centre of excellence within the European framework.  If the Irish legal system were reformed and made more efficient, I ask what is to prevent it from being the system that people would choose for the settlement of international legal disputes, rather than the system in London, Brussels or elsewhere.  Increasingly contracts are being entered into which have a multinational dimension and people have the choice to arbitrate disputes relating to those contracts in any one of a number of courts.  If our legal system continues to be so expensive and cumbersome people will choose to arbitrate those issues before another justice system somewhere else in Europe and Irish money will be going to other countries to have disputes settled which might be settled here if our system were more efficient, with the consequent inflow of other people's money.  Our legal system in the context of 1992 should be seen, if it were reformed and made more efficient, as a possible earner of foreign exchange.  The legal system needs to prepare for 1992 just as much as manufacturing or service industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> Our present adversarial system of justice is possibly one of the worst ways of achieving justice one could imagine.  It is predicated on the basis that one person exaggerates one side of an issue and then a second person exaggerates the opposite side on the opponent's behalf; then a third party, the judge or jury, decide which of the two exaggerations is correct or whether the truth lies between the two exaggerations.  Three parties are involved in settling something, whereas under a system of arbitration one person would do, if the individuals were allowed to put their own case.  It might be said that this is idealistic and fanciful talk outside the realm of the practical.  It is not.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is an excellent and efficient body.  They settle issues of liability, deciding how much a person should be paid in compensation for a particular injury. They deal with exactly the same sort of issues as the High Court, except that in the latter case the injury would have been caused by a civil wrong.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal also decide issues of liability.  They will decide whether a person contributed to his injury by starting a fight in which he may have come off worst.  They decide issues of relative blame, just as the High Court does.  It is not simply a question of putting a figure on damages; there are also questions of liability.  How does the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal compare in terms of efficiency with the High Court?  Very well indeed.  I have been told by a practitioner for whom I have very high regard &mdash; if I mentioned his name here I think everybody would recognise him for what he is in this regard &mdash; that he knows that a case in regard to exactly similar circumstances can be settled in half an hour before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal that would take the High Court a whole day to settle.  Part time barristers go before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal early in the morning.  Everybody gets a chance to say his piece, including the injured party and anybody who believes he might be paid too much, and the matter is settled in half an hour. <Col N="378" /> People may not be entirely happy but they have got what they were looking for. In the case of the High Court an amount of paper work has to be done before the case is heard, possibly two years later. Eight people used to be involved but that has been reduced somewhat as a result of welcome changes made by the legal profession.</P>
    <P>There is still a substantial number of people speaking on behalf of all sides.  It is no wonder that the same case that would take half an hour before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal takes five or six hours before the High Court.  It clearly indicates that in terms of speedy access to justice &mdash; and it is a fair adage that justice delayed is justice denied &mdash; our legal system does not really measure up.  One might ask why that is. It is the case because the law is made unduly complicated by the legislators, for a start, and people cannot easily read the law.  It is also the case because much of our law is based on precedent and law reporting here is deplorably behind-hand and as a result it is not easy for people to find out what are the precedents of a particular case.  Certainly, an intelligent individual trying to find precedents with regard to his case would have immense, if not impossible, difficulty in so doing.</P>
    <P>It is also the case because our Constitution provides &mdash; I think in Article 40 but I am not sure &mdash; that people must have a right to have their cases heard before a court.  It is argued that there is no way that any tribunal could be introduced which would, if you like, say that people must settle their problems inexpensively and in so doing forego the right to have their cases heard in court.  If people go to arbitration and know that if they do not like what the tribunal gives them, they can always go to the High Court, one might as well not have a tribunal at all because it will not have the effect of trying to settle things.</P>
    <P>The question that I would ask and I appreciate that it is in the nature of being fundamental, is, given that it is immensely difficult to get justice in this country, surely we should be looking at a fundamental reform of our legal system <Col N="379" /> in so far as this matter is concerned, given that poor people cannot get justice &mdash; either they cannot get legal aid because the legal aid system is blocked up and can deal only with matrimonial or family law cases in so far as it deals with any cases and just does not listen to other civil wrongs issues because the money is not available to do so or, alternatively, they cannot get justice because they are not poor enough to qualify for civil legal aid but are too poor to afford the price of going to court.  People who have good cases cannot go to court but if they do, they may expect to get very large damages. The whole thing has immense complications because it has become almost a lottery &mdash; if you do go to court you expect to do rather well from it but many people must be paid out of your damages because the system is so inherently expensive.</P>
    <P>The question that I would put to the House is, given that our legal system does not actually give justice to most people in civil cases because of its costs and cumbersomeness, and given that many issues that should be settled inexpensively are not so settled, should we not be looking at the constitutional provisions in this regard, in order to facilitate an arbitration, or tribunal, or small claims court approach to the settlement of problems? I would like to see a small claims tribunal, for example, which would have powers to decide in matters of injuries or losses, suffered on account of defective goods, which cost up to, say, £1,000.  This would be presided over by a chairman sitting on his own who would intervene, who would assist the parties to settle their arguments and sort out points of law rather than allow the parties to present their cases before him.  It would operate informally without rigid rules of procedure and essentially aim at reaching a settlement between the parties in the most inexpensive manner possible and that people would have their day in court, so to speak, at much less cost to themselves and to the taxpayer than is possible under the present system.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that it is <Col N="380" /> not just the money that the State spends on civil legal aid which comes out of the taxpayer's pocket, but also the great deal of money spent on maintaining the court system.  Would the Minister indicate if a small claims court is possible under our Constitution without running into the difficulties that it restrains people's rights to appeal against decisions and would be contrary to the relevant article of the Constitution?  If it is wrong, in terms of our Constitution, to introduce a small claims court or series of tribunals for settling different categories of legal disputes, some with regard to matrimonial issues, some with regard to injuries and some with regard to consumer issues, if such a network of tribunals for settling issues would be unconstitutional, in view of the serious problems which exist in obtaining justice in this country, would the Government be prepared to consider amending the Constitution in that regard?  If there is no constitutional obstacle, on the other hand, could the Minister indicate if he is not prepared to introduce the small claims court or a series of tribunals similar to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal to which I referred?</P>
    <P>I would mention another body which operated with similar expedition and is perhaps a model as to how our court system might work and that is the Stardust Compensation Tribunal which, again, settled a large succession of claims to the satisfaction of most of those who were injured and did so much more quickly and inexpensively than would have been the case if each of the cases had had to go before the High Court.  If we can do that in the case of a particular very tragic incident, namely the Stardust disaster, why should we not consider a similar approach with regard to all those who are looking for justice in other similar cases?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">

      <P>The question of liability. <Col N="381" /> is decided by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, as I indicated, so a tribunal can operate in the case of questions of liability, as well.  I accept that in the case of the Stardust tribunal, liability had been accepted and agreement on the amount was being sought but liability could also be decided in a tribunal setting in other cases.  Liability would certainly arise if there were a small claims court and if that system were to operate it would need to settle issues of liability as well as amounts of damages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very important because if it takes two or three years to obtain justice people will seek a larger sum of money to compensate for the delay.  People will have built up a pool of resentment during the period in which justice was delayed, so that the settlement, whenever it comes, will be less satisfactory to them.  To some extent what a court does is not just give money to people for an injury but it gives them the psychological feeling that they have got justice and that they have purged whatever issue it is that has caused them concern.  If that is being delayed people will be denied the feeling that they can get justice quickly.  I will wind up my remarks, unless there are some more interruptions which may tempt me to go on for longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the truth.  From my vestigial knowledge of the legal system Deputy Fitzpatrick has made a very valid point.  People aften suspect lawyers who have settled on their behalf and frequently they will come to public representatives with half-truths about what actually happened, saying they were not told things which, in many cases, they <Col N="383" /> were told by their lawyer but because they did not want to hear it they forgot it.  In a sense people want to have a third party to hear their case.  The only way they can do that in many cases nowadays is to go to the High Court if the amount sought is above a certain amount, which is immensely more expensive.</P>
      <P>Potentially there is under our present legal system an unlimited demand for civil legal aid.  If the Minister were to quadruple or quintuple or increase 50-fold the amount of money he is spending on civil legal aid it still would not be enough because there would be more and more people coming in with cases to take because the aid was available.  I do not think the answer to the problem is to be found in terms of resources.  It must be found in a reform of the legal system which delivers justice without the necessity of such a heavy level of representation and that involves simplification of the law and this House taking more of an activist approach in regard to simplifying the law and making it accessible to the non-lawyer. It involves also the introduction of a network of tribunals or small claims courts where issues can be settled by an interventionist chairman on an informal basis without the automatic necessity of representation or certainly without any artificial advantage being given to a party in dispute who has representation over one who does not.</P>
      <P>As somebody who does not come from any branch of the legal profession and who can, therefore, look at it, unlike those who have qualified in this area, with a totally unjaundiced eye either for or against I would ask the Minister to consider a fundamental reform of our legal system on more cost effective lines so that it can compete as a method of arbitration of dispute with the courts of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I want to thank the spokespersons for the different parties for the generous welcome which they gave to the motion before us.  I will deal, as best I can, with the different issues raised on the motion <Col N="384" /> proper.  There were quite a number of other matters raised which I do not feel I should deal with today but nevertheless I should like to say to Deputy Bruton that I found his comments enlightening and invigorating.  There is much commonsense in what he said and there is much food for thought for all of us in his contribution.  I accept much of what he said and perhaps now is the time to move a little further than what we have moved to ensure that we never forget that laws are primarily made for people and courts are there to function for the people and that everybody else is there to help the people.  I think that is very important.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Bruton's contribution, I know we will have another opportunity and another time to have a wide-ranging general discussion on the particular matters he raised.  There would be a lot of public support for the Dáil going down that road carefully: we cannot go too quickly.  I would not use the phrase used by Deputy Bruton's colleague, Deputy Barrett, that it would be McDonald type legislation &mdash; nobody would want that.  I am sure Deputy Bruton or any of us would not want that but certainly we should not be afraid to look for change.  I certainly would not be afraid to look for change and I hope we would get cross-party support from most Members of the House.  It is something we can bear in mind.  I would have a lot in common with what Deputy Bruton is offering here today.  I feel at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to Deputy Barrett that it certainly would not?  I thank Deputy Barrett and people in his party and others in this House for the considerable help we got in enacting that legislation which was around for a long time.  I publicly thank them again for that support because I think that legislation is working well.  I know people had divided thoughts and opinions on that legislation and we heard some of them expressed here again today.  From my discussions <Col N="385" /> with the people involved and people who can give a fair and honest assessment without the jaundiced eye, things are moving as this Oireachtas intended they would move.  In the event of a time ever coming when this Oireachtas has to review the operation of that legislation, I gave a guarantee that we would come back and have another look at it.  I stand over that guarantee and I would not be afraid to move down part of that road.</P>
      <P>I should like to say to the House that when the Legal Aid Board was being established I was put under extreme pressure as Minister for Justice of the day to introduce a scheme on the same lines as that operating in the United Kingodm which at that time was costing in the region of £20 million.  I was castigated in this House for not having a scheme similar to the one operating in the United Kingdom.  Today, that scheme is costing, as Deputy Bruton said, in excess of £400 million, a price which even the British Government cannot afford.  They are now reviewing the whole civil legal aid position in the United Kingdom and are establishing it on a different basis altogether. Having said that, I think the Oireachtas was wise at the particular time in not having a situation which was advocated in this House as the records will show, where people could walk in off the streets to any solicitor and take them on on a fee for an appearance at a particular time.  We must remember that we must cut our cloth according to the measure. We are not a very rich little country.  We are giving a very limited service in this regard and I say that quite openly.  I am not telling you anything you do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we get involved in that area I want to express the appreciation of this House to Mr. Niall Fennelly and to the members of the Legal Aid Board for the job of work they are doing.  We understand their difficulties.  They are difficulties which they are living with and which he and his predecessors have lived with since the board was established in 1980.  We would all like to have a situation whereby there would be more centres throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We would like to have a more <Col N="386" /> extensive scheme in operation but we are not in a position to afford it.  That is part of the problem and until such time as we are we will have to hope that our finances will improve.</P>
    <P>In recent days the Book of Estimates was published and it is fair to say that the legal aid scheme has not been reduced substantially in any way with regard to moneys being provided under the particular subhead, bearing in mind that schools and hospitals have been closed and other services have been pulled back to the limit.  I say that because of the recognition the Government have for the work of the Civil Legal Aid Board and what they are trying to do.  I would like to see, as any Minister for Justice would like to see, the scheme extended and better funded and the staffing increased considerably.  I am sure that case could be made by any person in the Oireachtas sitting here on this seat if they were replying to this motion as I am this afternoon. Of course we want that but in the meantime we have got to recognise the realities of the situation.  I want to say a very sincere word of thanks to Niall Fennelly, Senior Counsel, and to those on the Legal Aid Board with him who are spreading their resources as best they can to ensure that the service is there.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the services available under the scheme have been under strain for some time and that the development of services under the scheme, which I introduced in 1980, has not been as rapid as I or any Member of the Oireachtas would have wished.  This is due entirely to the present difficult economic circumstances. The Government are committed to the scheme and I hope that additional funding will be made available for the expansion of services under the scheme when we have overcome the present serious position we are in with regard to our public finances.</P>
    <P>It is easy to exaggerate the position about delays in services under the civil legal aid scheme.  This is a very easy thing to do and although some law centres have to restrict the services they can offer to new clients from time to time, the board <Col N="387" /> have always been able to take on emergency cases without any delay, for example, cases of marital violence requiring immediate recourse to the courts. That remains the position at present at all but one of the board's 12 law centres. The exception is one of the three Dublin law centres which has to refer new emergency cases to the other two Dublin centres for the present.  Applicants for legal aid whose cases do not require immediate action before the courts may have to wait for a period ranging from one to 12 weeks at present.  These are cases that do not require immediate action before the courts and we know that even people wishing to consult private practitioners cannot walk in off the streets; they have to make appointments to see a solicitor and they cannot be accommodated straightaway.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the Legal Aid Board was reviewed recently and sufficient funding will be available to finance the operation of all the board's 12 law centres in 1989.  It has been suggested during the course of this debate that the Legal Aid Board law centres cannot cope with the existing volume of work and as a result of that they will not be able to deal with additional clients who come to them for assistance under the European agreement.  I want to put on the record of the House &mdash; and I hope it is reported as fact &mdash; that the board have been consulted and they consider they will be able to cope with the extra work involved arising from their proposed designation as a transmitting and receiving agency under the European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid.</P>
    <P>The number of additional applications for legal aid from the 13 European countries who are parties to the European agreement, coming here as a result of Ireland's ratification of the agreement, is likely to be small.  People resident outside the State are already entitled to apply to the Legal Aid Board for legal aid in connection with court proceedings under the terms of the civil legal aid scheme. The transmission of such applications <Col N="388" /> through an official authority in the foreign country to the Legal Aid Board, together with all the necessary documentation, should help to reduce the work of the board in dealing with such applications.  As regards requests for legal aid in other contracting states originating from people in Ireland, the board already receive such requests and they regard ratification of the European agreement as a helpful development for them in dealing with such requests by providing special machinery for processing such requests to the relevant foreign legal aid authorities.</P>
    <P>A query was raised by Deputy Barrett, and I think Deputy McCartan, as to how Irish people will know about this agreement and how they will be able to take advantage of it.  When the agreement comes into force I visualise that it will be necessary for the Legal Aid Board to assemble the information and documentation they will require to enable Irish people to avail of the provisions of the agreement, in connection with legal aid applications to other contracting states.  Indeed, the board might wish to arrange appropriate publicity about their proposed new role under the European agreement.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is some concern generally in European circles that enough is not done to bring facilities that are available under the European conventions, such as the European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid, to the attention of those who could avail of them.  A meeting of European Ministers for Justice which I recently attended studied the problem of improving the implementation of European conventions and agreements and recommended that measures be taken to improve co-operation and exchange of information between central authorities designated under various treaties and to bring the existence and functioning of these treaties to the knowledge of all those for whose benefit they are designed.  These are aspects which my Department intend <Col N="389" /> to discuss with the Legal Aid Board following signature by Ireland of the European agreement.  At European level I expect that the European Committee on Legal Co-operation of the Council of Europe will take an active role in implementing the recommendations made at that conference to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, Deputy Colley and others referred to the non-statutory basis of the civil legal aid scheme and said that this is an impediment to Ireland's ratification of the European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid.  They said that the scheme could be terminated at any time by the Government of the day and basically they urged that a statutory scheme be introduced. I am advised that the non-statutory basis of the civil legal aid scheme is no impediment whatsoever to Ireland's ratification of the European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legel Aid.</P>
    <P>The present Administration are entirely committed to the continued operation of the civil legal aid scheme, as have all Administrations since the scheme was introduced in 1980.  It has always been the intention to place this scheme on a statutory footing, after experience had been obtained with the operation of the non-statutory scheme. A Bill is being drafted in my Department to do this and I should like to bring the necessary legislation before the House as quickly as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities and the resources available in the Department.  I understand there are ongoing discussions between my officials and representatives of the Civil Legal Aid Board and their solicitors to see how we can get over whatever difficulties are there.  I have been told that this Bill will not be ready before Christmas but I have urged that it be speeded along as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the question of translation and I should like to refer briefly to this.  The board already have experience in this area and they have engaged outside professionals to advise them on this.  It will be a matter for the <Col N="390" /> board to make whatever decisions they want to in that regard.  This is not new to them.  They are aware of it.</P>

      <P>No, it is a contractual arrangement.  A bit of a song and dance was made by Deputy Mervyn Taylor who regarded the exercise as cynical.  I do not know how he can regard these matters as cynical.  He wanted to know why there was a delay and why it took ten years. He seemed to forget that he was Deputy Government Whip for a long period, during which the delay took place.  I am putting it very simply to him that the delay took place, first, because we did not have a civil legal aid board in existence until 1980 and when in 1984 the Minister of the day decided to do what we are doing here today he had to consult with the Attorney General who sat on it for three years.  That is what the delay was all about and there is nothing cynical in that.</P>
      <P>I could go further than that to prove a political point to Deputy Taylor but I do not think that is necessary.  It was not the fault of the Minister of the day or of the Department of Justice.  It was just that the Attorney General of the day could not make up his mind whether Article 29.5.3º of the Constitution was the overriding factor in this area.  That was the reason for the delay.  Obviously Deputy Taylor is going to too many meetings of the Labour Party Administrative Council where lots of things are happening with the Militant Left which probably upset him and would lead to any normal person becoming slightly cynical.  On a more serious note, I want to thank Members for their generous welcome to this motion and to say I think we have done something worthwhile this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was dealing with the cost of employers' liability insurance.  There is a view among the Confederation of Irish Industry and employers that the high cost of insurance is the result of very high awards being paid to people who are injured in accidents in the workplace.  Employers and insurance companies put too much emphasis on the level of awards granted to people injured at work.  It is more important to concentrate on reducing the number of accidents and the avoidance of accidents in the workplace.  It is very important that greater attention should be paid by the Department of Labour, the Confederation of Irish Industry and employers to providing proper safety education for staff.  There should be regular briefings by employers &mdash; with the co-operation of trade unions &mdash; telling employees the safety precautions which should be taken at work.  This is vitally important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspectorate in the Department of Labour should be much more vigilant in enforcing safety regulations.  If a man loses a hand, an arm or a leg at work, no amount of compensation can make up for the loss of the limb.  The worker will have to suffer that loss as long as he lives. Much more attention should be paid to educating the workforce on safety precautions at work.  We read in the papers that a person who has suffered horrific injuries &mdash; he may be left quadraplegic &mdash; gets £1 million compensation but that does not make up for the injuries he has suffered.  I remember a person being granted £20,000 in the sixties and there was an uproar.  At that time it was unheard of that a person would get so much money by way of compensation.  I was in the Four Courts when the jury announced that award of £20,000, the biggest award ever at that time.  The papers were full of the story and they were saying that this would have an effect on insurance premiums.  I do not know if that man is alive, nor do I remember his name, but that £20,000 would not make up for the injuries he suffered.  Since the sixties awards of £100,000, £200,000 and so on, have been granted.  That is a lot <Col N="392" /> of money but no amount of money can compensate for the injuries these people suffer.  When people are injured at work they must get compensation so that they can get proper medical and nursing care. The cases I am talking about are injuries at work, people involved in car accidents, children injured at school and so on.</P>
    <P>As regards employers' liability insurance, there are far too many accidents taking place in factories all over the country.  There is supposed to be an accident book available for the departmental inspectors, but I wonder how often these officials inspect these books. If the book shows that accidents are happening regularly, the official should take action.  I have been a qualified solicitor for more than 20 years and in all my years in court I have rarely, if ever, seen any action brought by the Department of Labour against employers when a person was injured at work.  If action were taken, the chances are that many of these accidents would not occur.  These statistics should be available to the Department of Labour.  The Department have power under the Factories Acts and Safety in Industry Acts and they should ensure that proper safety precautions are being taken.</P>
    <P>The Department used to issue the Annual Report of the Industrial Inspectorate of the Department of Labour.  As far as I can ascertain the last annual report published by that inspectorate was in 1983-84.  I can understand a delay of three, six, 12 or 18 months, but the last official report was issued in 1983-84.  The inspectorate of the Department of Labour monitor what is happening in the workplace.  I accept that there has been a reduction in staff numbers because of the cutbacks, but it is essential that we reduce the number of accidents in the workplace.  With the co-operation of the Department, the employers and trade unions, the number of accidents can and must be reduced.  If the number of accidents is reduced premiums will be lowered. We must emphasise this fact.  I urge the Department to be more vigilant in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned the measures to be taken by the Minister for the Environment. He said:</P>
    <P>Also, the Minister for the Environment is proposing to introduce new legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more effectively with certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences.  The measures proposed could include the impounding of motor vehicles to deal with uninsured driving.</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement and I am certain it will have the support of almost every Deputy.  Efforts must be made to curtail the proportion of people driving without insurance &mdash; about 20 to 25 per cent.  This means that those people who pay insurance must also pay for those who are driving uninsured vehicles.</P>
    <P>Another aspect not covered by the provisions of this Bill is that of road accidents occasioned by the condition of our roads, with potholes, damage done to road surfaces, occasioning damage to vehicles, which in turn, leads to accidents.  It is crucial that additional measures be taken by the Minister for the Environment to improve our roads structure.  Whatever measures the Minister introduces to tighten up the Road Traffic Act code and alleviate insurance problems &mdash; to render our roads structure safer for traffic generally &mdash; will have the full support of this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to the relevant Ministers who introduced legislation to curb drunken driving and to the Judiciary for the commonsense manner in which they enforced the terms of such legislation which has led to a considerable reduction in the incidence of accidents on our roads. Long may it continue.</P>
    <P>Medical insurance has been the subject of a vast amount of publicity in recent times because of a number of actions, one of which is at present on appeal and to which I will not refer in detail today. A solicitor, Mr. John Schutte, held a seminar recently in the vicinity of this House, the theme of which was how medical personnel could reduce their <Col N="394" /> liability on account of medical negligence. I can foresee clearly that there will be increased claims on the part of patients against nurses, doctors and hospitals because of the reduction in personnel in hospitals throughout the country. Personnel in our hospitals are now working under such stress and strain it is bound to affect their judgment on occasion and their ability to maintain proper medical records.  Indeed such stress is bound to affect decisions which have to be taken on the spot.  Inevitably this means that accidents can happen leading to increased claims being lodged against the medical profession.  It is of the utmost importance that care be taken to monitor patients' treatment in hospitals in order to avoid such claims.</P>
    <P>In recent months there have been a number of deaths in hospitals some of which might have been avoided.  A patient may die because a nurse or doctor physically could not attend him or her. That patient's family have a right to proper compensation.  Again, if a patient suffers permanent damage on account of postponement of an important operation they were awaiting, he or she is equally entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the high cost of insurance premiums here. People tended to blame an unfortunate victim of an accident awarded high damages by our courts.  Because of the collapse of two or our insurance companies &mdash; the PMPA and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland &mdash; a levy has been imposed on all insurance premiums.  That was occasioned by the lack of proper management control on the part of those companies in the past.  I remember when premiums were increased annually by the PMPA, say, 15 to 25 per cent brought about by imprudent investment, lack of management control within the company and so on.  The same applied in the case of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland some of whose management decisions proved to be grossly imprudent or incorrect. It is the consumer who suffers by way of increased insurance premiums. Therefore, we must ensure that all our insurance companies are run efficiently <Col N="395" /> under proper management procedures. Here I might pay tribute to the new management of the PMPA and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland who took over those companies in difficult times.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce have a responsibility to ensure that our insurance companies are properly managed and run efficiently.  They had power to seek information about the running of those companies and are seeking additional powers under the provisions of this Bill.  It is essential that they be given those powers.</P>
    <P>One matter that concerns me a lot is that of pillion passengers on motor cycles not covered by the provisions of this Bill. It must be recognised that pillion passengers are not covered by insurance. Even if the driver of the motor cycle is 100 per cent blameworthy and his or her pillion passenger is injured &mdash; even if the most horrific injuries are sustained such as loss of a limb or back injury &mdash; he or she will not be paid a penny by way of compensation in 97 per cent of cases.  It is essential that legislation be introduced to ensure that such pillion passengers be compensated by insurance companies.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the internal market in 1992 there will be tremendous scope for expansion among our insurance companies in all branches of insurance and assurance.  Our insurance companies have the ability and expertise, built up over the years, to enable them to compete with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>The regulations giving the Department additional powers to seek information from insurance companies will be of benefit to the companies themselves.  It is my belief that they have a great future by way of expansion of their businesses after 1992, attracting business here from Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this important Bill.  I understand that the last Insurance Bill was introduced in this House in 1936. Insurance is so important to the nation and commerce generally I am surprised <Col N="396" /> that further legislation was not introduced sooner.</P>
      <P>The purposes of the provisions of the Bill are, first, to strengthen the Minister's legislative powers in relation to the supervision of insurers, secondly, to regulate commission paid to intermediaries where policyholders' interests so require and, thirdly, to introduce a form of regulation for insurance intermediaries.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the problems facing sporting organisations, residents' associations and community groups because of the cost of public liability insurance and the availability of cover.  As chairman of Cork-Kerry tourism, over the past two years it has been brought to my notice by my committees &mdash; especially festival committees &mdash; that they are being forced out of existence due to the high cost of public liability.  In many cases their premiums increased by 400 per cent in 1987-88. Some years ago the cost of insurance was never a matter of concern to Kerry County Council but the figures now being produced, particularly for employers' liability and public liability, are causing headaches for the finances of the county council.  The fact that the Irish public bodies' insurers are probably the only insurance companies which will cover local authorities indicates the real problem in liability insurance.  Every local authority public liability policy carries an excess of £5,000 on each and every claim and this adds greatly to the overall budget of Kerry County Council and other local authorities.</P>
      <P>While public liability and employers' premiums for local authorities are soaring, the fire prevention budget in local authorities is saving millions for insurance companies.  I suggest to insurance companies that they make a contribution to each local authority as they provide excellent fire protection services and save millions of pounds to the companies in regard to fire losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years we have become a nation of legally minded people.  This applies to most countries, particularly America.  The result is that claims and court actions have increased causing <Col N="397" /> higher premiums for motor insurance, employers' liability and especially public liability.  I hope that the Courts Bill to abolish juries in personal injuries cases will help to reduce premiums.  There is evidence that motor insurance premiums have been reduced and I hope that public liability and fire liability will also be reduced in the near future.  At the same time, I urge the Government to introduce new legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more flexibly with certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the compensation fund would be abolished because, as Members of the House know, it has been in operation since the collapse of the PMPA.  It is wrong that people who never had a car in their lives are paying 2 per cent on their fire policies to support the PMPA and ICI.  I know the fund can be used to meet claims arising from the liquidation of non-life insurers but all Members will hope that it will not be extended to meet other claims.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this question. An article in <i>Aspect</i> recently suggested that all might not be well with an insurance company looking for business over the telephone.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on the article as I am sure it has been brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>The supervision of insurance cannot guarantee solvency but it is very important for the Minister to have full power to take immediate action to deal with problems as they arise.  Section 36 refers to the power of the Minister to require a reduction in commissions.  May I assume that the Minister can request an increase in the commission rates?  It is wrong that building societies can get as much as a 25 per cent commission on house insurance policies and that brokers' commissions can be as low as 12.5 per cent.  I do not blame the building societies, the insurance companies should not allow this to happen.  The vast majority of agents and brokers are to be congratulated for carrying out their business in a very responsible fashion.  However, we all know that difficulties have arisen <Col N="398" /> in the past and, unfortunately, as in the case of other businesses, there are &ldquo;cow-boys&rdquo; who tarnish the good name of the industry.  We all know of cases of fraud, usually in the area of single premiums.  I hope the Bill will raise the standards of agents and brokers and I know that the two bodies mainly dealing with the matter &mdash; NIBA in particular &mdash; have been trying to raise standards over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>The big fault in the Bill is the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo;.  Section 43 defines &ldquo;agent&rdquo; as a member of a representative body of insurance brokers which requires compliance with the provisions of the Act as a condition of membership and a body recognised as such by the Minister. Section 44 provides that the broker has a professional indemnity bond which varies according to the size of the brokerage. An average small country broker's bond is in the region of £5,000.  Section 46 states that the consumer bond must be to the value of approximately £25,000. Section 47 states that he must have a separate bank account in connection with life insurance.  Indeed, the agent must have several bank accounts.  The broker is compelled to maintain an office, pay staff, PRSI, telephone, etc., in addition to many other outlays.  The agent has no expense except the consumer bond and yet he is almost equal to the broker as he is allowed to have four life and four non-life agencies.  Any conduct unbecoming has to be paid for by the insurance company as outlined in section 50.  I am not happy with this section so I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to reduce the number of agencies to one life and one non-life to an agent.  After all, an agent is a casual or part time employee.  In many cases the agent is a bank manager, a garage owner or a teacher.  It is evident that the broker has a responsibility which is not recognised and I hope the Minister will draw a line between a broker and an agent.  It is estimated that there are approximately 700 brokers operating here, in rural areas many of them are small and independent. If this legislation is not changed, I fear <Col N="399" /> that most of the rural brokers will go out of business.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the number of people who find it difficult to acquire insurance, in many cases they are not even quoted.  It is very important that something is done for these people because their job and future could depend on it.  If they are quoted a price for insurance, it verges on the ridiculous. Fifty per cent of the population are under 25 years of age and it is essential that they are given an opportunity to get some sort of car insurance.  A number of reasons are given for the high cost of premiums, one is the number of uninsured vehicles. This will have to be dealt with in another category because there is a number of uninsured cars on the road.  However, young people should not be penalised for this.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Bureau were set up to alleviate hardship for the victims of uninsured motorists and I hope they will take the initiative in dealing with young people.  I am open to correction but I understand that out of a total of about 750,000 somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 motorists are uninsured.  This is major legislation and a milestone for the industry, the wider financial services industry and &mdash; equally important &mdash; it is a major breakthrough for the consumer. The Insurance Bill is only one element in a comprehensive package of legislation which the Government are bringing forward, embracing the Central Bank Bill, the new building societies legislation and the companies legislation all of which amount to a radical overhaul and updating of our financial services legislation. The Government are bringing forward this legislation at a time of rapid change in the insurance industry.  The legislation will provide a framework within which these changes can be accommodated in a way that protects the solvency and stability of the industry, gives much greater protection to the consumer and generally prepares the industry for the major competitive challenges it will face after 1992. In short, this Bill is a charter for the insurance industry for the nineties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already set out in some detail the structure and content of the Bill.  I do not intend to cover the same ground again, but I think it worth reminding ourselves of the main provisions.  Part II sets out new provisions in relation to insurance companies.  In many ways this part merely regulates the existing provisions and EC requirements.  Clearly it is important that the Minister has ready access to all information necessary in relation to insurance companies, in particular the balance sheets.  The public rightly look to the Government to anticipate the difficulties which may arise and provisions have been included to require auditors to report certain matters to the Government.  Let me stress that in this legislation the Government are not seeking in any way to intrude on the day to day management of the company.  What the Government are intent on doing in Part II of the Bill is ensuring that the stability of the industry is adequately protected.</P>
    <P>The second major purpose of the Bill, in Part III, is to regularise commission payments to insurance intermediaries. On a number of occasions the necessity for these provisions has been spelt out. The consumer must be protected from the abuses associated with excessive commission payments and Part III does just that.</P>
    <P>The third absolutely essential element to the Bill, Part IV, relates to the provisions for the first time of a form of regulation for insurance intermediaries. This is long overdue.  The insurance industry is a major area in the financial services industry carrying increasingly closer linkages between insurance companies, the banks and non-bank financial institutions.  It is essential that some form of regular control be imposed over insurance intermediaries.  Let me stress that in setting out the structure contained in Part IV of this Bill the Government's overriding aim has been to raise professional standards within the industry. A form of recognition has been granted to insurance brokers who form the professional core of the industry and the <Col N="401" /> provisions are also aimed at strengthening the accountability of insurance agents.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already set out the intended structure in detail.  Here I want to underline the thinking behind it and in this context the importance which the Government attach to the various provisions of the Bill designed to protect the consumer.  These include, for example, the separation of clients' accounts, provision of a compensation fund and, more generally, an increased accountability and higher professional standards which will be required of both companies and insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>It is a well known fact that we need a strong competitive and stable insurance industry which enjoys the full confidence of the consumer.  The Government believe it is very much in the interest of the industry to maintain high standards. At the same time the Government cannot take this for granted.  We need to strike a balance, and that balance is contained in this Bill which takes account of the very extensive consultations with all interested parties.  High standards are running through the Bill, and this will benefit the consumer.  It would also help the brokers and the companies to stay in business particularly after 1992.</P>
    <P>We should see this Bill in the wider context of a development programme for the insurance industry which the Government have put in place over the last year or two.  Insurance costs have been brought down.  In motor insurance, for example, costs have fallen by up to 10 per cent.  The Courts Bill is already bringing about a fundamental change in the cost structure which will help to reduce the motor insurance premiums further.  More recently the Minister for Justice announced new pre-trial procedures and the introduction of a book of quantum of damages.  At the same time the industry is in excellent financial shape.  The preliminary figures from the Blue Book show a continuing reduction in underlying losses, a drop in the ratio of net claims to earned premiums and a rise in the net premium income.  These important developments mean that the major <Col N="402" /> Insurance Bill is being brought in against the background of a strong solvency industry which is bringing its costs down.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  It is in the right direction.  As I said at the outset, we have had no such serious legislation since 1936 and I hope and trust this is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  I would like to make a few comments in relation to this legislation which itself is welcome in the sense that it introduces a certain extra requirement for compliance, as it were, in certain aspects of the insurance industry, but I think a review of the insurance industry at present should have extended far beyond the ambit of this Bill.  I am not being critical of the Bill itself which is welcome in so far as it goes, but quite a number of other aspects need to be dealt with at present.  For instance, in this country we have become a very claim conscious society with claims in relation to virtually every aspect of life.  Every profession is subject to claim of one kind or another on an ongoing basis and the number of claims is increasing.  This, in the context of 1992 and the internal market and what it will mean, will become more obvious the closer we come to 1992.  One thing I hope to see happen then would be that we would have an insurance system in this country whereby reasonable rates could be available to people who want to insure, notwithstanding the increasing amount and number of claims that are coming before the courts and against the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take a couple of examples. Some of these were mentioned by my colleague Deputy Bruton last evening. Take, for instance, the cost of employer liability.  It would have been a very good time to look exactly at that problem now. It is a cost, an overhead to industry, to the provision of jobs and to the economy. We accept that the money which the insurance companies collect in premiums is put to good use, useful investment purposes and so on, but the actual cost to the employer or the person attempting to <Col N="403" /> provide jobs and encourage investments and get other people to do likewise is of such a nature in comparison with our European partners at present as to make it virtually impossible for our employers to operate on a reasonably equal basis. That simply is unacceptable.  It is wrong that we should have that kind of situation at present, but unfortunately that is the way it stands.  It has got worse and it will get worse and when 1992 comes there will be a period where certain disciplines in the insurance industry will have a derogation for a number of years.  That is grand, but we must remember that business and industry in this country will be opened up to very stiff competition from people who will be in manufacturing and services outside the country, and who will have access to our markets as well as to the market in which we are supposed to be able to compete, the European market.  The people in this country providing financial or manufacturing industry services are entitled to be able to compete on an equal basis but because of the huge cost of employer liability insurance at present it is not possible for them to do so.</P>
    <P>There are very many other overheads which are excessively high.  Generally, we have a very high level of taxation which is also a disincentive and we can do without the problem of high premiums in the insurance area.  The insurance companies will say, rightly so, that there are compelling reasons for this situation.  It is all right for them to say so but the logical conclusion of continuing along that road is that we will reach a stage where it will be virtually impossible to get employer liability insurance at all.</P>
    <P>Let us examine two examples of public liability insurance and take the case of either a very large firm or a very small firm.  I have had countless experiences over the past couple of years of small family firms operating in conjunction with the local authorities, semi-State bodies or health boards in the service areas.  They had adequate public liability insurance until decisions were taken albeit for very good reasons, whereby <Col N="404" /> their premiums were either doubled or quadrupled.  They then had to make a decision whether to continue in business or try to raise the money required for the insurance premium.  Many of the smaller companies took the decision to get out of business because they could no longer afford it.  They also had the possibility of operating in the black economy and operating without cover.  They would have serious problems if they took that option.</P>
    <P>Unless order is introduced in this area of insurance we will see in the very near future a vast growth in uninsured activity which is insurable, and desirably and very necessarily so.  If some measures are not taken soon there will be a large-scale evaporation of small businesses because the businesses are no longer capable of footing the bill required to carry public liability insurance.  This has not come to our attention suddenly.  We are told that by virtually every business person in the country.  They compare the premium for public liability insurance and employer liability insurance in this country with the premiums in the UK and Europe.  Rates are higher in some areas but in many areas the rates are far lower.  We have enough disadvantages, particularly in regard to access to markets, without creating and foisting further burdens upon ourselves by virtue of a situation which could be and should be controlled.</P>
    <P>How do we explain to business people that they should be penalised with regard to public liability and employer liability insurance?  They ask that question repeatedly. They get lots of bland answers from the insurance companies as to the excessive claims and the size of the claims.  That is of little consolation to them.  They are in the business of competing in the open market and their competitors could not care less whether their insurance premiums were quadrupled every year.  The net result is that those who carry that extra overhead have to find some means of absorbing it or passing it on.  Unfortunately this Bill does not tackle that problem at all.  This is a serious flaw in the Bill at present.  I think it was necessary at this stage to take a long hard look at the <Col N="405" /> issue and to find out whether it would be advantageous to take up the issue or whether it should be postponed to a later date.</P>
    <P>Let us also consider the question of insuring public amenities and recreational centres.  It is virtually impossible, in fact it is impossible, for voluntary bodies and local authorities, in many instances, to get insurance cover for play or amenity areas which are used by children. However, I know the local authorities have made certain arrangements themselves whereby they have got around some of the problems but to a great extent voluntary groups are out and they cannot get cover at all.  This is a sad and tragic situation because the voluntary groups have been providing facilities and services which are in tandem and in support of or additional to those provided by the local authorities and the statutory bodies.  In many cases the voluntary bodies provide the services where they do not already exist.  It is impossible for those voluntary organisations to get insurance cover.  I ask why?  The answer given is the continued volume and cost of claims and that the &ldquo;once bitten twice shy&rdquo; law applies.  I accept that is a factor but it is also a factor in the other countries with whom we trade.  However, in other countries they have facilities and seem to be able to cater for these problems but we do not seem to be able to get to grips with them.  Somebody has to take responsibility whether it be the Minister, the Department or the insurance companies. We will have to get together to work out a solution to that problem.  But come it must.  It is grossly and totally unfair that local voluntary bodies who collect their funds locally and provide facilities for the enjoyment of the community at large find that insurance cover is not available to them.  The Minister should intervene very specifically in this area as soon as possible.  In order to give recognition to the great service and work of the voluntary bodies he should make insurance cover available to them on the basis that the individual members concerned will not be faced with a huge liability should a particular claim arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> I wish to deal with a few other aspects of insurance.  This Bill will have some helpful effects on the cost of motor insurance.  I do not think it is going to have a dramatic effect.  Other speakers have referred to the difficulties experienced by young drivers when trying to get insurance, and I know one insurance company in particular has been instrumental in recent times in reducing premiums specifically in that area, which I think is laudable and helpful.  I have often spoken, and I am sure every Member of this House must have spoken to people who say they do not mind paying a high insurance premium when they start off driving but that they expect it to come down at some stage.  They would expect it to come down much quicker than it usually does.  Generally speaking they will point to people who have had continuous claims over a long number of years and seem to have relatively lower insurance premia than they themselves have, despite the fact they have a clean record, albeit for a shorter time.  The moral of the story is that those who have had the most claims are expected to have to pay more.  Obviously insurance companies are doing that but those who seek insurance for the first, second or third time are also paying very heavily for the privilege of getting that type of cover. There is considerable room for manoeuvre.  We should think about it and encourage the insurance companies to go down that road.  For instance let us take the case of hauliers and consider the bills they have to face for employer and public liability insurance together with the insurance on their fleet at present.  Any haulage contractor or carrier will tell you at present that the combination of those three factors makes it barely possible for them to exist, to comply with the regulations and live within the law.  That is not something that has happened yesterday. It has been growing considerably over the past number of years and will continue to grow unless someone somewhere sits down and works out a formula for dealing with the problem.  This Bill gives an opportunity to the Minister to look at the whole position.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the number of applications which he has received for licences to operate the proposed MMDS system; if granted, if they will be sufficient to ensure that the entire country will then be covered by either cable or microwave systems for television signal distribution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department have received a total of 42 applications for MMDS licences.  On the basis of the preliminary examination of these applications I can say at this stage that I am confident that the proposals received will constitute the basis for a country-wide transmission system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the applications to date will ultimately result in nationwide coverage.  That was one of the main points the Minister underlined when he introduced this system &mdash; to extend multi-channel viewing to the rest of the country.  I hope the applications materialise into a country-wide network.  When does the Minister expect that licences will be issued and the MMDA system brought into operation so that viewers in areas that do not have multi-channel will be able to receive it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as possible. The position is that I have to make an order and that order is being drafted at present by the Attorney General.  The 42 applications that have been received are being considered in relation to their technical aspects, their interface capacity and compatibility generally.  It is a very detailed process because we want to <Col N="408" /> make sure that the successful applicants have the full technical capacity that they claim in their applications.

      <P>The Minister undertook some time ago in the House to publish an explanatory leaflet, particularly dealing with the health aspects associated with the MMDS system.  He will be aware that much legitimate concern was expressed on behalf of certain members of the community about the radiation and health hazards associated with this proposed system.  He understood that that in turn could well give rise to difficulties when planning permission was sought for these installations.  Does he intend to publish an explanatory memorandum that will address that issue, and if so, when?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister suggested £300 per household and he was talking about a coverage that would have included well over half of the households in the country.  Therefore the amount involved would certainly be £200 million. To what extent is the commercial success of this enterprise dependent on a very high percentage take-up of the population to the offer of this service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is hoped that there would be tremendous interest in securing the widest possible level of choice.  This has been evident in those urban areas that have been easily cabled. <Col N="409" /> There has been a very high take-up in those areas.  What we want to do now is to remove the barriers between urban and rural Ireland and to provide opportunities for people in rural Ireland to have the multi-channel choice.  As the Deputy is well aware, it is the system to be used for the transmission of the national independent television service and I have no doubt that the people of Ireland will want to receive that as soon as possible.  I have no doubt that there will be a very high take-up in the areas.  It is a matter for the commercial operators to encourage people and to pitch their licence fees at a level which will be attractive to the people.</P>

      <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission was established on Monday, 17 October 1988.  Arrangements for the provision of services as provided for in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and the speed with which such services are provided are a matter for the commission and I have no statutory function in these matters.

      <P>Would it be right to say that the Minister suggested to the commission that they might put radio stations on the air by the spring of 1989? Does that mean that there will be a minimum period of three months during which the present independent pirate stations will be off the air before there is a replacement available?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my speech at the inaugural meeting of the commission that it would be my hope that independent licensed stations would be in operation by the spring of 1989.  There is no reason that local stations cannot be in operation between this and then.  I hope there would be the shortest possible time lag between the alternative pirate stations going off the air and a legal alternative radio regime being available to the listeners in Ireland who have indicated by the numbers in which they are listening to pirate stations that they want an alternative station.  I hope that the period between the pirates going off the air &mdash; they must go off the air on 31 December &mdash; and newer stations coming on air will be as brief as possible.</P>

I was delighted to learn later that day that they had made the decision to advertise immediately for the national radio service and the national television service and to carry out what we called in this House as we were debating the matter the trawl of interest in relation to other stations around the country.

In view of the fact that the Minister is anxious to shorten as much as possible the time lag between 31 December when the illegal broadcasters will go off the air and the new local radios will come onstream, will he be directing the commission to address the local radio services prior to giving attention to a third television channel and to the national radio stations, because it would help the situation when the gap is forshortened?</P>

However, I did take the opportunity at the inaugural meeting of making clear to them my earnest desire to see that there would be the shortest possible time lag between the illegal stations going off the air and an alternative legal local and national régime being put in place, and I was delighted to see that they have gone about their business in a three pronged way; they have advertised for the national radio, for the national television and, as a first step in establishing the local radio network, carried out a trawl resulting in a fairly reduced timescale for parties interested in establishing stations to contact them.  They are up and about their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>My sanction was not required for the decision by RTE to seek offers for the possible sale of Cablelink Ltd.  If RTE and the minority shareholder in this company decide to sell, any new owner of the system will require to be licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act.  The benefit of the existing licences issued to Cablelink cannot be transferred without my consent.</P>
      <P>At this stage I see no useful purpose in interfering with the exercise which is designed to enable the company to make a decision on whether a possible sale is in the best interest of RTE.  I am also of the view that it would be premature to comment on the deployment of any funds that might be generated in the future by a possible sale of this company.</P>
      <P>The possible sale of Cablelink will not alter the current practice in determining levels of charge for cable service.  Each application for a price increase is dealt with on its individual merits.  I take a number of factors into account including the interests of subscribers, rate of return on investment, profits, cash flow, projected investment, costs, age of system, company policy and plans, and my policy of encouraging the enhancement of cable systems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informally notified of the intention of RTE to seek offers for the possible sale of Cablelink which is merely a possibility at this stage; they are testing the market rather than coming with specific indications of intention to sell.  The want to see what the marketplace will produce.  On the question of the deployment of funds, it would be totally premature to comment in regard to any funds that might be generated in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not mention the rate of return on investment he allows.  Perhaps he would tell us.  I ask that because there is concern about the already high prices for the service that is being provided by Cablelink which has a monopoly in the Dublin area.  Can the Minister give us some indication of the rate of return, and assurances that if <Col N="415" /> Cablelink were in private hands the consumer would be protected from unfair charges?  Will the Minister reflect on whether it is premature to comment on the deployment of resources since the only reason RTE want to sell Cablelink is so that they would be free to invest and improve?  For many years RTE have been unhappy with the sanction they have got from the Minister's Department for the spending of their own resources.  It is far from premature to comment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be slightly confused.  At the end of his question he says that Cablelink are unhappy about the sanction I give them for the spending of their own resources, but at the beginning of the question he is decrying the fact that the Cablelink charges are so high in the Dublin area.  If Cablelink and RTE as the 80 per cent shareholders had their way, the Cablelink subscription would be far higher in the Dublin region.  It is because I have been constantly monitoring it that it is at the level it is at.  It is about half what the Cork community are asked to pay.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether he considers there is any conflict of interests, given the fact that RTE, the State broadcasting service, control 80 per cent of the shareholding in Cablelink? Cablelink distribute the signals of RTE's competitors.  I would like him to comment on whether he considers there is any conflict of interests.  Can he also tell us whether he thinks it would be better if Cablelink were kept separate from RTE on the basis that they would then be able to compete with the State broadcasting service in terms of having their own advertising and buying their own programme material?  While I accept that the proposal only amounts to a testing of the market at this point I think that if the right price is achieved it should be sold.

I have my own views as to what the full potential of the service is, it is not merely a matter of carrying television services.  Surely, there would also be the possibility of carrying other communications and networks for home shopping and perhaps Bord Telecom and others.  Therefore, it is a question of testing the market.

Can he give the House any indication of when he thinks the question will be resolved?  Will he also give an assurance that he will have due regard to the views of the workers in RTE who are solidly opposed to any sale or privatisation of Cablelink?</P>

In so far as the interests of the workers in RTE are concerned, I am very conscious of the views expressed by them.  I have received an indication that they are interested in sending a deputation to me to discuss the matter and I would be more than willing to sit down and discuss it with the members of the staff there at any time or with the Congress of Trade Unions at any time.  Until we know whether a substantial offer has been made it would be slightly premature to indicate whether a decision is going to be made.

      <P>Can the Minister tell us what particular steps he proposes to take as and from 31 December given the absolute fact that none of these stations <Col N="420" /> is going to close voluntarily?  Given that there are upwards of 70 stations operating in the country as he advised us previously and that all of them are currently operating with a flagrant disregard for the law, what steps does the Minister propose to take to ensure that as and from 1 January next his law as passed by this House will be implemented in full and regard had for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important step I had to take was to bring forward legislation to establish a legal alternative to the pirates many of whom have been operating for ten years and have been receiving public support despite the fact that they are illegal stations.  Having established a framework for the alternative, set up the commission &mdash; they met on Tuesday morning last &mdash; invited applications and carried out the trawl, I can assure the Deputy that all measures will be taken, which are in the course of preparation within my Department, to put the pirates off the air using the full rigour of the law, from 31 December.  I am glad to see that some of the pirates have indicated that it is their intention to cease operations from 31 December because, as the Deputy and as the House will be aware, the law allowing an alternative legal network did not forbid any of the former pirates from applying for new licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has not advised us that the Garda Síochána have been consulted to see to it that the law is implemented but on the other aspect of the question can the Minister tell us whether it is a concern of his in terms of having due regard and respect for the law as passed by this House that a situation will not be allowed to develop in which all of these operators would be allowed to simply change their clothes over night and reappear under a cloak of legality afforded them by the commission under this legislation?  Has the Minister issued any guidelines in regard to the implementation of this legislation to ensure that those who have flagrantly ignored and breached the law <Col N="421" /> over the past decade are not facilitated by his legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that section 6 of the legislation indicates that in considering an application the commission must take into account the character of the applicant.  That was inserted as a clear indication to the commission that they should give no bonus points, to put it at its minimum, to the former pirates.  Therefore, there is no question of the pirates being able to shed their clothes on 31 December and wrapping new clothes of a legal regime around them on 1 January.  That is not going to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the latest figures available on the comparative costs of local and of trunk calls in Ireland compared with other EC countries; and the extent to which he expects this discrepancy to have been eliminated by the year 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures available on the cost of local and trunk calls in Ireland compared with other EC countries are contained in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  However, I should point out that a simple comparison of the cost of local and trunk call charges between one country and another is seldom straightforward because of the variety and complexity of pricing structures and for other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, local calls in Ireland are <Col N="422" /> not timed.  Local calls in all other EC countries, with the exception of Greece and Luxembourg, are timed.  Where local calls are timed, the cost of the call increases sharply as duration increases. In addition, local calls in Ireland cover a far larger area than any other country.  In fact, those countries with the cheapest local call rates also have the smallest local call areas.  Also comparative costs are misleading without taking tax into account.  There is 19 per cent VAT on calls in Belgium, no tax in Luxembourg or Ireland, Portugal has 8 per cent and Denmark's charges include 22 per cent tax.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to speculate on how charges in Ireland will compare with charges in other EC countries by 1992 as so much will depend on how other charges move in relation to Ireland's in the meantime.  In fact, international calls from Ireland were reduced by 20 per cent &mdash; 30 per cent from 1 October and I am advised that if you take into account all of the factors relevant to charges, overall telecommunications charges in Ireland probably fall into the middle range in the EC member states.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that, comparing Ireland with a simple average on these calls, we are <Col N="423" /> about 60 per cent more expensive than other member states?  The Minister has said that it is impossible to speculate on how we will stand in 1992 and I should like to know if he accepts that an efficient telecommunications service and low charges will be very critical to our survival after 1992?  Will the Minister say if Telecom Éireann have informed him of the measures they will be taking to deal with their present discrepancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain in my reply the difficulty in dealing with this issue.  The Deputy is misrepresenting the position when he says that we are 60 per cent more expensive than other countries.  The matter is not as simple as that.  The Deputy's question referred to local calls but in Ireland they are not timed while in other EC countries they are.  That has a major effect on costs and, as a result, the statement that we are 60 per cent more expensive does not hold up.  In fact, taking into account all of the factors relevant to the charges, overall telecommunications charges in Ireland are probably in the middle range in member states.  We could argue all day about this but the matter is not as simple as the Deputy tries to portray.  I should like to tell the Deputy that Telecom Éireann are making major advances in their capital programme and introducing the most sophisticated network available in Europe.  With the exception of France we are ahead of most other countries.  It is too far down the road to say what the position will be in 1992 but the Deputy can be assured that all steps will be taken to ensure that we move from the middle to the top of the class.</P>

      <P>The preparation of a policy document to encompass these and other developments in the rapidly changing energy scene has been in hands for some time past and I have been looking forward to its completion at an early date.

We have had top-of-the-head papers produced by Deputy Bruton about energy costs here compared with those in Europe which were far off the mark.  I should like to assure the Deputy that I am anxious that we produce a proper White Paper.  A number of issues arise in relation to 1992. For example, there is the possibility of the inter-connection of Ireland's electricity and our gas grid with the UK and Europe.  There is also the question of a general review of the operations of Bord na Móna which is taking place and the effect of the review of offshore terms announced by me in September 1987.  I want to see what will happen in relation to the recent amendment of the electricity <Col N="425" /> Acts and the computerised energy information system.  A number of major changes are taking place and that may mean that a White Paper will be out of date as soon as it is published.  I do not want that to happen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 25, 35 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to state at the outset that this country made significant written and oral submissions to the European Court of <Col N="426" /> Justice in the case referred by the Administrative Court of Strasburg, France, which has become known as the &ldquo;Cattenom Case&rdquo;.  The proceedings concerned the proper interpretation of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty.  The plaintiffs included the relevant regional and local authorities in France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Luxembourg. The Governments of Portugal and Luxembourg as well as Ireland intervened. The European Court adopted the submission of Ireland to the effect that the Commission should be notified of the plans to dispose of radioactive waste before the member state involved authorises the disposal.</P>
    <P>Since the judgment of the Court of Justice was delivered on 22 September, 1988 my Department have been in consultation with the Attorney General's Office about the implications thereof for our future strategy.</P>
    <P>These recent events are significant and, I believe, beneficial to our overall expectations in this area.  I intend that these developments will be thoroughly evaluated without delay with a view to deciding the next appropriate step to take.  It is premature, however, to speculate what this step should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the decision of the European Court and commend the intervention of the Irish Government in the case referred to. However, I was utterly dismayed to hear the Minister say that he considers that we are premature in our inquiries about the action the Government intend to take at the European Court in regard to Sellafield. As long ago as May of this year the Minister told us that all options were under consideration and he has advised us that significant submissions were made.  The full extent of the Euratom Treaty and its obligations on member states must be apparent to the Minister and his law officers and I should like to call on him to take definite action involving international legal proceedings against the British authorities in respect of their installation at Sellafield.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the House, and the Deputy, that there is no prevarication whatever.  I welcome the Deputy's comments on the participation by the Government in the &ldquo;Cattenom Case&rdquo;.  It was the first time in the history of the State that we got involved in such a case and we played a major role in it. The point we made to the Commission proved important.  The judgment was delivered on 22 September and is being considered by the Attorney General.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the worst thing we could do &mdash; it would represent a serious setback &mdash; would be to take on a case that would not succeed. That is the last thing we want to do because it would seriously damage our position.  We are dealing in a complex area.  The Euratom Treaty was produced in the fifties when health and safety were not the paramount concern they are today.  We are trying to achieve the maximum benefit and effect for the Irish people in whatever steps are to be taken and it is a question of making sure that those steps are the correct ones and that we do not make a mistake.</P>

Is it not a bit foolhardy for the Minister to come to the House and tell us that that has been delayed because the court has found in favour of Luxembourg in this case?  We all know that that has been the case.  This issue of Europe being informed of waste disposal plans is not central to our case.  Our case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had interminable discussion on this issue on many occasions here.  Will the Minister agree with me that what he has just read out has been on the official records of this House going back over several Question Times?  The purpose of the question on the Order Paper today is to specifically ask if the Minister at long last is going to take legal action which will be effective in bringing about a closure of Sellafield. Does the Minister believe it is possible to achieve the closure of Sellafield or is he just paying lip-service to the unanimous vote passed in this House in December 1986?  Why will the Minister not take legal action under the Euratom Treaty? The Minister has claimed that we took legal action already.  We did no such <Col N="430" /> thing.  We submitted our views in a case which was not directly concerned with this country, a case between Luxembourg and France and the judgment handed down in the European Court will have to come back to this country anyway.  We have to initiate our own case in Europe before the case in relation to Sellafield can be disposed of.  Will the Minister now accept that this House is no longer prepared to take all of the waffle he is continuously spewing out in relation to the action he is about to take or that the Attorney General is contemplating and will he give us some indication of what positive action he will take at long last?</P>

      <P>It is interesting that I have been faced with this political charge here as I suppose the best recognised organisation involved in this area is the Greenpeace organisation.  Even those on the other side of the House will accept that.  Only yesterday I received a letter from Greenpeace congratulating me and my Department and the Irish delegation for the position taken by Ireland at the 11th LDC meeting on sea disposal of radioactive waste and decommissioning nuclear submarines.  Others recognise that we are working on behalf of the Irish people in this very sensitive and complex area.  I agree that Sellafield should be closed.  I believe it will be closed.  I was heartened to see a new move by the British Prime Minister to take on board an interest in matters green in her recent speech in Brighton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14, and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Given the well-known severe financial difficulties of Bord na Móna it has been clear for some time now that urgent initiatives are required to safeguard its future.  In this context, I have appointed consultants to carry out an in-depth study of Bord na Móna's entire operations and I expect to have their findings by the end of March, 1989.  In the light of these findings I will then be in a better position to take appropriate decisions on the board's future activities including those located in the midlands.</P>
      <P>The board itself has been examining its structures and, while no decision has been taken on this analysis, certain measures are proceeding including a voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme. This scheme, negotiated with the unions, has attracted many applicants.</P>
      <P>Because peat is a finite resource, the Government, in their forestry policy, were conscious of the advantages of providing alternative employment opportunities through afforestation in those areas where peat extraction is coming to an end.</P>
      <P>EC aid in the Valoren package is also contributing to the midlands area through the development of extra bogs, to maintain almost 500 jobs in the region which would otherwise have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the future, the amending legislation which I introduced earlier today will enable Bord na Móna to engage not only in peat-related activities but also to diversify into other employment creating operations where it has acquired expertise. It is not the purpose of this Bill to deal <Col N="434" /> with the organisation matters referred to in the questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Besides the submission which has been made by management and other groupings, is it the Minister's intention to have a full evaluation before any decision will be made on the question of carving up Bord na Móna?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of carving up Bord na Móna has not arisen except in the context of the task force report which was prepared at the behest of the chief executive, Mr. O'Connor, and his management team.  The consultants are already appointed and they are looking at the operations of Bord na Móna.  I expect them to report to me by the spring, at which stage the task force report together with the report of the consultants will be of benefit to the Government in arriving at decisions for the future of Bord na Móna.  So that time will not be lost, I have today circulated legislation which will allow Bord na Móna to become involved in joint ventures and in areas outside their immediate remit, namely peat extraction.  For example, they can become involved in engineering, horticulture and consultancy services and use their expertise as leaders in the peat extraction area where they have an international reputation.</P>

      <P>Studies were carried out for almost 20 years as to what was to be done with the cutaway bogs.  On coming into Government we immediately set about the use of about two-thirds of the cutaway bogs.  The board have about 88,000 hectares of bogland and it is expected that about two-thirds of it will be suitable for afforestation.  Already some 2,500 hectares have been handed over by Bord na Móna for forestry.  That is all in public ownership.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that we are very conscious of the impact of any voluntary job losses in the midlands area, not only on Bord na Móna itself but on the towns and the region <Col N="436" /> generally.  All State agencies and Ministers are making every effort.  My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is making every effort through the IDA to ensure that replacement industries are provided in the area. I believe the expertise which has been available through Bord na Móna should be maximised and for that reason I have introduced this legislation.  This will enable potential spin off industries through greater involvement in horticultural and engineering projects and in the provision of consultancy services.</P>

      <P>The principal requirement for Ireland is to maintain overall emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from large combustion plants within ceilings of 124,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes respectively.  The limits set for Ireland can be met by the use of low sulphur coal at Moneypoint and by low <Col N="438" /> sulphur oil and gas usage at other stations. It is very important to remember that if we had not secured the particular levels of 124,000 and of 50,000 the cost of compliance with the directive without the inclusion of those figures could have been of the order of £700 million from the Irish point of view.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that monitoring is being carried out at all times of the emissions of the sulphur dioxide from the plant in Moneypoint.  Independent monitoring is being carried out.  The emissions are well within the stringent levels set by Clare County Council as conditions for planning permission for Moneypoint and well within the levels set down in the new directive.</P>

      <P>The limited test, to which I referred in the House on 1 June last, was carried out on 10 October.  The test involved communication between the Meteorlogical Service, the Garda and the NEB, the convening of the nuclear accident committee at the emergency control centre, analysis of the effects of a hypothetical accident and the taking of necessary decisions.  The results of the test are being evaluated with a view to making improvements identified during the test in the emergency plan.  To ensure that the plan operates smoothly, further tests will be carried out in the future.</P>
      <P>It was envisaged that the limited test would be carried out earlier, but it was considered necessary to give all the Departments and organisations affected by an emergency sufficient time to familiarise themselves with their role and responsibilities and to identify key individuals who would form the nuclear accident committee, while at the same time ensuring that the test would be carried out in realistic conditions.</P>
      <P>The early warning system which forms an integral part of the plan is being put in place.  Bilateral and international arrangements for notification of accidents are already agreed and in place. The monitoring equipment which will allow continuous monitoring of radioactivity and identify the arrival and dispersion pattern of abnormal radioactivity will be installed over the next two months and should be operational by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I shall be as brief as possible.  I wish it were as simple as the Deputy mentions in relation to the continuous dose rate monitoring system. However, because of the complex nature of the monitoring system, the equipment cannot be bought off the shelves.  The Nuclear Energy Board ordered the systems and delivery is to take place in the month of October.  Work on the sites around the country is underway and it is expected that the monitoring system will be installed in November and that the system will be operational in December.</P>
      <P>As far as publication of the plan is concerned, that is a matter on which I must wait for full details of the test that has been carried out, the full report. Whatever recommendations come out of that will be taken into account.  The proposed plant will be ordered, the matter will come back to Government and then the question of publication will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Initiatives undertaken by the Government since assuming office have led to an unprecedented growth of forestry activities such as &mdash; State forest planting up from 7,000 hectares in 1986 to 10,000 in 1988; &mdash; Private forest planting up from 2,600 hectares in 1986 to 5,000 in 1988; &mdash; State forest production up from 1.26m. cubic metres in 1986 to 1.45 million in 1988; &mdash; Revenue from timber sales increased from £16.4m in 1986 to £21.5 million in 1988; &mdash; Increased EC funding for State and Private Forestry.</P>
      <P>The Government are determined to avail of every opportunity to keep up this momentum.  The Minister's visit was aimed at securing a higher level of investment in private forestry and in developing new industrial investments and greater added value in downstream processing industries.</P>
      <P>Due to the sudden tragic death of Assistant Secretary, Tom Rea, who was accompanying the Minister of State, the Minister's programme has had to be abandoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the present role and objective of the INPC; if he has satisfied himself that the present compulsory offtake requirement is not creating a high cost environment for petrol and oil products on the Irish market; if he is at present considering any proposals for a joint venture involving the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy storage facilities, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the INPC has not changed since its inception &mdash; it is to provide for the supply of a significant part of the oil requirements of the Irish market on secure terms.</P>
      <P>The regulation whereby importing oil companies are obliged to purchase up to 35 per cent of their petrol and gas oil requirements from the INPC was introduced as a result of a failure to reach agreement between the Minister for Energy and the oil marketing companies on the basis under which refined product from the Whitegate refinery would be sold.</P>
      <P>In the light of Whitegate's operations since 1982 and given the characteristics and performance of the Irish petroleum products distribution sector over the same period, I am satisfied that the offtake regime, of itself, does not create a high cost environment for petrol and oil products in the economy.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in reply to other questions on today's Order Paper, discussions are proceeding with other parties in relation to both the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy terminal. However, I am not, at this stage, in receipt of any definitive proposals relating to the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="443" /> accept that the acid test for a company like Whitegate Oil Refinery is that it will function on the basis of reducing costs to the consumer?  If its operations are adding cost to the consumer, its continuing operation must seriously be questioned.  The Minister in the course of his reply mentioned security of supply. Does he agree that refining capacity does not necessarily enhance one's security of supply?  I cannot think of a situation where one would have an abundant supply of crude oil and a shortage of refined oil.  On the basis of security of supply, I ask the Minister to consider the answer he has given me.  It is not relevant that one should have a refining capacity on that basis.</P>
      <P>In relation to the compulsory offtake, the company are allowed to pass on their costs to the consumer.  This consequently establishes a price for petrol and oil products on the Irish market which need not necessarily conform to the conditions on the world market.  It has been reliably established on many occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that at all.  The objectives of the INPC provide for the supply of a significant part of the oil requirement of the Irish market on terms which are as secure as possible in duration and continuity and in accordance with the policies approved by the Minister for Energy of the day and to operate within the Irish oil industry and market in a manner which will promote orderly development bearing in mind the national situation and other commercial interests involved.  I do not accept that the impact of Whitegate on the price is large.  I believe the breakdown of the <Col N="444" /> figure will show that it is about 1.1 per cent of the overall cost of premium petrol, about 1.1 per cent of derv and 1.9 per cent of gas oil.  That is the breakdown in pence per litre.  That is a percentage of the Whitegate element of it.  Whitegate and the INPC are providing us with the security of supply which is very important from our point of view.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 34, 38, 43 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal relating to the supply, refining, storage and distribution of oil <Col N="445" /> products to the Irish market which was submitted by a group representing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation earlier this year is no longer under consideration.  The decision not to proceed was made in the light of all the evidence available including the weight of authoritative, independent advice available to the Government in this matter.  Discussions with other interests are now proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the interest of maximising the economic benefit associated with the oil-related facilities at Whitegate and Whiddy and with a view to the development of stable oil supply arrangements with producing countries or other interested parties, aim to secure the upgrading and re-activation of these assets, the enhancement of national strategic supply security and the lowering of product prices throughout the economy. The Government are seeking, through direct contact with principals to develop projects of mutual advantage which would encompass these objectives.  Where proposals meet these requirements then they will be actively pursued through direct contact with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see progress made in relation to the development of proposals relating to our oil-related assets.  As an interim step, the Government have decided that the Irish National Petroleum Corporation should apply for full planning permission for the installation of two single point mooring systems at Whiddy. This step will encourage oil industry interest in the terminal and if a suitable customer is identified it will be possible to bring the facility on stream much faster than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a certain inherent contradiction in that reply and in the reply to the previous question. Notwithstanding that, can I ask the Minister if the Government have made a decision in principle that they would be happy to dispose of the assets at Whitegate and Whiddy?  I take it from the Minister's response now that the Nigerian venture is not under consideration &mdash; I <Col N="446" /> think all those negotiations are over &mdash; that there are discussions with some other interested party.</P>

As a first step and to ensure that no time will be lost we have decided that the INPC should apply for full planning permission for the installation of the two single point mooring systems at Whiddy. The Deputy can be assured that the full resources of the Government will be used to reactivate Whiddy and to upgrade Whitegate to the maximum.  He will be aware from his time in this job of the need for an upgrading of Whitegate.  If that can be done by private rather than public money so much the better.</P>

      <Col N="483" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the high costs of motor insurance as it affected the business community, those involved in the haulage and carrier business and those involved in the provision of amenity and recreational facilities generally.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with another area.  I welcome the developments made by the insurance corporations in recent years and their contribution to financial services and investment.  We should always give credit where it is due.  With 1992 in the offing and all the developments attendant thereto, there are ample and greater opportunities for the insurance companies operating in this country to provide an even greater service to the economy.  They are doing a great deal at present and there is scope for much more to be done but I do not want to delay the proceedings of the House by going too far into that at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to two matters.  The Minister has a supervisory role, and rightly so, and I hope that he will exercise it, as he and previous Ministers did, in a number of ways.  We all remember and recall with sadness the PMPA debacle of some years ago and we also recall the PMPS problems.  When many of the investors with the PMPA look at the new company which grew out of the ashes of the old company they see a healthy, good, aggressive, dynamic, competitive corporation which offers insurance at very competitive rates at present.  However, many of the unfortunate investors with the PMPS look at that company and see their life savings gone down the tubes and swallowed up in a huge corporation.  They believe they were extremely harshly dealt with.  I know quite well that at the time Ministers advised against such investments and pointed out the foolhardiness of investing in that project.  I fully accept that many people did not take account of those warnings but nonetheless the <Col N="484" /> Minister, in his supervisory role, has to be ever vigilant and has to be much more aware of the marketing pressures which are prevalent today in business, with particular reference to the insurance business.</P>
    <P>Every insurance company goes into the marketplace and sells as hard as they can, to as many customers as they can, but perhaps regard is not always had to the circumstances of the people who are being called upon to invest their money. Marketing techniques do not necessarily always coincide with what is best from an investor's point of view.  While it is acceptable and all right to say in the aftermath that Governments or Ministers had reservations about the wisdom of such investments, those warnings do not in every instance percolate through to the community to whom the insurance companies have access in their marketing. I am thinking about elderly people and many people who would not necessarily read the financial columns in the newspapers and who may not read, hear or have access to ministerial warnings. There is an ongoing need for the Minister to have greater care in the exercise of the supervisory role he has in relation to the way in which insurance companies operate.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the sale of life assurance.  It is common policy nowadays for insurance corporations to select people in a particular catchment area &mdash; and very often these people have been employed for some time and perhaps are former executives, people from middle management who have executive experience or whatever &mdash; to saturate an entire catchment area with insurance sales. Their job is to sell every possible insurance policy they can.  That is marketing. However, by virtue of the manner in which they are recruited, there is greater pressure on those people to sell than there is, for instance, on a broker or somebody who is established in an area and is recognised as having continuous and ongoing contact on a daily basis with an insurance company who have an office people can go into to ask questions.  An investor in the situation <Col N="485" /> about which I speak does not have the same security as an investor who deals with a broker.  I know that this has happened on countless occasions.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody in this House must know of people who are unemployed through no fault of their own, who may be short of cash, who want extra income and need it desperately so that the desperation with which they seek that extra income motivates them in the manner in which they sell.  They sell in a manner which to my mind which does not always have due regard to the safeguards from an investor's point of view.  I mean to cast no aspersions whatsoever on the people who are doing the selling.  They are selected for a specific purpose and they sell with a desperation born out of frustration or deprivation, as may be the case if they are in a really bad financial state.</P>
    <P>I have come across cases where the cover was explained to a reasonable extent to the persons seeking insurance but some small print areas were not adequately explained.  These people come to us afterwards when their claim is refused and invariably in every case they are in a desperate situation, for example, after a bereavement a wife who is left behind may suddenly discover when she proceeds to administer her partner's estate that there is a problem in relation to what they thought was adequate insurance cover.  This is a very serious situation and should be looked at much more closely.  The problem, which perhaps I have not explained adequately, exists to a good extent.  I have dealt with queries which have arisen in those kind of circumstances and I am sure that everybody in this House must have had the same experience.</P>
    <P>These problems arise because the insurance sales person is under such pressure to sell that he is unable to explain the full implications of the cover which exists for a person when their spouse dies, for example, medical evidence that might have to be submitted.  When a claim is refused, it is too late for anybody to do anything about it.  The only way this can be rectified is for insurance companies to ensure that in the recruitment of <Col N="486" /> insurance teams they have full regard to the fact that the people who are to be insured are the ones who matter most. The people who invest with an insurance company are the ones who matter most and they are the people who have to be protected.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by referring to an episode in my constituency.  This relates to insurance cover for amenity and recreational outlets which are provided by voluntary bodies.  One such outlet in my constituency had a fairly claim-free life span until such time as the facilities were handed over to the local authority and within five days there was a 500 per cent increase in the number of claims lodged.  I say that to further illustrate the fact that we obviously live in a claim conscious society and as time goes on we will become even more conscious of the possibilities of claiming. With the ever increasing cost of insurance cover, there will be a greater urgency on the part of people who are paying high premiums to ensure that they make a claim and succeed wherever possible. You cannot blame people for wanting to claim on a regular basis when they know that somebody, somewhere, is paying through the nose for it and if they do not make a claim, somebody else will.  This is a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes but it could go a lot further.  I hope we will see another similar Bill which will completely revamp the operation of insurance companies &mdash; the way they compete, the way they offer a competitive service the cost involved to business and industry &mdash; whether they be manufacturing or service industries &mdash; and the likely consequences of excessive costs on an ongoing basis in this country having regard to 1992 and the internal market and all the competitors who will be out there in the field.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the insurance competition from Europe becomes obvious here, our consumers, whether private or industrial, will reap the benefit because all such cover represents an overhead. We have reached the stage, unfortunately, where many business people <Col N="487" /> are looking at their options &mdash; one, to get their insurance cover at exorbitant rates, two, to operate without cover, or three, to get out of business altogether. That should not be.  So long as we can point to competitors, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe, who can operate to greater advantage than we can, we will continue to have these questions asked, and rightly so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies in welcoming this legislation which has found general acceptance from all sides of the House.  One thing I have noticed during this debate is the number of people who started by saying this legislation was long overdue.  Unfortunately, most contributions to debates on legislation seem to start with those kinds of phrases.  We always seem to act a little later than we should.  Nevertheless, this Bill, the first in this area since 1936, is welcome.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers pointed out, there is no question but that this legislation is needed, and badly needed, for what will happen in 1992.  We have to get our house in order in this and many other areas.  The Bill is timely.  There is no need to remind Members or the public that not so long ago we had the collapse of two major insurance companies, and the chaos that brought about.  This legislation is also necessary for consumer protection. Our standards in this area, not just in relation to insurance but to so many other things, are sadly lacking.  This problem has to be tackled before 1992 because the European regulations will supersede our national regulations if we do not take these matters in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is also necessary for another reason.  As Deputies are aware, the primary objective of this Bill is to regulate insurance companies, and particularly to regulate the intermediaries in insurance.  The necessity for doing this becomes very obvious when one considers the significance of intermediaries in the current Irish insurance market.  While we do not have any definite figures for the Irish insurance <Col N="488" /> market, we can make reasonable &ldquo;guesstimates&rdquo; following on the United Kingdom experience.</P>
    <P>Taking the figures in the blue book for insurance for 1982 to 1985, the brokers' share of the life market in Ireland amounted to approximately £1.8 billion, 65 per cent of the total life insurance business over that period, or a yearly average of £450 million.  The figures for the non-life market are almost as spectacular &mdash; in the region of £1 billion for the same period.  Those kinds of figures bring home the importance of the role of intermediaries, particularly brokers, in the insurance industry in this country.</P>
    <P>When we look at these figures we see how important the insurance broker is, not just to the industry but also to the economy because the bulk of the money taken by the insurance brokers is invested in Ireland through the insurance companies. That provides massive employment directly for the 4,000 insurance brokers, the insurance company employees, and the projects in which the insurance companies invest.  We are talking about huge sums of money and a very significant sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>In relation to consumer legislation, I particularly welcome the Bill because, more than any industry in this country, the insurance industry, rightly or wrongly, is notorious for the small print in insurance policies.  Well informed people in insurance matters know all about averaging in relation to house insurance, but I venture to suggest that up to 75 or 80 per cent of the general public who have house insurance do not know anything about the average laws, and many of them get a shock when they put in a claim and are told the maximum the insurance company will pay is 50, 60 or 75 per cent of the claim because, they say, the insured was only half insured, or three quarters insured.  That problem has been alleviated slightly by the insurance companies themselves in the recent past by index linking policies but nevertheless, there are some people who are caught by it.</P>
    <P>A number of policies have obscure clauses which never come to light until <Col N="489" /> a claim arises, when they are regularly quoted, when the insurance company will know what is the position in law and when, very often, the consumer loses. Indeed the inclusion of such obscure clauses in policies has become so prevalent that the public's general impression of insurance is that one is insured as long as one does not claim, that it is then problems come to light.  Many consumers have been caught by unscrupulous, fly-by-night operators who wanted to make a fast buck selling useless policies and who could not be traced when problems arose.</P>
    <P>The provisions of sections 16, 39 and 40 will help to alleviate problems caused by small print, by rendering insurance companies and their intermediaries responsible for spelling out to their clients exactly the cover provided under the policies being sold to them.  It is time all consumers had a clear idea of exactly the cover provided when they purchase an insurance policy.  I hope that the Ministerial regulations will ensure a positive improvement in that respect.</P>
    <P>In any discussion of insurance matters &mdash; and this has been the case over the past two days also &mdash; always there will be plenty of submissions and theories advanced on the cost.  As Deputy Durkan said, unfortunately most people do not link their claims and those of others with the cost of premiums.  The attitude appears to be: I am insured and, if given a chance, I will lodge a claim as quickly as possible.  Yet the same people are surprised when the cost of insurance premiums rises annually.  Unfortunately this compensation mentality has become prevalent in our society over the past ten years resulting in increased premiums having to be sought.  It will be readily seen that the increased cost of insurance cover is a direct result of the attitude and activities of individual members of the public and of some companies.  It is true to say that insurance premium costs have gone through the roof.  The insurance companies and the insured will have to share the blame.  Undoubtedly, in the past, there were mistakes on the part of the industry that contributed to those increased costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> I should like to give one or two examples that contributed to those increased costs of insurance cover.  A major factor was the under-provision on the part of various companies in respect of claims outstanding over the years. Most Deputies would accept that part of that under-provision on the part of companies was inadvertent.  Possibly lack of professional expertise led to other under-provision.  I am glad to note that the Minister will have powers under the provisions of this Bill to regulate the professional expertise of actuaries and others working for insurance companies which will help alleviate this problem of under-provision.</P>
    <P>In a recent magazine survey I read the one peculiar aspect about such under-provision was that all of the United Kingdom-based insurance companies, or whose parent company was situated in the United Kingdom, appeared to be able to arrive at more accurate estimates or figures for accident provision.  On the figures I have seen I would have to say that Irish companies were notorious for their lack of provision in respect of outstanding claims.  Over the years possibly successive Ministers turned a blind eye &mdash; particularly in regard to companies incorporated in Ireland &mdash; perhaps feeling that, if they took action leading to an increase in premiums, there would be a public outcry.  That appears to have been the attitude adopted resulting in all of us having to pay now for that lack of action by way of levies and so on in order to fund companies that collapsed.  As somebody who always paid a slightly higher rate of motor insurance premium &mdash; having been warned that some companies were not making adequate provision for outstanding claims and were in danger of collapse &mdash; I resent that I must now pay higher premiums and a levy to compensate for the cheap insurance cover offered to other motorists by irresponsible companies in the past.  We should beware that we do not fall into the same trap again.</P>
    <P>On the latest figures available to me I note there is at present one insurance <Col N="491" /> company that has made inadequate provision for outstanding claims between the years 1982 and 1985 in the motor insurance area.  For example, in 1982 there was an under-provision of minus 3 per cent, in 1983 minus 6 per cent, in 1984 minus 7 per cent and in 1985 minus 35 per cent.  Yet that company is at present quoting motor insurance premiums at approximately 20 per cent less than the average pertaining in the industry. They have now set up a subsidiary company one can telephone seeking a quotation.  That subsidiary, in turn, is quoting rates 10 per cent less than its parent company.  I have in my hand an insurance renewal form of that company showing a renewal premium at £321.77 and a revised quotation &mdash; showing all the relevant details given by way of telephone to its subsidiary &mdash; at £279.84. There must be something wrong there.  It is something about which the Minister and everybody concerned in the industry should be very careful.  While the parent company consistently under-provided for outstanding claims in the years 1982 to 1985 its subsidiary is now under-cutting them.  That is not a healthy sign for an insurance business or motorist.</P>
    <P>The second cause for insurance costs here being more than average is the high costs associated with our courts system and the reaction of the industry to that system.  Thankfully that pattern is changing because of legislation introduced.  As other Deputies have said, claims for outrageous amounts have been settled out of court because of the ludicrous awards being made by the courts.  Very often insurance companies decided to settle, at the eleventh hour, on the steps of the court, that being the safest way out for them.  However, one must remember that huge costs would have been incurred up to that point.  Like other Deputies, I welcome the recent Courts Bill and other moves by the Government &mdash; to which I will refer later &mdash; to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>A third point referred to has been the problem in relation to liability insurance, particularly employers' liability.  The Minister referred to the fact that because <Col N="492" /> of moves by the Government these costs are reducing but it is reckoned that employers' liability accounts for nearly 2.5 per cent of a company's payroll.  The blame for the high rate of employers' liability is usually put on court awards for on the job injuries.  That is certainly a factor but it is not the only one.  We are victims of the successful policy in the sixties and seventies of developing the industrial base here by attracting the large multinational companies.  That was very successful from an economic and industrial policy point of view but it also created problems of a new urban work-force being introduced into what had been, up to then, a largely rural community. Obviously, when there is a change from an agrarian and rural back-ground to an industrialised environment, it causes a certain amount of friction.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that arose as a result was that, in common law, the liability only arose from the obligation that each person had to exercise care in his actions so that he did not cause bodily injury or damage to others.  Therefore, in common law, employees were only entitled to damages if an accident was caused by an employer's personal negligence. In other words, an employee had no claim against an employer merely because he met with an accident in his employment.  That was the situation but, unfortunately, with the increase in industrialisation and the strength of the unions this notion of personal liability diminished. I am not criticising unions &mdash; they are there to help their members &mdash; but, because of their structure, they helped to centralise the legal process.  One solicitor can facilitate a number of small claims by doing a job lot in relation to industrial action.  That certainly led to an increase in the number of claims and, in some cases, there was a suspicion that workers deliberately inflicted minor injuries on themselves.  However, the employers could not get rid of those workers because of a threat of a strike or other industrial action.  The strength of the unions certainly tied the employers' hands to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>The fault for the increase in claims does <Col N="493" /> not lie only with the workers, employers must take their share of the blame.  Generally speaking, in Ireland employers and managers are not as attuned to the need for safety in the work place as they are in other countries and that has led to an increase in accidents.  The records show that the majority of accidents result from the failure of management to provide safety features at work.  The records also show that, in many cases, managers fail to comply with statutory obligations in regard to safety.  At the moment, common law underpins the rights of workers to a healthy and safe workplace. Unfortunately, instead of the employer using the law to try to reduce the risks in the workplace, the worker claims from the employer on the basis that the workplace was not safe.  The employer, if he was doing his job properly, would use the legislation as a basis for making his workplace safe, thereby reducing the risk of claims against him.  Employers and workers contributed to the problem of increased costs in employers' liability. Both groups and the insurance companies can contribute to the reduction of costs in this area.  If employers were more vigilant, if there was more co-operation between employers and employees and if there was an increased promotion of safety by employers, employees and the insurance companies, employers' liability insurance premiums could be dramatically reduced.  I know that over the past few years the insurance industry has assisted various firms in relation to safety orders and on site inspections by giving advice to employers, managers and workers on how to avoid accidents.  It is a welcome trend which should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation contributed £170,000 to the National Safety Council this year as a means of promoting the idea of safety which, in turn, will be of benefit to the employer and the employee.  There is no dearth of legislation in relation to safety at work.  The 1980 safety at work Act, if implemented in full by employers, would considerably reduce the amount and the frequency of claims.  Another way to reduce the <Col N="494" /> number of claims is by the employment of properly skilled people to manage and superintend businesses, for instance, the appointment of safety officers.  In general terms, they should try to get across to employers and employees the idea of a safe place in which to work, which would be of enourmous assistance.  In this regard, statistics show that in normal production procedures the rate of accidents is roughly one to 1,000 employees.  In stressful conditions this is increased to one to 100 employees.  In other words, safety goes by the board but it would be far better to have safety at work instead of depending on the person to adopt proper safety procedures.</P>
    <P>Public liability was mentioned by Deputy Durkan and various other speakers, particularly in relation to community organisation.  In this area, the situation has reached crisis proportions and organisations such as tidy towns committees, sports clubs and various voluntary organisations find it virtually impossible to get public liability insurance.  I know &mdash; and Deputies in other constituencies would echo this &mdash; of voluntary groups who normally held one or two fund raising events for worthy causes in their local areas for years on end but who stopped doing that in the past two or three years because of the high cost of public liability insurance.  People in voluntary organisations, sporting, athletic and community organisations give freely of their time and talents to help young people and the elderly in their community, to make their community generally a better place to live in but they are currently having to back out of these voluntary organisations, stop fund raising, stop holding events of a voluntary nature in their parishes because public liability insurance cost is so high.  It is completely and totally prohibitive.  I know of one athletic club in my area catering for over 100 young people under the age of 18 and they were quoted something in the region of £700 or £800 for public liability insurance.  The club just could not afford that with all the other costs they had in relation to transporting athletes around <Col N="495" /> the county and to various parts of Leinster. Something has to be done, therefore, in relation to public liability for community and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The answer everybody has to financial problems nowadays seems to be to look to the national lottery, but as I recall it, the national lottery was set up to facilitate youth in sport, to provide money for facilities for young people and for sports facilities.  Its base has been broadened considerably.  We should have a look again at the national lottery to see if there might be some way in which an insurance scheme to cover voluntary organisations for public liability could be introduced. People giving of their time are withdrawing from those organisations and that is to the detriment of communities. The expenditure of some moneys from the national lottery, even if it was only .05 per cent of the funds, on public liability claims, specifically for voluntary youth and sport organisations, would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>So much for the cost of insurances.  In this regard I would like to commend the Government on the action they have taken in the past 18 months to try to bring down the cost of insurance.  We have mentioned already, and so have other Deputies, the Courts Bill, the introduction of the two-counsel rule and the other procedures and decisions taken by the Government that should be implemented in the next few years which should lead to a reduction in insurance premiums.  Perhaps the most important contribution the Government have made is to have brought about the beginning of change in people's attitudes in the area of insurance and claims.  The attitude up to now seemed to be that the only way of meeting insurance claims was to increase insurance premiums, but now the industry and the Government, working together, have been able to change that attitude.  Changes are coming about within the systems we are operating and these will lead to a reduction in premiums. The other factors the Government have mentioned and are working <Col N="496" /> on at the moment are the pre-trial procedures, the implementation of the Barrington Commission report on safety at work, and the production of a book of quantum of damages.  All of those taken together and implemented would lead to a reduction in premiums, and the sooner the better.  In this regard the action of some insurance companies in the past year towards reducing premiums for the under 25s for motor insurance has been most welcome.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the Minister's power to intervene in the area of commission paid to insurers.  I suppose the history of this goes back to the early eighties when a voluntary commissions agreement was reached but never properly implemented.  It was open to many abuses.  In 1986 the previous Government told brokers and insurance companies to get their act together and talked about statutory regulations in relation to commission agreements.  Last August agreement was reached with the IIF.  Since then that agreement has been implemented and adhered to, with the exception of one of the new life assurance companies, and it is working reasonably well.</P>
    <P>The problem I see arising as a result of this agreement is that it may be in conflict with EC regulations in this area.  While I welcome the agreement from the consumer point of view &mdash; it prevents abuses creeping in where brokers or people would be offered huge inducements to promote a particular company's product &mdash; and it is useful as a consumer protection measure, the caveat I have in relation to it is that a similar agreement in Britain which was sent to the Commission for ratification was thrown out by the EC. I am not too sure about the situation here, but industry sources inform me that we may not have got a warning shot across our bows about that.  The agreement in Britain has been thrown out by the EC and if the same thing happens to the agreement we have here we will go back into a free for all in relation to commissions.  The Minister might have something to say on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Part IV of the Bill deals with the regulation of intermediaries.  This is probably the most important part of the Bill from the consumer point of view.  Its aim is to regulate the professional standards of those acting as intermediaries.  I think all of us in the House would say that it is an excellent move, that it is about time it occurred.  It should clarify for the consumer the exact status of the person from whom he gets his advice.  Deputy Foley and other Deputies have mentioned that the Bill is in need of strengthening in this area.  Section 43 refers to intermediaries as those members of recognised bodies: &ldquo;or, not being a member of a recognised representative body, he complies with the provisions of this Act....&rdquo; That is very vague.  Certainly the second part of the section is vague.  It cannot be allowed to go through unamended and the Minister will have to look at it again.  It is too vague for the insurance companies and certainly too vague for the brokers.  How are an insurance company to know whether a broker is recognised by the Minister for the purposes of the Bill?  Is the Minister going to introduce a system of certification or something to say, &ldquo;this person is recognised by me&rdquo; and the certificates can be issued by the insurance companies?</P>
    <P>This is very vague and will certainly have to be clarified.  I concede to a certain extent that the reason the Minister might have made this provision in the section is to protect brokers that are currently giving a good service but who are not involved in any of the organisations, perhaps because of membership fees which they may not be able to afford or for their own reasons.  There are a number of brokers who were never involved with the two recognised bodies NIBA or CIBA but are involved in insurance for a lifetime.  They know it inside out and are very professional in their approach. Under the section the Minister is trying to allow those brokers to continue in business. But if that is the Minister's intention, I think he should consider possibly adding a stipulation to this section whereby new entrants to the insurance business would have to be a member of <Col N="498" /> one or other of the recognised bodies. We can leave the people who are in practice and have been in practice for years as they are and let them be phased out over a period of time and all new entrants to the business would then have to join one or other of the recognised bodies.</P>
    <P>I also think that the Bill is not strong enough in relation to the distinction between agents and brokers.  I feel it is very weak in this regard.  To my mind a broker is a man who can provide a service which is beneficial to the public.  A broker is totally professional in his approach, a man that knows the business inside out. I think it is very important that a distinction should be made between the broker and the agent because the average insurance purchaser does not know that there is a difference between an agent and a broker.  The intermediary, whether he be an agent or a broker is the person at the point of sale.  His influence is very significant in terms of the clients' choice of policy.  Because of the complexity of the insurance product nowadays it is no exaggeration to say that, whether the intermediaries be agents or brokers, their advice and conduct are absolutely crucial to the average insurance purchaser. However, I think a problem facing the purchaser which is not addressed in the Bill is that he has to be aware of and able to distinguish between an insurance broker and an insurance agent and indeed to be able to distinguish between a qualified and a non-qualified broker.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the term broker means a full time insurance intermediary, a person who holds agencies for many insurance companies and a person who offers professional advice and service to his clients.  It is clearly established legally that the broker is regarded as acting as an agent for the insured, while in law the agent does not hold himself out as possessing any special expertise.  An insured person who suffers financial loss as a result of a part time agent's lack of knowledge has little or no legal redress, whereas a broker caught in the same situation could be legally pursued by the client if he did not give the proper advice or was negligent in giving his advice.  That <Col N="499" /> is why brokers have to have professional indemnity insurance.  The insurance broker is the professional, giving a full service and he is not tied to any particular agency or any insurance company, whereas the agent is.  Therefore, the distinction must be made between agents and brokers.  I do not think that by giving an agent four life and four non-life agencies we are helping to clarify for the consumer the difference between an insurance broker and an insurance agent. The term used to describe this is polarisation and this does not happen in the Bill.  You cannot really say that there is polarisation when an agent can have up to eight agencies, four life and four-non-life. I think an agent should be restricted to one agency, one life and one non-life.</P>
    <P>I noticed in a document sent to us by the Irish Insurance Federation that they have claimed that reducing the number of agencies for an agent would lead to a reduction in choice and I quote:</P>
    <P>Any move to force &ldquo;polarisation&rdquo; on the market will create instability in the marketplace and ultimately reduce the choice available to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I do not know how they can make that claim because no matter what we do in relation to reducing the number of agencies an agent can have, the market will remain the same, the number of insurers will remain the same, so therefore the choice and availability will not be reduced.  If you reduce the number of agencies an agent might have the only reduction that might occur is a reduction in the number of cowboys operating in the area.</P>
    <P>There is a legal problem in relation to agents with more than one agency.  An agent is demand to be acting for his insurance company.  If he does not do his job properly or is negligent and there is a claim, the insurance company can be sued.  What would happen in a case where an insurance agent with four agencies fills up a proposal form, takes a premium from the client for fire insurance, for example, but forgets to put the policy into force and then the insured person's <Col N="500" /> house goes on fire?  Which company does the insured person then claim from?  The agent is an agent for four companies and all four of them will disclaim any responsibility for it and the consumer ends up in a situation where he cannot win because he cannot sue anybody. There is also no provision in the Bill in relation to agents.  A practice has grown up whereby agents for a particular insurance company are appointing subagents. A type of cowboy operation has been going on in the midlands for some time.  I think the legislation should make it clear that if a person is appointed an agent he has no right or authority to appoint a sub-agent as is happening currently.</P>
    <P>I see another problem arising in relation to brokers and agents.  When professional indemnity insurance is introduced and certainly both NIBA and CIBA require it, a situation could arise where brokers would revert to agency status to avoid having to pay the high cost of professional indemnity insurance.  I do not know if there is anything in the Bill &mdash; perhaps the Minister might tell us if there is &mdash; to stop individuals from a firm of brokers, perhaps where there were three or four brokers in one firm, from setting up individual agencies and circumventing the requirement for professional indemnity when it comes into force.  In other words, if there are three brokers in a brokerage firm what is to stop each one of them from setting up four life and four non-life agencies, giving a total of 12 of each in that business?  I have failed to find anything in this legislation to prevent brokers from doing that and circumventing the requirement for professional indemnity.  There is a possibility, if the Bill remains as it is, that brokers will revert to agency status and possibly do what I have outlined because it will save them their bond, the professional indemnity and a lot of overheads.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the Bill that I want to mention very briefly relates to the section which allows the Minister to recognise another brokers' body if such a body was set up.  As I have said, there <Col N="501" /> are currently two bodies in existence for insurance brokers, NIBA and CIBA.  As far as I know, and I do not hold any brief for them, they are operating in a very professional manner.  They are trying to regulate for insurance brokers who are members and trying to ensure the highest of standards.  I have not heard any complaints about them but two bodies is probably one too many.  The Minister should not allow for the setting up of any further body.  Brokers who wish to become members of professional bodies should be well able to fit into one or other of those two bodies.  I have a fear that if the Minister allows a number of other bodies to be set up it will dilute the effectiveness of these bodies.  We all know what happens in union terms &mdash; there are so many unions that they become practically ineffective. To allow more bodies to be set up that purport to represent insurance brokers or other professionals would not be a good idea and the Minister should not allow it.</P>
    <P>One aspect which is not dealt with in the Bill and which perhaps could be dealt with is the position of building societies and their circumvention of the Building Society Regulations, 1987.  This relates to insurance for mortgaged properties. These regulations were introduced in 1987 to prevent building societies from forcing people to insure their houses with particular insurance companies.  The building societies have been trying to circumvent this by issuing indemnity forms, one of which I have here.  This makes it virtually impossible for the mortgage holder to change insurance companies.  I do not know whether this matter can be incorporated into this legislation but it is something that should be considered by the Minister as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Like most other Deputies in the House, I welcome the general content of the Bill.  I have reservations in relation to the lack of distinction made in the Bill in relation to agents and brokers.  I would like to think that changes will be made in that regard on Committee Stage and that we will have agents who are truly agents and brokers who are brokers and who will provide a complete and total professional <Col N="502" /> service to the general public.  The purpose of the legislation should be consumer protection and it falls down in that one respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several different aspects to this Bill which I want to talk about and which perhaps I might most usefully leave over to the next day. However, I will deal with some of the shorter items I want to refer to this evening.</P>
      <P>I am interested in particular in section 35 of the Bill which was introduced for the first time on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  It did not appear in the original Bill of 1986 or in the redraft of it that was published in 1987.  That puts a duty on auditors of an insurance company to report four different matters in relation to a company to the Minister for Industry and Commerce if and when they arise.  It is an excellent provision which states that doubts an auditor might have about a company should be immediately reported to the Minister even without the permission of the company which he is auditing. When you read the section as a whole you find that whereas the clear duty is put on the auditor it is not specified that it is an offence not to comply with that duty or requirement.</P>
      <P>The fact that it is not specifically stated to be an offence does not necessarily mean that it is not an offence.  It may well be an offence under the general offences and penalties section, section 3, which allows those found guilty on summary conviction to a fine of £1,000 and a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or, on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both. I would like the Minister, in his reply, to clarify the fact that breach of the duty, created under section 35, is an offence that is covered by section 3 and can be enforced accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of enforcement, some of the legislation is a bit subjective.  That section needs some clarification.  For example, as regards the requirement relating to an auditor having reason to believe that there are material defects in <Col N="503" /> the financial systems and controls, there is an element of subjectivity in that.  It is arguable as to whether or not an auditor might have, in particular circumstances, reason to believe.  That may be very difficult to prove.  Similarly, with regard to the first of the requirements, if he has reason to believe that there exists circumstances which are likely to affect materially the insurer's ability to fulfil their obligations to policyholders or meet any of their financial requirements under the Insurance Acts, again, it might be argued in a court that that is a subjective matter where different auditors would come to different conclusions and that some might have reason to believe that such circumstances exist and others would not.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters because they are very relevant to circumstances in which I found myself as Minister for Industry and Commerce in the late seventies and early eighties when I had the greatest of difficulty with a particular insurance company which subsequently went insolvent.  Each year fully certified accounts from a firm of chartered accountants were provided to me.  When I expressed my disquiet and concern about the position one of the pieces of advice which I got in the Department was that these accounts were certified by a large firm of chartered accountants and that it would be almost improper on my part to seek to go behind such certified accounts or to be appearing to challenge them and that the question of libel or defamation might arise if I were to seek to do so.  I got no information from auditors at the time to indicate that anything was wrong.  Indeed all the information I got was to the effect that everything seemed to be all right.</P>

      <P>Deputies <Col N="504" /> Enright and M. Higgins gave me notice of their intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the failure of the Minister for Finance to implement the recommendation of the Labour Court regarding the re-deployment of workers at the Office of Public Works.  The Deputy has some 20 minutes at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I raised is the particular position of those workers who have been involved in essential public drainage schemes and who have, this morning, been effectively locked out of their place of work.  The wording of the matter which I submitted to you clearly indicates this and the position is that yesterday the Labour Court issued a recommendation and the text of that includes the words &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;. It goes on to explicitly state that the lay-offs are &ldquo;probably in breach&rdquo; of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The court went further yesterday and suggested that the workers involved should be re-deployed immediately, and that is the word used by the court pending a fuller consideration of the matter by the central review committee set up as a mechanism within the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to decide on what the position should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find extraordinary about this is that on previous occasions when redundancies were suggested under the Department of the Environment's schemes &mdash; and here again the parties involved, the trade unions, contested the situation of about 1,000 local authority workers in rather similar circumstances &mdash; it was resolved by the Government deciding to withdraw the threat to the employment of local authority workers.  We are now in a position in relation to these particular workers where their employment has been the subject of two previous Labour Court hearings and in terms of the recorded Labour Court hearings the Office of Public Works, with responsibility to the Minister for Finance, is in breach of those two previous rulings. Also, very particularly, this morning management within the Office of Public <Col N="505" /> Works was ignoring the recommendation of the Labour Court yesterday, a short term urgent recommendation that the workers be re-employed immediately. That is the wording of the court's recommendation. The court also made the observation that the lay-offs were probably in breach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that these workers, thinking that they had approached the subject rationally by going to the Labour Court and having the matter on which they were in dispute with the Office of Public Works debated by the court, feeling that the matter had now at least been temporarily resolved until the central review committee could meet and discuss the matter fully on 26 October, then arrived at their place of employment this morning and were turned away. This is an extraordinary attitude not only in relation to the specifics of the work itself, because these are workers who simply want to work and are involved with public works that are of immense social significance, but also in relation to the attitude towards the court itself and towards industrial relations.</P>
    <P>As regards the workers who are involved, I would like to say as regards the mechanism for lay-offs, workers in the west have been asked to take a layoff period much longer than the workers in the east, but that difference does not bother me this evening.  What bothers me is the general principle that is at stake. These are workers, 180 of whom have now been laid off and 250 of whom are threatened with being laid off next week. If we add it all together we have something between 430 and 450 workers who are being treated like this or who are under threat of being treated in the way I have described.  It is very difficult to see the thinking or the logic in the point of view of the Office of Public Works in this regard.  These workers have only committed what might be regarded in these times of the hubris of the depeopled economy, if one likes, only one offence against that ethic: they have chosen to work rather than to take redundancy and they are being punished for having chosen to <Col N="506" /> work.  They are involved in publicly needed work, essential work, but in addition to that I would like to see where in fact the savings will accrue.  The workers that have been to see me are paying full tax rates and PRSI.  It has been pointed out to the Minister and to the Office of Public Works that there is no saving at all involved by turning them away from the work that they want to do. If one looks at the cost involved in terms of lost PRSI and lost taxes it is a sum that far exceeds what would be saved by the rather miserly attitude that is being taken towards their simple request that they be allowed to work.  The lay-offs can only be construed by me as some form of punishment for not having accepted what was previously described in the long discussions on the national programme in this House as voluntary redundancy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are a number of very specific questions I would like to have answered this evening.  Is it the intention of the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State to issue an instruction to the Office of Public Works and their management to allow these workers to resume work immediately as requested by the Labour Court yesterday, or is it the intention of the Department to ignore the recommendation of the Labour Court?  Would it not be more conducive towards a better outcome from the meeting of the central review committee which will discuss this matter in detail if the Department and the Office of Public Works were seen to be taking the Labour Court seriously, and could the workers not resume their work immediately pending the full hearing which is possible under the mechanism of the central review committee?  The next question I ask is this.  On what basis is this temporary lay-off justified in terms of the balance of advantage and disadvantage, in terms of tax and PRSI?</P>
    <P>Should the Minister or Minister of State not choose to be forthcoming in relation to my previous questions in terms of a commitment that they would honour the court's recommendation, are they aware of the serious implications and the <Col N="507" /> shadow that is cast over the <i>National Programme for Recovery</i> itself?</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances I would appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State to let good sense prevail, to let respect for the Labour Court and respect for the men and their livelihoods prevail and that this unnecessary hardship and this unnecessary humiliation which has been visited on workers should be avoided by a Government Department and by an agency of State.  I might say in this regard that the group of workers who are involved looked to the Labour Court with more than ordinary respect; they have never lost a day, any of them that came to me, not one single working day, through industrial action. On the occasion they went before the court they found that two recommendations which could have been construed in their favour had been broken and that a temporary ruling with a request that their jobs be restored to them pending a full and detailed ruling by the central review committee with perhaps a later Labour Court recommendation had been cast aside by the Department and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There is the other dimension to this. Anyone who lives in the west or in any one of the rural constituencies where the work in which these men are involved in is being carried out would recognise immediately that this work is valuable and appreciated as an essential part of the infrastructural preparation for the development of small farms.  I am beginning to wonder if that other darker ghost is not hovering in the background.  If the Minister wants to have an additional question to play around with this evening I would ask him if the work that these workers are engaged in is likely to be privatised during the next few years. Maybe their sin is not that they choose not to be made redundant but that they want to work and also to be public employees.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to have this opportunity to raise this matter in the House because it sets a very bad headline in its more general sense for a Department of <Col N="508" /> State and an agency responsible to one of the most senior Ministers in the State to be seen treating the matter of the livelihoods of workers and the Labour Court in terms of its advice in the way they have been treated since yesterday. What we are speaking about effectively is a lock out.  These men were locked out of their employment despite a recommendation by the Labour Court that they be allowed to return to work.  That is something which should not and must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to have this opportunity to put the record straight in regard to this matter.  I have listened with great interest to Deputy Higgins and I appreciate his concerns in respect of this matter.  I, too, like my colleague the Minister for Finance, who is present, have a deep interest in this matter and in the drainage schemes in this country.  We have tried to ensure that the maximum amount of funding is made available, taking into account the resources which are available in the State, and that the maximum number of opportunities are made available for people to work on the drainage schemes. This is in stark contrast with the position we inherited on coming into office in March 1987.</P>
      <P>To put the record straight in relation to the matter we are dealing with I would like to point out to Deputy Higgins that one week before we came into office in March 1987, £0.6 million was taken off the allocation for drainage schemes in the Office of Public Works by the Coalition Government.  The first duty I had to undertake on coming into office in March 1987 was to try to live within the Estimate for my Department and to see how feasible it would be to retain the workers employed on the drainage schemes in full time employment during the duration of the schemes.  I held meetings with the unions and with the workers' representatives. I had consultations with the Minister for Finance and with the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the proposal that in order to <Col N="509" /> live within the allocation which had been made available at that time &mdash; to make up for the shortfall &mdash; we would have to operate a four day week for part of the 1987 working programme.  That was rejected by the workers and their representatives. I accepted the advice of the commissioners and the officials negotiating for my Department with the unions, that the most equitable and reasonable way forward was to have full time layoffs in 1987 to make up for the shortfall in funds that we inherited.  This was to ensure that the workers would not be out of pocket and would be able to avail of full State benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government in recognition of the need to proceed with the drainage system allocated the same amount of funding in 1988 and 1989 for arterial drainage.  This year we have again found ourselves in the same position as last year.  The Deputy has inferred that an inequitable decision has been made pertaining to short term working in the west but I want to make it clear that the allocation of funds for drainage work in the west, particularly for maintenance schemes, has been based on the number of miles of channel in the region and on the number of men working in the region.  The allocations of funds to all of the other regions are based on the same criteria.  The funds for arterial drainage in 1988 were allocated taking the number of miles of channel and the number of workers in each region into account.  There is no more equitable or fairer basis than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely certain that this is the only way in which to do it because, taking the number of miles of channel and the number of people working on the schemes, one has to take the costs into account and one can only allocate the funds which are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter the Deputy has raised here tonight was raised also at a meeting held on 24 November 1987 with the Irish Transport and General Workers Union <Col N="510" /> and they were advised of the position and also of the fact that the Office of Public Works would have no option but to make approximately 200 workers redundant. The union rejected this and entered into a dispute on the issue.  The dispute was referred to the Labour Court which recommended that the notices be withdrawn. At a further meeting held on 9 March 1988 the union was told that short time working on construction schemes would commence on 15 April and would operate every fourth week until the end of the year, approximately eight weeks altogether.</P>
    <P>Short time working on drainage maintenance schemes would also be necessary and would amount to four weeks in the west, based on the criteria I have outlined, two and a half weeks in the south-west and two weeks in the east.  The union rejected this and referred the matter to the Labour Court.  The court recommended that the short time working be deferred pending the outcome of a review which according to the union was imminent. This recommendation was accepted by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>On 28 July 1988 following a meeting between representatives of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions the following agreed statement was issued:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have stated that there is a financial need to introduce short time working for workers on OPW drainage, construction and maintenance schemes.  At present projections this will operate at a level of six weeks, three weeks and one week for different groups between now and the end of the year to produce the required saving.</P>
    <P>The union side, while not agreeing that short time working should be introduced, recognise that, if an alternative solution is not found, short time working will be implemented by the Commissioners of Public Works to achieve the required saving.</P>
    <P>The union side have requested and the Commissioners of Public Works are prepared to agree to defer short <Col N="511" /> term working until 1 October but any short time working necessary will have to take place between then and end-1988. Alternative solutions will be explored between now and end-September and the position will be reviewed before end-September.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works were unable to find an alternative solution to the problem and were left with no option but to notify the union that short-time working would be implemented on the basis of six weeks on drainage construction schemes and three weeks on maintenance schemes except those in the eastern region where one week would suffice.  The union again rejected this and referred the dispute to the Labour Court where it was heard yesterday, 19 October.  The decision of the Labour Court, and its implications <Col N="512" /> are at present under consideration by my Department.</P>

      <P>Following the reductions in electricity prices in 1987 and 1988 Irish prices for domestic and industrial electricity are now below the EC average.</P>
      <P>Irish prices for natural gas for industrial and commercial consumers are the lowest in Europe.  In the domestic sector the Irish gas market is very different from that in the other Member States as a high proportion of customers consume very small quantities.  For the larger domestic consumers Irish prices are similar to the EC average.</P>
      <P>Domestic coal, in so far as comparisons can be made, is significantly cheaper in Ireland than in other EC countries.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant improvement in Irish prices for residual fuel oil compared to the EC average since January based on data published in the EEC Oil Bulletin.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has responsibility for the control of oil prices, announced reductions in petrol and autodiesel prices last Tuesday and also announced the setting up of an inquiry in regard to the supply and distribution of these fuels.</P>
      <P>As outlined above there have been very significant improvements between the prices now prevailing in Ireland and the EC average and it is the policy of the Government to continue to make Irish prices more competitive as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's view that the threat to the health and safety of the Irish public posed by the operations of nuclear plants in Britain can only be removed by the phasing out of such installations.  The Government has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the British Government about its plans for building new nuclear facilities with particular reference to locations close to this country.  In the short-term, some of the more pressing concerns we have about the British nuclear industry could be eased by the immediate closure of its more dangerous and accident-prone installations, including Sellafield.  On a number of previous occasions I have given details of the policy which is being pursued to attain this end.</P>
      <P>I continue to put constant pressure on the UK authorities, both bilaterally and in international fora.  On a European level, I am seeking the establishment of a Community (Health and Safety) Inspection Force which would be in a position to monitor nuclear installations objectively and independently.  I have raised our problems at international meetings of the Paris Commission and the London Dumping Convention.</P>
      <P>All possible courses of action, through bilateral, multilateral and Community contacts, are being taken to pursue these policies and I am satisfied that progress is being made.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the House is aware, an emergency plan for nuclear accidents is being put in place, and has recently been tested.  The aim of the emergency plan is to minimise the risk to the public in the event of an accident at a nuclear installation or another radiological emergency.</P>

      <P>This country has not acceded to either the Paris or Vienna Conventions and would not at present be able to claim under the liability provisions specified in them or in implementing statutes in those countries which have acceded to them. The Conventions themselves and the question of acceding to either or both of them are extremely complex and both matters are under active examination by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limitations which apply to individual British nuclear installations are set out in the UK Nuclear Installations Act, 1965 as amended.  My information is that the maximum prescribed compensation for a UK occurrence causing damage is £20 million sterling with a time limit for claims of 30 years.  The time limit is reduced to 20 years if the occurrence involved nuclear matter which was stolen, lost, jettisoned or abandoned. The Brussels Convention 1963 which is supplementary to the Paris Convention <Col N="455" /> provides that the member state concerned will provide additional compensation up to a maximum of 175 million Special Drawing Rights and that the members collectively will provide a further 125 million Special Drawing Rights. The UK is a party to this Convention.</P>
    <P>None of the various Conventions which exist are ideal from our point of view and I would have to be satisfied that adherence to them, despite their short-comings, is in the long-term national interest before recommending accession.</P>

      <P>In relation to part (i)  of the Deputy's question, I have to date given certificates under section 39B of the Finance Act, 1980, (inserted by section 30 of the Finance Act, 1987) to seven companies which will be locating in the International Financial Services Centre in the Custom House Docks Area.  To forecast the corporation tax yield from these companies in respect of the years in question, it would be necessary for me to make major assumptions about the profits of each of these companies for those years.  That would be highly speculative and would not provide a basis for reliable estimates. I am not in a position, therefore, to give an estimate of the corporation tax yield from these companies for the years in question.</P>
      <P>Part (ii)  of the Deputy's question depends upon the first part.  I am not in a position, therefore, to give the estimate sought.</P>
      <P>In relation to part (iii)  of the Deputy's question, none of the seven companies certified to date were previously carrying on in Ireland the trading operations for which they are now certified.  They cannot, therefore, be regarded as having transferred into the Custom House Docks Area and the question of tax foregone does not accordingly arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a general note, in regard to parts (ii) and (iii) of the question, I am confident that there will be no net loss of revenue to the Exchequer arising from the certification of companies in the centre.  In fact, I expect the very opposite to be the case and that the centre will provide positive benefits for the economy <Col N="463" /> by way of tax yield as well as new employment and investment which would not otherwise materialise.</P>

      <P>The European Community's structural funds do not provide for assistance for cultural activities as such.  It was therefore not considered appropriate to include culture as one of the specific topics to be covered by the preparatory study for a programme for the Dublin area.  However, to the extent that cultural activities have a substantial tourism content, they can qualify for structural fund assistance.

      <P>The recommendations from the Tourism Forum on measures to achieve the tourism targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> were considered by Government.  In response, the Government has increased this year's allocation for tourism promotion by £5 million on condition that it is matched by £5 million from private industry sources. This will allow Bord Fáilte in co-operation with the industry to implement an expanded marketing programme as recommended by the Forum in our main markets in good time for the 1989 peak tourist season.  Detailed expenditure proposals drawn up by Bord Fáilte and the industry have been approved by the Government.  I have been assured that these proposals taken in conjunction with other Government initiatives, particularly on lower access fares will facilitate <Col N="467" /> the tourism industry in meeting the targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>Under the EC calf premium and EC special beef premium schemes certain essential control procedures must be carried out to avoid the possibility of double payment of premium and to satisfy the requirements of the European <Col N="469" /> Community.  One of these essential controls is the earpunching following inspection of each animal presented for premium.  Mart or meat factory sales dockets cannot, therefore, be accepted in the case of these two schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the EC suckler cow premium scheme suckler cows sold during the six months period after date of application are not eligible for payment.  Furthermore, such animals must be inspected a second time to ensure they have been retained for the required six months period.

      <P>This dispute commenced on 21 March 1988 over the dismissal of an employee. Manufacturing, Science and Finance, the union involved, unilaterally referred the matter to the Labour Court under section 20 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court recommendation which issued on 3 May 1988 recommended that the company agree to discuss the dismissal of the employee with the union and if necessary to have the issue referred to a Rights Commissioner or other third party as the parties may agree.  The court also recommended that the company agree to recognise the union as the negotiating and representative body on behalf of those employees who are members of the union and that the parties should negotiate a procedural agreement to govern their relationship for the future with a view to avoiding any recurrence of the difficulties which had arisen between the parties.</P>
      <P>The company rejected the terms of the recommendation and the dispute continues. Labour Court recommendations issued under section 20 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, are not binding on the company and I do not have any power under the Industrial Relations Acts to have Labour Court recommendations enforced.</P>
      <P>The present position is that many of the workers are not members of the union and wish to continue working despite the presence of official pickets.  Due to a fire at the premises on 22 September 1988, I understand that the employees have been put on a three-day week.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is understood to be referring to a grant applied for by the school referred to in respect of sink units installed in 1985 about which my Department's professional advisers had expressed reservations in their reports, the units in question not being of the usual type which they recommend for national schools.  The matter is under review and I understand that my Department will be in a position in the near future to make a grant offer to the school. In view of his interest, I am arranging for the Deputy to be informed of the outcome as soon as a decision is arrived at.</P>

      <P>An application for a retrospective grant was submitted by the school management.  This application is currently being examined in my Department in respect of conversion work carried out at the school in the absence of any agreement with the Department with regard to planning, design or financing of the project.</P>
