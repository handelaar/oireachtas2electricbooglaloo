      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 8, 18, 4, 9 and 19.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on No. 8 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 12 noon.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 33.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business is agreed I wonder if the Taoiseach and the Government would consider not taking Items Nos. 8 and 18 today and deferring them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would bear with me for a moment, I must ask if the Order of Business is agreed, especially in respect of No. 8 which shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 12 noon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach and the Government to consider deferring Nos. 8 and 18, which are related, and to consider recirculating a Government Bill in respect of the item <Col N="238" /> concerned, the Courts Bill, in view of the fact that the amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is two years since we had a Second Stage debate on this in the House.  The Government amendments entirely supplant the original Bill as circulated by Fine Gael and Labour when in Government.  This is an important issue and I would ask the Government to consider recirculating their own Bill with their own explanatory memorandum of their proposals and let us have a Second Stage debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>The question is: &ldquo;That the proposal that the proceedings on No. 8 be brought to a conclusion not later than 12 noon be agreed.&rdquo;  On that question a division has been challenged. Will those Members who claim a division please rise in their places?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach the manner in which the House will be informed of the progress or lack of progress in relation to the talks being conducted under the aegis of the central review committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> regarding education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this in respect of legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Taoiseach indicated that he was considering the form in which such a statement would be made.  On the last occasion I raised the matter on the Order of Business he suggested it was premature.  I am repeating my request that there be some clarification as to the manner in which the proceedings of the work of the committee will be reported to the Dáil because of the fact that there was a Dáil motion which set this process in action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this.  First there is the question of the education issues.  The Minister for Education will be on questions next week and I suggest that the Deputy put down questions and elicit all the information he wants through Question Time.  The other <Col N="240" /> aspect of it relates to a more general and comprehensive report by the central review committee.  It is still too early in the day to make any such report but as soon as it appears opportune I will consider what way the matter can be brought to the attention of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in view of the fact that the House has just allocated a very limited time to two important pieces of legislation, debate on which must conclude at midday, would the House consider foregoing the luxury of this Order of Business session in order to let the House devote to this very important legislation the time that has been allocated to it?</P>

There was a promise that legislation would follow from the establishment of the sub-committee established to consider the matter of ground rents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1986: Instruction to Committee.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it to be an instruction to the Committee on the Courts Bill, 1986, that it has power to make provision in the Bill for the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice specifying the maximum number of counsel in respect of whom costs may be allowed on taxation by a Taxing Master, for <Col N="245" /> payment by another party or other parties to an action in relation to which section 1 (1) of the Bill applies, or a question of fact or an issue arising in such an action, or an appeal from a decision in such an action or on such a question or issue.</P>
    <P>The need for the instruction arises under the provisions of Order 99 of Standing Orders.  The reason is that the provision contemplated by official amendment No. 5 which proposes to insert a new section 4 in the Bill giving the Minister for Justice the power to make regulations concerning the fees of counsel which may be recovered on taxation, strictly speaking, was not contemplated at the time the Bill was initiated or discussed on Second Stage.  Consequently, it could be argued that the particular amendment is outside the general scope of the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that this point was discussed at considerable length on Second Stage.  The procedure by way of an instruction to the committee is designed to get over this difficulty.  It is purely a procedural measure which the draughtsman advised was necessary in the circumstances.  It has also to be considered in conjunction with the proposed official amendment to the long title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason for this technical amendment is, as I stated, to make clear and certain the step which is being taken in adding this Government amendment to the Bill.  The Courts Bill of 1986 was a more limited measure and the Government felt that much more was needed to deal with the very serious problem of legal costs.  We promised, when in Opposition, to bring in special legislation to eliminate the very serious over-representation in High Court personal injury cases and we are doing this in the proposed amendment to this Bill.  As Deputies will be aware, it requires three barristers and a solicitor on each side to deal with a case which may be valued at only £15,000, that is, eight lawyers in all.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, the Government are committed to a package which will have the effect of reducing the cost of insurance, for employers, for industry and business and for the owners of cars in the motor insurance area.  Indeed, Deputies will be interested to know that it is estimated by the industry that the abolition of the three counsel rule to which this technical arrangement refers will result in savings in the order of 10 per cent.  That is their view and their commitment.  They see the abolition of juries as resulting in even greater savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are very concerned that these measures should result in definite savings.  Consequently, they have had a great deal of discussion with the people involved to ensure that actual savings would accrue.  Some companies, in anticipation of this package of measures, together with other legislation which the Government are bringing forward, are, in anticipation, promising a reduction of 20 per cent in their fees for insurance. Others are talking of the order of 8 per cent to 11 per cent and are already, for the next year, giving quotations of that order.  Deputies will also be aware that young drivers particularly, stand to gain under the measures the Government are introducing.  The insurance federation <Col N="247" /> have promised a reduction of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent for young drivers who for two years have been named on their parents' insurance, and are accident free.  Parents know that this will be of particular advantage because of the high cost of insurance for young people.  This high cost is a great source of worry and difficulty for parents generally and for young people who have committed themselves to that scheme under the aegis of the insurance federation for young drivers. Consequently, the package the Government want to introduce and are bringing forward is one that is of great practical value.  There is general agreement that the cost of insurance here is too high and has been too high for far too long.</P>
    <P>Many people have direct experience of the high cost of motor insurance.  It has been prohibitively high for some, particularly people under 25 years.  One result has been the level of insurance evasion and the scandal of uninsured driving. There have been other serious but sometimes less obvious effects in the area of employers' liability and public liability insurance.  Many industrialists have protested that the cost of employers' liability insurance constitutes an increasing element in payroll costs and has reached levels where they have become a disincentive to employment.  The impact of employer and public liability insurance costs are having serious economic effects in key sectors, such as tourism, in some cases causing closure of ventures due to the failure to obtain insurance cover at any cost.  This is the background to the package of proposals on insurance costs which the Government published in conjuction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions to the problem of high insurance costs.  The levels of insurance premiums are related to the number and level of claims, the underwriting losses of insurers and the legal expenses arising in conjunction with court proceedings.  The remedy calls for <Col N="248" /> action over a wide range of areas, including radical measures in the area of occupational injuries and safety at work, further measures to tackle the problems of uninsured, drunken and dangerous driving, improvement in law enforcement and reforms of the legal system. These measures require action by various Minister including the Minister for Justice, Labour, Environment and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The most important measure the Government are implementing to improve the legal framework for dealing with personal fatal injury is the abolition of civil juries to decide these cases in the High Court.  This is not a step that the Government are taking lightly.  It was decided to proceed with this measure only after careful and long consideration and as part of a total package, hence the technical amendment we are putting to the House at this stage.  The Government are convinced that the abolition of juries in those cases will lead to more consistent and predictible awards which will provide a more reliable framework for insurers to estimate outstanding claims and thus reduce their costs.  Earlier settlement of cases and more consistent and predictible out of court settlements will facilitate better scheduling of court business, shorter trials, lower legal costs and in particular much less justification for the engagement of more than one counsel in a case and more successful challenges to spurious claims.  I accept that the abolition of juries is not a panacea, but the withdrawal to the right of a jury trial for these cases is justified as an important step in controlling the cost of insurance claims.  Together with the other measures the Government have announced, the abolition of civil juries will benefit the public, through lower insurance costs and easier access to insurance cover.  The Irish Insurance Federation have assured the Minister for Industry and Commerce that:</P>
    <P>When the Courts Bill 1986 is enacted by the Dáil the IIF members will agree to introduce a special no claims bonus for drivers who have been named on <Col N="249" /> one of the existing motor insurance claim policies subject to the following conditions: hold a full driving licence for at least one year, have been named on the policy for at least two years and not have had any claim for driving, or convictions.  Subject to meeting the foregoing conditions companies will grant the person involved a special discount equivalent to at least.  1 per cent on their normal bonus scale which in practice will represent a discount of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the premium which would otherwise be payable.</P>
    <P>This is a very real and immediate benefit which will be available to young drivers later this year.  In addition to this a number of insurance companies have already introduced more competitive rates for young drivers in anticipation of the more favourable environment which enactment of the Courts Bill will bring. One company in particular has capped the rates for young drivers and is providing cover at £850 for young drivers in the Dublin area and at £700 elsewhere. If all of the market followed this lead there would be more competition and young drivers would benefit enormously.</P>
    <P>In relation to the measure the Government are taking in introducing this important amendment to the Bill, it is not sufficient just to abolish juries in civil cases.  It requires a package which involves the juries, the number of legal counsel, and the pre-trial procedures on which the Government are preparing legislation separately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The package involves the improvement of pre-trial procedures, the tackling of other specialists costs which can be very high, for instance, medical costs and engineers costs, and the provision of safety in industry which is an important contributory factor to reducing costs.  The insurance industry are committed to reducing insurance costs and it is only on this basis that the Government <Col N="250" /> are proceeding with the whole package. That will have very important implications for industry generally, for the tourist industry, for hotels, for clubs, for community associations and for motoring generally.  With that in mind I would recommend the adoption of this technical amendment.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, was sent in here to take this Bill today because I spent some time reading the Dáil report of 28 May 1986, when Deputy Woods spent one and a half hours in this Chamber giving numerous reasons for not abolishing juries in personal injury claims.  Now the Minister has a hard neck to come in here and tell us all the reasons for changing our minds.  This must be the greatest U-turn or somersault of this century.  It will be very amusing as we go through the different sections during the day.  We will listen to the Minister's excuses as to why we should accept the Government's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this technical amendment, it is to enable the Government to introduce a very major change in this legislation, a very fundamental change. This amendment should have been for a future Courts Bill, where a long Second Stage debate might have taken place on the principle involved.  I have to agree with some of the points made by Deputy Woods in his speech on 28 May 1986 on this issue.  In that speech he covered very adequately the points I wish to make now on this issue.  I do not think there is anybody who doubts that there is a need for change and the Bar Council have recognised this fact.  There are cases where it is very hard to justify having two senior counsel but equally there are cases where this could very easily be justified and here I am speaking in terms of a plaintiff who is seeking damages in respect of negligence on the part of the medical profession.  A case could go on for some time and the plaintiff may need expert assistance from a member of the Bar who specialises in this area.  A case could also be delayed for a number of days.  As the Minister, Deputy Woods, <Col N="251" /> said on 28 May, the list system as it stands at the present time causes grave difficulties in proper representation for the average man on the street in our courts.</P>
    <P>The sufferer in all of these cases will be the average punter on the street.  There is no doubt that the fact that some members of the Bar operate in some cases on a no foal no fee basis helps the average person on the street and we will have to take this into account.  Rather than coming into this House and using the heavy arm of the law to impose restrictions on the Law Library or the Bar Council, it would be far more realistic to give the Bar Council the opportunity to make appropriate changes.  If at the end of the day we were not happy that the Bar Council were behaving in a rational and reasonable way we could then introduce an appropriate amendment or a further Courts Bill but to fundamentally change the Courts Bill, 1986, without giving this House an opportunity of a Second Stage debate is not right or proper.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on the record our objections on this side of the House to such a procedure.  The fact that we might accept this technical motion does not in any way indicate our acceptance of the Minister's amendment.  For that reason we have tabled an amendment to the Minister's amendment which, in effect, would give the Bar Council an opportunity to introduce their own rules and regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Brennan, Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, present in the House and I can recall reading that he met the Bar Council.  After that meeting he issued a statement in which he said that, if the Bar Council did not change their own rules on a voluntary basis, the Government would be forced to introduce legislation. That is a breach of good faith. He is now sitting beside the Minister for Social Welfare and saying in effect that what he said is totally irrelevant because he is not even giving the Bar Council an opportunity to introduce their own changes in their own rules and regulations but rather he is suggesting a change in <Col N="252" /> the law.  I think this is a breach of good faith between the members of the Bar Council he met on that occasion and himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bar Council have also met with the Restrictive Practices Commission and from the information which I have received I understand that the Bar Council are prepared to introduce the necessary changes in this area if and when this legislation, as originally presented, is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are not being given an opportunity to examine in depth the consequences of this change, not just the loss in earnings for members of the Law Library but for the proper representation of the ordinary individual who has to bring his or her case into court and get proper representation from qualified persons.</P>
      <P>I am not at all happy about giving the Minister power to make regulations which can be annulled within 21 days according to the amendment.  As everybody on the Opposition benches knows, such a provision is incapable of being brought into operation because the Government control whether or not Government time will be made available to annual a particular order laid before both Houses.  In effect, this will give the Minister complete control over what rules and regulations he may impose in the future.  I do not think this is a satisfactory or a proper way of doing business. Fine Gael will not accept it and they will not accept any changes in this area until the Bar Council are first of all given the opportunity to make their own changes. If we are not happy about these, we want to see the proposals the Minister may have in mind and we want to see those proposals confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas by way of a positive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, that is the amendment which I have tabled on behalf of my party and we will deal with it when we come to deal with the section of the Bill.  In the <Col N="253" /> meantime, we will deal with this technical motion and I want to place on record our total dissatisfaction with the way in which the Government have gone about changing this legislation in a very fundamental way.  It is not suitable to introduce an amendment in this way without giving the House the opportunity to debate such an important issue.  I would like to know if the plaintiff is going to suffer in cases where he or she only has the benefit of the services of one senior counsel?  Will the same apply to the defendant?</P>
    <P>For argument's sake, will the insurance companies involved be restricted to one senior counsel, or will it be the case that the average person on the street will be restricted in their representation but that the insurance companies will be able to wheel in up to ten senior counsel and ten experts if they so wish to defeat the ordinary person who may have a very justifiable case, a case which could be very intricate and in which the person may need as much assistance as one can possible get?  What will happen where a particular counsel representing a plaintiff finds that he is stuck because of a case lasting for a longer period than he anticipated and as a result somebody else is going to suffer.</P>
    <P>These are issues which must be thrashed out in great detail and it is not suitable to introduce a technical motion which would allow a fundamental change in legislation which has already completed Second Stage.  Certainly, it is not suitable for the Government to do so considering the stand they took when in Opposition when not alone did they oppose the implementation of what is now being proposed by way of this amendment but also the Bill itself.  They gave numerous reasons why juries should not be abolished.  All one needs to do is to read the one-and-a-half hour speech which this Minister made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anybody who reads his speech which lasted one-and-a-half hours will certainly get the impression that Fianna Fáil were not in favour of the <Col N="254" /> abolition of juries.  Can the Minister in his reply tell us whether the Government have endeavoured to bring in the various changes which he suggested on Second Stage and whether these changes have worked?  The Government now feel it necessary to proceed with this legislation. They owe it to us and to the public to say why they are now proceeding with this legislation which they were not in agreement with when they were on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out the need to do something about the list system and perhaps in his reply he might tell us what, if anything, has been done about the list system in our courts.  He also pointed out that there was a need for more High Court judges and I would like him to tell us how many judges have been appointed to the High Court since Fianna Fáil took office.  The Minister, Deputy Woods, pointed out the need for juries to decide the degree of negligence or liability.  Has he considered that aspect and has he found it to be unworkable and as a result is now proceeding with this legislation? He told us we should allow the judge to give guidelines to a jury on the level of general damages.  Perhaps he might tell us in his reply what has happened in that area that has not worked and as a result we now have to proceed with this legislation. The Minister also pointed out that we should raise the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from its present limit of £15,000 to £25,000 or £30,000 and we should retain the jury trial for the more serious matters.</P>

    <P>The Minister said we should reduce medical costs.  In the Official Report of 28 May 1986, column 524, he gave a very good example as to why we should <Col N="255" /> consider the need for a change in medical costs.  He quoted a case and said:</P>
    <P>...these can account for the major part of an award.  For example, in a High Court case an award of £181,000 was made which included £119,000, or almost two-thirds, for past and future hospital expenses.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Woods was spokesman on Justice in Opposition &mdash; unfortunately he is now on the other side of the House &mdash; he said that we should reduce specialist costs.  For anybody who is interested, that is quoted in the Official Report, Volume 367, column 526.  It makes very interesting reading.  A lot of research was done by Deputy Woods on that matter.  Having read his contribution I was nearly convinced that there is a reason why this Bill should not proceed.  I was totally confused while listening to Deputy Woods this morning tell us the opposite reasons why we should proceed not alone <Col N="256" /> with the Bill but with a major amendment on which we had no debate on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us there is a need to eliminate the cost of uninsured drivers, something with which we would all agree. Perhaps his colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan, Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, could give him some information as to what has happened in that area.  The Minister said that steps should be taken to reduce the number of accidents and to enforce the law.  That is something on which the Department of Justice could certainly give information.  I would like to know has anything happened in that area.  Has the number of road accidents been reduced and how have the Government fared in the past 13 months with enforcing the law in relation to the Road Traffic Acts?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who had the benefit of Deputy Woods's views when he was in Opposition, before he proceeds with this legislation as it was presented in 1986, he owes it to everyone of us to explain in detail the reasons he personally &mdash; I do not wish to personalise this matter &mdash; representing the Government, thinks we should change our minds.  He was very persuasive on 28 May 1986.  I would like to know the reasons &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will give them with conviction &mdash; why he has changed his mind.  I would like him to convince us that, as a result of being in Government for 13 months, we should now change our minds and follow the path that he was following <Col N="257" /> when in Opposition.  I also want the Minister to explain in depth why it was necessary to have a breach of good faith for the members of the Bar Council and why Deputy Séamus Brennan, as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, found it fit to issue a statement after meeting with the Bar Council in which he said that unless the Bar Council got their act together the Government would have to change the law to force them to do it.  My understanding is that the Bar Council are prepared to make changes and will do so if and when this legislation has been passed and that provisions are there for this change.  I want to know why this House should give the Government a blank cheque to write whatever regulations they so wish in this area without the House having an opportunity of seeing those regulations and debating them in full.  I am probably one of the few non-legal people here this morning but I am not here to defend any vested interest group.  I am here to see that the average person gets a fair deal out of all these changes.</P>
      <P>Many statements have been made that insurance costs will be reduced if and when juries are abolished.  I am in the insurance business and I know that insurance costs have been reduced in the last 12 months, particularly in the area of public and employer's liability.  The reduction in insurance costs has not come about as a result of the abolition of juries, because that has not happened yet.  I want to know whether the average person can look forward to a further reduction in insurance rates if and when this legislation is passed.  I equally want to know whether the rights of the ordinary individual will be protected if we agree to the amendment for the abolition of two senior counsel.  I want to know the reasons why we should do that when insurance companies or the defendants who could be very wealthy individuals can wheel in as many senior counsel and experts as they wish and the average punter will only have the opportunity of receiving costs for one senior counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of genuine answers to be given and I want the Minister to do <Col N="258" /> so this morning and to convince us that the road the Government are now taking is the right road.  I doubt very much if it is.  I, on behalf of my party, will not accept the amendment the Minister has put forward in this regard and will be pressing our own amendment which is reasonable and fair.  It gives the Bar Council the opportunity of setting their own rules and if they do not do so, then the Minister can move in and make regulations or an order which will have to be confirmed by this House.  The House will then have the opportunity of debating that order before it is passed.  I recognise that other people want to speak.  I will come back to this issue later in the debate.</P>

I also regret that the Minister for Justice is not here because clearly, from the type of opening statement that was made by the Minister for Social Welfare, we are going to have an unsatisfactory debate.  It is extraordinary that anyone who has any self-respect would have the gall to come in here and stand on his head on virtually everything that he said on this Bill less than two years earlier.  Unfortunately that is not new in this House and it is particularly not new in respect of many policies in more recent times.

It applies only to taxed party or parties costs in respect of actions coming within section 1 (1).  In other words, personal injury actions that were formerly tried before a jury.  That is a much smaller quantum of cases than the Minister for Social Welfare seeks to give the impression is the position, no doubt, inadvertently because he does not know the ins and outs of the matter.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the amendment to the long Title, No. 13, is also erroneous because it purports to insert the words, "provide for the regulation of the number of counsel appearing in certain actions and", but it does no such thing.  It makes no restriction, as Deputy Barrett pointed out, on the number of counsel.  One could have ten counsel if one wanted.  It simply says that in a contested case the party or parties costs are being taxed on a limited number of counsel.  However, that does not prevent either party to that action having five counsel if they wish.</P>

      <P>Precisely.  The amendment to the long Title is erroneous because it does not attempt to cover the point made in the amendment.  There is a related matter to this in amendment No. 4 to ministerial amendment No. 1. As other Members said, this whole thing is a total mess and it is a pity that it is <Col N="260" /> being done in this way.  Amendment No. 4 to ministerial amendment No. 1 is necessary for the reason that on the passage of the Bill, as now proposed to be amended by the Minister, it will not be possible to have any of these cases heard outside of Dublin.  At the moment thousands of jury cases are heard every year in six or seven venues outside Dublin. There is a special provision in Order 36 of the Rules of the Superior Courts of 1986 to enable that to be done.  I will read the provision in Order 36.2 (b) which is as follows:</P>
      <P>In the case of any proceedings which the parties are entitled as of right to have tried with a jury, [this is what we are talking about here] notice of trial may be served for any of the following venues &mdash; Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Dundalk, Kilkenny &mdash; without prior application to the Court, and the matter may be set down for trial at such venue.</P>
      <P>It is only if one is entitled as of right to have ones case heard by a jury in a personal injury action that one can have the case heard at the six venues outside Dublin that I have mentioned.  If the Bill goes through without the amendment tabled by Deputy Colley and I, every case in the High Court will have to be heard in Dublin.  That is ridiculous.  I have brought this matter to the attention of a senior official of the House who said that he has to be guided by the advice of the Department of Justice.  They should have a look at this because my attention has been drawn to this defect by a senior member of the superior courts.  It seems to me to be absolutely pointless that we will have to go through this nonsense today where we are going to prevent any case of the High Court being heard outside Dublin. Surely that is not the intention of the Government either in their present mood or in their May 1986 mood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Government to rectify this and draw to the attention of the Chair the fact that the advice given to the Chair up to now has misunderstood the position, that the consequences will be very serious and that the additional <Col N="261" /> costs of having to bring many litigants and witnesses from Kerry, Sligo, Donegal and elsewhere to Dublin unnecessarily while thousands of such cases have been disposed of around the country up to now is foolish and pointless.  If the amendment was being prepared by me I would draw it up much more broadly to enable some form of regulation to be made in the absence of voluntary agreement by the Bar Council.  I do not follow Deputy Barrett's reasoning where he said that this should be left to the Bar Council because his own amendment, No. 9, states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order prescribe rules of practice to be observed by the Bar Counsel [incorrectly spelled] in stipulating the number of counsel appearing...</P>
    <P>He seems to think he is giving the Bar Council the right to make their own rules but he is not.  The ideal would be that they should but if we are to make statutory rules let us least make the rule wide enough to cover all eventualities and possibilities rather than the extremely narrow proposal that is now contained in amendment No. 8 that will be before us if the motion is passed.  The Minister should think in those terms or, at least some Minister should or, effectively, the Department should do so because they are doing all this anyway. In my view they have misunderstood the position.  There are no officials in the Department with any experience of practice and it is sometimes hard for them to follow what happens.  They make errors that could be avoided.  I am not blaming them for that.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Minister is responsible but I was seeking to get to the reality of the matter.  Indeed, there is no one more aware than the Minister of who is responsible because in the course of the Second Stage debate on <Col N="262" /> this Bill on 19 June 1986 he commented on the fact that the then Minister for Justice of the Coalition was not present. Deputy Woods was extremely critical of that fact and objected to the Minister of State at then the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry reading a speech on behalf of the Minister for Justice. Deputy Woods went on for a couple of columns objecting to that procedure &mdash; columns 675 to 677, inclusive, of the Official Report.  He finished objecting at the end of column 677, to the absence of the Minister for Justice and to the fact that somebody else was reading a speech on his behalf.  Deputy Woods described the procedure as follows;</P>
      <P>Will the Minister not be in the House today to reply to this Bill?</P>
      <P>He answered that question by saying:</P>
      <P>This is something of a farce.</P>
      <P>How prophetic that was.  The opportunity should be taken to clear up these things because of the protracted nature of this whole matter.  It has got itself procedurally and from a drafting point of view into a bit of a mess.  In the course of Committee Stage, the Minister and his colleague's Department might have a look at it and try to sort it out.  There is not really much point in going ahead with it as it is here.  It is a mess.  It does not achieve what it sets out to achieve.  We should achieve that.  We should be told what the up-to-date situation is <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Bar Council and whether they are prepared to make voluntary rules in relation to this.  If not, a more general statutory power should be taken.  Certainly the amendment that is before us is not a general statutory power and it seems to me to be somewhat perverse to take such a limited power as is taken here and not cover the problem in total.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to oppose this motion more in relation to the nature of the way it is being taken than in relation to the content.  We object fundamentally to what is being done here by the Minister for Social Welfare.  The motion contains matters totally outside <Col N="263" /> the scope of the original Bill.  As has been said by previous speakers, it is bad enough that the Minister for Social Welfare had such fundamental objections in principle to the Bill two years ago but now all those objections seem to have vanished into thin air.  The Minister is not only pushing the Bill through but he is also determined that additional measures will be incorporated in the Bill today.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I believe we need to hear from the Minister in the course of the debate today what has taken place and what reasons he now has for supporting the Bill.  Granted it was not his brief in the past 13 or 14 months, but he had such strong objections to the proposals in 1986 that I believe he owes it to himself, to his constituents and to the public at large to explain how this conversion has taken place.  I hope that, in the course of the afternoon, the Minister will give us some detail as to the reasons he can now speak so convincingly this morning in support of the motion and of the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe it is also regrettable that we are not having a Second Stage debate on the Bill because there are now 30 Deputies in the House who have never had an opportunity to discuss the Second Stage of the Bill.  In addition, the matter was quite inconclusive in May 1986 when Second Stage had not been concluded.  I can only assume that it is in order to take Committee Stage when a Bill has not been concluded within the term of a previous Dáil.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that point in the course of his contribution later.</P>
      <P>There are many fundamental questions being rushed through the House.  Public confidence in the administration of justice demands that people and ordinary citizens should be involved in the workings of the courts through the jury system.  I believe there is respect for the courts among the people.  In large measure this is due to the fact that the courts are not administered by judges alone but, in particular, in serious cases, juries participate in the process as the judges of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> The situation was spelled out very clearly by Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy of the Supreme Court when he addressed the American Bar Association in Dublin in July 1985.  He made cogent arguments for the participation of the citizen in the administration of justice by way of the jury system.  It was his view that judges do not have any greater insights or greater ability than 12 fellow citizens when assessing liability or damages in civil cases.  It should also be borne in mind that trial by jury in serious cases is an institution of the State.  It has been part of the legal system since 1922, and it was retained in the Circuit Court up to the seventies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's current proposal is that personal injury actions brought in the High Court before a jury should be abolished. I have looked at the background to this &mdash; the attacks on the system over the years.  The Irish Insurance Federation fought for a number of years to bring this about.  They presented the case that juries make excessive awards and this is reflected in the insurance premiums.  At the time of the ICI debacle, consideration was being given by the then Government to this question but no final decisions were taken at that time.  With the onset of the ICI problem in the aftermath of the PMPA collapse, there was renewed pressure for the abolition of juries.  At the time there was a very blatant and misleading effort to link these commercial disasters with the continued use of juries.  There was absolutely no connection. At that time it was patently clear to all that the ICI and PMPA collapses were related to internal mismanagement of both those companies.  Nobody can deny this.</P>
    <P>However, the Government decided to amend the law by doing away with the right to trial by jury.  I was against this decision at all times and I and my Labour colleagues voted against this decision when that proposal was brought forward in Cabinet.  The then Attorney General outlined substantial arguments, grounded in principle and in policy, for the retention of juries in these cases.  I ask the Minister in due course to inform <Col N="265" /> us whether the present Attorney General has given advice to the Government on the merit and wisdom of proceeding with this Bill at this time.</P>
    <P>One of the most distasteful aspects of the Bill before the House is the fact that the decision then made, and which is now being adopted by the present Government, was made at the insistence of the Irish Insurance Federation.  It is obviously a pressure group and a lobby group. There was very little public debate on the issue.  There was no consultation with bodies with specialist knowledge of the resolution of civil claims.  There were no convincing arguments made that the administration of justice would be improved by the abolition of jury trials in such actions.  In fact, matters were quite the contrary.  The report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, 1965, rejected the abolition of juries in such actions and the MacLiam report, 1982, concluded that juries should be retained, but that judges should be entitled to give some indication to the jury as to what the appropriate level of damages might be in the case being tried.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry which was presided over by Professor Martin O'Donoghue reported in 1976 and recommended that rules should be introduced which would simplify the legal procedures for claiming compensation for personal injury arising out of a motor accident.  Serious steps were taken by the industry itself in this regard and, of course, substantial legal changes occurred, such as the increase in the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts in 1981 to £2,000 and £15,000 respectively.  The recent revisions of the rules of the superior courts whereby pleadings were tightened up so that full particulars of a claim must be given in a statement of claim and defence at an early stage have also been of great assistance. However, substantial changes could be made in pre-trial procedures which would facilitate the reduction of the number of issues that need to be tried in an action.  Even with the abolition of jury trials arising from cases of serious personal injury, these cases would still be <Col N="266" /> complex and difficult and further steps are necessary to avoid delaying such cases and to facilitate the reduction of the issues that have to be tried.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether they have taken into account the situation which has arisen in Northern Ireland. Last year the use of juries to try cases of personal injury was discontinued in Northern Ireland.  This has happened since the original debate in this House. Heretofore a jury of seven had tried both the liability and damages aspect of such cases.  I want to ask the Minister whether they have made inquiries to the Northern Authorities in relation to the following questions.  Has the level of awards increased or decreased in that jurisdiction? Have premiums been reduced as a result of the discontinued use of juries? Are there any cases in which the Northern Authorities, whether the Judiciary or otherwise, believe that jury trials in such actions should be introduced, as they are entitled to do?</P>
    <P>I believe we deserve to have answers to these questions before we proceed today with the proposal before us.  As I perceive it, we are abolishing by Statute what has been perceived as a civil right.  We are now proposing to abolish it today.  We should be all the more cognisant of the fact that the official advice available to previous Governments has been to the effect that juries should not be abolished. Perhaps the Minister would clarify for us the advice given by the present Attorney General in relation to this policy issue. Have the Government given consideration to and taken into account the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Synnott <i>v.</i> CIE and Reddy <i>v.</i> Bates wherein rules laid down by the Supreme court had the effect of reducing damages substantially in serious cases?</P>
    <P>Have the Cabinet considered these cases and their effects on the awards of damages being made in the courts?  What advice did the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Justice receive from the Attorney General in relation to these cases before they took their decision to reverse their previous policy while in Opposition, of opposing <Col N="267" /> the abolition of juries?  Are the Government aware that the tendency now in the courts is for juries to make modest awards?  In the words of many lawyers, juries have become mean, adopting a much more sceptical attitude to the claims of plaintiffs.  Many plaintiffs' claims have been thrown out by juries. Would it not be much better that such claims &mdash; if they are to be thrown out &mdash; should be thrown out by juries rather than by a judge?  Can a citizen whose claim has been thrown out by a jury complain when 12 jurors, his peers, have heard all the evidence in a case and have adjudged against him?  If the matter is tried by a judge alone will it not be the case that it will be said that the judge was prejudiced, is not an employees' man, of the bosses' class, or even that he is in cahoots with the lawyers on the other side?  These raise very serious questions in relation to the respect of the community for the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Our Judiciary merit the praise of the community and of this House.  In large measure they, and they alone, have been responsible for the circumstances obtaining in which the rule of law prevails and in which the judicial process and the legal system in general are accepted.  I believe we are about to weaken that by way of the proposal before us today.  Perhaps the best argument that can be advanced in favour of the Government's proposal is that trials be shorter.  Is it not better that a case take somewhat longer, perhaps a day or two longer, if in the end we are all to be more satisfied, and litigants confident that a fair trial has taken place before their peers in the jury?</P>
    <P>The general impression is given to the community at large that this proposal relates exclusively to road accident-type cases, but claims arising from injuries suffered in road accidents constitute a proportion only of those brought in the courts.  Thousands of cases are dealt with every year in which plaintiffs bring claims against employers, their doctors or other professional advisers.  Is it really appropriate &mdash; as will be the case in the future <Col N="268" />&mdash; that a case of, say, professional negligence involving a medical practitioner should be tried by a judge alone?  Would the judge tend, albeit unconsciously, to prefer the professional man who had made a once-in-a-lifetime error which might have had devastating consequences for his patient?  The answer to that is simple: one excludes the possibility by ensuring it cannot happen and that such a trial is by jury.</P>
    <P>We should examine what has been the experience in the United Kingdom, often quoted in support of the move to effect changes in our laws.  In this instance it is noteworthy that, in the United Kingdom, they did not abolish juries.  What they did there was to confer a discretion on judges whether to allow a jury trial in any given case.  Since the decision of the court of appeal in <i>Ward versus James in</i> 1965 &mdash; 1: <i>All England Report</i>&mdash; judges have exercised their discretion in negligence actions involving personal injuries against the jury system.  What has happened there is that a statute did not abolish juries, rather the judges, in exercising the discretion conferred on them by statute, tended not to favour juries.  Furthermore, the legal profession in England tended not to ask for juries in such cases anyway.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the proposal before us will not be fully considered here today because we are into a Committee Stage debate.  My fear is that no longer will it be possible to get a trial by jury in a case of personal injury involving employer's liability, occupiers liability or in a case of professional negligence. These are the very cases in respect of which it is essential to have a jury involved in the process of the administration of justice.  It should be remembered that it is the jury who bring common sense and common or garden, everyday knowledge to such cases.  It is noteworthy that this proposal is before the House without any suggestion that steps are being taken by the Government to improve safety in the workplace.  For example the question should be posed: when will effect be given to the proposals of the Barrington Committee?  When will <Col N="269" /> legislation be introduced giving effect to Mr. Justice Keane's report on the Stardust disaster?</P>
    <P>One cannot deal with the cost of insurance in isolation.  The Minister referred to a package.  I do not see this package as containing even half of what it should contain.  The Minister knows well that accidents in the workplace, in many cases, derive from the failure of employers to maintain safe practices and systems of work and that current practices generally here fall far short of what is desired in many industries.  This proposal before us will do nothing to increase safety or reduce the cost of insurance in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Our amendments and their effects are significant in that they would involve to some degree an acceptance of the thrust of the Bill.  What we are seeking to do is retain the right to trial by jury in cases in which a judge considers that, on account of the special circumstances of the case, jury trial would be preferable.  At the same time we propose that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be increased in cases of personal injury arising from negligence of £25,000.  This would have the effect of confining the jurisdiction of the High Court, in personal injury cases, to those cases where there was a reasonable prospect of damages being recovered in excess of £25,000.  Arguably, any restriction on the right to trial by jury, in principle, is wrong.  But we are prepared to go some distance with the Government, to concede &mdash; as has already been done in cases falling within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court &mdash; that many small cases of personal injury be tried by a judge alone, with the saver that trial by jury may always be sought in a substantial case involving damages in excess of £25,000, or where there are special circumstances rendering trial by jury desirable.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, is designed not to affect any case in which notice of trial has been given before the passage of the Act &mdash; section 4 (3).  There must be a question raised about the constitutionality of the provisions of this section.  I should like the Minister to refer to that matter.  The <Col N="270" /> issuing of legal proceedings introduce a justifiable controversy into the domain of the courts.  In my understanding of the law it is the position that neither the Legislature nor the Executive may interfere directly in the administration of justice in any particular case or cases.  That was the effect of the decision given in the case of <i>Buckley v. Ireland,</i> or the Sinn Féin funds case, as it is known.</P>
    <P>The effect of the provisions of the Bill as drafted, is to restrict the right to trial by juries in actions which are already in being and in which litigants have a right to such a trial.  It is difficult to see how it is within the competence of the Oireachtas to do this having regard to the provisions of the Constitution and the decision taken in the Buckley case.  What the provisions of this Bill seek to do is very similar to what prevailed in the Buckley case, in that it is proposed to intervene in legal proceedings already in being, to direct that those proceedings should be tried in a particular manner without giving the courts &mdash; which already have seisin of these cases in which proceedings have been issued &mdash; any opportunity to from an opinion on the respective rights of the parties to the actions in a trial by jury.</P>
    <P>I believe the argument as to whether a given case could be dealt with more expeditiously has not been well put.  I have not heard anything from the Minister this morning to change my view. There are substantial delays experienced in having appeals heard in the Supreme Court, in many cases up to three years; that is, without any impediment being placed in the way of the appeal by either party to the action.  Such delay does not derive from any absence of effort on the part of the Supreme Court.  Judges and indeed the Chief Justice have done everything possible to facilitate the early hearing of appeals but their numbers dictate that it is not possible to deal with them more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>There are many fundamental objections to the motion being proposed here this morning.  We object to it, in terms of practice in this House, in that it does not constitute a proper way of conducting <Col N="271" /> business, in circumstances in which a Government who have not moved the original Second Stage debate, want to add something to a Bill which should have been brought back in for Second Stage debate.  Over 25 per cent of the Members of this House have had no say on this Bill in the past.  They should have been afforded such an opportunity.  I do not believe its provisions will achieve any of the aims the Minister or previous Ministers have claimed.</P>

      <P>I should like to respond to Deputy Spring's proposal. The Workers' Party sought already on the Order of Business to bring some sanity into matters pertaining to the provisions of this Bill.  Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in pressing our point.  Therefore, we must address ourselves to exactly what is before us now. It has to be said that motion No. 8 is extraordinary.  The Minister's efforts to explain why the Government have had to rely on this procedure were disingenuous in their entirety.  This motion is a sloppy way of endeavouring to put right a Bill, flawed from the beginning, which has been taken on board by this Government for some extraordinary reason in view of the very enlightened remarks of the Minister, other Government Deputies and some backbenchers, in the debate which took place two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle in respect of all of this has to be addressed.  While it constitutes one only of the eight points the Minister referred to in what is necessary to be <Col N="272" /> undertaken to reduce in some way the costs of litigation, nonetheless &mdash; as was pointed out by Deputy De Rossa at the time &mdash; it is a step that will help in that direction.  For that reason The Workers' Party support the motion and do not propose to vote against it.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of the Minister.  I observe that the amendments to this amendment in the name of The Workers' Party are related.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister's amendment together with amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to it be taken together, with separate decisions if required.</P>

      <P>Amendment No.4 to amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputy Colley and Deputy Desmond O'Malley are deemed out of order as they are outside the scope of the Bill.  Deputy O'Malley can make his point on the amendments before us but his amendment proper is out of order.</P>

      <P>The Deputy brought the matter to my attention.  I had it further examined and I merely confirm my ruling that it is out of order.

      <P>For the Minister's amendment to be in order, it must be in accordance with the principle of the Bill.  The principle of the Bill, as adopted by the House on Second Stage, in the critical section 1 (2), confines it to cases for damages for personal injury to any person.  Perhaps the Minister's amendment highlighted a defect and seeks to change the principle by talking about claims in respect of matters other than personal injuries, which is the direct opposite of the principle of the Bill.  This cannot be in accordance with the principle of the Bill and, therefore, in my respectful submission, it must be out of order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>1.  In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding section 94 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, or any other provision made by or under statute, or any rule of law, an action in the High Court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  claiming damages in respect of personal injuries to a person caused by negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or a provision made by or under a statute or independently of any such contract or any such provision),</P>
      <P>(b)  under section 48 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  under section 18 (inserted by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965) of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, <Col N="280" /> or a question of fact or an issue arising in such an action, shall not be tried with a jury.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section also applies in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an action in which damages are claimed both in respect of personal injuries to a person caused as specified in subsection (1) (a), or the death of a person, and in respect of another matter, and</P>
    <P>(b)  an action in which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the damages claimed consist only of damages in respect of a matter other than personal injuries to, or the death of, a person, and</P>
    <P>(ii) the claim arises directly or indirectly from an act or omission that has also resulted in personal injuries to, or the death of, a person,</P>
    <P>and in relation to a question of fact or an issue arising in an action referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection.</P>
    <P>(3)  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, subsection (1) of this section does not apply in relation to an action where the damages claimed consist only of damages for false imprisonment or for intentional trespass to the person, or in relation to a question of fact or an issue arising in such an action.</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purpose of the application of subsection (1) of this section in relation to an action, or a question of fact or an issue arising in an action, any set-off or counterclaim, or any other claim by a party (other than a plaintiff) to the action, shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>(5)  Subsection (1) of this section does not apply in relation to an action, or a question of fact or an issue arising in an action, if the trial there of began before the commencement of this Act but does apply to the retrial of such an action, question of fact or issue if the <Col N="281" /> retrial begins after such commencement.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where, as respects an action in relation to which subsection (1) of this section applies, or a question of fact or an issue arising in such an action&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a notice of trial containing a requirement to have the action, question or issue tried with a jury, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a notice signifying a desire to have the action, question or issue tried with a jury,</P>
    <P>was served or given before the commencement of this Act, the requirement referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection or, as the case may be, the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section "personal injuries" includes any disease and any impairment of a person's physical or mental condition.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to substitute a new section 1 in place of section 1 in the Bill as introduced.  There is no change in substance involved.  The changes proposed in the revised section 1 will clarify the scope of the Bill and make adequate provision for various practical aspect of personal injuries litigation so that the policy intention of the Bill will be achieved in all cases.  Additional provisions of a technical nature are included to reflect the fact that many personal injury actions also include claims for other heads of damages, for example, damage to property and that defendants in these actions may make counter claims against plaintiffs and join other parties as co-defendants.</P>
    <P>In the discussion which took place earlier this morning, the question of the Government position in relation to this Bill was raised.  Basically, the Government raised the question whether it is desirable to abolish juries in these cases. Would that reduce costs?  During the term of the previous Government, the case was not adequately made for abolition. We did not oppose that measure <Col N="282" /> on Second Stage and consequently the Second Stage passed, but we sought a package and said that if this measure is to be effective there must be package. That is the package I mentioned earlier which we believe is necessary if this measure is to be successful.</P>
    <P>Other reforms in the legal system beyond the abolition of civil juries in personal and fatal injury cases are needed to facilitate a reduction in insurance costs.  One reason we were not enthusiastic about the Courts Bill, 1986, when it was introduced in the previous Dáil was that we felt much more needed to be done to reduce the cost of liability insurance for employers and the public generally.  We were particularly concerned about the need to reduce the legal costs arising in personal injury cases. When we decided in Government to proceed with the Courts Bill, 1986, it was on the basis that the Bill would have to be strengthened by including proposals to reduce legal costs.  The official amendments to the Bill proposed on Committee Stage are designed to do this, particularly the proposal to limit counsels' fees and to deal with the so-called "two-senior" system which had given rise to considerable public controversy.  Also the proposal to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to enable cases pending in the High Court to be remitted or transferred for hearing to the Circuit Court &mdash; if they could have been commenced there &mdash; will facilitate further reductions in legal costs in some personal injuries cases.</P>
    <P>Although welcoming the recent voluntary decision by the Bar Council to reduce the number of counsel appearing in personal injury cases, the Government have decided to go further and to give the Minister for Justice the power to limit the number of counsel in such cases as proposed in an amendment to the Bill.  It is to be expected that cases requiring more than one counsel will be extremely rare as most civil injury cases turn on matters of facts rather than detailed points of law.  The legal costs of hearing claims can frequently be up to 40 per cent of the award.  It stands to reason that the passage of the Courts Bill, accompanied <Col N="283" /> by the reduction in the number of legal personnel involved, will lead to substantial reductions in costs and will ultimately lead to lower premia overall. Spokespersons for the insurance industry have stated that the abolition of the three counsel practice in personal injury cases should reduce their legal costs by up to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>This was as far as we felt we could go in our efforts to reduce legal costs in the present Bill, but that will not be the end of the matter.  There are further commitments to reduce insurance costs contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Some of these will involve more changes in the courts system&mdash; particularly the need for a system of pre-trial procedures in the High Court aimed at achieving as much agreement as possible between the parties on the issues in dispute in a case before a trial takes place and reducing the need for expensive expert witnesses to appear in court to give evidence.  These matters will be dealt with in a proposed Courts and Court Officers Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation.  This is a further part of the package we said was necessary if this measure is to be effective overall.</P>
    <P>A further commitment made by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is to examine the scope to promote the publication of a book of quantum of damages.  The Government believe that a judge sitting alone, with the aid of a book of quantum of damages summarising previous awards in personal and fatal injury cases, is much more likely to deliver consistent judgements on award levels.  I am aware that the Minister for Justice has initiated discussion on this matter with the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland to see how such a project &mdash; which is a large one &mdash; could be undertaken. However, even before a possible book of quantum becomes available, I would hope that judges, when they start deciding these cases, will consult among themselves with the aim of fostering consistency of awards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> Another important part of the Government's strategy for dealing with the insurance costs problem, is to put in place policies to reduce the number of accidents in the workplace and on the roads. There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to introduce legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work &mdash; the Barrington Commission &mdash; and to promote the introduction of safety arrangements by insurance companies. The Minister for Labour intends to introduce the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill in the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  His Department are also having discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation about the promotion of safety audit arrangements by insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Already there are signs that measures taken to deal with the problem of uninsured driving are producing real benefits. As the Minister for the Environment has confirmed to the House recently, the results of the latest roadside survey by the Garda Síochána, in April and May 1987, revealed a level of motor insurance evasion of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent.  This was much lower than previous estimates which ranged from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  The Garda Síochána instituted 74,000 summonses for insurance offences in 1986 &mdash; the last year for which published figures are available. The introduction of windscreen insurance discs in July 1986 has made it easier for the gardaí to spot the evader, and has been an effective enforcement measure operating in conjunction with Garda checks on insurance certificates.</P>
    <P>However, there is a need for further radical measures to eradicate the scourage of uninsured and drunken driving.  The Minister for the Environment will be bringing forward measures in a proposed Road Traffic Bill to empower the Garda to seize and impound uninsured vehicles, pending the production of the necessary insurance.  The Bill will also contain proposals to reduce the blood-alcohol level. The Minister for the Environment recognises the link between road accidents and <Col N="285" /> the condition of the road infrastructure. He told the Dáil recently that improvements in road safety will continue to be one of the main objectives of future road development policy.  He stated that he would be taking all practicable steps to reduce road accidents, the related loss of life and personal injuries, the level of insurance evasion, and claims on both the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland and licensed motor insurers.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from what I have said that the measures in the Courts Bill, 1986, are just a part &mdash; but an important part &mdash; of a very wide package of proposals to which the Government are committed designed to deal with various aspects of policy that impact directly or indirectly on the cost of liability insurance.  These measures prove that this Government are doing their part to improve the overall environment in which insurance companies operate.  I can assure the House that the Government will be making sure that insurance companies play their part in this process by passing on the benefits to consumers.</P>
    <P>The measures to reform the legal system governing personal and fatal injury cases in the High Court &mdash; proposed in this Bill &mdash; will come into effect when the next legal year starts in October. We will expect further substantial concessions from the insurance industry then.  It is obviously not possible to estimate in advance what the level of those benefits will be for the public because insurance premiums are related to claims costs, but I can assure the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister of State at that Department who has particular responsibility for the insurance industry, will ensure that the savings that will arise for the industry as a result of the various measures being adopted by the Government will be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>If this does not happen, and happen quickly, or if inadequate benefits arise for the public, I suggest this would place a serious question mark over the bona fides of the insurance industry and may jeopardise the various other measures the Government have undertaken in <Col N="286" /> good faith to introduce to reduce the cost of insurance claims at the persistent request of the insurance industry and various employer and industrial interests who are suffering the costs of high insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Generally, the proposed revised text of subsection (1) is an amalgamation of the contents of subsections (1) and (2) in the original section 1 of the Bill, except for the final clause of the latter subsection which is now included as a separate subsection (3) in the revised section 1.  Subsection 1 repeats the substantive provision in the Bill as introduced to discontinue the use of juries in High Court actions claiming damages for personal injuries to any person &mdash; paragraph (a) and under section 48 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, or section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, in respect of the death of a person &mdash; the so called "dependency" action &mdash; paragraphs (b) and (c) respectively; or for the trial of a fact or issue arising in such an action, notwithstanding the provisions of section 94 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) contains additional provisions, not in section 1 of the original Bill, to deal with the fact that many personal injury actions include claims for other damages as well, e.g. damage to property, and paragraph 2 (a) provides that such a "mixed" action will come within the scope of the Bill, that is, will be tried without a jury.  In the absence of the provision, the contention might be made that since other damages are included in the claim, the action is not for personal injuries only, and thus does not come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 (b) eliminates a possible loophole that could arise if a possible action for personal injuries, and for other damages, were split into two separate actions.  Under the Bill as drafted, a plaintiff in a case which involved personal injuries and non-personal injuries, such as damage to property, might attempt to initiate an action first for damages for the non-personal injuries, and seek to have a jury trial to determine the issue of liability in the case.  It is not certain that such <Col N="287" /> a request would not succeed.  The matter would be likely to come before the High Court for decision.  If access to a jury trial could be secured in that way to try the non-personal injuries claim, a later, non-jury court, trying a subsequent action for personal injuries arising from the same facts and circumstances, might feel itself bound by the determination of liability in the first action.</P>
    <P>Such an outcome would circumvent the intention of the Bill that all the issues in personal injury cases should be tried by a judge sitting alone.</P>
    <P>The insertion of the new subsection 2 (b) in section 1 of the Bill is designed to close off the possible loophole that arises under the Bill at present, by providing that where an action is taken for non-personal injuries, and the action arises directly or indirectly from circumstances which resulted also in personal injuries or death, then the first action will be tried in the same way as a personal injuries claim, in other words, by a judge sitting alone.</P>
    <P>If a dispute were to arise in a particular case that a claim for damages for non-personal injuries was too remote from the circumstances that also caused personal injuries, it would be a matter for the court to decide whether the former damages were indirectly due to the same "act or omission".</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the exclusion from the scope of the Bill of actions for damages for false imprisonment, or for intentional trespass to the person, often referred to as assault and battery cases.  These cases are already excluded from the Bill by virtue of the final three lines in the existing text of subsection 1 (2) (a), but the exclusion will be highlighted by dealing with it in a separate subsection in the revised text of section 1.  One modification is proposed by comparison with the existing text.  It is necessary to restrict the exclusion to cases where damages are claimed only for false imprisonment or intentional trespass.  The existing text would allow any case which included such damages to be excluded from the Bill.  That could <Col N="288" /> create a loophole that would enable a plaintiff in a personal injury case to evade the intention of the Bill by including a claim for assault in his action, say where he alleged that there had been a separate assault on him following a car accident.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) contains an additional subsection to make it clear that any set-off or counterclaim by a defendant against the plaintiff, e.g. in respect of assault or damage to property, or proceedings initiated by a defendant to join other parties as co-defendants in an action, will not be capable of being used to bring a jury into a personal injury case, on the grounds that the action was no longer an action for personal injuries only.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) contains a new, transitional, provision to enable a jury trial of a personal injury case which had commenced, but had not concluded, before the cut-off date for jury trial to continue until the case is disposed of.</P>
    <P>The subsection also provides that a retrial of a personal injuries case taking place after the commencement date will be heard without a jury, even if the original trial was before a jury.  Retrials may be ordered by the Supreme Court following successful appeals from High Court jury decisions, and it is necessary for the parties to set down the actions for trial again.  In effect such a retrial becomes a new action and goes to the bottom of the list, and there is no reason to treat it differently from other personal injury actions heard after the Act has come into operation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) is a purely technical provision to provide for requests for jury trial by parties in personal injury actions set down for trial before the cut-off date for jury trial, to be ignored without the need for a court order.  Under the existing Rules of the High Court no notice of trial seeking a jury can be countermanded except with the consent or leave of the court &mdash; and such leave may be given by the court subject to costs or other terms. A plaintiff who requires a jury trial includes that requirement in his notice of trial.  Where a jury trial is not sought by <Col N="289" /> plaintiff in the notice of trial, the defendant may serve notice on the plaintiff in the action signifying his desire to have a jury trial in the case.  The proposed amendment has been drafted to deal with both of these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) relocates the provision at present in subsection (2) (b) of the Bill defining the expression "personal injuries". The definition is identical to the definition of the same expression in section 2 of the Statute of Limitations, 1957.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments to section 1 have been put down by the Opposition. I am opposed to amendment No. 1.  The words "consist only of" have been included in the text of subsection (3) to ensure that no loophole would arise which would enable a plaintiff in a personal injury case to evade the intention of the Bill by including a claim for assault in his action, say where he alleged there had been a separate assault on him following a car accident.</P>
    <P>I am opposing amendment No. 2 on the same grounds that I am opposing amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  I want the provisions of the Bill to come into effect on 1 August so that the benefits will materialise immediately.  Acceptance of Deputy Taylor's amendment would postpone for many years the date on which the provisions of the Bill would come into effect.  The amendment relates to the saving provision for cases set down for trial before the passage of the Bill contained in subsection (3) of section 4 of the Bill as introduced.  In my amendment, No. 10, I am proposing to substitute a new commencement provision to replace the saving provision referred to in order to bring the provisions of the Bill into effect as quickly as possible.  Jury trials would continue for up to four years if the existing saver for cases set down for trial remained in the Bill.  That delay is not acceptable.  I must ensure that the economic benefits expected from the passage of this Bill arising in the area of costs of liability insurance for the public and for industry can be realised as quickly as possible.  The Deputy's amendment would extend the saver for existing cases <Col N="290" /> to all cases where proceedings had been issued before passage of the Bill.  That would postpone the time when jury trials would cease for a further substantial period and this would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 which is being discussed again with this amendment is not acceptable either.  Subsection (6) is a purely technical provision to provide that requests for jury trials by parties in personal injury cases set down for trial before the cut off date for jury trial can be ignored without the need for a court order.  The Deputy's amendment is consequential on their proposed amendment No. 2 to my amendment No. 1.  I am opposing that amendment also.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that when the Bill was introduced on 28 May 1986 the case had not been made by the previous Government for the abolition of juries in personal injury claims for personal damages.  I fail to see how the Minister justifies that statement if he has changed his mind in the meantime because nothing has happened since May 1986 to suggest that the present Government have changed things to such an extent that there is now a need for them to proceed with this legislation.  I would suggest that the only party, perhaps with the exception of the Progressive Democrats who are consistent on this is ourselves, because we introduced this legislation and we stick by the principle <Col N="291" /> of the legislation.  We are extremely concerned that an attempt is being made here by the Government to pretend to the electorate that something enormous is being done in relation to insurance costs, and in the process there is a danger that we will ignore the right of the ordinary individual to be properly represented, particularly in relation to the measure that is now being suggested to control the number of counsel.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I have no brief for any particular group.  What I am concerned about is that the average person who finds himself in court seeking damages as a result of an accident will be properly represented.  I do not want to see him put at a disadvantage when the defendant, who in most cases is likely to be an insurance company, can produce as many experts as necessary to make a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To concentrate this whole legislation on the suggestion that if it is passed insurance costs will be reduced dramatically is false.  There are other aspects involved here that are a cause for high premium rates.  One is the size of our population.  The principle of insurance is based on a pool of funds where the good pay for the bad.  The smaller the pool the more likely the premium will be high.  Of course the size of damages awarded has an influence, but the reality is that as long as we remain in a situation where insurance companies underwrite risks based on the experience in this country alone we will be faced with higher premium rates than those in the UK.  A British insurance company operating here should view the totality of the fund; in other words it should take into account the UK situation and the Irish situation. But what they consistently do is look at the experience in Ireland alone and justify a hike in premium rates because of the situation they find themselves in here. If we were part of a greater pool, and I hope the Single European Act will help to some extent here, we would have a far higher chance of reducing premiums.  But to say that this Bill will sort out the insurance problems and ignore what <Col N="292" /> could happen to the ordinary individual who may find he is not properly represented and cannot make his case is wrong.  It is important to bear that in mind and not use this as a publicity exercise to pretend that something is happening since this Government came into power to bring about a massive reduction in premium rates.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Minister pointed to the need to enforce the existing laws.  As far as I am aware numbers in the Garda Síochána have reduced since this Government came into power and there is a non-recruitment policy at the moment.  There are no new measures in terms of a proper traffic unit to enforce existing laws.  The existing laws in relation to traffic lights and pedestrian crossings and safety on the roads are a joke.  There has been no move to have on-the-spot fines for minor traffic offences instead of blocking our courts with summonses for breaking through traffic lights.  We have not modernised our laws at all in that area despite repeated requests.  Yet we are pretending that there has been greater enforcement of the existing laws.</P>
    <P>In relation to the elimination of the cost of uninsured drivers which was a point made by Fianna Fáil in Opposition, I am not aware of any dramatic increase in the numbers driving around without insurance.  The main difficulty in that area is the difficulty of enforcing the law.  I have suggested on many occasions that we should insure the person and not the vehicle; in other words, everybody who drives a vehicle here should carry third party liability cover and have an insurance disc displayed when driving a car, indicating that it is the person who is insured and not the car.  We have this ridiculous situation of a car with ten drivers and nobody knows who is the insured person.  It is very difficult to check on the spot.  A Garda has to go to a lot of bother to have a certificate produced and time is spent in court with blockages in the court resulting.  The end result is that the law is not being properly enforced. Before we take the dramatic step of changing the level of representation the ordinary individual should have in our <Col N="293" /> courts we should enforce the present laws and make other changes that are also necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister, again when he was in Opposition, suggested that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be raised from £15,000 to £25,000 or £30,000.  They have not done anything about that either since they came into Government.  So to come in here and suggest that since they have gone into Government the case has been made for the abolition of juries is not accurate.  I cannot see any evidence of it and it is misleading to the public to suggest that it is so.  My party took a decision and we are being consistent but we are not leaving it stand at that.  We want to see action being taken in respect of the enforcement of the existing laws whereby real progress can be made in relation to the overall cost of insurance by making it practical and feasible to enforce the existing laws.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, I and members of my party are extremely concerned that the ordinary individual should have the opportunity to be properly represented. If we are going to abolish juries we have to give gurantees to people that they will get a fair deal.  That is what we are here for, to represent the ordinary individual who is the person who has put us in here.  We are not here to represent insurance companies; we are not here to represent the Law Library, we are not here to represent insurance brokers or any other vested interest group.  We are here to represent insurance brokers or a situation whereby when this Bill goes through the average individual will be properly protected.  Rushing into something for the sake of giving the impression that this Government are doing a lot to reduce insurance costs is not sufficient reason to force this House to adopt measures that could ultimately affect the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate on this Bill my party will be endeavouring to see to it that no steps are taken that will affect the right of that individual.  I am sure everyone in this House is concerned at the high cost of motor insurance, the non-availability of public liability and <Col N="294" /> employers liability insurance and the high cost, when it is available, of both those types of cover.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day other measures can be taken outside of what we are talking about here that could bring about this situation particularly in relation to insurance companies.  Insurance companies &mdash; and I know the business &mdash; have not always been open about the manner in which they have done their business. To suggest that you can look for an increase in motor premiums as a result of underwriting losses and ignore your investment profits from the sums of money taken in through motor insurance premiums is not fair.  It is not reasonable to say that we have made a loss on our underwriting income but ignore the fact that vast sums have been made on investment income.  Part of that investment income should go towards the cost of the insurance premium.  It is part and parcel of the same business.  They are financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should allow ourselves to scrap a system that has been in place whereby the individual has rights and those rights have been protected simply because the case has been made that insurance costs are high in this country. I hope that the abolition of juries when it becomes law will help to reduce costs.  As I said at the outset, I do not want to see the rights of the ordinary individual being affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome section 1 and the amendment which now substitutes a new section 1 which is much more extensive than the original section 1.  It is about three times or more as long as the original section 1.  This is the kernel of the Bill which has been long awaited. It had an unusually lengthy period of gestation and we are now taking Committee Stage approximately two years after its Second Stage debate.  I hope it will be law by the date envisaged in the amendments to section 4 which is 1 August.  It is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remind ourselves that we are the second last country in the entire <Col N="295" /> world that retains this strange 18th and 19th century system of allowing civil juries to award damages to people who have been injured.  All other European countries have long since abolished that system, whether they were of the common law tradition or otherwise.  All the British Commonwealth countries have long since abolished it.  The only country retaining it at present, apart from ourselves, is the United States of America. The United States of America has a system of compensation which is not appropriate &mdash; most people would agree &mdash; to any other country.  From time to time it has the most extraordinary results, including the awarding by juries of damages of millions and millions of dollars for punitive and exemplary purposes and to express their disapproval of certain things.  The damages are out of all proportion to the loss suffered by the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>There was a time in this country when civil juries tended to look on the award of damages as some sort of automatic right.  It was just a question of assessing the amount.  The question of liability scarcely arose with them and we got ourselves into very severe difficulties.  It was only when this Bill was introduced two years ago that suddenly the word began to percolate through to juries that they had better stop acting as they had been acting and start being a bit more reasonable. Up to that time they looked on every defendant as automatically insured and they looked on every insurance company as being like the Irish Exchequer &mdash; a bottomless pit out of which they could freely draw for all time.  Jurors in Ireland at one time, theoretically at any rate, were people of some substance.  You had to have a poor law valuation of £20 and you had to be a male before qualifying. That was all done away with by the Mairín de Burca case when the entire electoral register became liable to be jurors.  The electoral register was then opened to people of 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>A jury can now be very different from what it was a few decades ago.  It can consist of a number of very young <Col N="296" /> people and very uneducated people some of whom often have the greatest problem in trying to assess actuarial evidence and who through no fault of their own, find great difficulty in trying to comprehend the difference between £100,000 and £1 million because the noughts are entirely confusing.  Their own personal circumstances possibly are that they never had more than £20 or £30 in their pockets in their lives.  To try to think in very large numbers is something which, through no fault of their own, is beyond them.  The system that has often been adopted in practice by juries who were faced with this difficulty was that the foreman of the jury instructed the 12 members of the jury to write down whatever number they thought appropriate.  He would then add up the 12 figures and divide the total by 12 and that was the result.  I have often been told that by people who served on juries, as have others.  That is a well known fact and it was unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Jurors told me, for example, that sometimes there was a difference of several hundred thousand pounds between the lowest and the highest figure.  The whole thing was totally arbitrary and it no longer made sense.  I am glad to see that it is being changed.  It is interesting to see that the change is so slow, so painful and so protracted when I would have thought it made sense to do it quickly and to do it some time ago.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Justice I recall that we abolished civil juries in the Circuit Court in 1970 or 1971.  That was subject to some limited criticism but, at that time, the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; was only £600 so it could not have made much material difference.  I recall rather tentatively trying to extend that Bill to the High Court &mdash; I was very young then &mdash; and being told to behave myself and to stay in my place.  Little did I think it would be 16 or 17 years later before I would see this Bill enacted.</P>

      <P>If I thought I would <Col N="297" /> have had to wait 16 or 17 years to see this desirable thing happen, I might have fought with somewhat greater tenacity in the early seventies to introduce it.  I was up against one of the most civilised, but nonetheless effective, lobbies I have ever seen.  That is why this is now happening 16 or 17 years later than it should.  It seems to have been particularly inappropriate that for all these years we should have retained this system of going through all the panoply of the law for the award of compensation to people injured in normal traffic accidents when, first, other countries were able to do without it and, secondly, we ourselves established here about ten years ago a tribunal to deal with personal injuries to award compensation to people who were subjected to criminally inflicted personal injuries and that it was possible to do that without any reference to a court, in a private committee room or meeting room, where private individuals appointed to this tribunal would interview the injured person and award him compensation for whatever injuries he sustained criminally.  If it could be done there in respect of criminally inflicted injuries, why could it not have been done all along and why can it still not be done that way in respect of accidentally inflicted personal injuries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed on Second Stage that the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, referred to this possibility and the possibliity of &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; liability being brought in here.  He said he thought that these were away down the line and rather radical.  I do not think they are particularly radical.  This is the way in which we should be thinking.  I cannot see any justification for having a tribunal quietly, efficiently and effectively dispensing compensation to those who are criminally injured and then to have the great panoply of a court to give compensation to those accidentally injured.  In the vast majority of these cases there is no law involved.  It is simply a question of the assessment of the damages.  It could be much more easily done in a much more informal fashion.  However, I suppose I must be thankful that at least what is being done in this Bill is being done at <Col N="298" /> long last.  I hope that will not be the end of it until well into the next century.  I hope the question of the possibility of a tribunal, or some simplified form of award of compensation, will be thought of.</P>
    <P>I listened as carefully as I could to the Minister's speech just now on this amendment.  I want to draw the attention of the House to one phrase which he used which I think is very important and which may well cause a great deal of debate if it is reported accurately and if it is considered.  That is &mdash; and he will correct me if I misquote him, not having written down the exact words, but certainly having got the sense of it &mdash; where he said that it would, in his view or in the Government's view, be rare that more than one counsel would be needed in these cases, as they were not complicated and so on.  I think it has been envisaged, particularly in the later amendment, that what was being done was reducing the number of senior counsel from two to one, but if what the Minister said this morning is correct and only one counsel is envisaged in the great majority of these cases, I presume that one counsel will be a junior counsel.  Or is it envisaged that one senior counsel on his own can be briefed in these matters without a junior counsel?</P>
    <P>This may not appear to be of great moment to many people throughout the country, but if what the Minister said is correct and if that is what the Government have in mind, it is going much further than anything that has been suggested up to now.  It goes away beyond what the Bar Council recently voluntarily agreed and I think it needs to be clarified. It is possible that in reading out what he read the Minister omitted the word &ldquo;senior&rdquo;.   If he did, that could change the sense of it very considerably.   If the Minister is right, I certainly do not disagree with it at all, but perhaps more notice should be given to those involved or those affected.  All this is a welcome development.  I look forward to it being brought into effect on 1 August, as is now envisaged in the Bill, as amended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> In conclusion, I want to draw the Minister's attention to what I think is an error which has been made, simply by an oversight, which is quite understandable.  In the Rules of the Superior Courts and the practice of the courts as such, unless a jury is involved as of right, a plaintiff does not have the right to have his case heard outside of Dublin.  That may seem strange, or pointless, or whatever, but that is, in fact, what both the law and the practice are at the moment, unless you have, as of right, a right to a jury.  After this Bill is passed, a plaintiff will not have, as of right, a right to a jury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Therefore, unless some provision is made in this section to enable the present practice of these personal injuries cases being heard at different venues throughout the country, that practice will come to an end. The position is dealt with in Order 36 of the Superior Courts rules of 1986.  Rule 1 of Order 36 says:</P>
      <P>All proceedings in the High Court shall be tried at the Four Courts, Dublin unless otherwise ordered or provided by statute or by these Rules.</P>
      <P>It then goes on to give the exceptions and one of these is, in 2 (b), that in the case of any proceedings which the parties are entitled as of right to have tried with a jury, notice of trial may be served for any of the following venues: Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Dundalk and Kilkenny without prior application to the court and the matter may be set down for trial at such venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That right has been taken away.  It will be still possible to get a trial at a venue outside Dublin when this Bill is passed but only if, under rule 2 (a), an application is made by way of motion to a judge sitting in Dublin on notice to the other side for an order from that judge enabling the case to be heard at a venue <Col N="300" /> outside of Dublin.  Two counsel and solicitors have to be employed to make that application; affidavits have to be drawn up and all the rest.  It will cost, at the very least, several hundred pounds and it will delay notice of trial by several months.  It achieves nothing, but it will be a bureaucratic requirement that will simply delay things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley and I have put down an amendment, No. 4, to this amendment which covers the point.  It appears to have been ruled out by the Chair for very technical reasons.  I am not sure that the technical reasons that were adduced to me are correct.  Perhaps it is confusing for some of those who have to consider it.  I cannot believe that it was the wish or the intention of the Government, or of the Department of Justice, to prevent all these thousands of cases that are heard in provincial venues every year from continuing to be heard there.  A most chaotic situation will be created, as well as huge additional costs, if all the thousands of cases heard in the High Court around the country every year have to come back into the Four Courts in Dublin.  The additional inconvenience and the cost are enormous and simply this should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to prevent this, as Deputy Fitzpatrick calls it, decentralisation in reverse, total centralisation of our High Court.  Already, even with the thousands of cases heard throughout the country every year, we are very much over-centralised so far as the High Court is concerned.  All the judges live in Dublin.  They seem to think that Dublin is the only appropriate place in which they should live.  One could contrast it with other countries where judges of superior courts live all over the country and work all over their respective countries. There are permanent High Court sittings in Britain, for example, outside of London and it would be regarded as absolutely intolerable if London were the only permanent centre for the High Court in Britain, and similarly in other countries.  On the appointment of High Court judges from now on it should be made clear to them that they should be <Col N="301" /> expected to live for at least a period of a couple of years outside of Dublin.   There is no reason there is not at least one High Court judge permanently sitting in Cork &mdash; not necessarily the same judge, as it would perhaps be desirable that he should change from year to year.  Certainly there should be a judge there all the time.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the technicalities that seem to arise in respect of this amendment, it is essential that the amendment to the amended section be accepted, or else something very similar to it.  The Minister should express what I assume to be the Government's view, that there is no desire to recentralise all these cases back into Dublin.  That would be crazy and would cost hundreds and thousands, if not millions of pounds.  Whatever form it is in in this amendment should be accepted.  It is not just Deputy Colley and myself who spotted this problem.  My attention was drawn to it by a judge of the superior courts who said it would be intolerable if this change were inadvertently made and that it would be the cause of great hardship to litigants.  The whole idea of this Bill and these amendments is to simplify things and to make them less expensive.</P>

      <P>I was totally aghast at some of the comments made this morning by Deputy O'Malley with reference to the men and women who have served and who continue to serve on juries.  His description of many of those juries is totally consistent with the line of thought of the Progressive Democrats.  Not for nothing are they described as the yuppy party.  Certainly the disparaging comments made by Deputy O'Malley about many of the jurors who serve in civil and criminal trials have to be strongly deplored.  He described many of them <Col N="302" /> as being young and uneducated and as having great difficulty in assessing the difference between £10,000, £100,000 and £1 million.  I hope his comments are noted by many of the young people who serve on civil and criminal juries.  There is no suggestion about abolishing the responsibility of jurors in criminal trials. Do not the same test of qualification for jurors in criminal trials apply to jurors in civil trials?  Would Deputy O'Malley have us believe that those who determine the guilt or innocence of people in serious criminal trials are those he airily dismisses as being young, uneducated people who do not know the difference between £10,000 and £100,000 and that these people are sitting as jurors to assess the innocence or guilt of people charged with serious crimes?  That is a most outrageous statement for the Deputy to have made to the House this morning.  I am totally surprised that Deputy O'Malley would have made such a statement.  Having seen jurors in action over many years, many of them young, it is to their credit that they have made a very fine contribution to the juridical process in this country, both in the criminal field&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and as jurors in civil trials.  They have given of their time and energies and have applied themselves with great concentration and determination to matters they are well qualified to deal with.  They have approached the tasks accorded to them by and large with a degree of concentration and they determine the facts before them and decide the issue.  Perhaps it can be argued that they can do that at least equally as well as a judge.  It could be said that they are ordinary people who have more of a connection with the everyday facts of life than many of the judges who are remote from the problems that affect everyday people within the education system and within the health services which are being decimated severely by the present <Col N="303" /> Government.  These people are well qualified and have done a fine job.  We can be proud of the jury system as it has operated here.</P>
      <P>There are all sorts of criticisms levelled at the jury system from time to time and I will deal with these on an interim basis. First, I will refer to the appalling cynicism of this Government and of the Minister for Social Welfare in coming into this House today to move this Bill and these amendments.  I do not understand how a person who made the statements the Minister made on this issue on 28 May 1986 can now come in here and recommend to this House that this amendment should be adopted by the House.  I will refer to some of the statements the Deputy made on that occasion.  Deputy Woods said on 28 May 1986, as reported at Column 520 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil have considered this matter at length and have taken into account the views expressed by the Government, the employers' organisations and the representatives of insurance companies who all favour the abolition of juries and, on the other hand the views expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Bar Council and the individual trade unions who oppose the measure.  We have come to the conclusion that the case for the abolition of juries has not been established.  This is borne out by the findings of three independent commissions. In addition, the direction of what the Government are saying has been changed to something more vague and general than what has been said publicly up to this time.  They speak about stability and predictability in the future, but gone is the thing the motorist is interested in, the reduction in premium costs as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister for Social Welfare address himself to the fact that he and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party considered the matter at length having taken account of those views and having come to the conclusion that the case for <Col N="304" /> the abolition of juries had not been established? I wonder if the Minister will tell the House what precisely has changed his opinion on the matter between then and now.</P>

      <P>The condition the Deputy refers to is incorporated in the mortgage agreement with the individual borrower. It is tied up legally in that way.  The reason the subsidy is paid direct to the <Col N="311" /> agency is due to the income-related nature of the loans in question.  The benefit is not lost to the borrower in that it is offset against the increase in the loan capital.  The borrower has full advantage from the subsidy and as it is part and parcel of the scheme I have no wish to change it.</P>

In view of the high cost involved, a study was undertaken in 1986 on behalf of the local authority and the report on the study was made available to my Department.  On the basis of the results of that study, the construction of a bridge at this location could not be justified on economic grounds.

      <P>The only Minister entitled to make a comprehensive statement on this matter is the one the Deputy is talking to, and in due course that will be done.  In response to the Deputy's question, the final census figures have been received and are being examined.  It is only then that a decision can be taken on whether it is necessary to have a constituency review, considering it is only mandated on the Minister to do this once every 12 years.  However, from a casual perusal of the figures it seems there are some imbalances in the census returns as <Col N="318" /> regards one constituency against another.  Consequently we can take it there is need to adjust constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards legislation on derelict sites, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 114 of 8 March 1988.</P>
      <P>Proposals for amendment of existing legislation in relation to camping and caravan sites are being considered and details will be announced in the normal way when the proposals are approved by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced in November 1987, the Government have approved the general scheme of a Bill to update and strengthen the Water Pollution Act, 1977 and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. Drafting of the Bill is being finalised at <Col N="322" /> present.  The Bill will provide for substantial increases in penalties for water pollution offences and will make explicit provision for remedial measures at the polluter's expense.  The good defence provision of the 1977 Act will be modified so as to place a greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission would cause pollution of waters. The Bill will also strengthen the powers of local authorities to prevent pollution from agricultural activities and industrial effluent discharges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These are amendments of existing legislation.  I would think it reasonable that such legislation would apply to all caravan sites.  However, I had better not mislead the Deputy.  I should like to examine that aspect a little more closely.  I take it the Deputy is making the point that the provisions of such legislation should include all caravan sites, irrespective of whether they are of a permanent or of a purely tourist nature?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>Of course the new legislative provisions will carry increased penalties, which matter will be dealt with in <Col N="323" /> some detail.  I presume it will be welcomed by everybody in that the level of fines, as they are applicable currently under the law, do not achieve the results we would like.  Therefore, I can assure the Deputy that that will be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I recall that the last time we spoke in this chamber with the Minister for the Environment at Question Time this same topic was raised.  At that time I pointed out to the Minister that if he so wished we could visit, within 500 <Col N="331" /> metres of this building, houses that are derelict under any definition.  The Minister undertook to contact Dublin Corporation specifically in relation to derelict property, that is the housing to which Deputy Mitchell referred, which for want of an additional maintenance allocation they are unable to make good.  Having reminded the Minister of our previous exchange in this House, I want to ask him first what action he proposes to take in relation to the matter I have referred to and, secondly, whether the Bill, to which the Minister referred in relation to the question that was asked, proposes to take in all of the derelict property currently owned by public authorities throughout the country and specifically the property owned by Dublin Corporation in the city?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that where abandoned houses are in terraces they can be a fire or health hygiene danger?  This is an aspect I am very concerned about and it arises regularly.   Will the Minister look at the powers he has in relation to health hygiene and the prevention of fire to ensure that local authorities can at least secure abandoned premises?  This is a big problem in most areas.  If a house is abandoned the windows and doors are left open and there is a danger to the neighbouring houses from a fire or health hygiene point of view.</P>

      <P>My Department are not involved in discussions with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries in relation to toxic waste disposal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to hear that I have met on two separate occasions and at some length the people involved in this and they would have been very happy to have become involved in a voluntary arrangement except for one little difficulty that arose.  Participation in the scheme might just leave themselves open to litigation if anything went wrong or the advice given by them lent itself to litigation subsequently.  We thought we had it settled by way of voluntary arrangement.  A little difficulty has arisen and if it can be got over by voluntary arrangement, all the better.  If not it will <Col N="334" /> require legislation.  I am not averse to that, but if we could get it by way of the voluntary agreement, in which they are most happy to participate, I think that would be the way forward, but the intention of the Deputy's question is appreciated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister that the apprehension that voluntary private enterprise waste disposal companies may have about the possibility of litigation decoded by the Parliament and people of this State means they do not want to be responsible for their actions and certainly do not want to be liable in a court of law for any damage that might be done to the environment as a result of their irresponsible disposal of waste, as has been the experience in privatised enterprise in Britain?  Accordingly, what intentions or proposals has the Minister to ensure that any private concern who will get a favourable contract from this Government for disposal of waste would be accountable to the people &mdash; as distinct from the Government &mdash; in respect of any damage, whether accidental or negligent, that might occur to the environment as a consequence of their irresponsible management or disposal of that waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about transport incidences of spillages that might involve dangerous substances, and I have found the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries to be a very responsible group, responsible in that they wanted to offer every assistance possible by way of providing emergency services if called upon. They have all the knowledge about the substances, they have detailed knowledge of the type of chemicals being transported and they know how to react to the various substances.  The federation were quite happy in a speedy response to give the expert advice available and are still most forthcoming in supplying us with that information and assistance.  I want to get it on a regular basis, set down so that we can call on them at a moment's notice.  I would have thought that eminently responsible both of the Minister and the federation.  The one simple item <Col N="335" /> outstanding is to give them what they would regard as the necessary cover to prevent litigation subsequently.  I am happily disposed to doing that by whichever method is required.</P>

He attempted to suggest that what was at issue here was the transportation of waste.  I remind the House, you, Sir, and him that Question No. 18 in the name of Deputy Pattison asks about emergency situations relating to the question of toxic waste disposal.  Perhaps the Minister will rephrase his reply to the last supplementary in the context of what the question was, not that of the transportation of waste.</P>

He knows full well there is sufficient law on the Statute Book to deal with the matter raised by him.  The question about the disposal of toxic waste and that about transport of the waste are related, and that is what we are talking about in the first instance.  If a disposal has to take place transportation of the very waste the Deputy referred to is often involved, but there is sufficient law in place at this time to deal with the anxiety he expressed in his second supplementary.</P>

      <P>A person whose annual income is less than £10,000 may obtain a loan from a local authority for the provision of bathroom or shower facilities.

The interest rate is currently 9.25 per cent but I expect that this will shortly be reduced.  In view of the availability of this facility and the current budgetary situation, I do not consider that an interest free loan scheme would be justified.</P>

      <P>Relating to the latter part of the Minister's reply in regard to rented accommodation, is he denying that 1,200 Dublin Corporation homes are without bathrooms?  Does he consider in this Millennium year that that is satisfactory? Should these bathrooms not be provided, at least half this year and half <Col N="338" /> next year, to eliminate this outrageous scandal?</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware there are quite a number &mdash; I do not know the exact number &mdash; of homes that have no facilities such as the Deputy mentioned but he will agree that I have made a special effort in regard to the provision of remedial moneys to the corporation to deal with the matter, much more than was contemplated by any previous administration. My intention is to keep up that pressure until we rid ourselves of this matter entirely.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is in Dublin Corporation, the authority with whom I am most familiar, a list A and a list B of disabled tenants of the corporation who cannot get a bathroom or shower unit supplied?  The fact that there are 1,200 such homes in Dublin in this Millennium year is a scandal.  It would cost something like £5.5 million to provide all who need bathrooms with them and there is no reason why half could not be provided in this Millennium year and the remainding half next year.

Immediately on hearing of the abduction the Department contacted the Presidency of the European Communities &mdash; the Federal Republic of Germany &mdash; and the European Commission, both of which are represented in Addis Ababa, to seek their assistance.  We also informed the <Col N="341" /> UN High Commission for Refugees in Geneva.</P>
    <P>Concern representatives in Addis Ababa and Khartoum have been in contact with the UK Embassies in these capitals which are making inquiries on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Department are, of course, maintaining close liaison with Concern here in Dublin.  We understand that contact has now been made with the Oromo Liberation Front and I can tell the House that our latest information is that the two nurses are unharmed.  It is hoped that they will be handed over safely in the near future.</P>
    <P>I know that Members of the Dáil will appreciate the need for sensitivity in what we do and say in relation to incidents such as this.  However, I can assure the House that the Government will continue in their efforts to establish the precise whereabouts of Fiona Quinn and Mary Coen and to secure their early and safe release.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the luncheon adjournment I was referring to the contribution on this important issue by the Minister for Social Welfare when Opposition spokesman on Justice during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill on 28 May 1986.  I should like to refer to some more comments by Deputy Woods on that occasion.  Deputy Woods on that day was dealing with the attitude of the insurance industry and whether or not the abolition of juries would lead to a reduction in insurance premiums.  He quoted the response of the insurance industry and went on to say, as reported at column 520:</P>
      <P>In any event, the insurance industry are adamant that the abolition of the jury system will not result in an immediate drop in premiums although it may in time contribute in some way. This was accentuated in a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme when the spokesman for the industry, when pressed about the question of premiums coming down, said the hope was that they would be contained and that following the abolition of the jury system other things would follow, such as the streamlining of the whole system, the reduction in the severity and the number of accidents, the surveillance by the Garda authorities....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, we have this vagueness.  What are the &ldquo;other things&rdquo; that are supposed to follow?  Where are they?  I do not see any sign of them and I do not see anything in the Minister's amendment, or in any action by the Government, to indicate that they are bringing in these &ldquo;other things&rdquo;.  All that it amounts to is this pious hope that in some mystical way insurance premia will drop when juries are abolished.  This morning in the course of his contribution the Minister for Social <Col N="385" /> Welfare was on the same tack.  He said, &ldquo;We will expect concessions from the insurance industry then&rdquo;.  Many people expect a lot of things but they do not happen.</P>
    <P>I must be naive because I expected that, having regard to the attitude adopted by the Minister for Social Welfare, and the Fianna Fáil Party when in Opposition in 1986 in response to the Bill, they would drop it like a hot potato. All sorts of things happen that one does not expect.  Are we to take this major step of abolishing that basic right of the ordinary person to have his or her damages assessed and facts determined by a jury if all we have in return is the expectation of concessions from the insurance industry?  The House would be foolish to put its trust in that.  One would have wanted a much more definite commitment to decrease premiums by 10 or 20 per cent across the board.  The insurance industry have made it perfectly clear that this will not happen.  They have given no commitment.  They have said the best we can hope for is containment. There will be no question of juries going and premiums coming down.  Whence comes the motivation for this move?  It escapes me.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party sent in their former Front Bench spokesman on Justice, now Minister for Social Welfare, and he gave a long and detailed analysis in one of the finest speeches he has made. It was an excellent speech analysing all aspects of the problem down to the last detail.  I heard it all and found it so convincing that in my own contribution on that occasion I more or less agreed with him and deplored the fact that this Bill was being brought forward by the Coalition Government.  The Labour Party were not happy with this project and the Labour Ministers voted against it in Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Who told the Deputy that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party did not want the abolition of juries then and do not want it now.  Of course the Fine Gael <Col N="386" /> Party want the abolition of juries and if there is a merit in consistency they have it.  They are not concerned about the rights of protection for the ordinary man. Like the Progressive Democrats, they take the elitest position.  Unfortunately the Ceann Comhairle was not here this morning to hear the disgraceful performance by the Leader of the Progressive Democrats talking about the youth of this country being unacceptable or not doing a good job as jurors because they were uneducated and could not tell the difference between £10,000 and £100,000.  These kinds of comment do no credit to any politician.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, having considered this matter in 1986 and analysed all aspects of it, decided to oppose it, yet when in Government they decide that their considerations count for nothing and they press upon this House the very thing it took Deputy Woods an hour and a half to argue against.  There must be some strong lobby from some source to bring about that sort of change in a major party.  Where is that lobby?  Who is pressing for this?  I wish the Minister could tell us what changed his mind and that of his party to the extent that they could bring themselves to this monstrous about-face in advocating this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They argue that awards made by juries are inconsistent.  That argument has been mentioned many times.  It is said that there must be consistency in awards and that they should be predictable.  It is a line of argument.  It happens on occasion that awards made by High Court juries are unpredictable.  They have on occasion made awards that were too high.  The record will show that.  On the other hand, it would also have to be conceded that on very many occasions juries have made awards that have been too low and there have been cases &mdash; not a few in number &mdash; where jury awards have not been reduced by the Supreme Court but have been increased.  One notable case where the Supreme Court substantially reduced damages was a case which coincidentally had been assessed by a High Court judge Mr. Justice Hamilton, sitting alone without a jury.  The idea that putting awards <Col N="387" /> in the hands of a judge alone will achieve one kind of predictability and that in the hands of a jury the award will have another kind of predictability does not stand up.</P>
    <P>We are making the ordinary man in the street even more remote from the law.  The law is a rather intimidating institution anyway, but at least with the jury system there was always a connection with the ordinary man.  The young person so disapproved of by Deputy O'Malley, the ordinary person, became a part of the process, was sworn in and listened in the jury box to the evidence.  In some way at least he was identified with the system because he was a part of it.  If we take away that last vestige of connection between the ordinary man and the legal system we will be transforming the law into an elitest system of specialists, judges, barristers, solicitors and so on who make up the panoply.  The one involvement that was left with the ordinary man is being taken away.  To what end?  Is it to achieve predictability in awards?  The award that can be expected for a particular injury is already predictable within certain fairly narrow parameters.  If one describes to any average practising barrister the injuries in a particular case he will be able to tell within those narrow parameters the likely range of the award of damages. The fact is that jury awards are already predictable and, what is more, these awards come under the supervision of the Supreme Court.  There is no jury sitting in the Supreme Court; that is made up of judges alone.  One way or the other, the ultimate supervisory decision as to the amount of damages is under the control of judges alone.  It is commonplace for appeals to take place before the Supreme Court on the amount of damages from High Court jury awards and the Supreme Court gives its guidelines &mdash; judges alone, quite uncontaminated by any jury. Where is the panic, where is the pressure?</P>
    <P>The number of cases that go to the Supreme Court on damages on appeal is relatively few and it is fair to assume <Col N="388" /> from that that there is a broad average spectrum given in High Court jury awards.  It is and has been the basic, unalienable right of ordinary people, if they wish, to have their cases decided by a judge and jury of their peers.  They know that when they go into the witness box and describe the ordinary everyday events that happen to them, be it driving a car, or as a pedestrian, or as a worker in a factory, they will know that there will be sitting there people who will understand, perhaps other factory workers who know what it is like to work in a factory and know the risks that very often they are compelled to take which cause so many of the industrial accidents that take place.  They are entitled to and have always had that right.  It ill behoves any Government, or any party, to take away that right which has been vested in them for all those decades and which has become an enshrined principle of the law. I might be prepared to consider it if anybody could show me any great advantage in it, what benefits would flow to anybody from this.  If the insurance companies are asking the Government to do this so that they can have more money in order to reduce premiums, that would be one thing.</P>
    <P>In fact it is not the jury awards that are untoward.  There are other aspects that could be attended to that could reduce the costs.  I deplore that the Government have introduced the number of counsel into this measure in this way, to confuse the issue.  Two completely separate and distinct issues have been amalgamated in the Bill as now presented to the House by the Minister's measure in bringing forward the notice of motion.  These are disconnected items.  The question of the number of counsel in a case is one thing. It ought to be discussed by the House in detail and at length on Second Stage of a measure, so that there could be an analysis of the type of counsel, junior or senior, or the type of case.  If it is a particularly severe case, perhaps involving a paraplegic or something of that nature, is that not to be distinguished from the ordinary run of the mill £15,000 road accident cases?  Are we just to have some block <Col N="389" /> arrangement as is brought in here?  That is a very important issue.</P>
    <P>I fully accept and support the proposition that there has been overstaffing in so far as legal teams are concerned. Something must be done about that.  In that connection, you cannot consider that matter in isolation.  There are other connected matters that have to be dealt with at the same time if you are going to provide for one counsel per case &mdash; and I agree with one counsel per case, be it junior or senior.  That is a matter that will have to be teased out.  You must deal with the organisation of the courts.  You have to carry out a radical reorganisation of the listing system of these cases before the courts if you want to do that.  It was the unwieldy nature of the listing system that brought about the need for a multiplicity of counsel in the first place.  As a deliberate act perhaps four or five times as many cases were put in for decision in one day as it was known there would be courts available to deal with them.  As a result, the legal teams were forced into the position of having more than one counsel.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in wanting to bring in regulations to deal with the staffing of cases, but at the same time he must organise the listing system for the hearing of court cases.  I see no mention of that.  Where is the arrangement about that, apart from some vague talk?  There are the other vagaries, the other promises. This book of damages I have heard talked about since 1986 and through 1987 to 1988, which was supposed to be such an integral factor, when is that magical book which will solve the problems going to appear?  What has been done about that?  I heard some reference to it in the Minister's speech, but nothing very much.  I come to some of the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Woods, on 28 May 1986, column 521.</P>

      <P>It is an undeniable and very regrettable fact that the status of politicians in this country as compared with others is at a very low ebb.

When one looks at this situation one begins to understand why this is so.  When matters of principle are espoused, be they on one side or the other, at least they ought to be stood over through good and bad.

It is a very unenviable one in which he finds himself.  When he interjects and chips in in this manner, it is understandable.  One would have to have a great deal of sympathy with him.  Nonetheless, it is a job that must be done because one must highlight what has gone on here.  I am speculating on what it was that brought about this remarkable U-turn on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party, now in Government, in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there some institution that has just <Col N="392" /> determined that juries are to be abolished in civil cases in this country?  Does it really matter who is in power?  We should consider where the real power in this country lies.  Apparently some power has determined while one Government is in that juries should be abolished.  There is then a change of Government and into power comes a party who held a diametrically opposed view, and yet we find ourselves in the same situation, that juries in civil cases are still to be abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there some power orchestrating the Members of this House, marionette-like, to produce the desired result that has been enunciated not by any party in this House but by some outside power?  That seems to be the unavoidable conclusion that must be taken from this. At column 521 in the Official Report of 28 May 1986, Deputy Woods said:</P>
      <P>However, we do not accept the <i>status quo.</i> While we would prefer to see the jury system retained in the interests of the ordinary citizen, we are proposing the following steps which it has been shown will definitely reduce insurance costs.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would prefer that why does he not just do it?  Why does he not set about introducing these other things about which he was talking?  Deputy Woods referred, column 522, to the particular relevance that juries have in very serious cases.  We have tabled an amendment here as a saver to provide for the provisions of juries in very serious cases. I will be looking with interest to see if the Minister will support that amendment, to cover what he said, as at column 522 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Are there great costs involved in operating the jury system?  If there are great costs involved, that is certainly a matter to be considered but we will look at what Minister Woods said on that subject, column 528:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the role of the jury <Col N="393" /> we find that in themselves they cost very little.  All the people who sit on juries get is their lunch.  They are not very expensive.  The Minister has told us that there is considerable inconvenience, but there is inconvenience in any democratic process such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to highlight the importance of the democratic system in which the jury system evolved and he was absolutely right.  The Minister is as right today as he was then.  The Minister went on, column 528:</P>
    <P>Juries cost very little, but they set the standards for the treatment of citizens who have been injured.  That is their key, central role.  They come, they give their view and they go.  They have no vested interest other than their understanding and compassion.</P>
    <P>Whence will come the compassion, now that the Minister is sending them off about their business forever?  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>Any error on their part is likely to be on the side of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>Is that not a desirable thing to have?  The Minister went on, column 529:</P>
    <P>If one counts the number of times a jury erred one will find that it was more often on the side of the ordinary citizen who has been injured, and, possibly, maimed for life.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the point&rdquo; said Minister Woods: &ldquo;What is wrong with that?&rdquo; What indeed is wrong with that?  There is nothing wrong with it, so why then set about abolishing it?  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>How hard-faced have we become if we are not prepared to suffer the inconvenience of calling people up and arranging lunches and so on for them so that they can set the standards which we live by?  Are juries to be condemned because of their understanding and fairness?</P>
    <P>Are they to be condemned?  The fairness that the Minister spoke about is truly a recognised facet of the jury system by <Col N="394" /> and large.  As reported in the same column, the Minister asked:</P>
    <P>Should a jury of 12 men and women not be the arbitrers of the will and standards of the people?</P>
    <P>I do not mind what is done in England.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Minister minds a great deal about what is done in England, because here he is now going to considerable pains for no apparent reason to do what they do in England.</P>

      <P>Quite.  Is the English system all that great anyway?  I think not, because a leading QC, Greville Janner in introducing a Private Member's Bill in Westminster on last June 4 described the English compensation system by judge alone as nothing more than an archaic lottery.  The English system that the Minister is running so fast to catch up with and to emulate has been described by a leading QC at Westminster as an archaic lottery.  I suppose the Minister is partial to lotteries.  The lottery system has great appeal for the Government.  It is very useful for them in dispensing largesse where it suits them and where they think it will produce votes for them so maybe it has the attraction of the lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless it is an idea that Minister Woods has taken up with great vigour and great glee and an idea which he is using for political purposes.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been made about the complaints of the insurance companies, about how the insurance companies, detest this idea of a jury system and about how they should be pitied because of how badly they are doing and how much money they are losing.  Is it not really terrible for them when one looks at the offices they have put up and the millions of pounds of investments and all the rest of it?  It is not really necessary for us to pour out our hearts for the insurance companies.  They are incredibly wealthy organisations and I am not at all impressed by the losses they show in their books and which they put forward with a moan and a whinge and all the rest of it. They do very well for themselves and if one looks at their activities and their profits that is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance companies in many cases do not practice what they preach anyway.  In relation to, for example, the number of counsel in a case, they complain that a person has, say, three counsel. It is a fair complaint, but one would have thought then that they for their own legal teams would say that they did not need three counsel and that they would confine themselves to one.  They do not do that, however.  There has never been anything which compelled the insurance companies in court to practice what they preach.  Nobody compelled them to have three counsel but they always do.  If one goes down to any of the jury actions one will see the insurance companies there with the two senior counsel and one junior, that is if all three are there at the same time which is highly unlikely.  They are whingeing and complaining about the necessity for them to pay the other side for having three counsel.  Voluntarily they take on three every time.  I wonder whether the Minister has ever quizzed them about this or raised that question with them, I think not.  Still, they go on <Col N="396" /> about this question on juries, how they do not like juries and how juries are exaggerating the amount of damages but what do they do in practice?  I took particular interest in a report which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 June 1986 and I referred to this report in my speech on Second Stage.  I would now like to refer to it again.  The report is headed &ldquo;Judge criticises insurance firms&rdquo; and it stated:</P>
    <P>A judge has criticised insurance companies for insisting on costlier High Court actions rather than Circuit Court trials.</P>
    <P>Judge Diarmuid Sheridan said at Carlow Circuit Court yesterday that insurance companies had moved heaven and earth to do away with High Court jury hearings, but the opposition to leaving such cases in the Circuit Court jurisdiction, where they are dealt with by a judge alone, was coming from the insurance companies themselves.</P>
    <P>He said that the insurance companies had mounted a very large campaign for waiving jurisdiction of High Court juries.  To his certain knowledge since last October he had transferred at least 15 to 20 cases from the Circuit Court to the High Court.  In each case he had inquired as to whether the parties would leave the cases in the Circuit Court and consent to jurisdiction, but in each case one party objected to that course and that invariably was the defendant who almost always was involved with an insurance company.</P>
    <P>Judge Diarmuid Sheridan said he could not understand this and quite frankly neither can I.</P>
    <P>In the course of his magnificent oration, as reported in column 530 of the Official Report of 28 May 1986, the Minister, Deputy Woods, referred to a statement by Justice Douglas of the American Supreme Court in regard to juries and noted his comments with approval.  He quoted Justice Douglas as saying:</P>
    <P>A jury reflects the attitudes and mores of the community from which it is drawn.  It lives only for the day and <Col N="397" /> does justice according to its limits.  A group of 12, who are drawn to hear a case, makes the decision and melts away.  It is not present the next day to be criticised.  It is the one governmental agency which has no ambition.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Is it not wonderful to think that we can have 12 people give a verdict which can set a standard?  Those people do not have any connections.  Certainly those people are not open to back-handers or any involvement.</P>
    <P>He quoted Justice Douglas as going on to say:</P>
    <P>It is as human as the people who make it up.  It is sometimes the victim of passion but it also takes the sharp edges off a law and uses conscience to ameliorate a hardship.  Since it is of and from the community, it gives the law an acceptance which verdicts of judges could not do.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a lot of truth in what Justice Douglas had to say and that we should listen to such views before we threw away an institution which had set a standard for us in this area.  I agree with him entirely, his comments were very well placed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that the abolition of juries would in any way affect the amount of awards which the courts would give?  He gave his considered opinion on that question at column 535 of the Official Report of 28 May 1986 when he summed up the position as follows:</P>
      <P>In my opinion, therefore, the cost of awards would not be affected greatly by the abolition of the jury system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> At column 536 he had this to say:</P>
    <P>If we do away with juries we will leave the legal profession totally to control the procedure and level of compensation and the setting of the standards which will have to be observed by all.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister is setting about doing.  He has changed his mind on the issue.  He is now the supporter of the legal profession and is quite content to leave the entire administration of the legal system in the hands of the legal profession, something about which he expressed serious reservations on the last occasion.  Also in the same column he said:</P>
    <P>The availability of a jury trial serves the useful social function of discouraging and even preventing litigation from becoming the domain of an exclusive professional group of lawyers, judges and advocates.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on later in his speech to advocate an increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and I agree with him on that.  We have tabled an amendment to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and it will be interesting to see whether the Minister will support it.  At column 541 he referred to the functions of the House and said:</P>
    <P>We have a function and a responsibility in Opposition to tease out these things and to see what is really going on, and when you do so what you find is amazing.</P>
    <P>The situation in which we find ourselves today is certainly amazing and when we try to tease out what is going on behind the scenes and where the orchestration for this measure is coming from it becomes even more amazing.  When the Minister came to the conclusion of his speech after one and a half hours he said:</P>
    <P>I have said all I want to say about this now.  We come to the conclusion that in the measure which the Minister proposes the case has not been made for the abolition of juries.  It has not <Col N="399" /> been established and will not result in the savings which have been mentioned. We have considered this matter long and hard.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all of that we now find he is now imposing it on the House with the aid of the Fine Gael Party and the Progessive Democrats.  It is interesting to note the unity of intent on this issue between the three right wing parties and there is a message to be drawn from this because when the curtain is drawn aside we are left with the position where the concept of the abolition of juries which provided a protection for the ordinary person and the ordinary worker does have interestingly enough the consensus of the Government, the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats.

I would like to think that the Fine Gael Party had a rethink on the issue but when one hears the comments of Deputy Barrett in this House today, clearly that is not the case and the basic trenchant right wing position of the Fine Gael Party is as strong as ever.  They are competing with the Progressive Democrats and they are <Col N="400" /> in unison with Fianna Fáil.  They all espouse the same position.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly behoves the Government to look for measures that will reduce insurance costs.  They would be very important measures.  Much play has been made of the question of escalating insurance costs as a result of many motorists not taking out motor car insurance.  That of course is a very valid point.  It is compulsory for them to do so and that matter should be actively pursued through all available channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more to jury actions and compensation claims than motor car accident cases.  There is another area that involves very often serious injury to people and that is the industrial accidents area.  It behoves the House to address itself to insurance in industrial premises and the accidents that occur there all too frequently. It is entirely wrong and an outrage that it is not compulsory on people who run factories and other industrial premises of that nature to have insurance on their workers and to pay damages where they sustain injury in an accident. That situation has been permitted to continue for far too long.  The case is equally strong to make insurance compulsory for factory owners and people who run industrial premises as it is for motor car owners.  It is regrettable that there are large numbers of factory owners who do not carry insurance on their workers. There are many workers who claim injury awards against such factory owners and never succeed in recovering the money that was awarded to them by the court, whether it was with or without a jury.  If <Col N="402" /> it is made compulsory, and I believe it should be, to have insurance across the board on industrial premises &mdash; I am sure Deputy Barrett with his knowledge of the insurance industry would agree &mdash; that would bring down insurance premiums within that category.  That is the sort of thing that should be looked at and brought in instead of this sham concept that some panacea is going to be created by abolishing juries, that some degree of certainty that is not already there is going to be brought in, that there is going to be any major change in the situation and, most important of all, that the response in regard to insurance premia will be as the Minister hopes.  None of these things will happen.  These pious hopes are not going to be realised.  In the meantime the damage will have been done and the system will have been altered irretrievably. There is no going back when juries have been abolished.  We have to sit back here and rely on those pious expectations from the insurance companies. If that is all we have to hang our hat on, it is a bad day that this House approves of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be long, Deputy. At this point I would like to bring some reality back into the debate.  Deputy Taylor has gone back to the history of this Bill in 1986 and seems to be stuck there for quite some time.  Strangely enough, he was part of the Government which brought through the Second Stage of the Bill, which is the principle of the Bill, and supported it at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="403" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I questioned, as was my duty in Opposition, the savings that would flow from the abolition of juries alone.  I sought from the then Minister, during the course of the Second Stage debate, assurances that not only would there be containment of costs &mdash; that was not sufficient &mdash; but that there would be real reductions in costs as a result of the measure, and preferably as a result of a package of measures instead of the abolition of juries alone which was, at that time, being considered almost as a panacea to bring about all these savings.  What has happened since then?  That is the main import of what Deputy Taylor has to say this afternoon.  He said that if he thought benefits would flow and premia would be reduced, he would be more prepared to accept the measure.  He did not say he would accept it but that he would be more prepared to accept it, although he accepted it in principle earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>pened since 1986.  A great deal of effort has been made by the Government to secure from the insurance industry very firm commitments about the kinds of savings and reductions in premia that will arise from the House taking these measures today.  The Insurance Industry Federation have said that the abolition of the three counsel rule will result in a 10 per cent saving in legal costs.  That is a difference from the position in 1986.  The industry are now talking about actual reductions and not about containment. It is obvious that every Member of the House who is a member of the legal profession is contributing to this Bill today, as the Deputy mentioned earlier.  The federation have given statements to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and they cannot do any more than that.  We have to take that in good faith.  They have also said that, because of the knock-on effects of the abolition of juries and the various other effects, assuming that the other actions are taken in association with it to increase the efficiency of the whole operation, savings in the order of 10 to <Col N="404" /> 20 per cent will be realised.  Indeed they go beyond that.</P>

I went to refresh myself on that matter immediately prior to the Bill coming back to the House.  In relation to Deputy Taylor's point, a number of companies have already reduced their premia this year in anticipation of the step which is being taken by the House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce can quote the various companies already taking that action in the current year.</P>

      <P>I mentioned earlier that one company have introduced a special scheme with reduction of between 10 and 20 per cent for young drivers, with certain conditions: they must have been named on their parents insurance for two years and must be accident free.  That is another practical step that is being taken. There is another example of a company which stated that they have pre-empted the Irish insurance industry by offering reductions in anticipation of the passing of the Courts Bill, 1986, removing jury awards in insurance cases, which they expect to become law by 31 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various steps have been taken which indicate that there is a clear change in the environment and what we, as a Government, are looking for are definite reduction in premiums and the industry are promising these reduction and <Col N="405" /> delivering them, to some extent, even at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister might consider as part of his reply the report of the sub-committee on motor insurance, which I had the privilege to chair during the last Dáil and which was a sub-committee of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, which the Minister chaired.  The report said that the committee would not recommend the abolition of the jury system unless the insurance industry could satisfy them that there would be an immediate benefit in terms of lower premiums for motorists. The committee noted that reductions in VAT and the abolition of duty on car parts, though reducing the cost of car repairs, did not appear to have been passed on to the insured.  What assurance has the Minister that the benifits would be passed to the insurers in this case?  I thank the Minister for courteously giving way so that I could make this point.</P>

      <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the employers, the trade union and the Government came together.  Page 16, paragraph 4, of the programme reads:</P>
      <P>Irish liability insurance rates place many Irish firms at a cost disadvantage, particularly in comparison with UK competitors.  The Government will move quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs by proceeding with legislation to abolish juries in personal injury cases, by introducing legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (the Barrington report) and by promoting the introduction of safety audit arrangements by insurance companies.</P>

Surely that would be a complete picture to present to the House?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to Order 36 of the Rules of the Superior Court and his amendment which has been ruled out of order.  I can appreciate his concern. However, I can assure him that the Superior Court Rules Committee, which is empowered under courts legislation to make rules governing pleading practice and procedure generally in the Superior Court, including the power to fix venues for the sittings of the High Court, are aware of the need to revise the provisions of the rule in question following on the enactment of this Bill.  I understand they are reviewing the matter at present.  In these circumstances, a statutory provision would not be appropriate.  It would conflict with the present statutory powers of the Rules Committee and would, among other things, fix the venues in legislation so that any change that might be desirable could only be effected through amending legislation rather than by Rules of Court.  Since that matter is currently being reviewed by the Superior Court Rules Committee.  I trust the Deputy will be satisfied with my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I formally move our amendment.  Our amendment No. 1 to the Minister's amendment No. 1 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (3), third line, to delete <Col N="409" />&ldquo;consist only of&rdquo;, and substitute: &ldquo;comprises in whole or in part of a claim for&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the paragraph in the Minister's amendment in respect of claims for damages which arise out of false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person.  The wording of the Minister's amendment is that the claim should consist only of damages, whereas we are proposing that the words &ldquo;consist only of&rdquo; be deleted and be substituted by the words &ldquo;comprises in whole or in part of a claim for&rdquo;.  The reason for our amendment is that the small percentage of the writs issued and litigated before the court, but which are ultimately dealt with by way of hearing, often involve a multiplicity of claims and the wording of the Bill from the Minister's point of view is much too restrictive.  He suggests that the restrictive wording of the section arises out of a desire to avoid the multiplicity of claims in a writ so as to bring the ordinary car accident or other type of incident before a jury.  I anticipate that that will be the case in any event, that there will be skilful drafting of writs in areas other than those covered arising out of general accidents whether they happen on the road, in the workplace or at or in property.  I anticipate them being drafted in a way which would allow action be taken by jury at the election of the relevant lawyers or litigant.  I do not anticipate lawyers giving in very readily to the provisions of this Bill.  I anticipate that henceforth the ingenuity of our lawyers will be such as to get around the specific provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to amendment No. 1 proposed by The Workers' Party is in regard to the date of commencement of this Act.  The Minister contends that this must take place as and from 1 August next.  If our amendment is conceded he anticipates that jury action would continue for perhaps four years.  I believe he is absolutely wrong about that.  Even if it were to happen, would it not be much better that there be a phased approach to this rather than the absolute deadline suggested?  In any event will we not be <Col N="410" /> calling in jurors around the country for the purpose of hearing other allied actions, other types of actions, that would be entitled to juries as of right?  That is a point that has been missed absolutely in the course of this debate.  It will be incumbent on the registrars of the High Court, wherever it sits, to assemble jurors and juries for every sitting.  For example, who is to know what action might arise within the term of that court sitting that would be entitled to a jury trial, say, in cases of defamation of character, false imprisonment, personal accident and so on.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the working of this provision would present no pragmatic difficulty, recognising that the most important stage in litigation is when the decision is taken to issue the writ.  So many writs are currently in existence which have been issued on the basis of a decision taken by a litigant at the time, that it should be remembered that ultimately such a litigant will have the possibility of a trial by jury.  It is very unfair and grossly wrong for Government to intervene in the proceeding in being and say: we are now taking away a feature of the decision on which you initially launched your proceedings.  There is no doubt that many proceedings and cases are launched on the basis that a litigant will have the opportunity of a trial by jury, the benefit of having his or her case argued in front of his or her peers.</P>
    <P>We suggest that this be approached in a phased manner.  I have not heard any rejection on the part of the Minister of the percentage figure presented, that 0.2 per cent of all personal accident cases end up at hearing, so that one will realise we are talking about a miniscule number of actions requiring recourse to the facility of a jury hearing should this amendment be acceded to.  Nonetheless it constitutes a recognition of the rights, the factors obtaining at the time a litigant started proceedings, ensuring that those same conditions would obtain at the end.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the third amendment in the name of The Workers' Party is consequential on the second, in that it involves the deletion of subsection (6).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> I have found the Minister's response to each one of the amendments exceptionally disappointing.  With the Minister coming in advocating a complete and utter change of heart on the part of the Government on the principles involved, one might have expected some concession by the same Government with regard to some of the more practical approaches being advocated by Deputies in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I want to address some of the more general points surrounding the Minister's amendment, that is the need to abolish juries in the first place.  The single, greatest point advocated by the proponents of the abolition of the jury system in civil actions is that, in time, it will lead to a reduction in litigants' costs and, on the other, in the amount of the premium to be paid by persons seeking insurance cover.</P>
    <P>In regard to legal costs, Professor Bryan McMahon, in his booklet entitled <i>Judge or Jury?</i> published in 1985, in anticipation of this debate said:</P>
    <P>The jury trial of itself, i.e. the actual hearing, is not a really significant cost factor in causing high premiums.  Very few cases actually go to trial.  The shadow which the trial casts on the settlement arena, however, while difficult to fully assess, is a significant factor.</P>
    <P>In a footnote to that passage Professor McMahon indicated that it is estimated that 0.2 per cent only of all cases set down for hearing ever end up being heard. Many practitioners who know the workings of the courts also appreciate that cases that even commence at hearing rarely, if ever, see the end of the full deliberations.  Settlements are achieved within the first half hour, hour or two hours of hearings, often, if not invariably, before the first day of the hearing is over.</P>
    <P>The first point to be made is that the convening of a jury, embarking on a jury hearing, does not add substantially to the cost of litigation.  The fees are regulated on the basis of a one-day hearing &mdash;<Col N="412" /> known as a brief fee &mdash; without consideration being given to whether or not the case is settled on the door of the court or is embarked on in a hearing before the jury.</P>
    <P>In regard to insurance premiums, whether one accepts the argument advanced that jurors and juries lead to increased costs on the basis of irregular or excessive awards, there was not one piece of convincing evidence in anything the Minister said to indicate that the abolition of the jury, <i>per se,</i> would, in turn, reflect a reduction in premiums being sought by insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The point has been made here that in no way do Government control the levels at which insurance premiums are fixed.  If we have been talking in terms of reductions in premiums in recent years such discussion has not taken place in anticipation of anything contained in this Bill.  Rather it has taken place because of increased competition.  We should recognise the fact that for instance, the PMPA have got back on their financial feet.  It is remarkable that they have done so, that they have wiped out a deficit in excess of £53 million by increased efficiency, competitiveness in the market-place, without one day of juries having been abolished.  They did not need the abolition of the jury system to put their house in order, to get back into good, productive competition.  The Government cannot regulate or control premium levels within the insurance companies. Indeed, there has been no indication, beyond promises, that the insurance companies would respond.  The example has been cited of the 10 per cent reductions in premiums being levied on young drivers.  All of us have known over the years that the actual level of premium charged by insurance companies to young drivers was ridiculous, outrageous, way over the limit.  Therefore, it will be seen that the insurance companies are merely reducing their excessive margin of profit derived from the pockets of such young drivers; they have been doing nothing more than responding to community pressure.  That did not take place on <Col N="413" /> account of the provisions of this Bill. Rather did it come about because of the demonstrations, drives through the city, by young drivers on their motor cycles and the pressure of representations from politicians directly to the industry.  The insurance companies realised they could not get away with the daylight robbery they had carried out on young drivers over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that neither he, the Government nor anyone who has changed their minds on the matter since 1986 has made a case on why we should do without juries today.  In fact, I would argue in the opposite direction. The Minister highlighted a number of facts which developed in the interim period and which he said changed the horizon and the scenario and make it easy for him and the Government to change their minds.  He indicated that there is a court officers' Bill at an advanced stage of drafting.  One has to ask when that will see the light of day.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister's speech in 1986 did not mention pre-trial procedures as a matter of concern but that they are mentioned today.  There was a time when there were excessive delays in the listing of cases but it has to be recognised that actions, particularly in the High Court, now move at an exceptionally rapid pace.  There is no inordinate delay in getting to hearing on a civil action in the High Court in a list waiting for jury hearing.  In fact, if anything, practitioners are attempting to slow up and delay the setting down of actions because it takes so much time to investigate an injury or accident that lawyers are simply not geared to moving as quickly as the lists of the High Court demand them to move once an action is set down.</P>
    <P>The book of quantum damages has been referred to.  I cannot for one moment see how that will affect decisions on the level of damages any more than the decisions of the Supreme Court which were made in the period 1983-85 have had where the Supreme Court laid down very strong guidelines to the lower courts <Col N="414" /> on how to deal with the level of general damages to be awarded in accident cases.</P>
    <P>The Barrington Commission which dealt with procedures and safety at work was referred to.  The roadside surveys &mdash; and I think the Minister told us that the last survey was carried out in 1985 &mdash; indicated that then there was a 15 per cent evasion rate.  That has now been reduced to between 6 and 8 per cent.  This is a significant development.</P>
    <P>All of these aspects, if they have an impact to make on the issue, go towards the argument that what we should have had here today was a Second Stage debate so that all of these points could have been investigated and debated because all of them impinge on the principle of whether it is right to abolish juries in civil actions.  They go nowhere in justifying a decision made without explanation as to why the Government should change their minds on this matter.  The only point I can decipher from what the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has said is that promises have been made that premia will come down, that such promises were received by the Minister for Industry and Commerce sometime in the recent past and that there have been decipherable trends of downward movement in premium levels. Those promises are not worth the paper they are written on and I suggest that the downward trend is due to factors other than, and substantially other than, the legislation we are now dealing with.  I say to the Minister that he has not made any case which would warrant his massive change of heart on the issue.  If all these factors impinge on it the least we should have done was embark on a Second Stage debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>The point has to be made that there is no public demand for the abolition of juries.  The only demand for their abolition has come from within the insurance industry itself.  They have their own reasons for this but they have not fully explained or outlined them.  I do not believe those reasons stand up to any criticism.  The point has to be made that of the overall level of claims levelled against insurance companies, only 4 per <Col N="415" /> cent arise from actions taken by way of litigation in our courts for personal injury.  A very small percentage of the overall level of claims made against insurance companies start from claims originated in litigation and only 0.2 per cent of them ever threaten the doors of the High Court looking for a hearing before a jury.</P>
    <P>The juries are an essential part of the democratic process and of the democratisation of the law.  That is a fact that cannot be overlooked.  They are a means of giving the public and the community an opportunity of being involved and having a say in the running of our courts and the administration of justice.  I believe that that democratic feature is recognised by the exceptions written into the Bill and by the amendment from the Government, the exceptions in the area of a personal injury arising from a personal attack and false imprisonment.  I would love to know why the Government think it is important to have a jury in those cases but not to have a jury decide who was the cause of an accident either at work, on the road or wherever.  Juries provide a safeguard.  They are rarely sought in civil actions as a means of remedying an issue but they are incredibly important in terms of their being there and of a litigant knowing they are there and available to him or her should he or she be dissatisfied with what has been negotiated or settled on their behalf. They are a means of bringing the public into contact with the processes of the court and what goes on there.</P>
    <P>In that context I want to take the opportunity of referring to the unbelievable intervention of Deputy O'Malley this morning when he sought to cast insult on young people in particular who have come forward in huge numbers to assist the jury system in our civil and criminal courts.  The point has to be made that no court officers' association, none of the legal professions and indeed, looking at the survey of Professor McMahon, none of the judges who work in the courts demand that juries be abolished, sent home or done away with.  I have to make <Col N="416" /> the point again, because it is overlooked, that we are not relieving the courts of the necessity of having jurors attend and be available for the hearing of actions, be it in the High Court in Dublin or wherever, because there are many other actions running in the lists any day of the week that may or could require the presence of a jury.  I have found among the hundreds of thousands of people who come into our courts to attend hearings that, irrespective of their age, there is a huge enthusiasm for getting involved.  I have spoken primarily to people on the criminal side who have come out from jurors rooms and I have heard some of the greatest sense being applied to the decisions of the court cases taken.  I have listened to the inconsistencies and the level of debate in this House today, primarily from lawyers.  Perhaps we should be giving some serious consideration to the abolition of the legal professions rather than of juries when it comes to political debate.  What Deputy O'Malley says must be corrected by at least some of his colleagues in his party, and some of those members in his party who are much younger than he.  I would address Deputy Colley, recently appointed to the Front Bench of the party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the context of how to deal with legal affairs.  I hope that when she gets the opportunity to stand up here she at least will recognise the important development of the de Burca case, that was the case which, for the first time, brought in the right of women, unhindered and on an equal basis, to sit on our juries.  Their input into the working and administration of justice has been remarkable, and I hope the Deputy will make that point.  Irrespective of their age, it was a very good day of justice when women, as a result of the de Burca and Anderson case, were able to involve themselves in our jury system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we recognise the idea of a jury as our peers.  If we give decisions to our young people to vote the likes of Deputy O'Malley a Dáil Deputy <Col N="417" /> into this House, what right has he to turn around and say to these people, whom he with his party courted with all kinds of carnival and false promises to put him in here, in the course of this debate that they are ignorant, uneducated and incapable of understanding the &ldquo;noughts&rdquo; system?  I hope it is well noted and remarked by them when it comes to the next time Deputy O'Malley goes to the polls and looks to the 18 year olds to help put his party and the likes back here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Argument has been put before this House that juries are in some way inconsistent and unreliable.  I posit the question: does any of us know whatever goes on behind the doors in a jury's deliberations?  I believe that on the whole, whenever they come to decide issues they introduce an element of commonsense and community feeling and act as an important safeguard.  Where there have been excesses the right of appeal is written into our Constitution.  That has been readily availed of wholeheartedly by the insurance industry with increased costs or whatever is involved, and matters have been put in order by the courts by directives from the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>However, in any event, who is to know what is in the mind of a judge?  How many different considerations run through the head and mind of a judge sitting on the Bench alone?  How many little men and women are in his mind talking away to him when he is listening to the evidence trotted out in front of him as he attempts to make up his &mdash; or her &mdash; mind as to a figure and a decision?  Judges on their own or any one single person on his or her own deciding an issue is equally unpredictable and unreliable &mdash; if that is a word to be used in this context &mdash; as any 12 men and women assembled to sit on a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been well and truly taken to task for what he said during his contribution to the Bill in 1986.  I do not intend to go back over all that but I will make one point.  As a fellow constituent <Col N="418" /> representative I say that was one of the best speeches I have ever read.  I was amazed at the depth of the arguments put forward by Deputy Woods in 1986 in defence of the jury system.  I would like to take on board every point and argument he made then because they are equally, every one of them, relevant and applicable today.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated eight other areas where he felt action should and must be taken and I would support him in every one of those.   There were points of ending the two senior rule, appointing more judges to deal with the longer lists, raising court jurisdictions, an exceptionally important point in terms of the level of court jurisdictions at the moment, reducing medical costs which are outrageous in terms of the level of fees charged by doctors, controlling specialist fees in cases &mdash; again nobody could argue with the Minister on that &mdash; tackling uninsured drivers, cutting down on accidents and enforcing the laws of safety on roads and in the workplace. The final point he raised was reforming social welfare payments in the context of compensation awards.  I agree with all of those points and will support any legislation brought before this House to deal with them.  I support them particularly in the context of trying in some way to cut down on the cost of premiums to insured people and the cost of litigation to people who come before the courts to look for compensation.  Those are the practical points that will affect the levels of cost in both areas, and that was the view of the Minister then.  There is no evidence, good bad or indifferent, to show that the abolition of a jury in High Court civil actions will affect costs in either area substantially or at all.  That point has to be made very forcibly here today.</P>
    <P>This is not an unresearched issue. Deputy Spring in his intervention this morning referred to various reports of studies of the matter in this country and not one of them has proposed the abolition of juries in civil actions in the High Court.  He mentioned the third interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedures entitled <i>Jury Trial in <Col N="419" /> Civil Actions</i> issued in 1965, the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry in 1972 known as the O'Connor report and the report of inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance in 1982 known as the MacLiam report.  None of them advocated the abolition of juries in civil actions as they existed then.  The first one suggested it in regard to the Circuit Court and, as Deputy O'Malley indicated, that was undertaken in the 1971 Act.</P>
    <P>England was referred to as an example and the matter has been looked at in the report entitled, Civil Jury Trial in Scotland commissioned as far back as 1959 which recommended the retention of juries there.  They have been retained and are considered to be more conservative in their awards than judges alone sitting in the other part of Great Britain, England.  The Committee on Supreme Court on Judicature of Northern Ireland, who reported in 1970, again recommended the retention of jury trials there as they exist.  Finally, as was pointed out, the Pearson report on jury trials in civil cases dealt with the matter in Great Britain and it is an elective opportunity still there to be called upon if necessary.  Therefore, this is not a subject that has not been researched or gone into.  People studied it and have come to the conclusion that juries should be retained.  The only people who said otherwise were Fine Gael and Labour, when they were in Government in 1986, and the insurance industry.  The regrettable thing is that Fianna Fáil are now adopting their arguments.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the position of Fine Gael.  Deputy Barrett, in his vain attempt to make an Opposition intervention, pleads for the ordinary man and says that he must be looked after.  What about the position of ordinary men and women who are now denied the opportunity of sitting on juries and being involved in the democratic elements of our court procedures? Have they given consideration to that?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats advance their case on the basis that the system is <Col N="420" /> in some way strange and more appropriate to the 18th and 19th centuries. Does Deputy Desmond O'Malley consider that a jury in a criminal trial is strange and more applicable to the 18th and 19th centuries?  It would be interesting to recall his intervention as Minister &mdash; and that of a Member of this House &mdash; when the Special Criminal Court was introduced, consisting only of three judges.  I have already remarked on the points he made about young people and his suggestion that they had trouble with actuarial evidence.  That is rubbish in the extreme.  &ldquo;Actuarial&rdquo; is a fancy word but it comes down to what any young person can appreciate and understand, their future life expectancy and what they would hope to gain if they were in useful employment.  That is translated into common language with great ease from the reports and by the people who present them.  He also bemoaned the de Burca decision as he considered it opened up juries to people other than men of property.  He regrets that people with no wealth are able to have a say in what goes on in our court system.  By definition, he also regretted the arrival of women on our juries.</P>
    <P>The Government should withdraw this Bill in the light of the interventions and comments made.  The procedure is exceptionally tortuous and complicated and we should look afresh at the whole matter. This was the plea made by Fianna Fáil in 1986 to the Government, and indeed members of the Fine Gael Party also made this plea.  The Labour Party also wanted the matter to be looked at afresh and the Bill to be withdrawn.  Certainly, if we are to invade the premise of the jury, at least we should do it in a good, comprehensive package.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's comments that a Bill dealing with the courts and court officers is at an advanced stage.  Perhaps, in the context of that Bill, we should look afresh at this matter.  It would be a way of dealing with litigation and insurance costs.  We should not abolish juries as they are an important feature of the court system.  However, if we do, it must be on a fair and reasonable trade and that is not <Col N="421" /> what is being offered today.  I regret that we will abolish a very important phenomenon and that we intend to replace it with nothing concrete in terms of delivery or a reduction in litigation or insurance costs to the general public.  We will all regret this in due course.</P>

      <P>I do not want to dig deeper holes for myself to fall into.  The jury system is a good one, it serves the democratic system well and the judicial system will be badly served by the removal of juries in civil actions.  That has always been my view and it remains so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the process of this long, ongoing debate, there has been much criticism of the Bar and the Law Library in particular. I am a member of that honourable profession. I have been a barrister for 25 years and I have practised effectively for about 12 of them.  I should like to pay tribute to the Bar and the people there with whom I have been associating over that long period.  A lot of the criticism has been based on misinformation and indeed no information and on a lack of knowledge of how the Bar and the Law Library work.  The people who are mainly responsible for that are the law librarians themselves, the barristers.  They have not defended themselves against attack from the outside by people who do not understand how the profession work and who do not appreciate the type of work they <Col N="422" /> do in the interests of the ordinary man or woman.</P>
    <P>The Bar do not need me to defend them but maybe one of the main reasons for being confronted with this Bill and the fact that their views did not obviously sit well where it matters lies with people like myself.   I take collective responsibility for what is happening in the Dáil in respect of the legal profession.   I make no apology for being one of the so-called &ldquo;two jobbers&rdquo;.  I work extremely hard and I can serve two masters well.  I certainly do not think my constituents have suffered as a result of my involvement as a barrister, albeit sometimes on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The Bar is a decent place and the people who practise there are decent people.  They are not out to do down any organisations or individuals.  They are there to help and to make a living.  What is wrong with wanting to make a living at the Bar?  I intend to be brief in my contribution because I do not want to burden the House with my views once more on this subject.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Judiciary when I say that in some cases heard before a judge sitting alone the plaintiff has not done very well. There have been cases where plaintiffs have not done well before juries.  At this stage I should like to pay tribute to young people who serve democracy well by serving on juries.  Many young juries have awarded people the proper sum of money for the injuries plaintiffs have suffered.  I am in a rather invidious position in regard to this in that I have what could be described as an insurance practice.  It may not serve me well to express my views, which are contrary to those of the Federation of Insurers who support the measure. However, that does not worry me because, having worked with insurance companies for many years, I know that those involved are people of the highest integrity.  They do not have any problem with my views on the Bill and I do not have any problem with theirs.  They are entitled to hold their opinion, but I do not agree with those views.</P>
    <P>Democracy has been well served by the jury system in civil cases and it will <Col N="423" /> suffer by the abolition of juries.  I do not agree with the view of those in the insurance industry that the abolition of juries will lead to a reduction in premia, but after a year or two I may be proved wrong.  If that happens I will say so.  I would be failing in my duty as a public representative, and barrister, if I did not identify my special interest in the Bill, which is that we should retain juries in civil actions.  In time we will find out if the Bill was wise and whether costs will be considerably reduced with the abolition of juries.  I do not think so, but the insurance companies have stated that there will be certain reductions as a direct result of the introduction by the Government of the Bill.  Therefore, the ones to benefit will be those who pay car insurance.  They should be our main, but not our only, consideration, because there are many strands interwoven in the context of what the Bill seeks to achieve. Consistency can be seen to be an act of foolishness in politics and, if that is the case, I am guilty of that act of foolishness. It might also be considered to be an act of foolishness to make one's views known from the Government back-benches. However, I am anxious to place on record my support for the retention of juries in civil actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should declare an interest and it is that, like Deputy David Andrews, I am a barrister. However, I should also declare the limits of my interest.  Over the years I found myself involved in only a small number of jury actions and I think I can bring some objectivity to bear on this. The procedure we are following today is a most curious one.  In the ordinary course of events any Bill when published is presented to us for a Second Stage debate.   On that Stage we debate the principle of the measure, we form a view and if our view is that that principle is desirable the Bill goes on for discussion on Committee Stage, when Members probe the details of the legislation, section by section, line by line.  That has not happened here.  There has been in <Col N="424" /> this Dáil session no Second Stage debate. Of course, it is the case that our Standing Orders provide for a carryover of legislation from one Dáil to another, but what has happened here is something very far from ordinary in two respects.  First, it is far from ordinary in that the Government, who are now sponsoring the legislation, opposed it vigorously when in Opposition.  That is peculiar.</P>
      <P>It is peculiar also that the measure which is to be taken up on Committee Stage is a Bill that is radically different from that which secured the approval of the House to its Second Stage during the life of the last Dáil.  On those grounds this is a most peculiar way to do business. To add to that we have the fact that the hapless Minister for Social Welfare finds himself sitting in on this debate in the absence of the Minister for Justice.  We were told earlier that the Minister for Justice was attending a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference today and none of us would wish that he would be anywhere else &mdash; if we have any complaint it is that there have not been enough meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference &mdash; but we wonder about the way in which the business of the Dáil is ordered, a subject which is within the control of the Government.  As I understand it, the Minister for Justice is accompanied at that meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference by the Minister for Energy and Communications.  Deputy Ray Burke, who is standing in for the Tánaiste.  I also understand that listed for debate today, as a back-up to this measure, was the ESB Bill but that it was withdrawn from the Order Paper because the Minister for Energy and Communications would not be available, given his obligations at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference. I wonder why the same procedure could not have been followed in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those complaints of procedure are not nit-picking, because it is not a case where a Bill that had been all but debated, and was dealing with something like the borrowing powers of a particular company, is taken up where we left off.  What is involved represents a very fundamental change in the way in which we administer <Col N="425" /> justice.  This involves very fundamental changes in the rights that people heretofore enjoyed.  I should like to remind the House, so that there will not be any confusion, that the Bill in its original form was introduced by Fine Gael when in Government.  The decision that juries should cease to operate in personal injury cases was taken after a degree of soul-searching and debate.  It was no secret then that I was not enthusiastic about the measure and it is no secret now that I am not enthusiastic about the proposal to eliminate juries.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if there was a free vote on this measure I can say with absolute confidence that Deputy David Andrews and myself would be in the lobbies together opposing the abolition of juries and in support of the individual against the institution, which, essentially, is what the debate is all about.  However, in saying that I have serious doubts about the wisdom of abolishing juries I should like to say that my concerns are not for the practitioners or the legal profession but for our system of justice.  More particularly, my concern is for the way in which our system of justice is regarded and perceived.</P>
    <P>I happen to believe, and it is probably a minority view within the legal profession, that the jury system as it has operated has been bad for the Bar because it has tended to concentrate influence and prestige in the profession within a very limited circle.  It has been bad for the Bar because it has diverted some of the finest talents at the Bar into that area of work rather than into areas of work that in some instances might have been of greater value to the community.  I do not think the Bar will lose out in all of this, but rather the way in which our legal system is regarded.</P>
    <P>Our legal system is already regarded as being somewhat insular, somewhat remote from the concerns of the average citizen and somewhat sluggish in its response to these concerns.  To a quite unusual extent our legal system offers only the most limited opportunity for participation by the layman.  Other legal systems have opportunities for lay <Col N="426" /> involvement.  In some cases lay assessors assist a judge; in the case of our nearest neighbour magistrates, who are lay people, hear the great majority of cases that come before their legal system.  We have no such opportunity.  The only opportunity for lay people to be involved in the legal system is by serving as jurors in the criminal or civil courts.  I do not want to pretend that the individual juror who receives a summons in the post regards this as a great honour and feels he is doing his bit by democracy.  In most cases I am sure they regard it as a dreadful nuisance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that. Of course they regard it as an inconvenience. Those who do turn up deserve our praise and congratulations and should not be abused and villified as they were this morning by the Leader of the Progressive Democrats.  Their presence ensures a degree of public confidence in what happens.  It ensures that it is not a question of a small club of people, overwhelmingly male and from the same social background, making decisions about how people's lives are to be.  The presence of those who answer the summons ensures that people have some confidence that their peers will have a say in what may be one of the most important decisions affecting their lives.</P>
      <P>It strikes me as curious that some of the most impassioned debates we have had in the past couple of Dáil sessions have related to judicial decisions.  We have had impassioned debates on an all-party basis in which we have expressed concerns about inconsistencies by judges on sentencing policy.  Despite the fact that there has been that degree of concern and consensus, there is apparently a belief that no similar problems would arise were judges to be allowed to exercise their function alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ours is a very small and very intimate society in which people who find themselves in courts all know each other.  They mix socially, they come from similar backgrounds.  They live in the same areas <Col N="427" /> and they probably went to the same schools.  A person finding himself in that system is entitled to the reassurance that it is not just a club from which he is to be excluded.  A person finding himself before the courts is entitled to be reassured by the presence of his contemporaries and people from a similar background to himself that this is not an alien environment.  The abolition of juries will reduce that sense of security and result in a diminution of confidence in getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>I would pose a couple of possibilities. Let us suppose a case is brought against a Member of this House, perhaps somebody who has served as Minister for Justice, arising from an industrial accident at a factory owned by him.  The plaintiff who comes before the court would feel more comfortable in a situation where a decision on liability in that case would be in the hands of 12 people drawn at random rather than in the hands of the judge whose appointment was perhaps the responsibility of the defendant as Minister for Justice.  I am not saying that any judge would be influenced.  I absolutely believe he would not, but it is fundamental that not only should there not be any influence brought to bear but that people should know and be confident that there would be no undue influence.</P>
    <P>Let me put another possibility.  Suppose there is an action arising out of a claim for medical negligence.  A person may go into hospital and if some error is made in the surgery performed he may decide to bring an action against one of the leading surgeons in this city.  In the absence of a jury that case will be decided by a judge who almost certainly will have known that surgeon for years.  He will have been with him and against him in personal injury cases and will have had the surgeon appearing as a witness before him subsequent to his elevation to the bench.  The case will be argued before the judge by barristers, all of whom will know the surgeon.  If the judge takes the view that there was no negligence and the plaintiff is sent home without compensation for his injuries, would it be <Col N="428" /> anything other than human nature for the aggrieved plaintiff to feel that he was an outsider from the beginning, that everybody else seemed to know each other and that he was the only one perceived to be a stranger in their cosy world?  I have not the slightest doubt that no judge would allow the fact that he knew the defendant in such a case, either personally or by reputation, to influence him; but again it is a case where perception is important. What we would be doing in regard to perception would be seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, given the degree of debate there has been about the extent to which we make our legal system amenable to public scrutiny, the extent to which, for example, the DPP is accountable or not accountable for decisions made by him and the controversy in this House in relation to individual judicial decisions, that there should be such a consensus on the removal of what I regard as an important safeguard.</P>
    <P>The argument in support of changing the jury system is that this will involve lower costs for litigants and, indirectly and consequently, lower insurance costs. The rationale behind that argument is that the abolition of juries will mean greater certainty.  There is also an expectation that awards would as a result be lower.</P>
    <P>Let us consider those two issues.  What evidence is there that there would be a greater uniformity of approach by judges sitting alone and therefore a great certainty of expectation as to what the outcome is going to be?  I have already commented that it is a matter that has been publicly debated in this House, that there are substantial divergences of practice when it comes to imposing sentence. In the civil area also, what evidence has there been that individual judges would all adopt a common position?  Let us look at what happens in the Circuit Court. There, the court is confined by the upper limit of £15,000 so that the parameters within which a judge could, as it were, stray up or down from the norm are very sharply confined.  Notwithstanding that, anybody who practises in the courts will tell you that there is an extremely wide <Col N="429" /> divergence in the approach taken by different Circuit Court judges.  There are Circuit Court judges who are widely regarded as being very much on the generous side and there are Circuit Court judges who are notorious for the very conservative approach they adopt when coming to assess damages.  That is in a situation where the parameters are restrained, where the opportunity to diverge from the norm is limited.</P>
    <P>Who is to say that it will be in any way different when judges are at large?  Who believes that it will be different?  Do the insurance companies believe it?  If they do, why do they conduct themselves in the manner in which they now do?  It is a very frequent occurrence that a case will come on, perhaps late in the day after the jury panel has gone home, or there may be other reasons that arise, where the question of proceeding without a jury is on offer to the parties.  If there were substance in the case that has been made out on behalf of the insurance industry, one would expect that what would happen would be that plaintiffs would say that they could not proceed with the judge alone, that they would not touch that suggestion with a barge pole and insurance companies would be pressing on to have the case heard by a judge alone.  But that is not what happens.  Day in, day out, insurance companies' defendants decline to proceed, decline to allow the case to go ahead with a judge alone, and why?  There are a couple of reasons. The first is because they have formed the view that the award is likely to be as great, or greater, and second, they have formed an assessment of the likely tendencies of that particular judge who would be hearing the case, whether on the conservative side or the generous side when it comes to assessing damages.  They clearly do not believe that all the judges will be the same, that all will tend to reduce jury awards.</P>
    <P>I commented that it is a curious situation &mdash; and others have also commented on it &mdash; that the Bill is being piloted through the Dáil by the Deputy who, in Opposition, was the spokesman for Fianna Fáil in opposing this measure. <Col N="430" /> One would have thought that given the radical change of heart that there has been a great deal of evidence would be adduced to explain to the satisfaction of the House why this conversion took place and, no doubt, to bring those of us who would be still dubious on side.  Where has been the carefully argued case for change?  I shall not go back over the territory that Deputy Taylor went over at such length this morning, but what about the various alternative suggestions of allowing the judge to guide in relation to general damages and all the other suggestions? Why are we not being told what views were formed on each of those proposals as outlined by the now Minister in his speech of May 1986?  Surely we are entitled to know that much.</P>
    <P>Again, we are told that there is an expectation that awards will be lower and ultimately that insurance costs will be lower.  One might have thought that the Minister, in those circumstances, would have come in with some analysis of comparable awards in different jurisdictions. One might have thought, for example, however much it might have offended Deputy Kelly if he did so, that the Minister might look to our nearest neighbour and tell us how awards in this jurisdiction with juries compare, by and large, with Britain without juries.  My understanding is that whereas, historically, awards in England were very much lower than here, that divergence was explained by the fact that they were much more restrictive in the instances in which they admitted actuarial evidence, that they have changed their practice and the result is that in many classes of cases awards in Britain are now higher than they are here. I would be interested to know what sort of information the Minister has on that.</P>
    <P>Again, for very many years juries have continued in Northern Ireland.  As I understand it, that has been the subject of quite recent change there.  Could we be told what the results of that change have been?  What have been the results in terms of the size of awards, in terms of costs to litigants and what, if any, have been the results in terms of the benefits that flow down to the driver and to the <Col N="431" /> employer paying his insurance policy? Surely we are entitled to have that sort of information by way of explanation for what is really a quite extraordinary change of mind.  There is also a belief, which was most evident in Deputy O'Malley's contribution, that truly the jurors are only laymen or, indeed, as that Deputy suggested, they are only young and uneducated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider that, both in terms of a possible decision in relation to liability and in terms of a possible decision relating to the amount of compensation to be awarded.  Let us suppose that what is at issue is the way in which a factory is being run, whether it was reasonable to offer protective clothing, or whatever.  Whom would you regard as more suitable to express an opinion on that &mdash; a judge who, as a matter of overwhelming probability, has never set foot inside a factory in his life unless he came from a political background, was previously a candidate for election and did the odd tour while campaigning but other than that is most <Col N="432" /> unlikely ever to have set foot in a factory and most certainly never worked in one, or a jury of 12 people who, on the law of averages, would include a number of people with practical experience of the world of work?  Who could be expected to make the most reasoned and informed decision in that case?  It seems that by widening the area of experience that can be brought to bear on the decision-making process one improves the prospect of getting a good decision.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose then that it is a question of how much to award by way of compensation and that it is a case of an 18 or 19 year old girl who has been seriously scarred.  What is it about the judge's training or his background that makes him more appropriate to try to put a monetary value on what is required to compensate that unfortunate girl?  It seems that you are more likely to get a real view of how society would regard that scar and would wish to see it compensated from a randomly selected group of people who come together from very different backgrounds and bring their different experiences to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the Government now support the abolition of juries.  It is clear the the Progressive Democrats do so and that Fine Gael do so.  So, we must be realistic, and the reality is that juries will not be with us for very much longer. There remains the question of whether or not juries should go in all circumstances or whether some discretionary mechanism should be available to allow for juries in particular cases where it is regarded as particularly appropriate.  I strongly believe that such a mechanism is required in certain cases, perhaps because the gravity of the injuries or the nature of the incident is such that it would be regarded as appropriate to bring in outsiders to have a look.  The classic example is the professional negligence case.  The House should give considerable thought to including such a scheme so that in such a case there is an opportunity to apply to the court to seek the privilege in that instance of a jury <Col N="433" /> trial.  We can talk about the mechanics of it at some other time.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the other sections as I understand that this is a Committee Stage debate, although it is an unusual Committee Stage debate.  I hope that the Minister will not just continue to refer back to his brief and say that all has changed in two years, that we now have assurances from the insurance industry and that everything will be fine.  I hope the Minister will address the serious concerns that a numbers of Members of the House have and which he himself recently had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a most peculiar situation, being the first speaker for some time in this House actually speaking in support of his or her party's position. Consistency awards around here have to go to the Progressive Democrats alone in the House.</P>
      <P>I support this Bill.  I was not a Member of the House when the Second Stage debate was taken.  I am aware that the Bill has changed substantially since then and I am also aware that the other curious aspect of this debate is that it resembles a Second Stage debate much more than a Committee Stage debate.  I can only assume that the reason a debate akin to a Second Stage debate is necessary is because there are such substantial changes and that the two Stages are being rolled into one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation regarding jury trials in personal injuries cases has over the last number of years got out of hand and that is why action was taken some two years ago, although inexplicably it was not continued. The amendments which the Minister has tabled are worthy and in general reflect a closing of loopholes that might have existed had the initial Bill gone forward. We have to have regard to why the system of trial by jury for personal injuries cases got out of hand.  It comes down to one word and that is &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo;. The inconsistency of outcome and award under this system led to many things.  First, there was the incentive to go to trial.  There was the incentive that if one took a chance it might well pay off. <Col N="434" /> It was worth taking a gamble and many people did.  It is well known that most juries take the plaintiff's side in a personal injuries case.  Most juries are sympathetic to the plaintiff and therefore it is worth taking a chance that not alone would the facts be found to be in favour of the plaintiff but also that the award would be substantial and it would be worth one's while to go to court.</P>
    <P>The existence of jury trials has also had an effect on the numbers of witnesses who have been called in each trial.  The numbers of witnesses trotted in and out, and who have to sit in waiting rooms for hours or days, were not necessary to the proper operation of democracy, as has been referred to here, or to the judicial system.  It was a waste of time and money and it is misleading for plaintiffs to feel that this is in fact serving the course of justice.  The numbers of counsel who have been employed and the list system used by the courts stem directly from the fact that there is this inconsistency in that people do not know what will happen or how long a case will last.  They do not know whether the case will suddenly be settled for a smaller or a larger sum than originally offered, so they must put this team of counsel in.  Everybody double books on the cases they have on hand and the system is running round in circles.</P>
    <P>If we remove the use of juries in these cases it will discourage plaintiffs from pursuing cases to the bitter end and going into court.  That will reduce the number of cases involved and if the number of cases are reduced there is no further necessity for teams of counsel to be standing by because the list is reduced.  Alongside that, I see the Minister's amendment relating to the proof of costs in relation to the number of counsel in any case going part and parcel with the removal of juries, because the jury system has had the effect of increasing the necessity for the numbers of counsel.  I am not blaming the barristers who operate this system. The system is appallingly stupid, to say the least.  It has been left there to rot for many years, everybody knowing that there is some basic problem with it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said this morning <Col N="435" /> in his contribution, this idea was mooted by him in the early seventies when he was Minister for Justice.  It was pooh-poohed at that stage and he had to wait another 17 years to find it actually coming on the stocks.  Because of the jury system the length of a trial has been extended.  We certainly can expect that because a jury is being used the facts in the case must be clearly and pointedly displayed to the jury in layman's language and no short cuts can be taken in terms of using professional or technical language.  That must contribute to the length of every trial that goes before a jury.  The amounts of the awards that have emanated from juries has been quite astonishing in many instances.  Various Deputies in this House who have contributed, and indicated that they do not know of any call on the part of the public to abolish juries, must have their ears closed, because there is no doubt that many members of the public are calling for juries to be abolished because they see that the whole situation has got out of hand and that it stems from the fact that lay men and women sitting on a jury are not able to come to the kind of conclusions that are reasonable in these cases.</P>
    <P>I am not going to allow myself to be led down the road which other people assume Deputy O'Malley went down and blame juries for this.  During the years we have had a system of jury trials which have led to an abuse of the legal system. Plaintiffs have been encouraged to go right to the end of the road and into court no matter what.  I am aware of cases in respect of whiplash injuries where the plaintiff has been encouraged to pursue his case right until the end and into the High Court because by doing so he may get a better deal.  I do not think that that serves the system well.  As a result the system has become clogged up.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I picked the wrong injury, but what I am saying is there is no doubt people are being <Col N="436" /> encouraged to push their cases right up until the end because the jury system is unpredictable.  Juries are not to blame for this.  Plaintiffs and insurance companies are on a merry-go-round and they simply cannot get off without a change in the system.  That is why I welcome this Bill. It will lead to a change in the system.</P>
      <P>The legal costs involved are exorbitant. I am not confining these to the barristers' costs; I am also instancing the solicitors' costs and medical witness fees.  I believe the fees charged by GPs right up to consultants are exorbitant.  There is also the waste of time aspect, in that if a consultant or some technical expert is called to court and has to wait for hours or days to be called, it will cost them money. These costs are unnecessary.  We have an antiquated system.  Other legal systems have managed to move away from this arrangement and still have satisfactory systems where people agree to have recourse to the law.  I do not believe it is beyond our capabilities to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that high insurance premiums are in part due to this kind of system.  I am not saying that this Bill will be the panacea for all of the ills relating to insurance premiums.  However, I think we will find there will be an alleviation of the problem.  I am well aware that the insurance industry up until fairly recently made the case very strongly that insurance premiums will be reduced if juries were abolished in personal injury cases.  They are now pulling back from that position.  It will be necessary to say to them very strongly that they will have to get their act together and put their house in order and that we will have to see the results of this both in economic terms, that is in the size of the premium, and in efficiency terms.  A strong case could be made for an investigation into the insurance industry <i>per se</i> in order to see how it operates.  This should happen very soon, bearing in mind the 1992 deadline, when I hope we will not find ourselves bailing out insurance companies who did not gear themselves for that deadline.  In that context we should say to the insurance companies that we are going to keep an eye on them.  There is <Col N="437" /> nothing to stop us in three to five years' time, if we feel we have been totally hoodwinked and that this had no effect, introducing a Bill to bring juries back.  I do not think that will happen but rather that we will see a reduction in costs, even though I do not know whether we will see a reduction in premiums.</P>
    <P>Issue should be taken on the view that the ordinary person in the street is not going to get a fair crack of the whip in terms of his right of access to the court and to a jury trial.  I do not think that will be the case as he would still have a right to a trial under this Bill.  Constitutional cases are heard before a judge.  They are not put in front of juries.  The De Burca case has been referred to.  I am not going to say that juries hold a monopoly of wisdom as regards the man or woman in the street.  I do not know how a person can get to be a judge without knowing, whether from his practice at the Bar or, simply, life, what is going on in general.</P>

      <P>There is a gap in the legislation because no guidance is being given to a judge as to what amounts should be awarded, and that would have to be seen as a necessary reform in the system.  If no guidance is given we will be back into this House complaining about the different awards which have been handed down by judges.  There is no doubt that we need some kind of book of quantum damages. Such a book exists in other countries and its existence here should lead to consistency so that people would realise what <Col N="438" /> they could expect to receive in respect of given injuries.</P>
      <P>There should be certainty in the law. One of the basic tenets in the administration of justice should be certainty. As I said at the outset, inconsistency and uncertainty have bedevilled this whole area.  Therefore, I think there should be some type of book of quantum damages. Nevertheless, I am not saying that it should necessarily come from the Department of Justice but that it could be drawn up in conjunction with judges or the Insurance Federation.  It would state the average award granted in respect of certain types of injuries over a certain period.</P>
      <P>There was reference earlier to the fact that there has been some research into what are the problems in the system, but I have to say that a fair amount of the research referred to dealt with the views of the legal profession on this area.  I submit that they have a vested interest in maintaining the system, despite Deputy Birmingham's very persuasive pleas on behalf of justice itself and access to it.  I do not think he was persuasive enough. The vested interests, who feel that there will be a reduction in the amount of work available if this Bill goes through, should not hold sway on this issue.  There will be fewer court appearances and fewer counsel will be required to appear in those cases.  There is no doubt that less work will be available and my commiserations go to those at the Bar, as I understand it is a very difficult profession in which to make one's mark because of the numbers involved.  However, that is not a good reason for sticking with the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words regarding other Deputies' remarks on what Deputy O'Malley has said on jurors and their role in the system.  If one reads the Official Report it will become very evident that what Deputy O'Malley was speaking about was the jurors' difficulties in coming to terms with a system which has run away with itself and a system which has become convoluted with technical information, professional evidence <Col N="439" /> and professionals conflicting in their evidence, sometimes on minute points.</P>
    <P>It is not, as has been indicated here today, almost always on ordinary points of everyday occurrences.  They are not the difficult areas which juries encounter. The difficult area is where a jury has to decide which professional witness is the one who is correct.  I support what Deputy O'Malley said, that we could not and should not expect jurors of whatever educational standard, age or sex to have the same kind of professional capabilities and understanding that professional witnessess have.  On the other hand, in a system where the judge makes the decision, that judge has come through the system of presenting this type of evidence and of examining professional witnesses for many years &mdash; a High Court judge must have been practicing at least 12 years before being appointed.  It is not fair to jurors to expect them to be able to decipher this type of evidence and come up with a reasoned decision.  I am leaving aside for the present the amount of awards that should be made.  I am talking about decisions on questions of fact.</P>
    <P>I reject entirely the gloss that is being put on Deputy O'Malley's remarks.  He was expressing sympathy with jurors who are put in that situation.  He was castigating the system which has, as I have said, got out of hand.  He was reflecting on the trend in the conduct of these cases, the fact that they have become something of a gravy train which is moving along at a rapid pace and the jurors are byproducts. The real protagonists are the legal profession and the insurance companies. As far as I can see, they are out to blind one another with science and the jurors are caught in the middle.  That is a trend that has become established in fairly recent years.  I know the jury system is an ancient one, well regarded and historic but in recent years it has got out of hand and it is not right, democratic nor good for the administration of justice to allow it to continue in that vein.</P>
    <P>Much was made of the fact that there <Col N="440" /> are judges who are favourable to plaintiffs and those who are more interested in a conservative type judgement and that there are occasions when a plaintiff may feel that he or she should have got a greater award than he or she got.  One has to counter that with the acknowledged existence of many awards above what is reasonably expected to be given by juries. The scandal has been perpetrated by the ever-increasing amounts awarded by juries in this system.  The area has got out of hand.  In every system of justice there will be foibles and difficulties and we should do our best to iron them out but the balance here has to be seen to be in favour of abolishing juries as opposed to retaining them.</P>
    <P>I realise that I have made something akin to a Second Stage speech and I apologise for that but I was not here on the other occasion.  The Minister's amendments are reasonable and not to have brought them in would have led to difficulties in the implementation of the legislation.  I understand what the Minister has said regarding Deputy O'Malley's and my amendment and I take it that this is being dealt with in another forum.</P>

      <P>I will not strike a disagreeable or disobliging note by saying that I could not help noticing two strictly political dimensions to the debate this afternoon, one provided by Deputy Woods, the Minister, and the other by Deputy McCartan.  I know that Deputy Woods made a speech 180 degrees contrary to what he has been saying here today when the substance of this measure was before the House in the last Dáil.  Of course every Fianna Fáil Deputy has to win his spurs &mdash; I am mixing my metaphors &mdash; as a brass neck and Deputy Woods, by his performance here today, has shown himself to be well up in the Lenihan class where that is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very proud to be associated with Deputy Brian Lenihan at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>So would I, not perhaps for <Col N="441" /> that characteristic but for others such as his lack of bitterness and his good humour, most of all but, certainly, his brass neck is of a 22 carat grade.  The Minister here today must be assaying well over the 20 carat grade at least to judge by his performance.  If the Whip had said to a more sensitive man: &ldquo;Somebody has to move this Bill because other Ministers are out of the way; the Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot meet Tom King and therefore we have to send the two stock political plug uglys that they use for that purpose to substitute for him and we would like you to deal with this Bill&rdquo; he might have said: &ldquo;There are after all 15 members of the Government and I am only one of them.  I differ from the other 14 members in that I went out in front in opposing the measure you want me to promote in the House today&rdquo;.  He might have expected from a sensitive Whip the response: &ldquo;I had forgotten that; naturally we will find someone else, we would not wish to embarrass you by obliging you to say today that something is black which you said two years ago was white.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There has been much talk here this afternoon about the judicial and the legal world.  I will say this for the judicial arm of the State &mdash; naturally it consists of men and women made of flesh and blood like the rest of us &mdash; of the three arms of the State, Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, it is the one which has sunk least low in public esteem.  I do not believe it has sunk in public esteem at all. It is easy to say, when a case appears on the front page, high on the headlines, that a judge has made a fool of himself, that he has not sentenced somebody to a term long enough, that he has let somebody off that should not have been let off or that he has on the other hand been too severe or has misconducted himself through foolishness or misunderstanding in some way or other.  That is easily said but by and large I do not think incompetence or lack of conscience has ever been imputed to the Irish Judiciary.  I believe that when you make a man independent there is a very good chance that he is going to behave independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say about the Judiciary <Col N="442" /> I say with total sincerity and I wish to make it clear that that goes for people appointed by all Governments.  The Judiciary have come out of the last 60 or 65 years of this State with more credit and with less criticism than either this House or the various Governments that it has supported.  I know that at moments when one feels like throwing an easy punch at something which cannot defend itself and which is not in the business of defending itself, it is easy to sneer at the benches, the gowns and the wigs, but when all these petty objections and resentments are disposed of, that branch of our State has delivered a service over the last 65 years, with all the failings that may be admitted to it, which ranks in the public esteem far above the service provided by this House or by the Governments, in other words, the Executive which it supports, let alone the various arms of the Executive.  I am speaking about their political dimensions and not their official dimensions.</P>
    <P>There is some sort of resentment of the legal profession in the judicial dimension and in the dimension of those who practice in the courts, which centers on things like the wigs and the gowns, the formalities, the outmoded forms of address, the language used in addressing a judge and so on.  I sometimes hear people ask why cannot they all dress in suits like the rest of us, and not be intimidating plaintiffs, defendants and witnesses.  I would be willing to defend the system to the last detail, not so much because it is as it is but because it is formal.  There is a lot to be said for formality in court proceedings.  It is not intended to, and it ought not to, intimidate people but if it does over-awe them, if it induces in them a certain reverence and a certain disposition to think twice before telling a lie, that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of history that our judges and barristers wear a particular kind of outfit &mdash; I do not attach any special importance to that &mdash; but that there should be some kind of formality, most easily induced by dress and forms of speech, is entirely right.  I know that point of view would be greeted with derision <Col N="443" /> by virtually every audience in this country &mdash; and probably would be by my colleagues and friends in this House were it not for the rules of decorum &mdash; but I believe that is a very important reason why justice here has been well administered.</P>
    <P>I practised for some years in the courts. I have no doubt it is no worse here than any other country, but many people, but not all litigants or witnesses, are inclined to tell lies even on oath.  Everyone who has practised, even for a very short period &mdash; and I was there for five or six years &mdash; knows people are inclined, not perhaps wittingly, to tell lies.  The side they are on somewhat distorts their recollections of an event or their appraisal of a situation. Any dimension of formality, even of over-awing, in a court procedure which tends to induce caution, a realisation in people that they are in something more serious than a conversation in a private house or in a public house, is to the good.</P>
    <P>It is said the legal profession is a closed shop &mdash; whatever that means.  To me it appears the profession is as open as any profession can be that applies minimal rules in regard to competence and which is geared and run for the benefit of its members at the public's expense.  I am not in practice now nor have I been for a number of years, and I do not know if I ever shall be again, but I never felt like that about the legal profession.  I have no axe to grind now and I do not expect, in the foreseeable future to be in practice, but in my years at the Bar I was never conscious that it was a conspiracy against the public.  On the contrary, I always felt the public got a very good service.  In particular, they got from the Bar, the branch of the profession I feel best qualified to speak about, what I might call partisan emotion which never could be got from an engineer or an architect, and I say that not out of disrespect to those professions.  It was common at the Bar &mdash; and I felt it myself &mdash; to become involved in a client's case.  In fact, it was very important to try to maintain a certain perspective, to keep a certain distance from becoming involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> I remember being disproportionately downcast if I lost a case.  It might not have been my fault, but sometimes it was. Depression would fall on me for days at the thought of having allowed somebody to go out of the court with no compensation because of a mistake I had made.  What other profession is there in which this is so?  Equally, I remember being perhaps unduly elated when I won a case.  It did not matter that my fee in those days might be 14 or 15 guineas for having stood around for two days, but I felt a sense of satisfaction which infinitely exceeded the money involved.  I am not holding myself out as an example, because I believe that was true of the profession in general.  I know from my friends who are still at the Bar that they have a dog's life in many respects.  They are not able to plan holidays, weekends or spend time with their families in the evening because they are tied to a grindstone and if they detach themselves from it, their practice can be gone in a very short time.</P>
    <P>When I was at the Bar the incidence of TB was lessening but there were people who were laid up for four, six or eight months.  When they came back to work their practice had virtually disappeared, not because anybody was trying to do them down but because the solicitors on whom they depended had to get their client's work done by somebody and they necessarily made new connections.  They started to brief other barristers and when the unfortunate invalid finally resumed work, pale and convalescent, he might find that three-quarters of the solicitors on whom he had previously relied were no longer giving him the same volume of work.  There is no pension, no insurance, nothing to fall back on if a barrister falls victim to the ordinary ills of the flesh.  No one will cover up for him if he becomes an alcoholic.  These are things which the public, who are apt to sneer at what they perceive as the privileges and the selfishness of the legal profession, forget.  Much of what I have said, I have no doubt, could apply also to the solicitors profession, although I have no personal experience of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> I have strayed somewhat from the political point I wanted to begin with.  I say this without meaning to offend him because I have never had any trouble with him and I do not want to get his back up or to make an enemy of him, but I think it was a graceless performance of this Minister, whose Bill this is not, to have acquiesced in coming here and putting a face on something which he argued 180 degrees against not many months ago.  Having dealt as well as I can with Fianna Fáil, now let me move to the other side of the rainbow.</P>

      <P>Let me move from one leprechaun to another.  I have listened with a lot of interest to Deputy McCartan's contribution and learned a good deal from it &mdash; I say that without sarcasm &mdash; but I could not but be amused by the praise which he heaped on the efforts which had successfully got a particular insurance company out of their difficulties, even though there is still a jury system in place.  He was talking about the PMPA and how they had managed to haul themselves out of a deficit of more than £50 million.  How had they done that, asked the representative of The Workers' Party with warm admiration in his voice?  By dint of improved efficiency and competition.  How much efficiency and competition would there be in the State assurance company in Dubrovnik if The Workers' Party were in power?  It would be a State authority with no incentive, high or low, for efficiency or competition. Sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander.  I hopped off the Minister, Deputy Woods, for having been willing to say today something is black which he said not too long ago was white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have no personal quarrel nor have I had any trouble with Deputy McCartan, I feel he has made an extraordinary exhibition of himself this afternoon by appearing &mdash; and I do not think I am putting too unfair a gloss on his words &mdash; to endorse not just a policy <Col N="446" /> but a philosophy which his party were founded in order to destroy.  If he really believes efficiency and competition are the secret of success he belongs in some other party, not with Deputy Taylor I agree, but somewhere else in the House, and not perhaps with the Napper Tandys we do not see too often unless we are discussing one of their pet subjects, but certainly not in The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat the question other speakers have raised.  What is the motive for this measure?  I am sorry that I ask myself that question.  It is a bit like the method of diagnosis which Conan Doyle learned as a young doctor which he thereafter grafted onto his creation, Sherlock Holmes: when you have excluded the impossible, whatever else remains, however improbable, must be the truth.  I have run through the other possible motives for this measure, most of which have been dealt with very effectively by speakers here today, including Deputy Andrews.  I have had to exclude all of those as impossible.  I am left with the one which might seem in a republican Parliament to be highly improbable, though I am afraid long experience of that Parliament has taught me that it is by no means improbable, namely, that we are doing this because it was done in Britain.  As usual, we are doing it about 40 years later than them.  Not only do we catch their penny but it takes 40 years for it to drop.  That is shaming.</P>
    <P>Why are we stuck here with two alternatives only?  We could invest 50,000 different modulations of systems of assessing liability and measuring damages in personal accident cases.  But we appear to be so uninventive, so stuck in a rut, so little justifying the independence that generations before us worked for, or sweated for, that we can think of two alternatives only: either the system we have or the system the British have. There is nothing else or, if there is, I should like to hear from the Minister what consideration his Department gave it.  I do not mean to impute merely to his Government this intellectual lethargy, this shaming, slavish approach to any problem: get down the British statues, <Col N="447" /> lads, and see what they have done.  It was the very same under Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I know that this is a point of view which equally will be derided by those who are not interested in the era of their fathers or grandfathers, but unquestionably the most innovative period in the history of this State was its first ten years.  In order to save the Minister's feelings I do not mind throwing in the following five years as well, let us say, roughly up to the Second World War.  In that period there were people who were still sufficiently young to remember the Independence Movement before it had achieved anything, people who were sufficiently young and vigorous to realise that what was central to it was the conviction that we were able to do things for ourselves, with our own perspectives and objectives, better than anybody else.  It was not simply resentment of the British; it was not simply anxiety to be out from under the foreigner; it was also the idea that, if we were on our own, running our own State, we could design that State and all its works to suit ourselves.  I believe that.  But I do not think any Government ever believed it so passionately as did that of William T. Cosgrave and de Valera in their early days.</P>
    <P>After the Second World War &mdash; it may have been that some of them were ageing and that the vigour had left them, or it may have been that some of them may have forgotten &mdash; easy ways and corruption of one sort or another had begun to creep in.  That fine pride and conviction had begun to disappear by the time the war ended.  But in the twenties in particular it was very strong.  In the very area about which we are talking a more striking innovation was made than in any other in the State.  I know there are superficial things one could point to which are important &mdash; the symbolisms of the State, its coinage, its uniforms, its stamps, yes, the derided green letterboxes, its modes of address, of official conduct and so on. These were all designed from scratch in the twenties.</P>

      <P>Would <Col N="448" /> Deputy Kelly agree with me that he perhaps has spent a fair amount of time, as it were, digging the foundations on which he is going to base his case?

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the judicial system, to the innovative improvements it underwent in the first ten, if not in the first two, years of the State's existence, under the pilotage over there, where the Minister is sitting, originally of the first Attorney-General, Hugh Kennedy, and subsequently of Kevin O'Higgins, the Minister for Justice, who between them got the Dáil to enact the Courts of Justice Act, which perhaps not completely, but very substantially tore away the judicial system of the State from the pattern the British had left.  The District Court was an entirely new creation, the Circuit Court was an entirely new creation and the Supreme Court was an entirely new creation.  Naturally, they could not shed the legal system they had inherited, they could not shed some associations of jurisdiction with the courts which they replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I am trying to emphasise is that the very thought of creating a brand new court, staffed differently, the judges to which would be differently recruited, would be a bold and innovative step beyond anything which today's Deputies would seem willing to countenance or, I am sorry to say, the people who support them.  Why should that be?  Why is it that we are stuck here with two alternatives only: either we go along with the old jury system, in which I am sure there are some flaws, or we go for the British system, which is essentially that which the Minister opposite is promoting.  Surely there are other possibilities which could be canvassed? I am not recommending any of them in particular.  For example, would it not be possible to divide the functions of the court, in the trial of a civil action for damages for personal injuries, let us say, in such a way that the jury would decide the issue of liability only and that the <Col N="449" /> judge, perhaps with the assistance of expert assessors, would assess the damages, or the other way round?  Could some gains be made by reducing the number of the jury in a civil case from 12 to, say, six?  Would it be any use if we had the jury sitting with the judge?  That could not be done in the criminal sphere, because I believe Article 38 forbids us to meddle with the jury in essentially the same character it had in 1937.  It could be done in the civil sphere because the Constitution does not entrench juries for civil trial purposes.</P>
    <P>I mention those possibilities off the top of my head.  I should like to hear somebody explain to me why none of them is practicable, why no variation of any of them might be practicable.  Why are we stuck with these two alternatives only?</P>
    <P>I want to explore some of the motives behind this.  I contend that one of the reasons the Bill before us is being promoted by this Government, as it was by the last, is the agitation which has gone on about high insurance premiums.  I know very little about the working of insurance companies.  Deputy S. Barrett in front of me would know a hundred times more.  I believe the principle of the workings of an insurance company is that it operates on the basis of pooling the risk and that it varies its premiums in terms of the sort of pool that will be necessary in order to meet what it expects in the way of claims from certain categories of risk &mdash; fire, life, accident and so on.  I believe that even within those categories assessments of the level of risk will vary, depending on the people involved.</P>
    <P>If it has been the experience of insurance companies that 18 and 19 year old drivers constitute a higher risk than drivers of my age, why should they not charge premiums proportionately?  I am damned if I can see the reason for not doing that &mdash; all this whingeing and whining about young drivers being penalised. I was 30 years of age before I could afford a car let alone pay the insurance premium on it.  Granted, the exercise is troublesome. Let us look at it this way: my own car is a four-year-old Fiat and I am not in <Col N="450" /> the two car category.  For comprehensive insurance cover on the vehicle I pay in the region of £800 a year whereas, had I third party cover only, I am sure it would amount to very much less.  Even supposing the premium amounted to £800 for third party cover, which is far in excess of what it would be, I would still be paying only £2 a day for that insurance cover.  Is that a fortune?  Consider that for those £2, I can drive while drunk, I can cripple someone for life, leave a family fatherless; I can write off a line of parked cars by side-swiping ten or 12 of them as I drive along the street.  I can do all of these things with total impunity, at least civil impunity, for a mere £2 a day.  Naturally it does not relieve me of my criminal liability for such behaviour.  But, so far as compensating the victims of my behaviour, is concerned, £2 a day will let me out.  Where is the excessiveness in that?  Mind you, it is not really £2 a day because if I had merely third party cover the premium would be very much less and it is not very long since it was £1 a day.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for politicians, with their tails between their legs, running away from young drivers?  Are we never going to stand up to anybody and say: &ldquo;You must carry your own weight in the world and face the consequences of your own situation.  Do you not have the compensation of being young, without mearling and whingeing about having to pay insurance on a car in a risk category which is particularly high?&rdquo; I have nothing but contempt for politicians who run with the herd like that.  It is not very long since an 18-year-old person could not dream of having a car.  When I was a student the families of most 18-year-old students did not have a car, let alone the students themselves.  Let us not run, driven by a stampede, shouting and roaring about premiums that has brought this Bill into the House.</P>
    <P>Somehow we have been given the idea and sold the idea, that premiums will magically come down if we get rid of the juries.  If I really could see a necessary connection between the abolition of civil jury trials in accident cases and the size <Col N="451" /> of premiums I would probably have a different opinion.  I practised in the courts for five or six years and I appeared several times before a jury in the High Court and addressed juries in accident cases.  I have a little experience of this, though not, I suppose, as much as Deputy Andrews has.  I also accept that my experience of it is now a bit rusty, but I cannot see the connection between these two matters. For example, I cannot see that the existence of a jury prolongs a case in duration substantially beyond what it would be before a single judge.  Cases can also run for very long-periods of time before a single judge.  When Mrs. Ryan, the fluoridation plaintiff, was in the High Court in 1965 her case, which involved not a road accident but, one would have thought, the simple question of whether she was being poisoned by the drinking water, took 63 days to hear.  I know there was technical evidence and so forth involved but I would need to be persuaded, and I am not sure anyone could persuade me, that a judge sitting by himself who is slow &mdash; and when I say &ldquo;slow&rdquo; I do not mean slow of understanding; I mean slow in the sense of being careful, cautious, not anxious to skimp the taking of evidence and sure he understands something before he goes on to the next point &mdash; would conduct the hearing of an accident case, in which both sides are allowed to call their evidence and allowed to cross-examine the other side's evidence, substantially quicker than a jury would.  I have not heard any argument in this debate along those lines.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know to what extent the prevalence of uninsured drivers on our roads contributes to the height of premiums and what relative impact compared to what we are promised now &mdash; and we are not really promised anything very concrete &mdash; catching up with these uninsured drivers would make.  I do not think the public understand that the cost of uninsured drivers and the accidents they cause falls essentially on those people who are insured, for reasons I am sure everyone in the House understands.  It ultimately falls on <Col N="452" /> them and it has the effect of pushing up the premiums because the insurance companies essentially have to carry the loss of people who drive uninsured.  Naturally, if one could be sure that no uninsured drivers existed any longer, that ought to have an effect on the levels of premiums.</P>
    <P>When I see the word &ldquo;clampdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;crackdown&rdquo; in the papers I always think it is like a picture when I said to myself &ldquo;This is where I came in&rdquo; and looked for my hat and coat to go home.  I have been reading for years about ministerial crackdowns on uninsured driving.  Where is the sign of this crackdown?  About six months ago I was in a line of traffic on which a spot check was being conducted by the Garda to see whether drivers had tax and insurance.  This is a very good idea.  No doubt that kind of spot check will net a good many uninsured drivers. Equally, if the Minister and his crackdown team walked around the streets and spot checked parked cars which have no insurance disc &mdash; and in that regard I must commend the idea of insurance discs which I tried in vain to promote during the seven or eight months I was in the Department of Trade &mdash; that no doubt would net a good deal more.</P>
    <P>I have not been told that the general level of uninsured driving has substantially fallen.  I would expect a Government to crack down and keep on cracking down until such time as this country, instead of having 10 per cent of its drivers uninsured, would have less than 1 per cent, which would be the continental European level.  When that is done we can start looking at our system of judicature and ask whether it is perfectly adaptable to the task which it has on hands.</P>
    <P>The same goes for the weakness of the Government's position, and of the Government who promoted this Bill in the last Dáil, in regard to comparisons with what happens in Britain, and from which this Bill is being copied.  All right, let us sink our national pride, forget about the Republic, the dead generations who have gone before us and the Easter Declaration and let us suppose we are an <Col N="453" /> outcrop of the United Kingdom, which for legislative purposes we might just as well be when it comes to dealing with something like this.  Let us suppose we have a subordinate Legislature like they had in Stormont and that that is all we have here &mdash; and that is how we frequently behave &mdash; might we not be told how they have got on across the water in England in regard to the level of awards. Have they fallen substantially?  How substantially did they fall in 1948, or whatever year it was, when civil actions for injuries and the kind of things we are talking about here ceased to be tried by juries and became tried by judges?  What is the present situation there in comparison with the situation here?  What is the tariff, let us say, for a broken pelvis &mdash; to get down to concrete injuries &mdash; of a 28 year old women or a slightly shortened leg of a man of the same age?</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I will not be finished before 7 p.m. but I have to dwell on this point because it is absolutely essential.  We have been discussing the Bill &mdash; and I accept this is the basis on which the Bill is being put before us &mdash; on the basis that it is going to reduce insurance premiums.  Let us not forget something which I believe is a good deal more central; we are talking not about insurance premiums; we are talking about justice. We are talking about a Bill called the &ldquo;Courts Bill&rdquo;.  It is not called the &ldquo;Courts (Reducing Young People's Premiums) Bill.  It is the Courts Bill, the courts which under Article 34 are supposed to administer justice.  Let us not forget that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again concede that there is no obvious tariff which you can read off which will deliver a simple answer in the case of personal injuries.  What is an appropriate <Col N="454" /> sum for a broken leg, for the loss of an eye or some other injury like that?  I would not wish to suffer a grave injury like that for any money.  Only in circumstances such as were said to exist in India &mdash; I do not know if they still do &mdash; where destitution and desperation are so appalling that people are said to throw themselves under cars in order to build up a claim for compensation.  I hope I will not offend a friend of India or anyone else by saying so.  I may be wrong, maybe my information was wrong at all stages or is out of date, but I have read or heard that and if it is so it is a desperate situation which nobody would wish another human being to be in.  Nobody here would endure an injury, no matter for what money, therefore there is no, so to speak, obvious valuation to be attached to an injury.  We know roughly what value we attach to our house, our car and so on, but what value can we attach to a disability which perhaps will be with us for life? There is no tariff for that.  It is purely conventional, but if it is purely conventional the promoter of a Bill of this kind ought to feel a duty to persuade the House that those conventions are likely to be better achieved by a single judge who on average will be a man in his fifties or sixties than by a jury who would be much more likely to represent an ailing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>To recap on where we were last night.  I regard this Bill as a serious attempt to address a serious problem but I have doubts about some of the measures and I hope, if the Bill goes into Committee, to probe those doubts somewhat further.  May be those <Col N="455" /> doubts will be addressed by the supporters of the Bill and will vanish, but I hope I might persuade those people to think again about some of the details of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In particular I indicated I had some doubts about the enforcement provisions and their feasibility and I suggested some alternatives.  I want to suggest two possible approaches which would go some considerable distance towards achieving the objectives the Progressive Democrats have set themselves.  These approaches certainly are more moderate in scope but they might be more effective for all that. I had just begun to mention the first of those last night.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development Act) 1976, section 27, allows application to be made to the court for an order prohibiting the development of or securing compliance with a planning permission.  It was envisaged in the legislation that that order could be addressed to any person.  In the early years in which the legislation was in effect it was a matter of course to seek to have that order addressed to the directors or shareholders or to people intimately associated with the development company.  Over a period of years the courts took the view that that should not happen as a matter of course and that the order should be directed to individuals only if there was some element of personal culpability.  I think that is a fair paraphrase of the net effect of a series of decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could with benefit return to the earlier practice and provide by legislation that the courts would have a very wide discretion indeed as to whom orders should be directed.  That would have a salutory effect on the behaviour of certain rogue developers and makes a good deal of sense.  We are not talking here about the normal situation of limited liability where people are seeking to protect their personal assets when they go out to trade in the marketplace.  Involved here are people who are guilty of either actual criminal activity or quasi-criminal activity in failing to comply with the conditions <Col N="456" /> of a planning permission which they themselves sought.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it would be open to a planning authority considering an application for planning permission to look to the track record of a developer and say, &ldquo;No, we have had experience of you; we saw what you did out in Kilnamanagh or whatever and you are getting no more planning permissions&rdquo;.  I know there are certain difficulties with that.  The point will be made that because planning permission runs with the land there will be difficulties of carrying that through in the case of subsequent sales and so on, but the very possibility of finding oneself on a black list would represent a serious deterrent to a developer who was thinking of dragging his feet and leaving an estate unfinished.  That is worth taking on board and if this goes to Committee I want to pursue it further.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last night, my concern with the measures the Progressive Democrats advance is that I do not think they take into account fully the depressed state of the building industry and in particular the need for builders to have access to finance if they are to develop. Many developments now are constructed on the basis that the sales of the early completions are going to finance the rest of the development.  I was particularly dubious about the suggestion that conditions would be permitted to restrict the occupation of any structure without the consent of the planning authority until after full completion.  In practice that could well prove a major problem for developers, their financial backers and, more seriously, the general public.  It seems probable that financial institutions advancing mortgages to purchasers would be unlikely to advance finance until those conditions had been complied with, yet the developers would not be in a position to comply until final completion. It seems to me that the people putting forward that proposal have not really grasped the gradual nature of a development process.</P>
    <P>This new and radical concept Deputy Keating told us about last night of the planning receiver may well be, but will it <Col N="457" /> work?  I am not at all sure how it is designed to work.  Presumably if the receiver is to be effective he is going to be in a position to give title to the land if he is to sell it off and pay for the default of the developer.  That is fine so far, but if he is in a position to give title to the land, where does that leave the financial institution that was bankrolling the whole thing from the beginning?  Their interest will normally have been secured by a first charge on the land.  Now it seems that one of two things will be the case.  Either the interest of the financial security will take priority, in which case the planning receiver will have little practical effect, or the planning receiver really will have teeth and will be in a position to give title and use the assets as envisaged.  If that is the case nobody in his right mind is going to advance money for a development that would be subject to such a risk.</P>
    <P>I welcome entirely some of the other enforcement procedures, such as the suggestion that the courts should be in a position to give mandatory orders as well as orders formulated in prohibitory terms and also the suggestion of transferring to the Circuit Court.  These are very sensible.</P>
    <P>Let me go back to compensation.  It seems in some cases that the Bill does not achieve all that is set out for it.  For example, Deputy Keating told us &mdash; or certainly more than implied &mdash; that if this Bill had been enforced there would have been no Killiney Hill case.  That is just not right.  This Bill just lengthens the already lengthy list of cases in which compensation is not payable.  In the Killiney Hill case An Bord Pleanála saw fit for reasons of their own to rewrite a refusal of the local authority and, for negligence or worse, decided to do so in language that was not contemplated by the 1963 Planning Act.  If in future we have the misfortune to have people of such incompetence around exactly the same results will arise.  If we want to avoid such cases we must make accountable people who make that kind of mistake and bring such burdens on to the taxpayer and ratepayer and ask what is the accountability of those <Col N="458" /> people who had the political responsibility of putting such people into positions for which clearly they were not qualified.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of what is to be done in relation to this Bill.  I was not impressed by the Minister's plea that the Bill be withdrawn and his statement that if it was not withdrawn he would be obliged to oppose it.  On a series of occasions in the life of this Dáil we have found ourselves in this situation, with one or other of the parties in Opposition coming forward with proposals for legislative reform and a Government Minister saying we are on the right track and agreeing broadly speaking, with what we are trying to do.  However, he then adds that he has to kill the proposal because the Government have legislation of their own in the never-ending pipeline.  That happened, for example, in relation to the Adoption Bill almost a year ago.  The Government indicated that they could not accept a proposal for changes in the law relating to adoption and instead they proposed to publish their own legislation. They did, in identical terms, and it still is not law.  As a result, childless couples continue to live in misery, children live in institutions and are denied the prospect of a secure family environment.</P>
    <P>There is a minority Government in office and, because of that, the parties on this side of the House have to exercise particular responsibility and at least some of us have imposed disciplines on ourselves. A minority Government must realise that they cannot expect to exercise a monopoly in instituting legislation. They must be responsive to suggestions for reform.  Last night, there was talk about the possibility of the publication of the heads of the Bill and there could also be an agreed timetable for the publication of comprehensive Government legislation. I am not closing any doors but the Minister has a lot to do to convince us of his seriousness of purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on why the Progressive Democrats found it necessary to produce the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1988.  Everybody welcomes the thrust and the intent of the proposed Bill but one could be forgiven for forgetting that Deputy Birmingham's party have been in office for about nine of the past 14 years. The then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, made a speech in Cork on this very important matter after what any logical, fair-minded person would interpret as a very unacceptable court decision.  The Minister told the House last night that the Bill is not deficient in a critical way but that there are a number of other headings, areas and issues that can be addressed when one is bringing forward a Bill dealing with planning and development.  For that reason, it was a fair point for the Minister to make that the Bill would be withdrawn on the very specific undertakings given by him.  Of course, it does not take away from the right of the Progressive Democrats to introduce this Bill in Private Members' Time, which I know is quite limited. Their requests are reasonable and made with the best of intentions.  It is a complex, legislative matter and the Minister has been queried about it at various parliamentary party meetings over the past year.  He had given an undertaking that the drafting was well advanced and would be available to the House as soon as possible.  The Progressive Democrats, in a co-operative and harmonious way, could take the commitment given by the Minister last evening that the best of their Bill will be incorporated in a broader and <Col N="460" /> more expended Bill dealing with local government planning and development.</P>
      <P>From contributions made last night, it was clear that some of our eminent legal eagles had played a part in drafting the Bill and assisting the Progressive Democrats. It is to their credit to give of their time in assisting in the preparation of legislation.  However, one must also highlight the major reasons for the problems in these areas in the past ten or 15 years. Those same legal eagles have put complex interpretations of the law before various courts and members of the Bench have accepted some of their arguments and made decisions which were contrary to the common good clause in the Constitution. There is confirmation of that in the Explanatory Memorandum on section 5 which states that there have been some suggestions that tackling this problem by legislation might well be unconstitutional and would infringe the property rights guaranteed in the Constitution. It also says that a series of recent Supreme Court decisions have indicated that there is no real foundation for those fears and that planning permission in respect of speculative developments has been described as an enhancement of property rights and a bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of XJS Investments Limited, logic prevailed in the end.  However, in the beginning and during the processing of these compensation claims which have given rise to the introduction of the Bill &mdash; our colleagues in the media could also be criticised &mdash; the millions and millions of pounds claimed were highlighted but the final decisions did not attract anything like the same attention. As the Minister pointed out last evening, out of a substantial number of compensation claims, the grand sum of £84,000 was paid on foot of something in the region of £70 million claimed. However, he said that the potential loss to local authorities, even from the small number of claims made, is extremely worrying.  The 130 claims made between 1982 and 1986 amounted to nearly £70 million.  The Minister also stated that <Col N="461" /> total compensation paid by local authorities in this period came to just £82,000. We must strike a reasoned balance between the difficulties and problems and the practical solutions.</P>
    <P>The Bill probably addresses some of the problems but, because of court decisions on a number of occasions, the members of the Bench are probably a little more attuned to the realism of the common good.  Many decisions in the past ten years, which have caused this House great anguish, were &mdash; to be kind &mdash; very questionable, based on the evidence and facts.  They highlighted a type of political ideology coming from the Bench which was an unacceptable interpretation and running contrary to the intent and thrust of legislation on the Status Book.  Very often we had to reverse decisions which were, to say the least, surprising.  Deputy Birmingham, who is familar with court procedure, referred to one or two of those cases last night.  The decisions in those cases caused many problems for local authorities.  The Bill attempts to address them and I have no doubt that the Minister in his legislation will seek to do likewise.  I hope it will be possible to produce wording that will now allow such a narrow interpretation of the law.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage now where some senior counsel have attracted the label of experts in planning law because of their success in claims for compensation. Senior counsel and not town planners or architects represent applicants at oral hearings before An Bord Pleanála to argue planning issues that arise.  An Bord Pleanála appeals are being turned into court sessions with cross-examination of inspectors, officials and planning staff of local authorities. That was not intended in the legislation and I find it objectionable.  If it is considered necessary to introduce legislation to protect local authorities, and the general public, it is our responsibility to do so swiftly.  I hope the Progressive Democrats will accept our word that we intend to do that.  They should have patience and wait for more comprehensive legislation to be introduced by the Minister. <Col N="462" /> The Progressive Democrats will get full credit for the initiative they have taken in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he proposes to address other issues in his legislation. He said that if he were to introduce amendments to the Progressive Democrats Bill on Committee Stage the issue would become very complex.  I have the honour of representing the constituency of Dublin West which includes two satellite towns, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin, designated in the early seventies for population growth to a figure of 100,000 by 1991.  Deputy Harney represents the third satellite town, Tallaght. We are aware that local government officials are well versed in the development needs of those areas, as are Members who also sit on local authorities. We must ask ourselves why the planning laws have not worked and why there is a need, in section 7, to provide a more effective remedy for breaches of the planning laws.  That section also proposes to give planning authorities an effective remedy for unfinished development, to change the law in relation to the obligation of sanitary authorities to provide sewerage services, and to co-ordinate the duties and powers of sanitary authorities with the duties and powers of planning authorities.</P>
    <P>That section highlights our problems. When I first went before the electorate in 1974 Clondalkin was a village of about 2,000 people and Lucan and Blanchardstown did not have as many people. We are all aware of how those areas have mushroomed into major centres of population.  Many reputable, conscientious and capable house builders were engaged in work in those areas but a small though active number created a very bad image for builders.  That is unfortunate and we must try to deal with that problem.  We must try to ascertain how much work remains to be completed. It is important to assess how local authorities can insist on builders adhering to all the conditions in planning permissions.</P>
    <P>I am confident that local authority <Col N="463" /> officials have come to grips with the problems in recent years but that was not the case in the mid and late seventies.  One will find that planning permissions granted today contain many more conditions such as bonding and financial responsibility for the completion of development work.  I am afraid that some sections of the Bill will add more red tape and bureaucracy and I am doubtful about the ability of the proposed planning receiver to deal with all the problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should appoint a development co-ordinator, of the status of principal officer, and that we give him the legislative power to co-ordinate the work of sanitary and planning authorities. They do not appear to work together at the moment, and that is nonsense. As a result of that we have had arguments about compensation and the impression is created that our planning laws do not have teeth.  When debating this issue we must consider the great demand for houses in the seventies. There was a great demand for houses in the medium to low price range but there was not a sufficient number of houses to meet it.  As a result there was an explosion of residential development. We have all inherited the hangovers of that growth period.  Fortunately, today the supply is greater than the demand. Those who do not build a quality type house, who do not complete the development work on the sites will not be able to sell them.  House designs and standards have improved greatly.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister, and his predecessors, on the quality of local authority houses.  They have set a headline in my constituency and in many cases surpass the quality of low cost private housing.  In the early seventies applicants for planning permission were in the main, house builders.  We passed from that to the phase of the major site developer who obtained planning permission in the usual way and then disposed of blocks of sites.  There was a breakdown in communication and it was difficult to establish who was responsible for road <Col N="464" /> surfacing, public lighting and the development of open spaces.  We had house builders building on licensed sites and a developer responsible for the estate.</P>
    <P>The planning department, with a development co-ordinator, should be in a position to cast a critical eye over planning applications in excess of 200 to 250 houses.  In estates in excess of that number it is unlikely that the one developer will conclude the work.  Many good house builders are criticised and blamed for unfinished work which is not their responsibility.</P>
    <P>We need to be practical when dealing with new residential development and recognise the problems house builders must face.  However, we should not permit house builders to abuse the system.  The Minister has told us of his concern about the number of unfinished estates.  Planning permission should be confined to blocks of not more than 50 to 100 units and the applicant should be told that any number of units in excess of that will be approved if certain conditions are met.  That would satisfy applicants who are seeking financial assistance from the banks and allow the development to proceed. Those who represent the western part of County Dublin will be aware that planning permissions were granted for perhaps 800 houses and the development was left unfinished.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that young people making the biggest investment of their lives should be in this position.  We have all been at meetings of residents' associations and community councils where this issue has been at the top of the agenda. A major problem for representatives of rapidly growing urban areas is the matter of unfinished estates and the misleading information given to prospective buyers at showhouses.  Often they do not know whether there is to be further development in the neighbouring area.  It should be a condition of the grant of planning permission that some guideline information be displayed in showhouses.  The sales information should be formally submitted to the planning authority in order <Col N="465" /> to establish its accuracy.  The local authority are responsible for the overall development plan and if misleading information is given in this literature it could be identified.  Housebuilders and people selling property should have some accountability for the manner in which they market their product.</P>
    <P>The Shortt case has caused enormous problems in the area of compensation. Dublin County Council decided in 1972 to build an exciting new satellite town in Tallaght.  It was proposed to run the various services in the most economical way along the Dodder valley.  A landowner in that area decided, with the colleagues of Deputy McDowell in the Law Library, to construct a convoluted legal argument based on some 19th century Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some bench holder accepted the argument and we ended up forking out millions.  It was a national scandal which should not have been allowed to happen.  I cannot see how a judge reading our Constitution and studying the public health Acts could come to the conclusion that the common good clause of the Constitution could be overridden by this legal argument.  That is why this Bill is before the House.  The Minister is moving rapidly to produce a more comprehensive and wide-ranging Bill.  Legislation is necessary because of the the vagaries of the court system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately this kind of case has succeeded in getting a very bad name for the construction industry.  The faults of the few are blamed on the many.  Many builders and developers give excellent employment.  Their industry, more than any other, uses basic Irish materials and makes a major contribution to the economy. Their bad name is due to a small number of compensation claims and unfinished estates.  Those who do not finish estates are the very people who bring compensation claims before the courts.  It is quite unacceptable that such an important industry should have its <Col N="466" /> reputation ruined by a small number of those involved in it.</P>
    <P>Fortunately we are now in the position where supply has outstripped demand. The late Seán Lemass once said the only way we would adequately control the price of building land would be by servicing more than we needed.  That is the case at present and I hope we can maintain that position.  We must not revert to the conditions of the seventies when the price of residential and industrial land in County Dublin was sky high.  There was a shortage of infrastructural investment but that problem has been adequately addressed.  I hope further funds will be made available with the upcoming integrated plan for the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>I make a special appeal to the Progressive Democrats to recognise the bona fides of the Minister.  We on this side of the House intend to tackle this problem in an aggressive manner as quickly as possible.  The Minister stated last night that his Bill would take priority in the queuing list of legislation.  Having given that commitment, there is a greater onus on the Minister to produce that legislation if this Bill is withdrawn.  We do not wish to have to vote it down.  Since the Minister has given a commitment to introduce a Bill it is our duty and responsibility to see that this is done. We accept the thrust of this Bill but our colleague on the Government benches has stated that he will bring forward a more comprehensive Bill.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party have read this Bill and I regret that the period between its circulation and this debate has been so short.  The Bill addresses itself on the periphery to a number of very important issues which I understand will be addressed at some stage in some Bill that will be brought into this House by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Regarding the central question of compensation, I do not believe the Bill goes far enough.  As I understand it, it proposes to restrict the areas in which compensation can be obtained.  I am subject to correction on this by the party putting forward the Bill.  It has always been a point made by the Labour Party since the mid-seventies when we introduced a building control Bill and laterally in 1981-82 when we reintroduced the same Bill that the issue of compensation is not necessarily the main problem but rather the basis of the valuation upon which compensation is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response of successive Governments, right back to the minority report of the Kenny Committee which is the starting point for modern debate on this issue, has been that unless full and unfettered market value is granted to the owners of property who are having their property, in whole or in part, acquired by a local authority, are given the full potential market value, any other action is deemed or considered to be unconstitutional. Deputy Lawlor referred to the fact that at one stage I was an officeholder in this House and by reference to that, that I am aware of the opinions that successive Attorneys General have given on this question and that the body of political opinion delivered by the law officers of successive Governments has been to the effect &mdash; and I think I am correct in this summary &mdash; that any attempt to interfere with the method of valuation would be unconstitutional.  The dilemma for any person who sits where the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, currently sits, and indeed for the adviser beside him, would be that if they were to seek the advice of the legally appointed, constitutionally recognised law officers to the Government in respect of these <Col N="468" /> matters, they would, on balance, be advised that such a matter would be unconstitutional.  They, in turn, are precluded by the Constitution of this State from knowingly introducing legislation into this House that would be deemed to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I have argued consistently that this matter must ultimately be tested by the only body within the Oireachtas competent to test it and that is the Supreme Court.  It is regrettable that while this legislation in draft form addresses itself to many issues that are relevant and of concern, it does not address itself to the main issue.  Quite frankly, it is not a question of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted but virtually, without disrespect to the energy of the authors, of erecting a stable long after the horse has disappeared over the hill.  I say that because the problems of urban development confronting our society now are not ones of suburban development, by and large.  Deputy Lawlor spoke with some knowledge of his own constituency and Deputy Harney beside me here equally would have some knowledge of her constituency. Earlier today in this House we had the spokesperson from Fine Gael, Deputy Gay Mitchell, talking about empty houses in suburban Dublin built by the local authority.  The effective demand, whether it be social or economic, for housing on the periphery of our towns and cities has, by and large, subsided.  We can go into many arguments as to why that is the case, but most of us would be drawn inevitably to the rational and logical conclusion that that is the case and is likely to be the case for, I would say, four to five years minimum.</P>
    <P>Demographic projections in this area are notoriously unreliable but most recently, in the publication of a book on housing sponsored by the organisation known as Focus, probably one of the best known social scientists in the housing field in this country, Mr. Blackwell, talked about the changing nature of housing demand and the changing composition of households, that is, people looking for houses.  They are not the kind of people who traditionally would have <Col N="469" /> sought housing in a suburban location. For a variety of reasons they are people who would seek to be housed in established built-up areas which already have a range of <i>in situ</i> and accessible services, through public transport or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The various cases that are cited in the explanatory memorandum, the authorship of which it would appear from yesterday's debate is disputed and certainly not necessarily connected with that of the legislation, are, in the main, suburban cases of complaint and contestation in our courts, with respect to compensation. The reason I am saying, respectfully, to my parliamentary colleagues in the Progressive Democrats party that this is not the central issue is that this legislation <i>per se</i> will not address itself to the essential problem of how property in the already built-up areas of our society which have existing urban use can be acquired and how individual parcels of property, which of their own account do not constitute a development potential but which, taken together, could constitute such, can be acquired by either a private individual or the local authority, or some intermediate body such as the Custom House Docks Authority, or any other such body.  All such bodies, I would put it to the House, ultimately must operate through the compulsory purchase legislation and within the framework of the 1919 Valuation Acts.  From my knowledge and it is, shall we say, an informed amateur's knowledge &mdash; I would not profess it to be any other &mdash; over the years the weight of political and legal opinion has come down through the Custom House and the legal advisers there and in Government Buildings as being to the effect that full market value and only such can be given and can be offered by the arbitrater, at the end of the process, to the owners of that property.</P>
    <P>We have a living example of that in my constituency in an award winning scheme of houses on City Quay, facing the office of the Minister for the Environment, where what was once and always had been a coalyard prior to the arrival of the Vikings, was trading as a coalyard and valued as such and written into the books <Col N="470" /> of the coalyard company of the time&mdash; Doherty's, if my memory serves me right. Suddenly, when the local authority, because the coalyard in question had merged with other coalyard companies to form the CDL and had moved downstream, wanted to acquire it for the purpose of housing, this property ceased to be a coalyard and ceased to be valued as such.  It was now being valued as an office development site, even though the owners of that site had never sought or attempted to get planning permission for an office block on that site because of market conditions.  Although in theory it was zoned as capable of being an office block, the reality of existing market conditions effectively was that in no way would one be able to let or sell an office block on that site.  As a consequence, because the State, operating through, in this instance Dublin Corporation, were obliged to or decided through the process of CPO to sanction the purchase &mdash; the Minister would have been perhaps Deputy Molloy or Deputy Boland &mdash; that site was acquired as if it was a site equivalent to one in Ballsbridge which could be an office block.</P>
    <P>The nub of that problem and the reason that the arbitrator operating within the framework of the 1919 valuation legislation was obliged to recommend that and exercise, in his professional judgment, his duty and the reason that the local authority &mdash; and therefore we, the taxpayers &mdash; were obliged to expend the money in question was because there was no effective way of saying that existing use value should and could constitutionally prevail over the potential market value of that site.  That is a summary of a much more complex argument and I think that Deputy McDowell, who is quite knowledgable in a legal and political sense in these matters, would accept that it is a summary of an argument on something which is much more extensive.</P>
    <P>The reason I respectfully suggest to the Progressive Democrats that their measures do not extend far enough is that their Bill does not address itself to the core issue of valuation.  That is a core issue because the thrust of urban development <Col N="471" /> and urban renewal in the next five to ten years and for the rest of this century must be in our existing urban areas, whether it is in the centre of Portlaoise, the centre of Tullamore or of Limerick, Cork or Dublin.  It is not sufficient for us as the previous Administration has done and as the existing Administration is carrying on, to simply say that we should designate an area and give it beneficial tax incentives. The private property developer or the local authority cannot assemble property in a sufficiently viable parcel to enable a realistic development to take place.  If the local authority moves in, the process is too slow and the price is exorbitant.  If a private individual comes in, the process remains slow and in some instances the deal cannot be concluded in terms of acquisition because the nature of tenure is indecisive or in some cases simply incapable of being established.</P>
    <P>For those reasons the measures in the designated area package of tax incentives are defective, unless clear title can be given to the property in question.  That is the core of my argument in relation to the question of compensation.  Of course, the introduction of some of the measures which the Progressive Democrats feel would curtail areas of compensation would be an improvement and it would be churlish of me to say otherwise.  That improvement however would not be significant to justify us going through the process of using scarce parliamentary time in enacting this Bill.  The Progressive Democrats have missed the boat.  I will not speculate why they have chosen to draft this legislation in this way or why they have addressed this issue.  It is for them to respond to the points I have made.</P>
    <P>This is an issue about which I have been concerned over a number of years. I regret that when this House had the opportunity to vote on the net issue of existing use value <i>versus</i> hope value, to use the auctioneer's phrase, the majority of Deputies voted against the possibility of existing use value on very spurious grounds.  Deputies Molloy, O'Malley, Harney, Keating and Wyse voted against <Col N="472" /> the Labour Party measure, the Building Control (Land) Bill, which would have enshrined in law the question of existing use value as distinct from hope value.  By that, I mean the reference to the coalyard argument of City Quay.  That is my first point and it is at the core of what is at issue here today.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Birmingham whose parenthood we should all celebrate. As the father of a 17 year old I would tell him that the joys are soon to be replaced by other concerns but let him enjoy the joys while he can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham talked about the impracticalities in relation to the idea of a planning receiver.  As somebody who has practised as a consultant architect and with experience of dealing with local authorities, not just the Dublin one, I know there are numerous administrative impracticalities.  I find it somewhat contradictory that the Progressive Democrats should propose to assign additional responsibilities to a local authority in relation to the monitoring of planning developments in a way that is more extensive than is currently the practice, at a time when that party are calling for extensive reductions in public expenditure, and one of the areas earmarked for a reduction in public expenditure by the Progressive Democrats is the public service. The public service covers such areas as planning control.  For Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation to administer the minutiae in real terms of what is proposed in the relevant sections of this Bill, they will need additional staff and perhaps expertise that they currently do not possess.  In order to meet their legal obligations the first impulse of a civil servant and properly so, is that they would block, delay, and seek additional information. That has been the response in relation to the existing planning legislation. Therefore, instead of enhancing development and economic activity, which I presume is paramount in the minds of the Progressive Democrats, this would be a barrier which would impede development.  I see this series of sections in the Bill as being contradictory to the general thrust of what I understand to be <Col N="473" /> the Progressive Democrats political and economic philosophy.  Unless they are prepared in another context to advocate extra resources for local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would support the party's property tax, but I am not so sure the Deputy's own supporters would.  Deputy McDowell has anticipated me.  If in the context of what I have said the Deputy is indicating that he would see additional resources becoming available to local authorities, then my reservations in respect of the comments I have just articulated would have to be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn now to the response of the Minister for the Environment against whom no comment of any acerbic content can stick.  The Minister has out-performed President Reagan in this regard. The Minister's statements, as I read them from the record of the House last night, in relation to his bringing forward of his own Bill, were a series of protestations that I simple cannot accept.  I would remind the House that the same Minister has no Committee Stage, a Bill called the Building Control Bill.  It has been there for some time and the Minister has consistently refused to give it floor time or to seek floor time in this House.  That Bill would address many of the issues which this legislation seeks to address.  The Minister despite an enormous amount of work that has been done in relation to the draft building regulations and so on, including the horror of the Stardust disco fire nearly seven years ago, has repeatedly refused to seek time for that Bill.  I invite the Minister of State here to correct my information if it is wrong.  This legislation has gone through Second Stage and it is not contentious in terms of political ideology or partisan support but it is absolutely essential because at the moment every fire officer in the country has a different set of standards as to what is acceptable in relation to proposed developments, and a developer proposing any measure enters into some sort of bureaucratic lottery when he engages with a fire officer of any local authority <Col N="474" /> on what is an acceptable standard.  Before the Minister promises more legislation, perhaps he would advance Committee Stage in relation to that measure. Through my Whip, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I have invited the Minister to set up an all-party committee so structured that no adverse partisan votes that would embarrass the Government could take place.  I did this simply to advance the progress of this legislation.  There are no kudos to be gained or votes in getting this measure through, but it would be good common sense to enact this Bill.  So far the Minister has refused.  That is item No. 1, a Bill already at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Item No. 2 is the Housing (Miscellaneous) Bill, more popularly known as the Homeless Persons Bill.  After a year plus, it was redrafted from the previous Bill.  It was watered down because of the internal arguments either within the Government or the Department.  It is not for me to speculate, but comparing the Bill which has now been published with the Bill which previously had been on the floor of this House during the term of office of the previous Government one can see that there has been a watering down in relation to the statutory obligations on a local authority in respect of the homeless.  If my memory serves me correctly, that Bill was published immediately after Easter; but it has not yet been ordered for Second Stage and, as far as I can see, there is no possibility of it being taken during this session, despite a co-ordinated campaign by the religious orders throughout the country and other organisations such as the Simon Community, to have it taken.  Let us have a bite at that Bill before we proceed with something else.</P>
    <P>The other legislation is the legislation which has recently been circulated, the legislation in regard to multi-storey dwellings, but which has not yet been ordered for Second Stage and which, having regard to the amount of legislation promised for this session, is unlikely to have completed Second Stage before the end of this session, which I gather will be at the end of June.  Therefore, what is <Col N="475" /> the real reason behind the offer of the Minister for the Environment to the Progressive Democrats, who are the third largest party in the Dáil, not the Oireachtas &mdash; I like to make that point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know that, but when you are all running for it you will be converted.  I would remind the Progressive Democrats that legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas and not by the Dáil.  The request of the Minister for the Environment to the Progressive Democrats, who have used scarce parliamentary time to introduce legislation which addresses itself to an important issue, was patronising in the extreme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To request the Progressive Democrats to withdraw their Bill on the grounds that somehow or other the Minister for the Environment would come forward with another Bill which would be given due priority was extremely patronising, particularly having regard to his record.  He will go down in history as being the most antagonistic Minister for the Environment there ever has been and he cannot be trusted.  He is the man who abolished An Foras Forbartha, with the consent of the Government, and he reduced by £30 million &mdash; from £81 million to £51 million &mdash; the allocation for local authority housing, and he is the man who has initiated the housing crisis of the nineties.  In three years' time we will talk in this House about the crisis of the nineties. He has the gall to stand up in this House to say that he regarded himself as being the best Minister for the Environment there has ever been because <Col N="476" /> some nun had told him so because he had promised £1 million over three years to deal with the question of homelessness. Without being personal, but nevertheless perceptive in relation to the perceived track record of this man over the 15 months he has been Minister for the Environment, he has published three Bills but we do not know when any of them are going to be taken.  He is requesting the Progressive Democrats not to move their Bill but rather to take it away and that he will introduce another Bill in its place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the method of evaluation, which is at the core of how we deal with urban expansion, is one which our society has to come to grips with.  In a period of rapid suburban expansion we made rich overnight many individuals who had the good fortune to live on the edge of our cities and in the process we made many property developers and housing developers very rich. By the same token &mdash; and I say this particularly to Deputy Lawlor, who has left the House &mdash; that many such developers went bankrupt.  It was a lottery of a kind in that there were losers and winners, but the winners gained very handsomely and their rewards are still being paid for every month of every year by all of the people who are struggling to pay their mortgages.  In many cases we have not received the benefit of the transfer of resources within our society because many of the so-called developers <Col N="477" /> bought race horses, pubs or apartments in Spain.</P>
      <P>I believe that that period of suburban expansion is now over in terms of economic and demographic demands, but I also believe that we are into a new period of urban renewal and regeneration and that this is critical to the development of the fabric of our cities and towns.  Indeed, Patrick Shaffrey, who wrote the definitive book on the Irish town in the late seventies, talked about an incipient crisis in every Irish town because of the age structure of those properties which are to be found in the centre of every town &mdash; and I am not talking about my own constituency or the inner city of Dublin but about Tullamore, Portlaoise, Thurles, Nenagh and so on.  If one drives through those towns and looks above the neon signs one will see in many cases that the top floors are no longer occupied.</P>
      <P>We are facing a crisis which can only be resolved by having a system which will enable the community, through either local authority, private developer or a joint venture of both or any other combination, to acquire and develop parcels of lands at their existing use value. Nobody would buy a burnt out Volkswagen and pay the going rate for a brand new vehicle of the same kind on the basis of what you see it is not what you get, what you see could be a new car and therefore you should pay the going rate. Any commodity, be it fruit in a supermarket at 4.30 p.m. on a Saturday or fish on a Friday, has a market value related to the demand of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that is the core of the issue in respect of planning, compensation, acquisition and redevelopment. Whatever Bill he may have in mind is going to be struck on the anvil of whether it is constitutional or not and no matter how much he wants to change the system of valuation he will be told repeatedly that it is unconstitutional. That is the sincere and considered view and I am not imputing that there are any spurious or malevolent motives behind this view.  The Minister can read such views in such extensive publications as the Kenny report on Building Lands, <Col N="478" /> which was left on the desk of the incoming Minister for Local Government in 1973. We need to get a definitive case into the Supreme Court so that it can make a ruling which in turn would enable whoever happens to be the Minister for the Environment to bring in legislation which we could all support and which would enable us to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to some of the points which have been made by Deputy Quinn.  First of all, I acknowledge the interest he showed in this area during his term as Minister and his expertise in this area, but I have to respond to some of the points he made in regard to my own Minister.  I believe the Minister is sincere about introducing comprehensive legislation not just in this area but also in regard to housing.  I am aware from the statements which he has made and from questioning him that comprehensive legislation is on the way. I accept there is the old argument about what did you do when in power.  I was not in this Chamber when Deputy Quinn was a Minister; if I had been I would have been able to prod him about proposed legislation, which he is quite good at doing on the Order of Business.  The Deputy has repeatedly asked for legislation in this area and on housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy has rightly said, the Kenny report was left on the desk of the Minister when he took up office and simply nothing happened.  It is a difficult and complex area and I am critical that nothing was done, but it is unfair to criticise the Minister in that manner in regard to this legislation considering that he has been in office for just over a year.  In saying that, I welcome the fact that the Progressive Democrats have produced this Bill.  I support the Minister in what he had to say.  I have said the same to the Fine Gael Party in regard to another Bill that has been discussed here recently, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill &mdash; I know I am beginning to sound repetitive &mdash; because I believe his Bill is more comprehensive. He has the full weight of the office of the Attorney General to support him in putting this comprehensive legislation <Col N="479" /> together.  That, in itself, is a very strong argument.  I am aware that the Progressive Democrats have very strong legal advice within the party and I commend them for putting so much time into producing this Bill.  I would ask them, as the Minister did last night, to allow for the Minister to produce his Bill and I, too, hope that this will not take very long.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of Dublin County Council since 1979 and many of the cases mentioned &mdash; for example, the Shortt case and the Viscount Security case &mdash; refer to my own constituency.  I know that many of the speakers who have contributed so far represent local authority areas within Dublin County Council. This is the key area that is affected by this legislation.  We all accept that there have been abuses of the planning laws and that speculators have been allowed to take advantage of these abuses.  The question of compensation being sought where the local authority refuses permission is a most critical problem. I know that the Bill refers to the ongoing problem of estates that are uncompleted. As a member of Dublin County Council, I know that we have to come to terms with that to some extent in that we have put in very stringent conditions with regard to the development of estates.  I accept that this is a problem we must tackle, but I think it is really a problem of the past.  The planning department seem to have come to terms with this matter by ensuring through very strict conditions that developers put in place what we call the infrastructural support mechanisms before, or at least alongside, the building of houses.</P>
    <P>As a member of the council who has witnessed in horror, along with my colleagues, cases such as the Viscount Security case and the Shortt case, I am very concerned about this matter and I welcome the debate.  The planners in Dublin County Council have had to do deals with developers and that is something that has not been itemised in monetary terms. Reference has been made to the cost of compensation, but it is important that we also take account of the deals that have <Col N="480" /> been done with developers under the threat of compensation.  What that has meant is that there have been inferior type developments.  We have not built up County Dublin &mdash; I refer to County Dublin because I have some knowledge in that area &mdash; as we would like to have done because the planning laws have not been changed for the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about compensation. In some cases amounts awarded as a result of compensation claims have been substantially lower than the amounts claimed.  I am sorry that some of the claims have not been pursued. Reference was already made in this debate to the Killiney case where compensation amounting to £2.37 million was claimed, but the amount awarded was a relatively paltry sum of £150,000.  The Minister referred to the payment of compensation and said that the compensation paid for nine claims amounted to £82,000.  That was the total compensation paid by local authorities in a given period. As I have said, this does not take account of the many deals that were done.  County Dublin is a prime residential and commercial development area.  I am concerned about this area and I know there is need for this legislation.  I hope the Minister will follow up, as he committed to do last night, by introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>Credit is due to the officials in Dublin County Council because they have managed to come up with very imaginative proposals under tremendous pressure. As I have said, the end result in many cases might not be desirable, but they have managed to come to some agreements with developers.  Sadly, we have lost open space and planning permission has been given in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.</P>
    <P>I have a newsletter from the KRAM group, the Keep Rovers at Milltown Group, and the picture on that newsletter tells its own story.  It is a photograph of Glenmalure Park at Milltown, the grounds that have been vacated by Shamrock Rovers.  That is very much a sporting matter but, as Deputies are aware, it is quite relevant to this debate.  In this case a very valuable amenity, a football field, <Col N="481" /> has been left to waste away and the grass on the playing field is overgrown.  A developer is waiting in the wings to put in an application for development of a possible shopping centre or apartment block.  Down the road from this football ground there was a rugby club, the Palmerston Rugby Club, but they have moved out and an apartment block now towers over the surrounding residential area.  This is very much central to the debate that is taking place.  Here is a congested residential area.  A planning application will, I presume, be sent in soon and the people from the football club are obviously concerned.  This is a corporation issue and, being a member of the county council, I will not have an input at planning level; but councillors are literally waiting for the inevitable and can do nothing about it.  It is a real problem. This is a zoned amenity area, and the owners are aware of this, but because it can be serviced it is inevitable that construction will take place on this site. I have spoken to the Minister for Sport in regard to this matter and I have brought a deputation from the football club to meet him.  The Minister for the Environment is aware of this matter, as well as many other contentious issues in Dublin, and I hope he will address them when putting together his legislation.  But I hope time does not run out in this case.</P>
    <P>I recognise the very good intentions behind this Bill and in particular Deputy Keating's statements when introducing the Bill to the House.  A lot of work was put into getting this legislation together in an attempt to address the compensation issue and to achieve a balance between the rights of the property holder and the common good.  This is a real test for the Minister in putting his Bill together.  I understand that in the last 25 years 500,000 houses have been built in this country and mistakes have been made, particularly in County Dublin.  Mistakes have been made in regard to development plans also.  There is now a greater environmental awareness among councillors and members of local authorities. They feel more responsible when it comes to looking after the environment and to <Col N="482" /> orderly development, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Minister had to say to the House last night and I believe it is worth waiting for the legislation which he will introduce.  He has given us some guidelines in this regard.  As I have said, he has the advice of the Attorney General at his disposal and that is most important.  We have waited for 25 years for legislation in this area and we should ensure that we have the best possible legal advice.  The general thrust of the Bill has been approved by the Government and as the Minister has said, it is with the Attorney General for priority drafting.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister intends to take up some of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Building Land.  They stated that relevant Acts should be amended to restrict the right of connection only to development that has been granted planning permission.  That is straight language and I believe it will give an amount of control to the local authorities.  Their hands are tied at the moment.  At the end of the day what we want to see is local autonomy, more power to the local authority and to the people on the ground who know what is happening.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in the Progressive Democrats' Bill have been pointed out and they are worth repeating.  As the Minister said, this Bill would leave the law unchanged on undertakings between the local authorities and private developers, and these laws are defective as they are.  It does not review the present rules for determining the amount of compensation awards made by the property arbitrator.  I understand that one proposed amendment to section 56 (1) (a) of the 1963 Act under section 3 (a) of the Bill &mdash; arising from the judgement of the Viscount Securities Limited case &mdash; may go too far and could lead to constitutional problems and to the total exclusion of compensation.  This would be worrying.</P>
    <P>Some arrangements for compensation in our planning code are inescapable. This problem has not been addressed for the last four years.  A balance must be <Col N="483" /> achieved and there will have to be some compensation included.  Reference was made to the Kenny report and many of the recommendations in that report would now be obsolete.  The Minister has a tremendous task on his hands and is rightly anxious to include in his Bill the preservation of amenity trees.  I recall that Deputy Quill played a very active role in the debate on the Trees and Woodlands Bill.  This is an issue in which I have a particular concern.  It is a positive element of the proposed legislation and it is important that we include it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time, the Minister said there was a threat of compensation under section 45 of the 1963 Act and this created a problem.  During the debate on the Trees and Woodlands Bill, 1987, the Government gave a commitment to a general review of compensation revisions of the Planning Acts.  Some proposals have been included in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> That is a start it is a definite commitment and, as I said, at the end of the day we want to get it right.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the lack of a transitional provision in this Bill.  I would have expected that provision on an issue with such deep implications for property rights would have been included.  It is obvious that the Bill should have addressed the question of dealing with the rights of compensation arising under existing legislation up to the enactment of the present Bill.  What I am saying is that there should be demarcation lines between the old legislation and the new to cover this transitional problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues the Minister said he will address &mdash; and they are with the Attorney General &mdash; are, first, the separation of the planning compensation code from the compulsory purchase compensation code and the tightening up of the market value and the basis of assessment of compensation. This will be welcomed by developers.  Let us face it: we are talking <Col N="484" /> about a number of speculators who will not welcome this legislation but it will be welcomed by local authorities, courts and many environmental groups who have been feeling so helpless over the years and were open to ridicule under the present legislation.  Secondly, the Minister wants to allow planning authorities much wider powers for granting planning permission on the grounds of deficiency of water supplies or sewerage facilities without incurring a liability to compensation. This will be welcomed by Dublin County Council because it will help them ensure more orderly development.</P>
    <P>Third, the Minister's Bill will remove the liability for compensation in a case where the refusal of permission is on the grounds that the proposed development would conflict with an objective of the development plan.  This happens all the time in our authority.  We should give more guidelines to local authorities when it comes to introducing development plans.  As I said, mistakes have been made.  Deputy Lawlor referred to the fact that we have plans for three satellite towns &mdash; Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  Sometimes I worry about the rigidity of our plans.  We plan for huge shopping centres and we seem to dictate where we will place our people in society. Our authority have been getting proposals for smaller developments but we have to take account of the market. There should be more flexibility when it comes to the areas in which we place our people.  We should not be so rigid.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Minister wants to regulate the right of connection to public mains services and to widen circumstances in which permission can be refused without incurring a liability to pay compensation. That is a most important provision.  The Minister also wants to amend the laws on the preservation of amenity trees.</P>
    <P>As regards unfinished estates, much has been done in this area in recent years. The Minister spoke about the need for enforcement.  By imposing conditions Dublin County Council have ensured that all work in open spaces, on tree planting, roads, footpaths, lighting, etc., goes hand <Col N="485" /> in hand with development.  Dublin County Council use the certificate of compliance and they will not release the certificates until these conditions are met. This is a most useful mechanism.  I do not believe this section is as contentious as other sections of the Bill.  A survey showed that 300 estates were unfinished throughout the country and that the cost of the work was £4 million.  In many cases the builders or developers are in liquidation or have left this jurisdiction and cannot be pursued through the courts. The local authority then seek a court order to compel the defaulting developers to comply with the permission.  This is a very tedious procedure, as I know from experience.  The enforcement of the court order is a problem.  The Minister wants to see a vigorous enforcement programme by the planning authority and an imposition of appropriate conditions in the permission to ensure the completion of infrastructural works.</P>
    <P>I have often felt account should be taken of the history of the developer.  I have said this at local authority level. There are a few rogue developers and when we are granting permission we should look at a developer's history. Those developers who have made a mess of our country are well known throughout County Dublin.  This is a competitive market and that is why I said earlier it is really a problem of the past.  I welcome the involvement of the Construction Industry Development Board who were asked by the Minister to comment on the survey to see how these problems might be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats talk about a sequence of development in the planning permission, amenities before houses, etc., but that is in line with what I have been saying because many of these things are being done at least by our local authority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome this debate. This area concerns anybody living in the Dublin County Council area and I ask the Progressive Democrats to wait until we see the details of what the Minister will be putting before the House.</P>

      <P>There are several things about this Bill deserving close examination.  The first is the Ministerial response to it and, second, the response of the various parties in this House.  The Minister's response, which was anticipated to some extent, is simply this, give me time to bring in a more general Bill, this is too particular.  That would be all very well if one year ago the Minister had not said, in relation to a Bill brought forward by the Labour Party in relation to woodlands: give me time to bring in a general Bill, this one is too particular. On that occasion he stated that he had a Bill in course of preparation, that he had proposals to bring before this House, in the general area of compensation. Nothing took place for a year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lawlor castigated Members of the Judiciary for what he considered to be inexplicable decisions in relation to sewerage.  The strange thing is that, in one case, the judge stated that the law, as he found it, compelled him to give the decision he did.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mary Flaherty has given me notice of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the announcement by the board of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, that they will cease bone marrow transplants for children forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="487" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for having given me the opportunity of raising this matter on the first day I sought to do so.  It is a rare and pleasant experience, particularly as it is such an important issue.</P>
      <P>The announcement last week by the board of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, that they can treat two more patients only before ceasing the service entirely means that the impact of the cutbacks in health are being felt now in a way not experienced to date. We have become used to increased waiting lists but the total abolition of a service for children is something unique and indefensible.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to indicate to the House this evening that he regards the matter as seriously as I do, that he intends to act to ensure that the proposal to cease operations for children entirely here, forcing them to go abroad, will not happen.</P>
      <P>The unit now propose to contact the Eastern Health Board to seek support for cases needing treatment abroad, which cases would then be funded by the Eastern Health Board.  I gather that the cost of such an operation, usually in England, is in or about the same as that of an operation performed here; the difference may amount to a couple of thousands of pounds.  Added to that cost is the personal cost to the family and the child itself, in travelling from this country, the expense of maintenance, often carried by the Eastern Health Board, such children often requiring long periods of preparation for and recuperation after such operations.  For example, there is involved a period of immune deficiency during which children have to be kept in hospital for quite some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context it seems extraordinary that the cost involved will be borne by the health services through a different avenue.  The hospitals have no money but there will be money provided by the Eastern Health Board to have the operations performed abroad at approximately the same cost.  That appears to me to be a silly set of circumstances.  It should be remembered that it is also very serious <Col N="488" /> and difficult for families facing into a traumatic time during the severe illness of a child or children.</P>
    <P>The other unit providing a bone marrow transplant service in Dublin is that located at St. James's Hospital which currently deals with adults only, although I gather they are dealing with children other than the very young.  At present they have funds to cover 15 transplants only a year, so there is no question of their having any spare capacity.  On the basis of their own list they need to perform 30 to 35 transplants annually in order to provide the kind of service required.  The children's unit was performing approximately one operation per month.  Therefore, it will be seen that there is a huge shortfall and requirement for services abroad if there is to be no expansion in the direct services provided here.</P>
    <P>The practice was established under the regime of former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, after some controversy, when a clearcut policy was established that, if necessary medical treatment could not be provided here, it would be provided wherever else it was available provided it was deemed to be medically advisable.  That entails an ongoing commitment to provide such a service whether at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>What has happened in this regard since the Minister gave a commitment to this House some five months ago, indicating that he intended establishing, jointly, St. James's and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin as the national bone marrow transplant unit.  When questions were raised in this House about the future of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children the Minister categorically assured us that both units would be maintained by way of a joint national service.  To my knowledge there have been no meetings held in this respect since February last.  In the meantime the hospital have had no funding arrangements agreed or allocations to the joint national service. Therefore, it is not surprising that this crisis has arisen.  Let us hope that it may lead to a resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> I am interested to know what the Minister proposes doing.  There is no economic argument in favour of what is happening.  I wonder who is running the service.  If the Minister cannot ensure that commitments he gives are honoured then he should not enter into such commitments or assure us that such a national service will be provided.  If the Minister does not have control over the hospitals and health boards, what does he propose to do about it in order to make any progress in regard to the unit budgeting issue.  At least if we had unit budgeting, with hospitals being allocated sums, then at least the Department would be able to establish priorities.  This would mean that priority areas such as this &mdash; and that in relation to heart transplants and operations for children and adults &mdash; could be afforded due priority within the politics that obtain within hospitals in which different specialists all vie for a limited source of funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a particular responsibility to respond, first, because he has given a certain commitment to the House and, second, because of the downstream effect of the overall cut to the relevant hospital &mdash; which has provided the necessary funds from within its own resources in recent years.  In addition I should say that both this unit and that at St. James's Hospital have been backed and developed to an extraordinary degree by private funding and support.  Indeed the operations currently performed at St. James's Hospital are funded, to a substantial degree, by way of private fund-raising; certainly that is the case in regard to equipment there, although the Department did provide some resources at given stages.</P>
    <P>I want to know what the Minister proposes to do in relation to this.  Will he ensure that there will be a bone marrow transplant service available to children, so that a service which was built up with great effort and commitment on the part of many dedicated people, people who have developed an expertise ensuring that life-saving operations are available to children here, does not cease.  I hope the Minister will assure the House this <Col N="490" /> evening that he intends to act to prevent this cessation occurring.  As it is quite clear that, if necessary, the funds will be provided by the Eastern Health Board for such operations can they not be directed into the mainline service?</P>
    <P>I should say that I carry no brief for any individual hospital.  I know there is much politics obtaining within the hospitals services.  I am concerned that a service is provided for children, that it is maintained where it is located, be that at two separate centres or in a single one.  I am not interested in entering into such argument.  I merely want to ensure that a service is provided and maintained for children.</P>

      <P>There is no crisis.  I should like to assure Deputy Flaherty that bone marrow transplants will continue at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Officials of my Department along with representatives of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and St. James's Hospital are examining the financial implications of a bone marrow transplant service to ensure that sufficient resources are available.  Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children have carried out approximately 30 bone marrow transplants at a cost of £17,000 each from within its allocation.  There is no doubt about the effectiveness of the bone marrow transplant programme.  My Department are committed to providing the service in this country rather than sending patients abroad.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I initiated discussions between Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, St. James's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital with a view to the establishment of a national bone marrow transplant service.  I am glad to say that it is now accepted that a national bone marrow service will be provided in two units, at Crumlin hospital for children and at St. James's Hospital for adults.  I can assure Deputy Flaherty that bone marrow transplants will continue at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.</P>

      <P>The Environment Council formally adopted, on 3 December 1987, two directives to control gaseous emissions from cars and from heavy commercial vehicles.  The directives set emission standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides with application dates differentiating between new models of vehicles and new vehicles, with earlier dates for new models.  The dates extend over the period 1 October 1988 to 1 October 1993.</P>
      <P>Member states are required to permit the marketing in their territories of vehicles conforming to the new standards but it is left to the discretion of member states whether to apply these as the only permitted standards at national level. The pace at which Ireland can move to exclusive application of the new emission standards will depend on the supply of suitable vehicles from the EC or elsewhere. I am considering how the new standards can be applied in Ireland, and within what time frame.</P>

However, I note from the Dublin Corporation Environment Pollution report for 1986/87, that of the 66 complaints about noise received in that period, only one was about burglar alarms.</P>
      <P>The principal legislation with regard to noise nuisance is contained in section 51 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.

      <P>The Government have already made significant contributions towards the celebration of the Dublin Millennium in 1988.  In the case of my own Department grants of £500,000 have been made available for major improvements to Grafton Street and O'Connell Street.  In addition £700,000 has been made available through Dublin Promotions Organisation Ltd., the company co-ordinating the celebration, for the sponsorship of a diverse range of projects.  I am aware that the Commissioners of Public Works are making special efforts to maintain high standards throughout the city during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have no plans to appoint a Minister with special responsibility for Dublin.  The Government have decided to move towards a programme basis for applications for assistance from the European Community's development and structural funds.  To this end it <Col N="360" /> is proposed to carry out a study preparatory to the formulation of a programme for the greater Dublin area which will seek EC funding to help tackle many economic and social problems which exist in the city and county at present.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced that the introduction of legislation would result in an improvement in the availability of organs for transplant purposes.  Some countries in Europe such as Finland, the Netherlands and Turkey have introduced specific legislation while others have decided to rely on voluntary codes of practice.

The need for legislation, is however, something which I will keep under regular review.</P>

      <P>A decision was not made by the Department of Health to close the Drug Information Centre at St. James' Hospital.</P>
      <P>The drug information centre at St. James's Hospital was set up in 1983 and was funded mainly from private sources. The private funding was used for the salaries of the three personnel (who were seconded from St. James's Hospital) employed in the centre and St. James's Hospital provided the premises and contributed towards the non-pay expenses such as heat, light and power.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the private funding arrangement was discontinued and two of the three persons employed in the centre left the employ of the hospital.</P>
      <P>The staffing, funding and general future of the centre were considered against the background of the overall staffing requirements of the hospital and its general financial situation and, taking account of the fact that the information needs can be provided from sources such as the National Drug Advisory Board and the poisons centre (now at Beaumont Hospital), a decision was taken to discontinue the information centre.</P>

Public support is more likely to be sustained if we adhere to our policy of voluntary donation rather than any policy based on presumed consent.</P>
      <P>My Department has also pursued a policy of concentrating transplant activity in a series of national centres as the most effective means of supporting transplant activity and this policy has been broadly supported by the medical profession.</P>

She is, therefore, eligible for transport to that school while she is under ten years of age.  However, as there is no service from this area to Ryland, she may be allowed concessionary fare-paying transport to Ballykerwick from the existing route of the service to this school.</P>
      <P>It has been stated in previous representations that this child's nearest school, by means of a right of way, is Barrachauring closed school, which amalgamated with Ballykerwick NS.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that St. Joseph's Youth Club, Inchicore, Dublin 8 had been approved for a £60,000 grant in each of the last two years but that due to circumstances beyond their control were unable to take up the grant in either year; that the old club premises have been closed for the past two and a half years on foot of an order of the Fire Officer in the aftermath of the Stardust disaster; that the club which has been in existence since 1944 is finding it hard to continue without a premises; that a site which has been donated for the purposes of a new clubhouse, has been cleared; that planning permission has been granted; that because of the lapse of time the club's needs will now be in the order of £100,000, in order to bring the project to <Col N="381" /> a successful conclusion; if she will approve a grant of that amount; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department received an application from St. Joseph's Youth Club, Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Inchicore, Dublin 8, on 10 March 1988, under the capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities.  There is no record of an application from the club prior to this date and no previous allocations have been made.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the application received, a grant of £20,000 has been provisionally allocated to the project. The sport and youth section of my Department will shortly be in contact with the organisers regarding the conditions of the grant allocation.  No work should be undertaken or commitments entered into until the availability of the grant has been formally confirmed by my Department.</P>
